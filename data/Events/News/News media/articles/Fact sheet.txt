A fact sheet, factsheet, fact file or (in some industries) one-sheet is a presentation of data in a format which emphasizes key points concisely, usually using tables, bullet points and/or headings, on a single printed page. Fact sheets often contain product information, technical data, lists, statistics, answers to common questions (e.g. FAQs), educational material, or how-to, "do-it-yourself" advice. They are sometimes a summary of a longer document.
