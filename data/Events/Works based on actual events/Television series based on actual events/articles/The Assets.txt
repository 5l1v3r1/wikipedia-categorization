The Assets is an eight-part American drama television miniseries that aired on ABC in 2014.  The series was based on the book Circle of Treason: A CIA Account of Traitor Aldrich Ames and the Men He Betrayed by retired CIA officers Sandra Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuille. The series was executively produced by Morgan Hertzan, Rudy Bednar and Andrew Chapman.  The pilot episode earned a 0.7 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, making The Assets the lowest rated drama premiere ever on one of the big three networks.   On January 10, 2014, ABC canceled The Assets due to low ratings.  ABC Entertainment Group President Paul Lee disclosed at the Television Critics Association press tour that the unaired episodes would be made available at some point in the future.  On June 21, 2014, the remaining episodes began airing on Saturdays,  but after just two further broadcasts, ABC again pulled the series. The final four episodes aired in a Sunday afternoon timeslot in late July and early August, 2014.  All eight episodes of The Assets were then made available on Netflix on September 1, 2014.  The Assets received mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic awarded the series a "mixed or average" score of 58 out of 100, based on reviews by fifteen critics.  On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 56% rating with an average rating of 5.6 out of 10, based on 16 reviews.  More than four years after its initial broadcast, the series was picked up by Alibi for broadcast in the United Kingdom, with broadcast set for Summer 2018, ahead of Jodie Whittaker's debut as The Doctor in Doctor Who.
