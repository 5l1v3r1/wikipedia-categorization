Good Girls Revolt is an American period drama web television series. It is inspired by Lynn Povich's 2013 book The Good Girls Revolt and based on real-life events. The show was released on October 28, 2016, on Amazon Video.   On December 2, 2016, Amazon cancelled the series after one season.     The series follows a group of young female researchers at News of the Week magazine in the revolutionary times of 1969. Women in the newsroom are relegated to low-level positions. Many researchers are more talented and better educated than their male counterparts (the reporters), and do writing that the reporters incorporate directly into their stories, yet are paid less.  The women have a sense that they're paid a lot less, and during the series it emerges just how much lower their pay is.  But also at issue is the fact that their writing is not recognized: on the rare occasions when a female researcher's writing is openly accepted (such as when a male reporter quit just before a deadline), the story is nonetheless published under the man's name only.  Good Girls Revolt has received generally positive reviews from critics, with most comparing it to Mad Men and some calling it a female version of that show. On Rotten Tomatoes, a score of 71% was reported with its critical consensus saying: "Good Girls Revolt features a compelling true story, told by a talented cast, even if the period drama hasn't yet achieved Mad Men-level mastery".  On Metacritic, a 66 out of 100 metascore was reported indicating, "generally favorable reviews".
