April Rhapsody is a 2000 TV series written by Wang Hui-ling, based on the romantic life of Xu Zhimo, one of China's most renowned poets in the 20th century. Virtually all characters in the story are historical, but the plot deviates from history somewhat. After the series' broadcast, historian Liang Congjie blasted the show and denied his mother Lin Huiyin's relationship with Xu was anything other than platonic.
