The Corner is a 2000 HBO drama television miniseries based on the nonfiction book The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood (1997) by David Simon and Ed Burns, and adapted for television by Simon and David Mills. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 16, 2000 and concluded its six-part run on May 21, 2000. The series was released on DVD on July 22, 2003.  It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries in 2000. The Corner chronicles the life of a family living in poverty amid the open-air drug markets of West Baltimore. "The corner" is the junction of West Fayette Street and North Monroe Street (U.S. Route 1) (39°17′22″N 76°38′49″W﻿ / ﻿39.289372°N 76.646848°W﻿ / 39.289372; -76.646848). Many actors from The Corner later appeared on Simon's next television series, The Wire, often playing contrasting characters. They include Clarke Peters, Maria Broom, Corey Parker Robinson, Reg E. Cathey, Clayton LeBouef, Donnell Rawlings, Tootsie Duvall, Robert F. Chew, Lance Reddick and Delaney Williams. Alexander and Peters later starred in Simon's Treme. Many of the actors had also appeared on Homicide: Life on the Street, which was adapted from Simon's book. A review by Hugh K. David of DVD Times praised The Corner as "raw, gritty, uncompromising, realistic, smartly directed, supremely well-acted, compulsively watchable, but harrowing and with little light at the end of the tunnel", comparing it to the television equivalent of such films as Last Exit to Brooklyn or Requiem for a Dream (also adapted from novels), with elements in common with both La Haine and City of God.  The miniseries received four Emmy nominations at the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards. It was nominated for Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special and won for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Charles S. Dutton); Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or a Movie (David Simon and David Mills) and Outstanding Miniseries.  It also won a Peabody Award in 2000.  Each episode starts and ends with a documentary style interview, wherein a lead character answers questions from the director Charles S. Dutton.
