 Miss Match is an American comedy-drama television series created by Jeff Rake and Darren Star and produced by 20th Century Fox Television, Darren Star Productions, and Imagine Television. It aired in the United States on NBC, Australia on Seven Network, Arena, and Fox8, and in the United Kingdom on Living, Channel 4, and is on E4. Seventeen episodes of the series were filmed, with eleven aired in the United States. The entire series aired in both the UK and Canada. Starring Alicia Silverstone and Ryan O'Neal, the show garnered poor ratings, which could have been due to its inability to compete in the Friday 8Â pm ET timeslot (the "Friday night death slot"). It was based on the real-life story of Samantha Daniels. A Los Angeles matrimonial attorney, Kate Fox (Alicia Silverstone), doubles as a high-end matchmaker even though her own love life is far from perfect. NBC had a cross promotion where Deanna Wright, Galen Gering and McKenzie Westmore, who starred on NBC's soap opera Passions, appeared in an episode of the series. The series was executive produced by Darren Star, who also directed the pilot, and Jeff Rake,  who wrote the pilot, as well as David Nevins and Brian Grazer.  After Alicia Silverstone, the first actors cast in Miss Match were David Conrad, Lake Bell and James Roday in February 2003.  This was followed by the casting of Ryan O'Neill, as the divorce attorney father of Silverstone's character, and Jodi Long, in early March 2003.  NBC ordered Miss Match (then titled Miss/Match) to series in May 2003.  In December 2003 NBC added four episodes to the order for Miss Match, bringing the total number of produced episodes to 17.
