In February 2018 in Delhi, a man residing in New Friends Colony was accused of rape by his 11-year old daughter.  The 11-year-old girl later admitted in court, said that she complained against her father after watching Savdhaan India and that she “exaggerated things” before her mother and the police.  She said that the show gave her the impression that her father’s innocent kisses were something ‘wrong’.  Her father was acquitted by the court.
