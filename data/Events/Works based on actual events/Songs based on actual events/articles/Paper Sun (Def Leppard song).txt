   Paper Sun is a single by British band Def Leppard from their 9th album Euphoria. It charted at #11 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts. It failed to chart elsewhere however. It is included on the second disc of the compilation album Rock of Ages: The Definitive Collection. Lyrically the song is about the Omagh bombing which occurred on August 15, 1998. After being omitted from tour set lists since the Euphoria World Tour in 2000, the song has now been returned to Def Leppard's set list for their 2015 World Tour with Tesla and Styx.
