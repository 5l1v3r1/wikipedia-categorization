 "Misty Mountain Hop" is a song from English rock band Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album, released in 1971. In the United States and Australia it was the B-side of the "Black Dog" single, but still received considerable FM radio airplay. It was recorded at Headley Grange, a mansion with a recording studio in Hampshire, England, where the band sometimes lived.  The most common interpretation of the song's title involves a reference to the Misty Mountains in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. The lyrics refer to the events of the 7 July 1968 "Legalise Pot Rally" in Hyde Park, London, in which police made arrests for marijuana possession.  The lyrics reflect Plant's quest for a better society, a place and time when hangups are replaced with individual freedom and a life of mutual support and rapport.  The song also appeared as a Led Zeppelin track in the 1997 Time-Life 6-CD boxed set Gold And Platinum: The Ultimate Rock Collection, marking one of the rare times that a recording by the band has been included in a various artists compilation. A different version of this song is featured on the second disc of the remastered two CD deluxe edition of Led Zeppelin IV.
