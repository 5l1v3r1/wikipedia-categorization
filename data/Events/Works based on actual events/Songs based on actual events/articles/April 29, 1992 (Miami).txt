"April 29, 1992 (Miami)" is a song written by American ska punk band Sublime in 1996 from their eponymous album Sublime.  The song title refers to the date of the 1992 Los Angeles riots,  of which news spread throughout the United States following the acquittal of four police officers accused in the videotaped beating of Rodney King.  The official title of the song references the date April 29, 1992; however, the lyric is sung as "April 26, 1992." It has been said this was a mistake, but the take was strong enough the band kept it. Theories have developed about the true integrity of the song's lyrics. The acts of crime including arson, robbery and vandalism referred to in the lyrics were purportedly committed by Bradley Nowell and other Sublime band members during the 1992 LA riots. The lyrics also offer a justification for the band's participation in the unrest: They said it was for the Mexican And not for the white man But if you look at the street, it wasn't about Rodney King It's this fucked-up situation and these fucked-up police It's about coming up and staying on top And screaming 187 on a motherfuckin' cop  After lead singer and guitarist Bradley Nowell's death, the two surviving members of the band released every mix and alternate version that the band had recorded. Along with those recordings, an alternate version of "Miami" was released on their  1997 compilation album Second-hand Smoke titled "April 29, 1992 (Leary)".
