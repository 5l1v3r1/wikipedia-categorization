 "Hiroshima" is a pop song about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima written by David Morgan and first recorded by Wishful Thinking in 1969.   In 1978 their single entered the German Top 20  with a peak at #8  and stayed there for several months. In 1983, East German band the Puhdys recorded a version with translated German lyrics on their Computer-Karriere album. In 1990 German singer Sandra released the song on her fourth studio album Paintings in Yellow. It was produced by Michael Cretu and received positive reception from music critics. The song was released as the lead single in the spring of 1990 (see 1990 in music), and became one of Sandra's biggest hits. The song went to number four in Germany, Switzerland and Israel and entered the Top twenty in France. However, in the United Kingdom, it failed to enter the chart. The single's B-side, "La Vista de Luna", had previously appeared on Sandra's third studio album Into a Secret Land.  The song was also covered by the German power metal band Freedom Call in the special edition of their first live album Live Invasion.  Wishful Thinking version Sandra version
