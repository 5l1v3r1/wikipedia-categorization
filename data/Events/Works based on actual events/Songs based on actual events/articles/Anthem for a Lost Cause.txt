   "Anthem for a Lost Cause" is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It is the second single released from the band's eleventh studio album, Rewind the Film.  Both song and lyrics were written by singer James Dean Bradfield, in an interview he stated that the song was about the question of if lyrics today are as important as they were before. The song has one of the longest, if not the longest chorus of any song on the album. The music video features Tori Lyons, who previously starred in the video for "Show Me the Wonder", reprising her role as a miner's wife in the 1984 miners' strike.  The band stated that Kieran Evans was important for this video, because not only did she appear in the band's last video, but because they wanted to capture the feeling of the 80Â´s and how women dealt with the big miners' strike. in the video we see a woman that is trying to survive without her husband that has left her because of the conditions that they were living in. The video shows many realities of the consequences of that 80's strike.  The song was made available by digital download on 25 November 2013, backed up by two songs Death of a Digital Ghost and See It Like Sutherland. A live version of She Is Suffering at the O2 Arena in 2011 was also in the single digital download. It peaked on number 200 in the UK Singles Chart.
