 "Hey Man Nice Shot" is a 1995 single by the industrial rock band Filter. The song was released on July 18, 1995 via Reprise Records, as the first single from their debut album Short Bus. The song was written about the January 22, 1987, public suicide of Pennsylvania state treasurer R. Budd Dwyer. Dwyer had been convicted on bribery charges in December 1986, and was expected to receive a long sentence from U.S. District Court Judge Malcolm Muir. Professing his innocence and decrying the legal system, Dwyer shot himself with a .357 Magnum during a press conference.  Although singer and songwriter Richard Patrick frequently clarified this in interviews, as well as the fact that he had first written the song in 1991 before the band even had a record deal, the song's popularity was augmented by a widespread perception that it was about the 1994 suicide of Kurt Cobain.   There are at least three versions of the music video for "Hey Man Nice Shot". The first version uses the album mix of the song; a second uses the promo-only remix later heard in The Cable Guy; and a third version uses the "Sober Mix". All three of these versions feature footage filmed in December 1994, with color effects being added in during the post-production of the video.
