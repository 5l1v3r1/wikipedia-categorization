  "Revol" is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released in 1994 by record label Epic as the second single from their third studio album, The Holy Bible, which was released later in the month. It reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart on 13 August 1994.  "Revol" has been categorized under the genres hard rock,  punk rock  and post-punk.  The song's lyrics were written by rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards and bass guitarist Nicky Wire. The verses list famous and controversial names in history, each being dismissed one-by-one in short and often insulting staccato lines (such as "Chamberlain, you see God in you", "Pol Pot, withdrawn traces, bye-bye", "Che Guevara, you're all target now" and "Gorbachev, celibate self-importance").  The track may be considered an autobiographical account of Edwards' attempts to hold down any meaningful relationships.  "Revol" is "lover" spelt backwards. The lyric also places the names of famous political figures next to images of failure in sexual and emotional relationships. Wire, however, has said not even he knows exactly what the song is about.  James Dean Bradfield has previously been critical of the song, saying that he hates the UK version. He is, however, a fan of the "US Mix" by Tom Lord-Alge, which can be found on the 10th Anniversary re-issue edition of The Holy Bible.  "Revol" was released on 1 August 1994 by record label Epic as the second single from their third studio album, The Holy Bible. It reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart.
