"Tsunami" is a song by Manic Street Preachers, released as a single on July 5, 1999 through Epic. It was the fourth and final single to be released from the album This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours. All three members of the band - James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire - share the writing credits. The single peaked at number 11 on the UK charts.  Tsunami is the Japanese word for "big wave". The song was inspired by The Silent Twins, June and Jennifer Gibbons, who gave up speaking when they were young, became involved in crime and ended up being sent to Broadmoor Hospital.  The song is unique in the band's catalogue in that it is largely built around an electric sitar and strings.  The single peaked at number 11 in the UK, remaining on the chart for 8 weeks. Of all four singles from This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, "Tsunami" spent the least number of weeks in the charts.  In Finland the song peaked in number 13, spending 3 weeks in The Official Finnish Charts.  The B-side "Buildings for Dead People" featured on the enhanced CD 1, along with the video for "A Design for Life". CD 2 featured a remix of "Tsunami" by Cornelius and a mix by Electron Ray Tube. The cassette version included a live recording of "Motown Junk" from the Tivoli in Utrecht in Holland on March 29, 1999.
