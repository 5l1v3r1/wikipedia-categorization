 "FM Doll" (originally entitled "Fuck Me Doll")  is a song by English alternative rock band Queenadreena, originally released in 2002 on Rough Trade records, three years prior to its inclusion on the 2005 album, The Butcher and the Butterfly. The single was later released in 2005 on One Little Indian, after the band had switched record labels.  The track is inspired by the 1996 murder of American child pageant competitor JonBenét Ramsey. The painting featured on the original 2002 single is by artist Simon Henwood.  According to vocalist KatieJane Garside, the song was inspired by JonBenét Ramsey. In a 2002 interview, she stated: "I know because of the lyrical content it won’t get on [the radio]. It’s about child murder. Do you remember the JonBenét case in America? The child beauty queen who was supposedly murdered by her mother and father? It’s about that and the endemic infection in the female psyche."  The lyrics of the song mention JonBenét Ramsey by name,  and also include allusions to stripping and sexual abuse. Nick March of Drowned in Sound gave the single a positive review, writing: "When the 'FM Doll' charges out of the stereo speakers, it greets your eardrums with a "we-didn't-come-to-fuck-around" urgency. This puppy's a re-recorded version of an earlier release that's been beefed up a bit, so it's worth adjusting your aural settings accordingly. You should either listen to it at bloody-murder volume or turn it off."  Contactmusic.com echoed a similar sentiment in their review, noting: "This three-minute train wreck from ultra-fierce psycho-punks Queen Adreena is a ride from Satan’s own backyard amusement park. That is to say; if it’ll scare the Dark One, it’ll scare anyone."
