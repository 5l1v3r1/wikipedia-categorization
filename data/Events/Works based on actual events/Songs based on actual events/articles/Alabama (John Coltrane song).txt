"Alabama" is a composition written by John Coltrane that appears on his album Live at Birdland (1963). It was written in response to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing on September 15, 1963, an attack by the Ku Klux Klan in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four African-American girls.   Coltrane's Quartet performed this piece on television for an episode of Jazz Casual in 1963. "Alabama" was performed on the 2016 Jack DeJohnette album In Movement with two musicians whose fathers played on the original version--bassist Matthew Garrison and saxophonist Ravi Coltrane.
