 "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)" is a song by the American alternative rock band R.E.M. It was released in May 1984 as the first single from the group's second studio album Reckoning. "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)" became the second R.E.M. single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 85. R.E.M. performed a rough version of the song on the NBC television show Late Night with David Letterman on October 6, 1983—before the song even had a title—in what was the band's first U.S. network television appearance. The video, directed by Howard Libov, was filmed at the Reflection Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina during the recording of Reckoning there, and first aired in June 1984. It featured the members of the band playing their instruments behind white screens (gobos) in an otherwise empty room, with Michael Stipe singing in the foreground. Stipe refused to lip sync to the song.  Guitarist Peter Buck said, "We played a recording of the track, and the rest of us faked it, but Michael insisted on singing a new vocal to make it more real for him."  The song is also featured in the Left of Reckoning video shot by James Herbert. A version of the song was released by Grant-Lee Phillips on his 2006 covers album, Nineteeneighties. The song also was covered by Hem on the 2006 album "No Word from Tom." All songs written by Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe unless otherwise indicated. 7" Single 12" single Album Notes:
