Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué (Gustavus III, or The Masked Ball) is an opéra historique or grand opera in five acts by Daniel Auber, with a libretto by Eugène Scribe.  It received its first performance at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opéra on 27 February 1833, with costumes designed by Eugène Lami and Paul Lormier, and sets by Léon Feuchère (Act I and Act V, scene 2), Jules Diéterle (Act II), Alfred (Act III), Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri (Act IV), René-Humanité Philastre and Charles-Antoine Cambon (Act V, scene 1). The opera was a major success for the composer, with 168 performances until 1853. Ellen Creathorne Clayton has translated French critic Jules Janin's description of the last act, which was often presented separately from the opera, as follows: The opera concerns some aspects of the real-life assassination of Gustavus III, King of Sweden.  The major aspects of the plot can be found first in Giuseppe Verdi's planned opera, Gustavo III, which was never performed as written, but whose major elements were incorporated into a revised version of the story in the opera which eventually became Un ballo in maschera.
