Drot og marsk (King and Marshal) is an opera by the Danish composer Peter Heise. The libretto, by Christian Richardt, is based on Carsten Hauch's play Marsk Stig (1850). The opera was first performed at the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen, on 25 September 1878. The opera is based on the true story of the murder of the Danish king Eric Glipping in 1286. The king is an inveterate womaniser and when he seduces Ingeborg, the wife of Marshal Stig, the marshal organises a conspiracy to kill him. Stig is banished and Ingeborg commits suicide.
