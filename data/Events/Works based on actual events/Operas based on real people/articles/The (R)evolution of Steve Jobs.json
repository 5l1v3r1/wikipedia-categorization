It was commissioned by <a href=\"/wiki/Santa_Fe_Opera\" title=\"Santa Fe Opera\">Santa Fe Opera</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Seattle_Opera\" title=\"Seattle Opera\">Seattle Opera</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco_Opera\" title=\"San Francisco Opera\">San Francisco Opera</a>, with support from Cal Performances. The opera is about one of the most influential people in recent history; it is set at a time when he must confront his own mortality and circle back on the events that shaped his personal and professional life. \n</p><p>The world premiere took place at the Santa Fe Opera in 2017, conducted by <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Christie_(conductor)\" title=\"Michael Christie (conductor)\">Michael Christie</a>. The original production featured direction by Kevin Newbury, scenic design by Vita Tzykun, costume design by Paul Carey, lighting design by Japhy Weideman, projection design by Ben Pearcy for 59 Productions, and sound design by Rick Jacobsohn and Brian Loach; it was a co-production of Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, San Francisco Opera, and the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. <i>The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs</i> was the most popular new opera in Santa Fe Opera\u2019s history and one of the top-selling operas in the company's history. An extra performance had to be added to accommodate the demand for tickets. In May 2018, a recording of the work was issued under the Pentatone label. \n</p><p>Bates was drawn to <a href=\"/wiki/Steve_Jobs\" title=\"Steve Jobs\">Steve Jobs</a> as the subject for an opera, because, he says, opera \u201ccan illuminate the interior thoughts of different characters simultaneously through the juxtaposition of individual themes. That makes it an ideal medium to explore a man who revolutionized how we communicate.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Bates asked Mark Campbell, one of America\u2019s leading opera librettists, to create the story in the libretto. According to Campbell, \u201cLearning that Jobs was a Buddhist his entire adult life lead me to the ens\u014d, the circle that is drawn in Japanese calligraphy to express enlightenment. I connected that with Jobs\u2019 habit of taking long walks and the Zen practice of pacing in a circular pattern called a kinhin and began to develop a story in which Steve \u2018circles back\u2019 on his life. The title actually refers less to the revolution Jobs helped create in technology rather than the kinhin of self-reflection that propels the story.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Gary Rydstrom of Skywalker Sound assisted Bates with the production of the opera\u2019s electronic sounds.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Roles\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Roles</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Synopsis\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Synopsis</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Discography\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Discography</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Roles\">Roles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_(R)evolution_of_Steve_Jobs&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Roles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Role\n</th>\n<th><a href=\"/wiki/Voice_type\" title=\"Voice type\">Voice type</a>\n</th>\n<th>Premiere cast, 22 July 2017<br />(Conductor: <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Christie_(conductor)\" title=\"Michael Christie (conductor)\">Michael Christie</a>)\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steve Jobs\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Baritone\" title=\"Baritone\">baritone</a>\n</td>\n<td>Edward Parks\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Laurene_Powell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Laurene Powell\">Laurene Powell</a>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Mezzo-soprano\" title=\"Mezzo-soprano\">mezzo-soprano</a>\n</td>\n<td>Sasha Cooke\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\"Woz\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Steve_Wozniak\" title=\"Steve Wozniak\">Steve Wozniak</a>)\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Tenor\" title=\"Tenor\">tenor</a>\n</td>\n<td>Garrett Sorenson\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/K%C5%8Dbun_Chino_Otogawa\" title=\"K\u014dbun Chino Otogawa\">K\u014dbun Chino Otogawa</a>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Bass_(voice_type)\" title=\"Bass (voice type)\">bass</a>\n</td>\n<td>Wei Wu\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Chrisann_Brennan\" title=\"Chrisann Brennan\">Chrisann Brennan</a>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Soprano\" title=\"Soprano\">soprano</a>\n</td>\n<td>Jessica E.
