Soong, his longtime supporter and fundraiser, and the complications which were to arise because of\nthe love-affair (and then marriage) of Ching-ling, Charlie's second daughter, to Sun, the impetus for the opera came from the discovery by playwright Candace Mui-ngam Chong of \"a snippet of a true tale about a wedding dress intended for Ching-ling\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-MAYS_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MAYS-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  It appears that the dress had been made some years before in anticipation of Ching-ling's future wedding, but when Charlie discovered that she had married Sun, he refused to give her the dress and ordered that it be sold by a friend. Recognizing its significance, the friend did not sell it. Chong then wrote the opera's libretto,<sup id=\"cite_ref-MAYS_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MAYS-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> although  \"while staying 98% close to historical facts, Ruo states, [it] focuses on the human side of the great man\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-MAYS49_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MAYS49-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Huang Ruo planned the work in two versions, the first of which was designed to have a Western orchestra which would have been employed for the Beijing premiere while the second version, which was written for a Chinese orchestra, was planned to premiere at the <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong_Cultural_Center\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hong Kong Cultural Center\">Hong Kong Cultural Center</a> under the direction of Yan Huichang leading the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra.

A score for an orchestra of Western instruments was rounded out with Chinese percussion.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>[The composer] has also developed a system of musical notation to blend traditional Chinese singing seamlessly into modern Western scores. Traditional Chinese opera notation is less specific about rhythm than Western opera, giving performers more improvisation space to emote and riff off a single note. But the scale and complexity of a modern opera requires Western-style staff notation. \"In Chinese opera, there is more improvisation in singing, and a more nasal, penetrating sound\", Huang Ruo explains, pointing to a section in the score, \"A long note is a chance to bring out more emotion\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-FRISCH2_20-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FRISCH2-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Following the Hong Kong premiere, British critic John Allison commented on several aspects of the music in his article in the British magazine <i><a href=\"/wiki/Opera_(magazine)\" title=\"Opera (magazine)\">Opera</a></i>:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>In his first opera, Huang Ruo has sought to develop the synthesis of Chinese and Western elements already found in his previous works; his aim is not so much to mix them as to achieve an organic unity, and\u2014to the extent that here he has composed for Western-style operatic voices singing Mandarin words\u2014he succeeds. His vocal lines are apparently influenced not by traditional Chinese opera but by (local to Hong Kong) Cantonese narrative singing, with one syllable to one note, departing from standard Western vocalism. But the most obvious musical feature of <i>Dr. Sun</i> is the scoring for traditional Chinese instruments (Huang  Ruo has made two versions, with an alternative for Western orchestra), realised here with subtlety by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra under the conductor Yan Huichang. Some of the Chinese reviewers are said to have dismissed this as a gimmick, but this colourful soundworld did not distract from the substance of the work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ALIS_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ALIS-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Additionally\u2014quoting Huang Ruo as \" 'collaging East and West' \"\u2014Miyoshi outlines what she describes as his:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Exuberant use of percussion and his inclusion of Chinese instruments\u2014the sheng mouth organ (which Kuan memorably calls a \"Mini Me\" version of the Western organ) and other bamboo winds, as well as strings such as the pipa\u2014build an exotic atmosphere.  The quanzhi, a double-reed pipe, he describes as \"in its own category, unique, a character instrument, very sad, very touchiing\u2014and intimate, like a human voice singing, so it pairs well with the voice, and it's not loud.

Granted, its libretto describes a love story with operatic precedents galore. The ecstatic Sun/Ching-ling duet closing the second act recalls Mim\u00ed and Rodolpho\u2019s scene concluding act one of <i><a href=\"/wiki/La_boh%C3%A8me\" title=\"La boh\u00e8me\">La boh\u00e8me</a></i>.....</dd>\n<dd>But it\u2019s the depth and rich complexity of that score, presenting a deeply felt affair of the heart instead of extravagant exoticism, that makes <i>Dr. Sun Yat-sen</i> unique among all those distressing Western musical chronicles of broken-hearted Asians. Here, unconventionally, a happy ending arrives for the lovers and, one hopes, for the nation. Huang\u2019s orchestra plays a major role in, well, orchestrating that action.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>In his review, James Keller makes the following observations regarding the orchestration and its effects:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Wind instruments tend to work in sections, with groups of trombones or flutes or whatever alternating or overlapping in tone blocks that are displaced from each other rhythmically, ultimately to a heavy effect that leaves little room for luminosity. Indeed, rhythm was the score\u2019s strong suit, and sometimes it injected considerable momentum. By the end, though, it did not sustain a score of this length on its own, unassisted as it was by concomitant strength in harmonic direction or, most regrettably, melodic contour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Keller_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Keller-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Critical_evaluations\">Critical evaluations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dr._Sun_Yat-sen_(opera)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Critical evaluations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Following the world premiere, a variety of critical evaluations were published.
