Cantarella (Japanese: カンタレラ, Hepburn: Kantarera) is a manga series by You Higuri, serialized in the Japanese monthly comic magazine Princess Gold Magazine and published in tankōbon format by Akita Shoten.  The first volume was published March 2001 and there have been 12 volumes published in Japan as of July 2010.  The series went on a four-year two-month hiatus in Princess Gold Magazine, resuming in the September 2009 issue.  Cantarella has also been translated into Traditional Chinese by Ever Glory Publishing in Taiwan (also sale to Hong Kong), French by Asuka (first volume May 2005), German by Carlsen Comics, English by Go! Comi (first volume October 2005), Russian by Palma Press (Палма Пресс) (first volume July 2010) and Italian by Free Books. Cantarella is the story of Cesare Borgia, an Italian aristocrat during the Renaissance.  In the manga, Cesare's father Rodrigo Borgia, a Cardinal, sells his infant son's soul to the Devil as part of a deal that will one day make him Pope (Rodrigo will become Pope with the name of Alexander VI).  Cesare is consequently shunned by his father, who is unable to see him as anything but an agent of darkness and reminder of his sin.  Increasingly alienated, Cesare eventually comes to rely on the dark powers within himself.  He becomes obsessed with  the idea of conquest, and is aided in his political machinations by the assassin Don Michelotto.
