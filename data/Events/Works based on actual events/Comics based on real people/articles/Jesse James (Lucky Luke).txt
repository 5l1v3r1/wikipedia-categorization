Jesse James is a Lucky Luke comic written by Goscinny and illustrated by Morris. The original French edition was printed in 1969 by Dargaud. English editions of this French series have been published by Dargaud, Cinebook. Brockhampton Press and Tara Press. It is based on the true story of Jesse James (1847â€“1882). In 1880, the story begins with Jesse James, who idolizes and tries to emulate Robin Hood, but somehow he is not able to clearly define the line between the rich he is supposed to rob and the poor he is supposed to help. With the help of his Shakespeare aficionado brother Frank, he therefore simply redefines the term "poor" for his own benefit, and along with Cole Younger the two begin robbing trains en masse, forcing Lucky Luke to move out and stop them with the somewhat inept assistance of two Pinkerton detectives.
