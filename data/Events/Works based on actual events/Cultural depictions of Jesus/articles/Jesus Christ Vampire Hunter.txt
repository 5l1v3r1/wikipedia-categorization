 Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter is a 2001 cult film from Odessa Filmworks which deals with Jesus' modern-day struggle to protect the lesbians of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, from vampires with the help of Mexican wrestler El Santo (based on El Santo, Enmascarado de Plata, and played by actor Jeff Moffet, who starred as El Santo in two other Odessa Filmworks productions). This film earned an honorable mention in the Spirit of Slamdance category at the 2002 Slamdance Film Festival.  Time's Richard Corliss panned the film, finding that "the comedy is slack, the song lyrics feeble, the pace torpid".  Ken Eisner of Variety took a more neutral view, finding that "the film is too silly to offend".  Jason Nolan of The Harrow deemed the production "horridly wonderful", although uneven, noting that "[w]ith a film like this, you want it to be bumpy".  Film Threat's Eric Campos gave the film a generally positive review.
