Jesus Day is a common term for the day of the March for Jesus held annually by some Christians on the Saturday before Pentecost Sunday, since the 1980s, with the purpose of "express[ing] their love for Jesus by serving their communities and worshiping their Lord in the streets of their cities."  While Governor of Texas, Former President George W. Bush, signed a bill into law proclaiming June 10, 2000 to be Jesus Day, the event was observed in Austin that year. The Texas proclamation urged people to "follow the example of Jesus" to "answer the call to serve those in need". The proclamation received national attention when the New York Times ran an article on it.
