 "The Hell Song" is a song by Canadian rock band Sum 41. The song was released in February 2003 as the second single of the band's album Does This Look Infected?. "The Hell Song" was released to radio on February 18, 2003.  The song was featured in the films American Wedding and Punk's Not Dead and in the video game Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home. "The Hell Song" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on May 29, 2015.  Deryck Whibley, the lead vocalist of Sum 41, wrote "The Hell Song" after learning that one of his friends had contracted HIV.  He said, "That song just came out in, like, half an hour when I just found out," Whibley said. "I wasn't even meaning to write about it, but for some reason that just came out right away".  The music video was of a concert with dolls and action figures, with Sum 41's faces on those "performing" in front of a Lite-Brite screen. They were joined with other action figures such as those of Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ozzy Osbourne with his family, Marilyn Manson, Korn, Metallica, Eddie the Head, Gene Simmons, Spice Girls, Angus Young, Jesus Christ, Alice Cooper, Destiny's Child, George W. Bush and Ludacris. The dolls' obscene finger gestures and nudity are comically censored, which parodies real life. The video was directed by Marc Klasfeld. All live tracks (on this CD) from Sound, London.
