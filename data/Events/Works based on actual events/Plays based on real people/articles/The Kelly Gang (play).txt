The Kelly Gang; or the Career of the Outlaw, Ned Kelly, the Ironclad Bushranger of Australia, is an 1899 Australian play about bushranger Ned Kelly. It is attributed to Arnold Denham but it is likely a number of other writers worked on it.  Contemporary reviews remarked on the similarities the play had with Robbery Under Arms.  Denham sued for copyright infringement against the producers of other plays about Ned Kelly including Outlaw Kelly in 1899   and The Kelly Gang in 1901  (the latter was appealed unsuccessfully  ).
