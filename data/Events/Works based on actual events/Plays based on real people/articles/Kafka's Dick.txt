Kafka's Dick is a 1986 play by Alan Bennett.   It is a play about the nature of fame, and how reputation is gained. Set in the 1980s in a Yorkshire suburban dwelling, Kafka aficionado Sydney and his wife Linda are visited by Franz Kafka and his friend Max Brod who are both long dead. (Kafka had left instructions for all his works to be burned, instructions which Brod chose to ignore). As we spend time with the unusual party, it becomes clear that Kafka's wish was for anonymity, and that he had serious issues with his father. When his parent turns up, he is in possession of a very personal secret relating to his son, one which Kafka is terrified his father will disclose.
