Lucrezia Borgia (French: Lucr√®ce Borgia) is an 1833 play by the French writer Victor Hugo. It is a historical work portraying the Renaissance-era Italian aristocrat Lucrezia Borgia. The play (along with Angelo, Tyrant of Padua) is believed to have been a major influence on Oscar Wilde's The Duchess of Padua (1891).   The opera Lucrezia Borgia composed by Gaetano Donizetti had a libretto by Felice Romani which was based on Hugo's play. Several films about Borgia and her family have drawn partly on the plot of the play.
