The Danton Case is a 1929 historical play by the Polish writer Stanis≈Çawa Przybyszewska. The work portrays the conflict between the rival revolutionaries Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton during the French Revolution, particularly in the period leading up to Danton's execution. Przybyszewska wrote the play between March 1928 and March 1929, after many years of studying the French Revolution. The 1932 French film Danton and the 1983 Polish-French film Danton both drew inspiration from the play.
