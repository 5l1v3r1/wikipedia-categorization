  Tipu Sultan Kanda Kanasu (English: The Dreams of Tipu Sultan) is a 1997  Kannada play written by Indian playwright Girish Karnad. The play has been performed many times but different groups around the world but mostly in the subcontinent and mainly in Pakistan and India. The story follows the last days as well as the historic moments in the life of the Ruler of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, through the eyes of an Indian court historian and a British Oriental scholar. The figure of Tipu Sultan has continued to dominate Indian and British imagination for over two centuries,[who?] as attested by the numerous scholarly works, ballads, plays and novels about his tempestuous life and tragic end. What is less well known,[who?] however, is that this man, who spent a large part of his life on horseback, maintained a record of his dreams that he concealed from his nearest associates. The Dreams of Tipu Sultan examines the inner life of this warrior, political visionary, and dreamer.
