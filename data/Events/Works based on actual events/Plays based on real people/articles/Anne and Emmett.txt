Anne and Emmett is a play by American Janet Langhart Cohen. It explores an imaginary conversation between Emmett Till, an African American, and Anne Frank, a German Jew, which takes place in Memory, a non-specific afterlife or alternate dimension. They were killed as young teenagers because of racial persecution. The play recounts the lives of the Till and Frank, comparing and contrasting the events in their lives and deaths.  The show features recorded narration by Morgan Freeman, and a score by Joshua Coyne.   The play was set to premiere at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10, 2009, as part of the commemoration of Anne Frank's 80th birthday.  The premiere was cancelled due to a shooting at the museum, which resulted in the death of a museum guard.    The New York City Police Department has had the play produced for audiences of its police officers, using it to teach tolerance.
