Edward The King is a 2008 two-act play by American playwright David Brendan Hopes. The play is an adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's play Edward II, which in turn is a dramatization of the real-life story of Edward II of England. Beset by the duties of his birth and dominated by a heroic father, Edward looks forward to a life of apparent conformity and desperate subterfuge, until he meets Piers Gaveston in a dirty alley. It is love and rebellion at first sight. From then on, Edward steers a perilous course between desire and safety, which does not entirely end even when he becomes king, and faces not only the usual enemies of unconventional love, but his queen and her lover as well. Edward the King neatly straddles the 14th and 21st centuries, which manage to appear almost equally violent and inhospitable to love.
