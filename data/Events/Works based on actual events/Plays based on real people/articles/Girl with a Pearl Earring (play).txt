Girl with a Pearl Earring is a 2008 play.  Adapted by David Joss Buckley from the novel of the same title by Tracy Chevalier, it premiered at the Cambridge Arts Theatre.  It then received its London premiere at the Theatre Royal Haymarket on 29 September 2008, directed by Joe Dowling and designed by Peter Mumford.  Its London run had been scheduled to end on 1 November, but after largely poor reviews  and in a poor financial climate it closed early on 18 October.
