Osawatomie Brown is a play, by Kate Edwards, about John Brown's struggle with pro-slavery forces in Kansas which brought him national attention and made him a hero to many Northern abolitionists. With only two dozen men he successfully defended the free-soil town of Osawatomie, Kansas (on August 30) against an attack of about 400 men, earning him the nickname "Osawatomie Brown." Brown's play premiered just two weeks after Brown's execution.
