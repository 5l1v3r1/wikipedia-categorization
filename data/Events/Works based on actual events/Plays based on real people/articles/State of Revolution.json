It deals with the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Russian Revolution of 1917\">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Civil_War\" title=\"Russian Civil War\">Civil War</a>, the rise to power of <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin\" title=\"Vladimir Lenin\">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and the struggles of his chief lieutenants \u2013 namely <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Leon_Trotsky\" title=\"Leon Trotsky\">Leon Trotsky</a> \u2013 to gain power under Lenin in the chaos of the Revolution.\n</p><p>The play was first staged in the <a href=\"/wiki/Birmingham_Repertory_Theatre\" title=\"Birmingham Repertory Theatre\">Repertory Theatre</a> in Birmingham, on 3 May 1977 and later moved to the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre\" title=\"Royal National Theatre\">Lyttelton Theatre</a> in London.\n</p><p>Despite the painstaking work put into the show by Bolt (he spent almost three years researching the Revolution and then editing the script), <i>State of Revolution</i> was at best a modest success. He was particularly criticised for having a play which, many felt, lacked Bolt's usual humour and a clear point (see <i>Times</i> review below). Others criticised the play for depicting the Russian characters in too much of an Anglicized manner. The play received its share of positive reviews as well, but was ultimately not a box-office success. It would prove to be Bolt's last stage production, though he would write several more film scripts.\n</p><p>Bolt himself was never satisfied with the play, feeling that he had failed to create strong and sympathetic lead characters. In the late 1970s (according to Bolt's biographer, <a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Turner\" title=\"Adrian Turner\">Adrian Turner</a>), <a href=\"/wiki/Charlton_Heston\" title=\"Charlton Heston\">Charlton Heston</a> attempted to produce a film version, but Bolt himself talked Heston out of it.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Play_synopsis\">Play synopsis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=State_of_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Play synopsis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Act I</b>\n</p><p>The play is framed by an address being given by <a href=\"/wiki/Anatoly_Lunacharsky\" title=\"Anatoly Lunacharsky\">Anatoly Lunacharsky</a> to a group of Young Communists at an unspecified date in the future, on the anniversary of Lenin's death. Lunacharsky gives a speech which solidly toes the Communist Party line about the Revolution and its leaders, <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a>, Lenin, and Trotsky.\n</p><p>The narrative begins in <a href=\"/wiki/Capri\" title=\"Capri\">Capri</a> in 1910 at a meeting of several exiled Communist leaders \u2013 including Lenin, <a href=\"/wiki/Felix_Dzerzhinsky\" title=\"Felix Dzerzhinsky\">Felix Dzerzhinsky</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Alexey_Gorky\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alexey Gorky\">Alexey Gorky</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Alexandra_Kollontai\" title=\"Alexandra Kollontai\">Alexandra Kollontai</a>. Lunacharsky's speech dissolves into a speech being given at this meeting, being proposed as a Communist thesis; all present support it except Lenin, who dismisses it as \"shit\". Lenin thinks his beliefs in supporting \"<a href=\"/wiki/Humanism\" title=\"Humanism\">the human ethic</a>\" is ridiculous and \"merits abuse\", and dismisses the majority opinion against him: \"It's not a school for revolutionary activists you're getting ready here \u2013 it's a school in parliamentary procedure.\"  Lenin continues to draw conflict with his peers and is depicted as being driven purely by ideology rather than any idealism.\n</p><p>The play cuts ahead to 1917, when Russia's struggles in <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a> lead to the <a href=\"/wiki/February_Revolution\" title=\"February Revolution\">collapse</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia\" title=\"Nicholas II of Russia\">Czar</a>'s government. The <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government\" title=\"Russian Provisional Government\">Provisional Government</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky\" title=\"Alexander Kerensky\">Alexander Kerensky</a> wants to continue the war, but the radical Bolsheviks urge an end to the war at all costs while others in the Party \u2013 including Stalin \u2013 urge continuation of the fighting on the grounds that Russia's defeat will lead to the re-establishment of the Czar. When Lenin arrives in <a href=\"/wiki/Finland_Station\" title=\"Finland Station\">Finland Station</a>, he is initially greeted warmly \u2013 until he calls for the establishment of a socialist regime and an end to the war \u2013 even if it means a German victory. Later on, the situation comes to a head as the Russian army finally collapses, and Lenin recruits Zhelnik \u2013 commander of the <a href=\"/wiki/Kronstadt\" title=\"Kronstadt\">Kronstadt</a> Sailors' Soviet \u2013 in his plan to capture <a href=\"/wiki/Petrograd\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Petrograd\">Petrograd</a> for the Bolsheviks.\n</p><p>Lenin instantly sets about organising his government, placing Trotsky, Stalin, Kollontai, and Lunacharsky in high-ranking positions. The government leaders proclaim a new system of freedoms and reforms, much to the delight of the Russian people. Trotsky is, however, forced to negotiate a <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk\" title=\"Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\">peace treaty</a> with the Germans and is unable to bargain on his own terms \u2013 apparently under the delusion that the German soldiers will desert and join the Revolution. The first signs of tension appear when Stalin refers to Trotsky \u2013 who volunteers to organise the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Army\" title=\"Red Army\">Red Army</a> \u2013 as \"our <a href=\"/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Napoleon Bonaparte\">Bonaparte</a>\", greatly insulting Trotsky for <a href=\"/wiki/Bonapartism\" title=\"Bonapartism\">this suggestion of counter-revolutionary disloyalty</a>. At this time, Dzerzhinsky is appointed head of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cheka\" title=\"Cheka\">Cheka</a>, the Soviet secret police. At the end of the act, in a private conversation, Lenin tells Stalin that he is \"the most useful Comrade on the whole Committee.\"\n</p><p><b>Act II</b>\n</p><p>Act II begins as Zhelnik angrily meets with Lenin, his wife <a href=\"/wiki/Nadezhda_Krupskaya\" title=\"Nadezhda Krupskaya\">Nadezhda Krupskaya</a>, and Kollontai, reporting an incident where he and his men were ordered to massacre a group of peasants who would not turn over their stores of grain. Lenin argues the measure was justified because peasants are likely to be counter-revolutionaries, and Zhelnik's protests \u2013 \"We're all \u2013 <i>peasants</i>!\" \u2013 fall on deaf ears.\nShortly thereafter, Lenin meets with <a href=\"/wiki/Fanya_Kaplan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fanya Kaplan\">Fanya Kaplan</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Socialist-Revolutionary_Party\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Socialist-Revolutionary Party\">Peasant Revolutionary Party</a>, who protests the exclusion of all non-Bolshevik parties from the Soviets. At the end of the conversation, Kaplan produces a pistol and shoots Lenin, regretting only that she failed in her attempt.\n</p><p>The assassination coincides with the outbreak of full-scale <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Civil_War\" title=\"Russian Civil War\">Civil War</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War\" title=\"Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War\">intervention</a> of foreign powers, leading Dzerzhinsky to institute the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Terror\" title=\"Red Terror\">Red Terror</a> against all Russians suspected of being counter-revolutionary. At this time, Lunacharasky protests to Dzerzhinsky the extravagant production demands of the government \u2013 in turn, she is warned by him against protesting.\n</p><p>Zhelnik and the other Kronstadt sailors organise a <a href=\"/wiki/Kronstadt_Rebellion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kronstadt Rebellion\">revolt</a> against the Soviet government. Trotsky and Kollontai meet with the sailors and refuse to give in to their demands; Trotsky resorts to violent force to put down the rebellion. Shortly after, Trotsky comes into conflict with Lenin and Stalin for proposing a limited market economy \u2013 which Stalin twists into being counter-revolution. At this point, Stalin proposes that the Party must be expunged of its less loyal members, and advocates a purge \u2013 which is supported by Lenin. The accusations against Trotsky grow, until even Lenin is almost convinced of his possible treachery. Gorky confronts Lenin over his treatment of Trotsky. Gorky angrily protests the imprisonment of provably innocent individuals by the Cheka, and Lenin accuses him too of being a traitor. Lenin then has a stroke, leaving him incapicitated and Stalin and Trotsky to fill in the void.\n</p><p>Stalin and Dzerzhinsky meet with Victor Mdvani, leader of the <a href=\"/wiki/Georgia_(country)\" title=\"Georgia (country)\">Georgian</a> Communist Party, and interrogate him over disloyal statements made in a private letter and his alleged refusal to support Lenin's policies of collectivisation and unification in his republic. At the end of this meeting, a Cheka officer \u2013 Pratkov \u2013 is identified as Captain Draganov, a high-ranking member of the Czar's secret police, and Stalin orders him executed.\n</p><p>A crippled but still strong-willed Lenin speaks with his wife, expressing his dislike and distrust of Stalin. He plans to have Trotsky give a speech denouncing Stalin, but Trotsky is ill and Stalin ends up giving the same speech about Trotsky. Lenin dies shortly thereafter.\n</p><p>After Lenin's death, his colleagues organise a vote, hoping to have Trotsky appointed as Lenin's successor. Despite his distaste for Stalin, Trotsky refuses to brand him a counter-revolutionary, and Stalin wins the vote. The play ends with Lunacharsky's speech \u2013 discussing Trotsky's fall from grace and saying that the Revolution should not be remembered as a \"pageant of Great Men\", but rather as an inevitable event which was served by Lenin, Stalin, and others.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Original_cast\">Original cast</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=State_of_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Original cast\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Blessed\" title=\"Brian Blessed\">Brian Blessed</a> ... <a href=\"/wiki/Maxim_Gorky\" title=\"Maxim Gorky\">Gorky</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Bryant_(actor)\" title=\"Michael Bryant (actor)\">Michael Bryant</a> ... <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin\" title=\"Vladimir Lenin\">Vladimir Lenin</a></li>\n<li>Anthony Douse ... <a href=\"/wiki/Martov\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Martov\">Martov</a>/Czernin</li>\n<li>Peter Gordon ...
