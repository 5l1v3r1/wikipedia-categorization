Tannöd is a novel by German author Andrea Maria Schenkel. It was first published in Germany in January 2006 and was adapted for film in 2009. The novel narrates the story of a multiple murder at an isolated Bavarian farm called Tannöd in the 1950s. The points-of-view of the victims, the witnesses and the perpetrator are intertwined in 39 short passages. Through these largely separate testimonies, the reader gradually builds a complete picture of the events that lead a rural family, headed by a tyrannical, abusive father to all be brutally murdered. The novel is based on the unsolved murder of an entire family in 1922 on the farmstead Hinterkaifeck, Bavaria.
