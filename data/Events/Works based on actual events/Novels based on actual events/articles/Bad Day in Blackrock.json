He and his two friends, Stephen O\u2019Brien and Barry Fox, all attended the (fictional) privately run Brookfield College, a secondary school which boasts of producing high-ranking politicians, judges and business leaders. They have now moved on from this and are embarking on university studies. All of the youths are also heavily involved in the Dublin rugby scene. Another of their former schoolmates and rugby teammates is Conor Harris, who was always considered something of an outsider. Both Culhane and Harris had been at one stage or another involved with the much-admired Laura Haines, another of the South Dublin privileged set. Her behaviour at the nightclub is the trigger that finally results in Culhane and his two friends assaulting and accidentally killing Harris.\n</p><p>The story is told in elliptical fashion, moving backward and forward across the span of the story and delving into each of the individuals\u2019 character, background and possible motivations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Controversy\">Controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bad_Day_in_Blackrock&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On release, the novel attracted some controversy because of its similarities to a real-life event. A close friend of the families involved was reported as saying that the novel was \u2018insensitive\u2019 and that \u2018They're horrified and appalled to think that someone would drag up the case again just as the media interest was beginning to die down.\u2019 Author Kevin Power stated that he did not research the Murphy case while writing the book. He was quoted as saying \u2018I would hope they won't react badly. If you find something in a society that people aren't talking about, in a sense that is what fiction is for\u2026it's not a question of trampling all over sensitivities, that's absolutely not my project here at all. So I would hope that no-one draws offence from anything I've done.\u2019 <sup id=\"cite_ref-a2_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-a2-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Critical_response\">Critical response</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bad_Day_in_Blackrock&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Critical response\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Bad Day in Blackrock</i> received widespread praise from the critics.
