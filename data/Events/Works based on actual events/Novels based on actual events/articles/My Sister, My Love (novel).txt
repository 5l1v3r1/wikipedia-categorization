My Sister, My Love is a 2008 novel by Joyce Carol Oates, her 37th published novel. It reimagines the JonBenét Ramsey murder, with the ice-skating champion Bliss Rampike standing in for JonBenét, and is narrated by her surviving older brother, Skyler Rampike. The book received generally positive reviews, with USA Today noting, "Employing her powerful imagination, the gifted Oates gets inside her fictional characters’ tormented souls to solve the case…as a literary exercise, it deserves a rave…she brilliantly depicts status-obsessed parents who alternately push and ignore their deeply unhappy children."
