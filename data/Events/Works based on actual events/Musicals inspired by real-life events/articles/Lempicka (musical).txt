Lempicka is a musical with music by Matt Gould and lyrics and a book by Carson Kreitzer. Based on the life of Tamara de Lempicka, the musical made its world premiere try-out at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The musical follows the life of de Lempicka as she flees the Russian Revolution in Paris, France.     Lempicka and her beloved husband Tadeusz must make a new life in Paris with their daughter Kizette. Facing the rise of fascism, Tamara takes to painting to survive, and when she meets the free-spirited Rafaela, a prostitute on the fringes of Parisian society, she's torn between the life she cherishes with her husband and the passion, ambition, and possibility awoken in her by her new muse. Inspired by the life of the artist who transformed herself from penniless refugee to star of the art world when the world itself teetered on chaos, Lempicka looks at the beauty and danger of one painter pursuing it all.
