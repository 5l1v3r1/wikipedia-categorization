Baby Case is a musical with book, music, and lyrics by Michael Ogborn. The show is based on the famous Lindbergh baby kidnapping, commonly known as the "Crime of the Century".  The musical, which had its world premiere at the Arden Theatre Company in Philadelphia, has gone on to win multiple awards, including the "Best of Fest" award in the 2012 New York Musical Theatre Festival. The musical originally ran at the Arden Theatre Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as a part of its 2001/2002 season. The musical had its New York debut in 2012 in the New York Musical Theatre Festival. Direction was by Jeremy Dobrish, with choreography by Warren Adams. The cast consisted of Will Reynolds, Anika Larsen, Melissa van der Schyff, Eugene Barry-Hill, Jason Collins, Hannah Elless, Tom Riis Farrell, Michael Thomas Holmes, Matthew G. Myers, Patricia Noonan, and Kurt Zischke.     In her review of the New York Musical Theatre Festival production, Anita Gates of the New York Times wrote: "This production has rousing songs, big voices, stylish staging and choreography, first-rate lighting and handsome period costumes. And framing it with the radio bulletins of Walter Winchell (Michael Thomas Holmes), the celebrity-gossip king of his day, was a smart idea."  The Huffington Post review wrote: "We were both overwhelmed by Ogborn's wit, juxtaposition of historical elements, his range of you-can't-keep-your-toes-from-tapping syncopation, his you-actually-walk-out-humming-them melodies and his handling of a complex and complicated subject...a cut above the original. Director Jeremy Dobrish deserves an E for Exceptionallly Excellent for his revisions."  The musical received 4 Barrymore Awards for Excellence in Theater in 2002, including Best Musical.  In 2012, it received 4 NYMF awards in 2012, including Best of Fest.
