Till We Meet Again  is a 120-minute stage play written by David Langlois, using music from various radio shows and radio-commercials from 1939-1945. The war-time musical production Till We Meet Again offers a true account of how a live CBC-based radio show connected a nation during the uncertainty and emotion of World War II. Based on months of careful research, dozens of interviews with veterans, and analysing old radio recordings and letters, Till We Meet Again authentically recreates life in Canada in the 1940s. This musical will bring audiences back to an era of live radio entertainment typical of what was presented at the Mount Royal Hotel in Montreal that provided hope to a country lost in radio land.
