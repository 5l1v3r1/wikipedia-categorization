I and Albert is a 1972 musical by composer Charles Strouse, and lyricist Lee Adams. The plot is based on the lives of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was adapted for the stage by Jay Presson Allen.   The musical debuted in the West End at the Piccadilly Theatre on 6 November 1972, under the direction of John Schlesinger, but proved a flop, running only for three months, 120 performances. British actress Polly James performed the role of Victoria opposite Sven-Bertil Taube as her husband Prince Albert.   Lewis Fiander and Aubrey Woods had featured roles. Sarah Brightman made her stage debut in 1973 in this musical, as Vicky, the queen's eldest daughter, and a street waif, at age 13. Also in the cast was Simon Gipps-Kent as a young Prince Edward ("Bertie"), a role he would later reprise for television in Edward the Seventh. The musical has not been performed on Broadway.
