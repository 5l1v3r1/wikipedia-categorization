 The Hatpin is a musical by James Millar (book and lyrics) and Peter Rutherford (composer).  It was inspired by the true story of Amber Murray who in 1892 gave up her son to the Makin family in Sydney, Australia.  Written and developed in 2006â€“2007, The Hatpin opened at the York Theatre, Seymour Centre in Sydney on 27 February 2008.   The musical has received subsequent productions in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Hatpin is the true story of a single mother, Amber Murray, who advertised her baby in a newspaper trading column in the hope of saving his life. Baby farmers take the child in return for regular support payments, but in fact murder the child. Eventually the evil couple are arrested and tried for the murder of several infants - leading to one of the most moving criminal trials in Australian history. Using the moral support she gains from her friendship with the free spirited Harriet Piper, Amber fights the injustices of circumstance and tragedy to find hope and strength.
