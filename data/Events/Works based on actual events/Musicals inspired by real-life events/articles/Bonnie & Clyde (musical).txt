Bonnie is a Scottish given name commonly used for females. It is rarely used as a male given name and is sometimes used as a descriptive reference. It comes from the Scottish word "bonnie" meaning "pretty, attractive", which was itself derived from Middle French bonne "good" as a way to describe a fair, good and beautiful girl.  That is in turn derived from the Latin word "bonus" meaning good. The name can also be used as a pet form of Bonita. Bonnie is often used as a nickname or a form of endearment towards a loved one. Bonnie is the main character in the Scottish folk song "My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean". It was covered by The Beatles a year after their formation in 1961, peaking at #5 in a German chart. Legend suggests the album My Bonnie played a role in their early recognition and later success.  Bonnie the orangutan was noted for her musical abilities, namely whistling.
