Amapola is a 2014 Argentine-American romantic comedy fantasy film written and directed by Eugenio Zanetti and starring Camilla Belle, François Arnaud, Lito Cruz, Leonor Benedetto and Geraldine Chaplin. It is the first film as a director of Zanetti, who was previously known for his work in art director, as well as set designer and theater/opera director. During the turbulent years that changed Argentina - between 1966's Coup d'etat and its subsequent dictatorship, the Malvinas/Falklands War in 1982 and the return to democracy in 1983 - a young woman who lives with a family of artists is magically transported to the future, where she discovers the decadence that fell upon her family, their estate and herself. She decides to return to her present in an effort to maintain the union of her family, save her happiness and find her true love. Amapola was for a long time a dream project for Argentine Eugenio Zanetti, who gained international recognition for his work in many Hollywood films as Flatliners (1990), Last Action Hero (1993), What Dreams May Come (1998) and The Haunting (1999), and won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction in 1995, for the film Restoration. Zanetti also participated as the film's production designer. Camilla Belle took some time before filming for learning to speak Castilian, a variant of the Spanish language and Argentina's official language (as well as the most popularly talked in the country), and to do so with a "Porteño" (people from Buenos Aires City) accent. Released in Argentina on June 5, 2014, the film received mixed to negative reviews.
