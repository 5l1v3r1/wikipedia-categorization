Il gobbo (internationally released as The Hunchback of Rome) is a 1960 Italian drama film directed by Carlo Lizzani.    It is loosely based on the real life events of Giuseppe Albano, an Italian partisan that was one of the protagonists, from 1943 to 1945, of the Roman Resistance against German occupation.   Alvaro fights during World War II against the Nazis and soon becomes a partisan leader. The other resistance fighters eventually dismiss him because they find his behaviour inacceptable. After the war he doesn't return to a normal life but turns into a foolhardy gangster.
