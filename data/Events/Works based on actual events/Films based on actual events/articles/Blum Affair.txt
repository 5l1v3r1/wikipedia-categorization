Blum Affair (German: Affaire Blum) is an East German drama film directed by Erich Engel. It was released in 1948. A German Jewish industrialist is tried for murder. It is based on a real 1926 case in Magdeburg.  Bosley Crowther, critic for The New York Times, praised it as "a trenchant dramatic exposition of the way in which an innocent German Jew is almost destroyed by nascent Nazisâ€”back in 1926."  The film sold more than 4,330,000 tickets, making it one of DEFA's all-time most successful productions.
