Mathirimangalam Natesa Iyer, an Carnatic musician, sang most of the songs. There were two songs in Tamil: one by a group sung by the thieves who were waiting to way-laid Tyagaraja. The other Tamil song "Sivano" is a translation of Tygaraja's popular kruthi "Evareni".  According to film historian Randor Guy, the film was a box office success mainly because of the music. He stated the film would be remembered for "The classic compositions of Saint Thyagaraja rendered by Natesa Iyer and the on-screen narration by Virendra Desai."
