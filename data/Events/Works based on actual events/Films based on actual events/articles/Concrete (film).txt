Concrete (コンクリート, Konkurīto) is a 2004 independently produced Japanese film that recounts the story of the murder of Junko Furuta. The film deals as much with the social factors that produced Furuta's four assailants as it does with Furuta's suffering at their hands. The film involves four boys who kidnap a girl named Misaki. The boys rape, torture, and murder her in a similar manner to the manner of the boys who killed Junko Furuta. Many people protested the film's release before it even premiered, and it was eventually relegated to specialty theater showings and a DVD release.
