  Deadly-2 is a 2010 Kannada action - crime biographical film directed and written by Ravi Shrivatsa. The film is based on the real life incidents of an infamous underworld don, Soma and is a sequel to the same team's 2005 released film, Deadly Soma.  The film features Auditya reprising his role as the protagonist  and Meghana as his lady love replacing Rakshita in the prequel. Suhasini Maniratnam, Devaraj and Ravi Kale play other pivotal roles.  The film featured original score composed by L. N. Shastry. The film, upon release received mixed response from both critics and audience and got a negative publicity owing to the violence being glorified throughout the film.  Soma (Audithya) is a talented cricketer-turned-underworld don. An incident where Soma is asked to cough up a    10 lakh bribe so as to be included in the state cricket team turns his life upside down. Not only does the selector leave out Soma's name from the final list, but also refuses to return the money. What ticks off Soma even more is a swear word uttered by the selector. In an impulsive act of rage, Soma kills the selector and thus begins his tryst with the Bangalore crime scene.  Soma having emerged as one of the most wanted criminals, is on the hit list of police officers Ashok, Mani and Ugrappa.  Does he fall to their bullets? And is there any connection between him and the Soma in Deadly Soma? The background music was composed by L. N. Shastry. There is only one situational song composed by him for the film.
