Can You Hear the Laughter? The Story of Freddie Prinze is a 1979 American made-for-television biographical drama film of the life of stand-up comedian and actor Freddie Prinze (portrayed by Ira Angustain).  The teleplay by Dalene Young is based on a Playboy magazine article entitled "Good Night Sweet Prinze" by Peter S. Greenberg. The film was made without the cooperation of Prinze's mother or widow.  At 19, Freddie Prinze (Ira Angustain) exploded on the entertainment scene. With the help of his friend, comedian David Brenner (Ken Sylk), Freddie's career catapulted from second-rate clubs in Manhattan to a prime time stardom on the 1970s television sitcom Chico and the Man as well as sell-out crowds in Las Vegas. Although Freddie had fame, fortune, women, the leap into overnight stardom also brought with it a new set of problems. Freddie looked for love and approval in any way he could, but happiness and satisfaction eluded him. Finding no one to understand him, he turned inward and deeper into drugs. The budget was $1.3 million.
