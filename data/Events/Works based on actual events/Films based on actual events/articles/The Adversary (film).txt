The Adversary (French: L'Adversaire) is a 2002 French drama film directed by Nicole Garcia, starring Daniel Auteuil and Géraldine Pailhas.  The film is based on the 2000 book of the same name by Emmanuel Carrère which is inspired by the real-life story of Jean-Claude Romand. L'Adversaire's protagonist Jean-Marc Faure (Auteuil) pursues an imaginary career as a doctor of medicine in a plot more closely based on Romand's life and Carrère's book than was Laurent Cantet's 2001 film L'Emploi du Temps. The film was nominated for a Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.  At the César Awards 2003 Auteuil was nominated as Best actor, François Cluzet as Best supporting actor and Emmanuelle Devos as Best supporting actress.
