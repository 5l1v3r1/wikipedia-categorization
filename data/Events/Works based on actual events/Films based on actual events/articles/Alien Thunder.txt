Alien Thunder (also known as Dan Candy's Law) is a 1974 Canadian western film directed by Claude Fournier and starring Donald Sutherland. Set in 1880s Saskatchewan at the time of the North-West Rebellion, Alien Thunder is based on a true story about a Woods Cree (Gordon Tootoosis in his first film role) who kills a North-West Mounted Police sergeant (Kevin McCarthy) under desperate circumstances. Hunted for two years by the sergeant's resolute partner (Donald Sutherland), the ending brings tragedy for all those involved. The movie was not a financial success. "Suspense is lacking and characters are generally underdeveloped, as is the tension between the Mounties and the Indians." â€“ Natalie Edwards, Cinema Canada Its filming locations were in Saskatchewan's Battleford, Duck Lake, and Saskatoon.
