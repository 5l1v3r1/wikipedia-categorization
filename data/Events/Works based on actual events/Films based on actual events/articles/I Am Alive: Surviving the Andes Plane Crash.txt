I Am Alive: Surviving the Andes Plane Crash is a 2010 television documentary recounting the tragedy of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 from the perspective of survivor Nando Parrado. Directed by Brad Osborne, this 2-hour special features reenactments of the October 13, 1972 crash and the 72-day struggle for survival that followed, including details of the 37-mile trek out of the mountains by Parrado and fellow survivor Roberto Canessa. Appearing in the film are Parrado, Canessa, Eduardo Strauch, and several other survivors, original search teams, historians, expert pilots, high-altitude medical experts, and others including Piers Paul Read (author of Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors), renowned mountaineer Ed Viesturs, and Andes Survivors expert/alpinist Ricardo Peña. Peña led the only expedition to date to repeat and document the survivors escape route; it is highly significant that he was able to follow almost all the path followed by the survivor with the exception of the initial climbing of Mount Seler, whose route was definitely too much dangerous to follow. During this documentation he has made many discoveries at the site of the crash). I Am Alive was produced by AMS Pictures and premiered on the History Channel on October 20, 2010. It was released for DVD on February 22, 2011.  Critic Linda Stasi of the New York Post awarded I Am Alive four stars, calling it "without question the finest survival documentary I have ever seen on TV."
