The Hiding Place is a 1975 film based on the autobiographical book of the same name by Corrie ten Boom recounting her and her family's experiences before and during their imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp during the Holocaust in World War II. The Hiding Place was directed by James F. Collier.  Jeanette Clift George received a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer - Female.  The film was given limited release in its day and featured the last appearance from Arthur O'Connell. As the Nazis invade the Netherlands in 1940, Corrie and her family allow Jews to hide in a part of their home that is specially remodeled by members of the Dutch resistance. However, the Nazis eventually discover that Corrie and her family are hiding Jews, and on February 28, 1944, the entire family and their friends are arrested after their betrayal by a Dutch collaborator. The hidden Jews are never found by authorities. Corrie's father, Casper, dies before he reaches the concentration camp, and Corrie worries that she will never see her home again. The Nazis send Corrie and her sister, Betsie, to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in Germany for hiding Jews in their home. At the concentration camp, Betsie encourages Corrie to remain hopeful that God will rescue them from the brutalities they experience. With little food and constant work, the women suffer constantly, and Corrie's sister Betsie (Julie Harris), dies. Ultimately, Corrie (Jeannette Clift George) leaves the camp in December 1944 through what is discovered years later to have been a clerical error, as everyone else in her group of prisoners was gassed the following month (January 1945). Her life after this ordeal was dedicated to showing that Jesus' love is greater than the deepest pit into which humankind finds itself.
