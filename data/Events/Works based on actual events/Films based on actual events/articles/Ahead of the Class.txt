After leaving her role as headteacher at The Douay Martyrs School, Ickenham, she takes over as headmistress at St. George's Roman Catholic Secondary School, which is facing closure after its previous headmaster, Philip Lawrence, was murdered in 1995, whilst breaking up a fight between his pupils and students from a rival school. The school is suffering from a multitude of problems, including bullying, gang culture, persistent absence and vandalism. Staff morale is at an all-time low, and Ofsted have placed the school in special measures.
