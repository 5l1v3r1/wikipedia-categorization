Fanny's Journey (original title: Le Voyage de Fanny) is a 2016 French-Belgian children's  war drama film co-written and directed by Lola Doillon. The film is inspired by an autobiographical book by Fanny Ben Ami.   In Vichy France, 1943, a group of Jewish children (who had been sheltered by the Å’uvre de Secours aux Enfants for three years) must now flee to Switzerland, separated from any adults they can trust.
