The film marks Shraddha Kapoor's first female protagonist venture as she is essaying the title role.   Kapoor's  brother, Siddhanth Kapoor portrays the role of Dawood Ibrahim, and Ankur Bhatia plays the role of Haseena's husband.    Haseena Parkar (Shraddha Kapoor) lives with her close to dozen siblings in a small house in central Mumbai.

Haseena gets married to the kindhearted Ibrahim Parkar (Ankur Bhatia) but finds herself compelled to bear the brunt of her brother’s actions. As her brother turns big in the underworld scene, his enemies also increase manifold. One of the enemies eliminates Ibrahim Parkar as revenge. On the other hand, the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai send shock waves everywhere. Dawood emerges as one of the key conspirators in this ghastly crime. As he escapes to Dubai, once again it is Haseena who falls into trouble.  Haseena realises that she can no longer be a victim. She hits back and emerges as Aapa (older sister) in Mumbai's male-dominated underworld. Haseena faces 88 cases of extortion in which she is named as part of her brother's infamous D-Company. She maintains her innocence and relates the story of how she was merely a nervous new bride who was forced to turn into the Godmother of Nagpada. As the defence lawyer Saabir (Sunil Upadhyay) and Public Prosecutor Roshni Satam (Priyanka Setia) continue to argue the case, the judge emerges as sympathetic towards the life and story of Haseena Parkar.
