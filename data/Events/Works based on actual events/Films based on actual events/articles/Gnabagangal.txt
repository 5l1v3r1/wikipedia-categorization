  Gnabagangal (English: Memories) is a 2009 Tamil-language drama film directed by M. Jeevan. It stars lyricist Pa. Vijay (in his acting debut) and Sridevika in the lead roles.  This is a remake of the Hindi film Raincoat (2004), with only difference in the purpose of protagonist's visit to his ex-love. Sify wrote "The story is as old as the hills, and it is hard to believe that it is based on a real life experience of Vijay?s friend during his struggling dates. There is no logic and reason in Vijay?s story, as it is screeching, sentimental, soap style, over the top melodrama suited more for the Tamil stage of the 50?s".  Behindwoods wrote "Gnabagangal has the kind of story that poses the risk of sounding way over-the-top melodramatic or just plain clich√©d, if the treatment lacked sensibility."  Rediff wrote "The screenplay is one huge yawn-fest potted with inadvertent comical situations, mostly provided by Pa Vijay himself. The man, together with director Jeevan, needs a couple of hundred acting and screenplay-writing classes. Meantime, maybe Pa Vijay should stick to lyrics."
