 Cleveland Abduction is a 2015 American crime drama television film directed by Alex Kalymnios from a teleplay written by Stephen Tolkin. Based on the Ariel Castro kidnappings, the film stars Taryn Manning, Raymond Cruz and Joe Morton. It debuted May 2, 2015 on Lifetime.  The film is based on the memoir, Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed by Michelle Knight.  Michelle Knight (Manning) was abducted by Ariel Castro (Cruz) on August 23, 2002 in Cleveland, Ohio. She was held captive in his home for almost 11 years before finally being rescued on May 6, 2013. Finding strength through her belief in God and determined to be reunited with her son, Knight refused to be broken down by Castro. Soon thereafter Castro kidnaps, abducts and rapes two more girls, Amanda Berry (Droke) and Gina DeJesus (Sarife). These girls too become imprisoned along with Knight. They become friends and fellow victims, and they treat each other as sisters through their years in captivity. When Berry became pregnant with Castro's child, it was Knight who delivered her baby, even performing CPR on the infant girl under the threat of Castro killing her if Berry's child didn't survive. Despite enduring more than a decade of brutality and captivity, Michelle's spirit would not be broken as her faith in the face of what she once thought would be a hopeless situation was a testament to the human spirit. On May 6, 2013, Michelle was rescued from the home that was her prison for nearly 11 years, and finally given the chance to reclaim her life.
