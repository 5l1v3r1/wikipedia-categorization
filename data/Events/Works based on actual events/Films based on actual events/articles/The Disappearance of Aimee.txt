The Disappearance of Aimee is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film directed by Anthony Harvey for Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions. It stars Faye Dunaway as the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, with Bette Davis and James Woods.  Based on true events, it attempts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of McPherson in 1926 and the court case that followed her safe return after being missing for four weeks.  In her memoir "This 'n That" (1987, Berkley Pub Group), Bette Davis recounted several anecdotes about working on the film "The Disappearance of Aimee." Among them was that her co-star, Faye Dunaway, was one of the most unprofessional people she had ever worked with. Davis stated that Dunaway would show up hours late, not knowing her lines, and being generally difficult. For one of the scenes in the un-air-conditioned tabernacle, over 1800 unpaid extras (locals who had been promised a box lunch and a chance to be in a movie) were left for hours awaiting Dunaway's arrival. When they finally began leaving, Davis rushed to the pulpit and began singing, "I've Written a Letter to Daddy," a song from her wildly popular film, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Hearing her, many returned to their seats in the pews.
