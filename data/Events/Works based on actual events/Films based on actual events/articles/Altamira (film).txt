Finding Altamira (released as Altamira in Spain) is a 2016 Spanish biographical drama film starring Antonio Banderas, and directed by Hugh Hudson. It is Hudson's first fiction film since I Dreamed of Africa in 2000.  It was shot in Santillana del Mar, Comillas, Puente San Miguel and Santander at the end of 2014 and was released at the beginning of 2015.  The film chronicles the groundbreaking discovery of stone age cave paintings in the Cave of Altamira in Cantabria, Spain, and the subsequent controversy by leading religious and scientific figures of the day. The music was composed by guitarist Mark Knopfler and percussionist Evelyn Glennie. It has a score of 57% on Metacritic.  Johnathan Holland of The Hollywood Reporter called the film "picturesque, but routine" and wrote that "little of the wow factor is felt on a first viewing of the Antonio Banderas-starring, Hugh Hudson-directed Finding Altamira, where events which played a footnote role in Darwin's great scientific revolution are reduced to a good-looking but unimaginative period drama in which everything proceeds exactly as expected".
