Finding Rin Tin Tin is a 2007 Bulgarian–American drama film directed by Israeli filmmaker Danny Lerner. Based loosely on historical events, the film is the most recent in a long line that includes the character Rin Tin Tin. The film tells the story of the original Rin Tin Tin, the legendary German Shepherd, found shortly before the end of World War I by American serviceman Lee Duncan as a shell-shocked puppy in Lorraine, France. The dog was taken to America and became the hero of several films made in the 1920s and 1930s.  Finding Rin Tin Tin is the lowest ranked film on the French site AlloCiné, compiling the ratings of several film critics and was unanimously ranked 1 star.  In October 2008, Daphne Hereford, an American woman breeding progeny of the original Rin Tin Tin, asked a federal court in Houston, Texas to protect her rights to the Rin Tin Tin name.  The judge ruled in favor of the filmmakers, declaring the use of the name in the film to be fair use.
