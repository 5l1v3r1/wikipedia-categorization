Despite the awkwardness and pain of his condition, he would walk eight to ten miles a day to meet his customers.  Porter supported himself and continued to work as a salesman until age 69. Door to Door is also the name of a 2009 Japanese TV movie, starring Kazunari Ninomiya, which is set in Japan and loosely based on the Bill Porter story.
