House on the Hill is a 2012 American horror film directed by Jeff Frentzen and based on the real-life killing spree of serial killers Leonard Lake and Charles Ng. The film had its world premiere on 11 May 2012 at the Monaco Charity Film Festival and was released to DVD in the United Kingdom and United States in 2015. In the United Kingdom, 7 minutes and 12 seconds were cut from the film by the British Board of Film Classification in order to obtain an 18 rating.  Sonia (Naidra Dawn Thomson) is the only known survivor of the serial killer Leonard Lake. She's paired up with a private investigator in the hopes of finding a lost woman and during their exploration of Lakeâ€™s compound, she tells the investigator about how she was tortured and forced to videotape the rape, torture, and murder of another woman. HorrorNews.net and Bloody Disgusting both panned the film, criticizing it for what they saw as poor plotting and acting.   Ain't It Cool News was more positive in their review, praising the performances of Day and Leung while overall stating "while the filmmakers had some disquieting inspiration to build a movie on, HOUSE ON THE HILL is just too low fi to be effective in any way."
