After Jimmy is a 1996 American made-for-television drama film based on a true story starring Meredith Baxter as a woman, with her family, mourning the suicide death of her teenage son. As of 2008, the film has not been released on video or DVD. Depressed eighteen-year-old Jimmy Stapp commits suicide by shooting himself in the head with his father's gun. His family (mother Maggie, father Sam, and two young siblings Billy and Rosie) struggles to deal with life, amid questions of why they didn't see the signs sooner and what could have precipitated suicide. Both parents grieve very differently in the aftermath, which divides them as they search for a way to bring their family back together.
