  Copenhagen is a 2002 British television drama film written and directed by Howard Davies, and starring Daniel Craig, Stephen Rea, and  Francesca Annis. It is based in Michael Frayn's 1998 Tony Award-winning three-character play of the same name.  The story concerns a meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in Copenhagen in 1941 to discuss their work and past friendship, and also revolves around Heisenberg's role in the German atomic bomb program during World War II. The film was produced by BBC Fictionlab for BBC Four, in association with KCET. The film was first broadcast on BBC Four on 26 September 2002, preceded by a prologue with Frayn, and followed by an epilogue by physicist Michio Kaku and a documentary on the historical events. It was broadcast in the United States on PBS (the Public Broadcasting Service).
