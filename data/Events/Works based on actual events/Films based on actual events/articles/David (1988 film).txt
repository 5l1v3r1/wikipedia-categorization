David is a 1988 American television movie, the true story of a child named David Rothenberg, who was burned by his father. This made-for-television film co-starred Matthew Lawrence as David, Bernadette Peters as his mother, and John Glover as his father. It aired on ABC. The film is based on a book written by Marie Rothenberg and Mel White and relates the true story of David, a child who was burned over 90 percent of his body by his father.  The parents were estranged and the non-custodial father, Charles Rothenberg, fled with David in tow to California, but quickly decided that he could not care for David alone. However, rather than return David to his mother's care, the elder Rothenberg used kerosene to set fire to his son while the boy slept in a hotel room. The movie shows how his mother, Marie Rothenberg, coped with the crisis, and the courage and determination of David. Source: AllMovie  In his review, John J. O'Connor wrote: "David can indeed be painful at certain moments but, in the end, its message about going beyond surface appearances comes through admirably."
