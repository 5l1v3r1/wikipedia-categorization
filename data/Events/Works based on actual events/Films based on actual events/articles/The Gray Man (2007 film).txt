The Gray Man (previously known as Wysteria: The Horrible Story of Albert Fish) is a 2007 biographical thriller film based on the actual life and events of American serial killer, rapist and cannibal Albert Fish. It premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival on August 31, 2007, and was scheduled for a theatrical release sometime in 2007. It is directed by Scott Flynn and stars Belgian actor Patrick Bauchau as Albert Fish. At St. John's Orphanage in 1882, children, including a young Albert Fish, are being paddled as punishment for their sins. Albert Fish as an adult (Patrick Bauchau) then tells an anecdote of a horse that some older boys at the orphanage set on fire, comparing himself to the horse. He regularly whips himself with a belt while hallucinating himself as he appeared in the orphanage. Fish kills a boy scout, Francis McDonnell, before visiting the Budd family home, where he abducts and murders ten-year-old Grace Budd (Lexi Ainsworth) on June 3, 1928 under the pretense of taking her to his niece's birthday party. Throughout the film is a film noir-style narration by Detective William King (Jack Conley), of the Missing Persons Bureau. King searches for Grace Budd for six years, before finally tracking down and arresting Fish. Fish is found guilty despite evidence of his insanity, and promptly sentenced to die in the electric chair. Variety's Dennis Harvey, film critic wrote "A chilling turn by Patrick Bauchau as Albert Fish, the seemingly harmless old gent exposed in 1934 as a serial child murderer, dominates 'The Gray Man.' Skirting graphic horror terrain for a less sensational character study/detective-procedural, helmer Scott Flynnâ€™s debut feature manages to be just moderately compelling despite the grotesque subject. Cable and DVD sales are signaled."
