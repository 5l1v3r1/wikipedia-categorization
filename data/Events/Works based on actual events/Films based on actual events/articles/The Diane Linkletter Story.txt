The Diane Linkletter Story is a 1970 16mm short film by American filmmaker John Waters starring Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, and David Lochary. This improvised film is based on the 1969 suicide of TV personality Art Linkletter's daughter, Diane. In the film, Mr. and Mrs. Linkletter fret about their daughter's recent behavior, which includes taking drugs and dating a lowlife named Jim. Eventually, the parents confront Diane, which results in her suicide under the influence of LSD. Waters claims that the film is "accidental" â€“ he and his friends improvised a story while testing a new synch-sound camera (later used on Multiple Maniacs).  The film was unreleased in any form until it showed up on a 1990 videotape entitled A Divine Double Feature.
