  Bride of the Wind is a 2001 period drama directed by Academy Award-nominee Bruce Beresford and written by first-time screenwriter Marilyn Levy. Loosely based on the life of Alma Mahler, Bride of the Wind recounts Alma's marriage to famed composer Gustav Mahler and her romantic exploits. The title of the film alludes to a painting by Oskar Kokoschka named Die Windsbraut, literally meaning The Bride of the Wind, though often translated as The Tempest. The artist dedicated this painting to Alma Mahler. The film met a hostile reception from most critics and did poorly at the box office.  The film poster artwork depicts Alma reclining on a chaise longue attended by a lover, with a field of flowers in the background.  Alma's dress, her hair, the chaise, the field of flowers and even the air are replete with many of famed painter Gustav Klimt's stylistic elements.
