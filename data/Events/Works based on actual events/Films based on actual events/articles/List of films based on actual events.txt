This is a list of feature films that are based on actual events. Not all movies have remained true to the genuine history of the event or the characters they are portraying, often adding action and drama to increase the substance and popularity of the movie. True story movies  gained popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the production of movies based on actual events that first aired on CBS, ABC, and NBC. The Movies Based on True Stories Database by Traciy Curry-Reyes was the first to compile a list of movies based on true stories and was the first site to coin the term "movies based on true stories" in the 1990s. This list should only include movies supported by a Wikipedia article.
