Disaster at Silo 7 is a 1988 American made-for-television thriller-drama film directed by Larry Elikann.   It is loosely based on the 1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion. During routine maintenance of a liquid-fuelled ICBM, the fuel tank is penetrated by a falling socket. The film traces the efforts of the maintenance crew and associated military and civilian personnel to recover the potentially disastrous situation before the fuel tank is sufficiently depressurised that the stack collapses and explodes.  Inspired by the 1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion, Jeffrey K Kennedy one of the main protagonist of the Damascus event was a special technical advisor for this movie.
