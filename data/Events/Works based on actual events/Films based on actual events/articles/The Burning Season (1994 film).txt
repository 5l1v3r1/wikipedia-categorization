 The Burning Season  is a 1994 television movie directed by John Frankenheimer. The film chronicles Chico Mendes' fight to protect the rainforest.  This was Raúl Juliá's last film released during his lifetime. The movie was based in part on the 1990 book of the same name by journalist Andrew Revkin. Chico Mendes was a Brazilian rubber tapper, unionist and environmental activist who was murdered in 1988 by ranchers opposed to his activism. The movie opens in 1951 with a young Chico Mendes witnessing his father's interaction with corrupt ranchers who are exploiting peasants for their work. The bulk of the film then takes place between 1983 and 1988, showing Mendes' activism to preserve the Amazon rainforest, to his murder in a drive-by shooting by a disgruntled rancher.
