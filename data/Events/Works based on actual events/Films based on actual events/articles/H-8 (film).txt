H-8 is a 1958 Yugoslav film directed by Nikola Tanhofer. "A bus and a truck are moving towards each other along a two-way traffic highway on a rainy day. At the very beginning we learn that a reckless driver of another car will cause them to collide while trying to pass the bus; we even learn what seats will spell doom for their occupants. The rest of the movie follows two streams of events on the bus and on the truck, getting us to know and like a wide variety of characters, wondering which ones will end up being casualties and holding (our) breath for our favourites." (IMDb) The movie is based on a true story, in which the driver that caused a fatal 1957 bus-truck collision was never identified. "H-8" is the beginning of that driver's license plate, the only available information on the culprit's vehicle.  In 1999, a poll of Croatian film critics found it to be one of the best Croatian films ever made.
