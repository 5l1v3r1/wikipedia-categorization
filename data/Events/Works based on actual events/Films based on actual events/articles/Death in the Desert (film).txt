Death in the Desert is a 2015 American crime-drama film directed and produced by Josh Evans and starring Michael Madsen and Shayla Beesley, with John Palladino, Paz de la Huerta, and Roxy Saint appearing in supporting roles. Principal filming completed in February 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  It is the second film collaboration between Madsen and Evans, who produced The Price of Air in which Madsen starred.  Released in March 2016 by Osiris Entertainment, the film is based on the book Death in the Desert by true-crime author Cathy Scott about Ted Binion, a wealthy gambling executive and one of the sons of famed Las Vegas casino magnate Lester Ben "Benny" Binion, owner of Binion's Horseshoe. The book adaptation was written by screenwriter John Steppling. The storyline covers the real-life 1998 death of the younger Binion, a drug addict who had lost his Nevada gaming license, and his live-in girlfriend Sandra Murphy, charged with murdering Binion along with her lover Rick Tabish, who was caught digging up Binion's buried silver.  The film first premiered in October 2015 at the Tucson Festival of Films.  Indiewire wrote, "Luckily for Madsen fans, the actor looks to be having a complete blast in his most recent film, Death in the Desert.  Vegas Seven Magazine, in its review, wrote, "Death in the Desert, despite its protagonistâ€™s wealth, rides the downbeat vibe of a back-alley, underbelly Vegas. What emerges is a muted, thoughtful study of disillusionment, dashed dreams and fatal appetites via a relationship that takes root amid the mechanical sensuality of a Downtown strip joint."
