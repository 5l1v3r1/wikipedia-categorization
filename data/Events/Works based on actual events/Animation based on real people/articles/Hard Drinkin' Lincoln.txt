Hard Drinkin' Lincoln is a Macromedia Flash Internet cartoon series produced in 2000 for the Internet animation company Icebox.com. The series was created by Mike Reiss and directed by Xeth Feinberg. Unlike Reiss and Feinberg's later series for Icebox, Queer Duck, Hard Drinkin' Lincoln did not receive attention from other media outlets. The series portrays Abraham Lincoln (voiced by Jim Ward) as a boorish alcoholic who enjoys pestering his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (voiced by Jocelyn Blue, later Tress MacNeille) and causing trouble during shows at Ford's Theatre.   Many episodes end with Hard Drinkin' Lincoln being shot by John Wilkes Booth (the main antagonist, voiced by Maurice LaMarche), often to the delight of bystanders.  Other historical figures who appear in the episodes include Jenny Lind, Mohandas Gandhi, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee and Frederick Douglass. Creator Reiss explained: "What makes me proud of 'Hard Drinkin' Lincoln' is that it's a totally undeserved attack. The comedy comes from the fact that this man did nothing to deserve this."
