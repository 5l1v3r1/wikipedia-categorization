The Governator was a planned superhero franchise for children developed and produced by Stan Lee and co-developed with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The Governator was first announced via Entertainment Weekly with Lee co-developing into an animated TV series and comic book on March 30, 2011 with the comic book title coming out first in 2012.  Schwarzenegger announced his return to acting at a press conference in MipTV in Cannes with a series trailer with the addition of a game and 3D animated film to the project. Lee was developing the series alongside Andy and Amy Heyward of A Squared Entertainment. German-based Your Family Entertainment was handling the world sales rights.  The comic book series was planned to be published under the Stan Lee Comics joint venture.   On May 20, 2011, A Squared Entertainment announced that production of The Governator was halted in the wake of Schwarzenegger's infidelity scandal.  The Governator featured a fictionalized Schwarzenegger who after stepping down from his role as Governor of California became a superhero in order to fight crime. His real-life family and Brentwood home would have fictional counterparts with the home having an Arnold Cave under it as a base of operations. To assist in crime fighting, the cave would have high tech vehicles, super suits, gym and a group of sidekicks. One sidekick is his cyber security expert, Zeke Muckerberg, a teenage computer genius. The Govenator would go up against G.I.R.L.I.E. Men (Gangsters Imposters Racketeers Liars & Irredeemable Ex-cons), his recurring supervillains.  A recurring character shown in the trailer is an investigative reporter, voiced by Larry King.
