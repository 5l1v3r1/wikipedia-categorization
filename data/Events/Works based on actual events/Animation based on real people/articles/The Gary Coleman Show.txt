The Gary Coleman Show is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that originally aired on NBC during the 1982â€“1983 season.  It featured the voices of Gary Coleman, Lauren Anders, Jennifer Darling, Julie McWhirter Dees, Geoffrey Gordon, LaShana Dendy, Jerry Houser, Calvin Mason, Sidney Miller and Steve Schatzberg. The series featured Gary Coleman as the voice of Andy LeBeau, an apprentice angel, who was dispatched back to Earth to earn his wings by helping others. The character of Andy LeBeau was a spin-off character from Coleman's made-for-TV movie The Kid with the Broken Halo (1982). In each episode, Andy was dispatched to help a child in need and resolve his problem. The antagonist in each episode was Hornswoggle, who tried to make Andy's mission more difficult, usually by getting him to make the wrong choice or by otherwise complicating the mission. It was up to Andy to correct whatever mistakes he made and foil Hornswoggle's plans.
