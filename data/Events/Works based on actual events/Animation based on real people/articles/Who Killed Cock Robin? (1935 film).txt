Who Killed Cock Robin is a Silly Symphonies short released on June 26, 1935 by United Artists, produced by Walt Disney and directed by David Hand. It is based on the nursery rhyme Who Killed Cock Robin?. An extract from the cartoon was featured the following year in Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage. While Cock Robin (caricatured after Bing Crosby) serenades the Mae West-esque Jenny Wren, an unseen assailant shoots an arrow into Cock Robin's heart and he falls to the ground, giving the other birds in the tree the impression he has been shot and killed. The police arrive at the scene and arrest a Harpo Marx-like cuckoo, an Edward G. Robinson-inspired sparrow (possibly an homage to the original story) and a Stepin Fetchit-based blackbird as suspects. The next day a trial is held over the identity of Cock Robin's assassin, with an owl serving as the judge and a parrot as the prosecutor, interrogating the suspects and showing Cock Robin's body as evidence. The blackbird confesses he hadn't done, seen, or known anything about it. The sparrow refuses to say anything. The cuckoo doesn't know either, but continually points to the judge and the parrot and even himself, showing he is indeed "cuckoo". Everyone is astounded that no one knows who murdered Cock Robin. At that moment, Jenny Wren arrives and demands that she see justice done for her Cock Robin. Eventually, the judge declares that all three suspects be hanged as they don't know which of them is guilty. Just then, an arrow strikes the judge's hat, and its owner, Cock Robin's supposed killer, is revealed to be Cupid. He reveals that Robin isn't dead at all; he simply fell for Jenny Wren and is currently unconscious, the arrow he was shot with is in his armpit. Jenny revives Robin and they kiss, to the excitement of the jury. Who Killed Cock Robin? was released on the Walt Disney Treasures Wave One DVD Silly Symphonies.
