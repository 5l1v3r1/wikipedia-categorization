El Ap贸stol (Spanish: "The Apostle") is a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world's first animated feature film.   It was directed and produced respectively by Italian immigrants Quirino Cristiani and Federico Valle. The film was written by Alfonso de Laferrere    and directed by Quirino Cristiani. The film consisted of a total of 58,000 frames played over the course of 70 minutes (at 14 frames per second).  The film was a satire, with President Hip贸lito Yrigoyen ascending to the heavens to use Jupiter's thunderbolts to cleanse Buenos Aires of immorality and corruption. The result is a burnt city. The film was well received by critics at the time and a commercial success. A fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of El Ap贸stol, and so it is now considered a lost film. A 2007 documentary Quirino Cristiani: The mystery of the first animated movies, directed by Italian animator Gabriele Zuchelli researches the history of the studio and recreates the look and technique used in El Ap贸stol.
