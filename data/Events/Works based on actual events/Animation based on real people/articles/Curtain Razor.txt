Curtain Razor is a 1949 Looney Tunes short directed by Friz Freleng and starring Porky Pig.  It is notable as a showcase of the voice talent of Mel Blanc. An operatic tenor voice and piano music for the Act III Prelude from Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin accompany the opening credits and earth-shaking scene as hopeful stage talents wait outside the office of Goode and Korny: Talent Agents. While singing, the voice boasts of his previous experience in other venues. The voice turns out to belong to a tiny grasshopper, who ends his performance with Blanc's trademark pronunciation of "Cuc-amonga". Porky, who is the agency's producer and listening to the auditions, tells the grasshopper he might have a spot for him. The rest of the short consists of a series of acts by various performers, most of whom Porky rejects: Finally, it is the fox's turn to do his act. He dons a devil's costume and swallows atomic powder, TNT, gasoline, and finally, a lit match. BOOM! Porky thinks the act is terrific, but the fox (now a transparent ghost) comes through the office door and says that there is only one tiny problem with the act: he can only do it once. (The same gag and punch line would be recycled near the end of the 1957 cartoon Show Biz Bugs, only with Daffy Duck blowing himself up.) Curtain Razor is available restored on the Looney Tunes Super Stars' Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham DVD release.
