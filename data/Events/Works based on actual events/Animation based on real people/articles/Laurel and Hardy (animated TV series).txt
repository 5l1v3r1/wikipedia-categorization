Laurel and Hardy is an American animated television series and an updated version of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's comedic acts by the animation studio Hanna-Barbera from Hal Roach. A total of 156 shorts were made, each having its own opening and closing wrap-arounds, to make them easy to air in syndication. In a majority of the cartoons, after Laurel and Hardy get into a mess of trouble, almost each one of them ends with Laurel whimpering in a high register. As both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had died by the time of this series (Laurel died a year before the series went to air), Larry Harmon (who also produced the cartoons) and Jim MacGeorge respectively provided the voices of Stan and Ollie. They would later reprise their roles in an episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. Additional Voices: Hal Smith, Don Messick, Janet Waldo, Paul Frees, Doug Young, Allan Melvin           From 1969â€“1974, Thorpe & Porter in the United Kingdom published a color comic book series based on the Laurel & Hardy cartoon, which lasted 136 issues  plus eight extra large issues.  In 1972, DC Comics published a single issue of a comic book series based on the Laurel and Hardy cartoon series.  The cover for the unpublished second issue appears in The DC Vault.
