Mike Tyson Mysteries is an American adult animated television series, and the first to be produced by Warner Bros. Animation for Adult Swim. It premiered October 27, 2014.  The series features Mike Tyson solving mysteries, in the style of I Am the Greatest: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali, Scooby-Doo!, Jonny Quest, and Mr. T.  On December 10, 2014, Adult Swim renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on November 1, 2015. A third season premiered on May 14, 2017 , and the remaining Season 3 episodes aired from March 4, 2018 to May 13, 2018.    The show follows Mike Tyson, the ghost of the Marquess of Queensberry, Tyson's adopted daughter, and a pigeon as they solve mysteries. The style of the show borrows heavily from 1970s cartoons, most notably Hanna-Barbera productions such as Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? and The Funky Phantom. However, it also contains adult language and concepts, in the manner of Family Guy, or South Park, and many other Adult Swim shows. While each episode involves a mystery as a framing device, often these are ignored altogether while the plot takes another direction as the mysteries are usually never solved, and episodes sometimes end on cliffhangers which are never resolved. The series has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The show currently holds an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with its consensus being: "A dizzying whirl of lowbrow and high-concept, Mike Tyson Mysteries should more than satisfy fans of Adult Swim's signature blend of animated silliness."  Metacritic gives the show a score of 75/100 based on six reviews, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.
