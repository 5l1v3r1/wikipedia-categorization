Santo vs The Clones (Spanish: Santo Contra Los Clones), is a 2004 Cartoon Network Latin American original animated series consisting of five short episodes, which were aired every Wednesday nights at 8:00 PM only and exclusively in Mexico.  It's created by Carlo Olivares Paganoni, a filmmaker and advertising worker, but also a cartoonist who already made the local Cartoon Network pilot Bobots; he wanted to pay tribute to the legendary defunct Luchador wrestler enmascarado and film actor Rodolfo Guzm√°n Huerta, better known as El Santo. Finally, Carlo hired for this show as developer El Hijo del Santo. Set in Mexico City, Santo vs The Clones follows the adventures of the homonym wrestler as a superhero who must try to stop the plans of Dr. Clone, an evil scientist, who which is determined to kill him and simultaneously dominate the world by creating clones of his old enemies (through their DNA). In 2007 has been announced like a relation to Santo vs The Clones, that its international version is in development at Cartoon Network Studios,   but was eventually released as an unaired short pilot titled Mask of Santo in 2008. Also for it, Carlo Olivares Paganoni and El Hijo del Santo are reconfirmed as creator and developer, respectively.
