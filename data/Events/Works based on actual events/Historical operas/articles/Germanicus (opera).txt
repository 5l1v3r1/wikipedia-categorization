Germanicus is a German-language opera by Georg Philipp Telemann, to a libretto by the poet Christine Dorothea Lachs (de), fourth daughter of Nicolaus Adam Strungk of Dresden.     The opera was written in 1704 and revised in 1710. It is supposedly one of the twenty operas that Telemann wrote for the opera house in the Leipzig Brühl.  The plot concerns the Roman general Germanicus. The opera was believed lost until 45 arias were discovered in a Frankfurt archive by Dr Michael Maul. The opera was premiered with spoken text between arias at the Bachfest Leipzig 2007 and at the 2010 Magdeburg Telemann Festival under conductor Gotthold Schwarz. A recording was released by cpo in 2011.
