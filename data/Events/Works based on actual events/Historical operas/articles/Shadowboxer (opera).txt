Shadowboxer, is a boxing opera in two acts composed by Frank Proto to a libretto by John Chenault based on the life of Joe Louis, the legendary American boxer. Conceived and directed by Leon Major at the University of Maryland Opera Studio,  it premiered on 17 April 2010 at the University's Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.  The opera begins with an elderly, sickly Louis in a wheelchair, remembering scenes of his life.  The first act shows him becoming a successful professional boxer and ends with his triumphal defeat of the German Max Schmeling in 1938. With this victory Louis became an American hero.  The second act follows his decline, eventual defeat in the ring, and his problems with the American Internal Revenue Service.
