Sister Jiang (Chinese: 江姐; pinyin: Jiāng Jiě) is a 1964 Chinese-language western-style opera based on the real life death of Sichuan revolutionary martyr Jiang Zhuyun, though in the opera the name is changed to Jiang Xueqin.     The opera was composed by Yang Ming and Jiang Chunyang  musicians of the art bureau of the Chinese Air Force.   In 2002 at the invitation of the German World Art Festival, director Zhang Yuan presented the opera with Zhang Huoding in the title role as Jiang Jie at the Cologne Grand Theater - the first major presentation of a revolutionary opera in Europe. Zhang Yuan made a film version of the production in 2003. The opera is not the base of the 2010 CCTV-1 series also entitled Jiang jie.
