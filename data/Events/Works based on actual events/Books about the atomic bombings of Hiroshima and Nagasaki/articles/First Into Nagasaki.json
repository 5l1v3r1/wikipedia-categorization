(Delayed) U.S. Prisoner Sees A-Bomb Rip Nagasaki.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Substantial portions of this <i>Los Angeles Times</i> September 16, 1945 published article are contained in two dispatches in <i>First into Nagasaki</i>: 1. First Dispatch September 6, 1945 2300 pages 25\u20137; 2. Fifth Dispatch September 8, 1945 0300 pages 35\u20136. Both these dispatches are part of a group of eight dispatches (pages 25\u201345) which are described in <i>First into Nagasaki</i> as never published. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> page one article of September 16, 1945 with its sub-headline \"Witnesses Describe Parachutes Falling and Searing Blast\" includes Weller's interviews with Captain Farley, POWs Bridgman and King, and Dutch doctor Vink (all in Dispatch #5) and Weller's interview with the Japanese lieutenant, aide to the district's commander (Dispatch #1). The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article has the following introductory paragraph: \"The following story, delayed by censorship, is an eyewitness account by an American observer of the results of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki and includes the stories of men on the ground who saw the bomb fall.\"\n</p><p>The <i>Boston Evening Globe</i> on September 15, 1945 published a page one article \"By George Weller Nagasaki\" with bold all caps headline \"American Saw Atom Bomb Hit Nagasaki\" using content described as \"unpublished\" [page 24 <i>First into Nagasaki</i>] and at the end of the article \"Continued on Page 2\" is the following: \"(Copyright, 1945, by the Boston Globe and Chicago Daily News.)\". Text from Dispatch #6 and Dispatch #1 is used (example: \"Walk in Nagasaki's streets today and you walk in ruins.\" This is the first line of Dispatch #1). Weller's interview with the Japanese lieutenant (Dispatch #1) is used in the <i>Boston Evening Globe</i> article as is Weller's interview with Captain Farley (Dispatch #5), and Weller's interview with Dr. Nakashima (Dispatch #8). Quoted statements by ex-POWs Bridgman and King (Dispatch #5) are in this <i>Boston Evening Globe</i> article, which covers both Japanese and Allied observers' eyewitness accounts of the bomb as well as Dr. Nakashima's description of the bomb's medical symptoms. The Boston article reads: \"However, about 70 percent of deaths have been from plain burns.\" (Dispatch #6). The <i>New York Post</i> on September 15, 1945 published an article by George Weller headlined \"U.S. Prisoners Held at Nagasaki Describe Terrors of Atom Blast\" using the same line of text as the Boston article (Dispatch #1), death statistics (Dispatch #3) and re-located position of POW camp (Dispatch #4). The New York article includes Weller's interviews with Captain Farley, Dr. Vink, Harold Bridgman, and Fred King (Dispatch #5). The article concludes with the bomb's \"peculiar 'disease'\" (Dispatch #8).\n</p><p>The <i>Miami Herald</i> on September 18, 1945 published an article \"By George Weller Miami Herald-Chicago Daily News Wire\" headlined: \"American Tells of Being Atomic Bombed\" with quote above: \"'I Hit the Ground...Building Began To Quiver'\". In this article are quotations and statistical data from Dispatch #3 \"The known dead number 20,000, Jap police tell me, and they estimate about 4,000 bodies remain to be found\" along with \"The wounded are estimated to be about twice the number of dead.\" \"Walk in Nagasaki's streets today and you walk in ruins.\" (Dispatch #1) Also, Captain Farley's eyewitness account (Dispatch #5) is quoted. The interviews with Bridgman and King (Dispatch #5) are included as well as information from Dr. Nakashima  (Dispatch #8) and the interview with the Japanese lieutenant, aide to the district commander (Dispatch #1).\n</p><p>George Weller's own response \"In hours of walking through these areas I experienced no burns or signs of debilitation.\" is from Dispatch #3 (<i>First into Nagasaki</i> page 30) which mentions Weller's \"nausea\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> not reported in the <i>Miami Herald</i> article of 1945.\n</p><p>The <i>Miami Herald</i> article incorrectly states atomic POW casualties \"Forty-eight were killed instantly and four others died later.\" while Dispatch #5 states \"Forty-eight were wounded, four instantly killed, and four, including Aalders, died.\" The incorrect POW casualty figures also appear in Weller's <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article of September 16, 1945 and his <i>New York Post</i> article of September 15, 1945, and his article in the <i>Akron Beacon Journal</i> headlined \"Yank Saw Atom Bomb Wipe Out Nagasaki\" and above that \"It Was 'Terrific, White Flash'\" September 15, 1945 (this article includes interviews <i>supra</i> from Dispatch#1, Dispatch#5, and Dispatch#8). The Associated Press' Vernon Haugland quotes Dr. Vink \"only four of our 200 prisoners were killed\"[outright when the bomb exploded; four more died subsequently] in article published widely, including in the <i>New York Times</i> and on September 10, 1945 in the <i>Miami Herald</i>. Thus papers in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, and Akron all print Weller's incorrect casualty statistics, whilst Dispatch#5 gives correct data, as does the Associated Press in 1945.\n</p><p>Eight Dispatches (pages 25\u201345) are described in <i>First into Nagasaki</i> as written in Nagasaki September 6\u20139 with Weller \"sending them off to MacArthur's military censors in Tokyo, hopeful that they were being cabled onward to his editors at the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> and thence to a vast American readership via syndication. These dispatches have remained unpublished for sixty years; it appears that the U.S. government destroyed the originals.\"\nThe fact of publication by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Boston Evening Globe</i>, <i>New York Post</i>, <i>Miami Herald</i>, and <i>Akron Beacon Journal</i> is irreconcilable to George Weller's assertion that: \"...I sent 25,000 words by the hands of the obliging <i>kempeitai</i>, the secret police, directly to MacArthur. ... All my dispatches were suppressed.

Both Gollin and Junior Anthony Weller produced two novels during their first two years at Yale....Real-life people and familiar scenes provide the basis for Weller's novels. He concentrates on telling the story and lets meanings work their way in surreptitiously. The writer's most difficult task is to be true to his characters, Weller believes. \"A writer must think out vivid characters; he must know what they will say and how they will act. For example, a girl from Long Island would comment 'I feel a little nauseous' not just 'I feel nauseous.'\" Weller plans his characters' actions like chess moves that have many repercussions. \"The action keeps readers interested. They want to find out what events, cause changes in attitudes, rather than the thoughts of a character.\" Writing his second novel, he encounters a dangerous urge to make it too complicated, too literary. He has spent two and a half years writing and revising his book about a college student who begins to face responsibilities involving other people, and must ponder what relation women will have to his life. Weller has already begun work on a third novel that's \"less quiet\" than the other two; it concerns a man whose best friend attempts to murder him. ... None of these students currently take any English or creative writing courses at Yale. ... Weller explains that he would not take a creative writing course because \"there's a point when you have the urge to develop on your own -- without interference.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Anthony Weller, <i>The Weller Dispatches by Anthony Weller pages 305-6 First into Nagasaki</i>, Edited and with an Essay by Anthony Weller: VII</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>Chicago Daily News</i> August 14, 1965 page 20</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-11\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-11\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>First into Nagasaki</i> page 3</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-12\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-12\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Robert Manne <i>Quadrant</i> August 1985 (reprinted in <i>Left Right Left: Political Essays 1977-2005</i> \"He Chose Stalin: The Case of Wilfrid Burchett\");
