It focuses on two cellmates, one whose successful appeal means that his release draws near and one who must remain in prison for many years to come. They spend their days performing futile physical labor and nights rehearsing in their cell for a performance of <a href=\"/wiki/Sophocles\" title=\"Sophocles\">Sophocles</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antigone (Sophocles)\">Antigone</a></i> in front of the other prisoners. One takes the part of Antigone, who defies the laws of the state to bury her brother, and the other takes the part of her uncle Creon, who sentences her to die for her crime of conscience. The play draws parallels between Antigone's situation and the situation of black political prisoners. Tensions arise as the performance approaches, especially when one of the prisoners learns that he has won an early release and the men's deep friendship is tested. <i>The Island</i> bears testament to the resiliency of the human heart.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Structure\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Structure</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Plot\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Plot</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Characters\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Characters</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Themes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Themes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Language\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Language</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Broadway_awards_and_nominations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Broadway awards and nominations</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Structure\">Structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Island_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The play has four scenes. It opens with a lengthy mimed sequence in which John and Winston, two cell mates imprisoned on Robben Island, shovel sand in the scorching heat, dumping the sand at the feet of the other man, so that the pile of sand never diminishes. This is designed to exhaust the body and the morale of the prisoners. Later scenes include a <a href=\"/wiki/Play_within_a_play\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Play within a play\">play within a play</a>, as Winston and John perform a condensed two-person version of <i>Antigone</i> by Sophocles.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Island_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The play was first performed in Cape Town, at a theatre called <a href=\"/wiki/Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)\" title=\"Space Theatre (Cape Town)\">The Space</a>, in July 1973. In order to evade the draconian censorship in South Africa at the time (plays dealing with prison conditions, etc., were prohibited), the play premiered under the title, <i>Die Hodoshe Span</i>. It was next staged at the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Court_Theatre\" title=\"Royal Court Theatre\">Royal Court Theatre</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>, with John Kani and Winston Ntshona portraying John and Winston respectively.

Notable among them were the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre\" title=\"Royal National Theatre\">Royal National Theatre</a> in 2000 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/?lid=1246\">[1]</a>, reported at the time as their final production, although they went on to star at the <a href=\"/wiki/Old_Vic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Old Vic\">Old Vic</a> in 2002 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.onlinereviewlondon.com/reviews/island.html\">[2]</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music\" title=\"Brooklyn Academy of Music\">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a> in 2004 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.showbusinessweekly.com/archive/222/island.shtml\">[3]</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot\">Plot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Island_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Plot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>John and Winston share a prison cell on an unnamed Island. After another day of hard labor and having been forced to run while shackled and then beaten, they return to their cell. They tend each other's wounds, share memories of times at the beach and rehearse for the prisoner-performed concert which is imminent. They are going to perform a scene from an abridged version of <i>Antigone</i> by Sophocles. John will play Creon and Winston will play Antigone.\n</p><p>When he sees himself in his costume, Winston tries to pull out of playing a female role, fearing he will be humiliated. John is called to the governor's office. He returns with news that his appeal was successful and his ten-year sentence has been commuted to three years: he will be free in three months. Winston is happy for him. As they imagine what leaving prison and returning home will be like, Winston begins to unravel. He doubts why he ever made a stand against the regime, why he even exists. Having said it, he experiences a catharsis, and accepts that he must endure.\n</p><p>The final scene is their performance of <i>Antigone</i>. After John-as-Creon sentences Winston-as-Antigone to be walled up in a cave for having defied him and done her duty towards her dead brother, Winston pulls off Antigone's wig and yells \"Gods of Our Fathers! My Land! My Home! Time waits no longer. I go now to my living death, because I honored those things to which honor belongs\". The final image is of John and Winston, chained together once more, running hard as the siren wails.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Characters\">Characters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Island_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Characters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>John has been imprisoned for belonging to a banned organization.</li>\n<li>Winston, we find out later was imprisoned for burning his passbook in front of the police.
