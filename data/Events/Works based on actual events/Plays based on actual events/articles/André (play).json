The play does not go into the historic details, but rather presents a fictionalized account of the American debate over whether to spare or hang him. Only three characters in the play are historic: Andr\u00e9 himself, <a href=\"/wiki/George_Washington\" title=\"George Washington\">George Washington</a> (referred to throughout the text, except once in a passage inserted between the first two performances, simply as \"The General\"), and <a href=\"/wiki/Honora_Sneyd\" title=\"Honora Sneyd\">Honora Sneyd</a>, who had been briefly engaged to Andr\u00e9 ten years earlier under the auspices of <a href=\"/wiki/Anna_Seward\" title=\"Anna Seward\">Anna Seward</a>, who had done much to romanticize the affair in her <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Monody_on_Major_Andr%C3%A9&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Monody on Major Andr\u00e9 (page does not exist)\">Monody on Major Andr\u00e9</a> of 1781. (Actually, Honora Sneyd had died of consumption some months before Andr\u00e9's death, and never went to America.)\n</p><p>Despite the fictionalization, the play genuinely shows the anguish felt by many on the American side over the necessity to hang the brilliant and charming young officer, and it is written in unusually supple verse for the 18th century.\n</p><p>Apart from its intrinsic merits, the play is noteworthy as the first American tragedy written on an American subject. However, despite being nowadays acknowledged as Dunlap's best piece of work, it was, unfortunately, not a great success at the time. Its lack of popularity stemmed from the controversial lionization of Andr\u00e9. Moreover, at opening night, the crowd rose to its feet in anger and indignation when Bland, a soldier in the play, hurled his <a href=\"/wiki/Cockade\" title=\"Cockade\">cockade</a> to the ground at the prospect of Andr\u00e9 being sentenced to death. The controversy was twofold\u2014 not only was Bland losing composure over the fate of a British spy but the cockade (worn by <a href=\"/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)\" title=\"Patriot (American Revolution)\">Patriots</a> and then later by the revolutionaries during the <a href=\"/wiki/French_revolution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"French revolution\">French Revolution</a> to emulate their spirit) being tossed to the floor was interpreted by many as Dunlap attacking the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\" title=\"American Revolutionary War\">American Revolution</a> itself.\n</p><p>Dunlap later recycled much of <i><b>Andr\u00e9</b></i> into his pageant-play <i>The Glory of Columbia, Her Yeomanry</i>, a piece resonating with the <a href=\"/wiki/Populism\" title=\"Populism\">Populist</a> tone in theatre at the time, and which continued to be regularly produced for fifty years.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Andr%C3%A9_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://John-W-Kennedy.name/Andre\">http://John-W-Kennedy.name/Andre</a> \u2013 Full text</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2230\nCached time: 20180917205939\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.048 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.064 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 321/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 2249/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 256/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 17/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.017/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 849 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   53.179      1 Template:Infobox_play\n100.00%   53.179      1 -total\n 91.47%   48.643      1 Template:Infobox\n 14.43%    7.673      1 Template:Start_date\n  7.69%    4.088      1 Template:MONTHNAME\n  4.30%    2.285      1 Template:Template_other\n  3.88%    2.061      1 Template:MONTHNUMBER\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1420543-0!canonical and timestamp 20180917205939 and revision id 802032550\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Andre (play)","*":"Plays_by_William_Dunlap"},{"sortkey":"Andre (play)","*":"1798_plays"},{"sortkey":"Andre (play)","*":"Plays_based_on_actual_events"},{"sortkey":"Andre (play)","*":"American_Revolutionary_War"},{"sortkey":"Andre (play)","*":"Plays_set_in_New_York_(state)"},{"sortkey":"Andre (play)","*":"Tragedy_plays"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"American Revolutionary War"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Anna Seward"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Benedict Arnold"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cockade"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"French revolution"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"George Washington"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Honora Sneyd"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"John Andr\u00e9"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New York City"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Old American Company"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Park Theatre (Manhattan)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Patriot (American Revolution)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Populism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"William Dunlap"},{"ns":0,"*":"Monody on Major Andr\u00e9"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox play"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Start date"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:MONTHNAME"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:MONTHNUMBER"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Italic title"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Template other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Infobox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Navbar"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:InfoboxImage"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://John-W-Kennedy.name/Andre"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Andr\u00e9_(play)","byteoffset":2987,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"<i>Andr\u00e9</i> (play)","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"displaytitle","*":"<i>Andr\u00e9</i> (play)"},{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Andre (play)"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4759804"}]}}
