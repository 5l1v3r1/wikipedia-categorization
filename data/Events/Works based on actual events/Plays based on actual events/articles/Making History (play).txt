Making History is a play written by Irish playwright Brian Friel in 1988, premiered at the Guildhall, Derry on 20 September 1988.  It focuses on the real-life plight of Aodh Mór Ó Néill, Earl of Tyrone, who led an Irish and Spanish alliance against the English in an attempt to drive them out of Ireland. The play is set before and after the Battle of Kinsale. The battle does not directly feature in the play, although it is central to the plot. The  play's other main theme is O'Neill's unexpected third marriage  to the much younger, English-born  Mabel Bagenal, daughter and sister of his most implacable enemies, which the play presents as a genuine though ill-fated love marriage.
