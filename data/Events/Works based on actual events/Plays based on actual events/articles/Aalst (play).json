Based on real-life events that took place in the town of <a href=\"/wiki/Aalst,_Belgium\" title=\"Aalst, Belgium\">Aalst</a> in 1999, the play recounts the murder of two children by their parents. It was originally performed in 2005 by the <a href=\"/wiki/Ghent\" title=\"Ghent\">Ghent</a>-based theatre company <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_(theatre_company)\" title=\"Victoria (theatre company)\">Victoria</a>.

They killed the daughter by suffocating her with a <a href=\"/wiki/Pillow\" title=\"Pillow\">pillow</a>, and the son by stabbing him with a pair of <a href=\"/wiki/Scissors\" title=\"Scissors\">scissors</a>. They were subsequently arrested, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. The case caused a sensation in Belgium and was the subject of massive coverage in the press and media.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_play\">The play</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aalst_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The play\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2005, Pol Heyvaert, a veteran stage designer who had a long-standing relationship with the <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_(theatre_company)\" title=\"Victoria (theatre company)\">Victoria</a> theatre company, gave the story dramatic form. Heyvaert and his co-writer <a href=\"/wiki/Dimitri_Verhulst\" title=\"Dimitri Verhulst\">Dimitri Verhulst</a> drew extensively on original source material, including statements and interviews given by the accused, <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> footage of the trial and a <a href=\"/wiki/Documentary_film\" title=\"Documentary film\">documentary</a> on the murder investigation. Heyvaert also designed and directed the play, his first outing as a stage director. \n</p><p>The format of the play is simple. Separated by a few feet, the couple sit on two chairs with a microphone stand in front of each. A white curtain hangs behind them. The stage is bare of any other furnishing. Over the next 70-odd minutes, the two are interrogated by a disembodied, authoritative voice, and the story of their lives and that of the murder of the children pours forth. \n</p><p>It transpires that both parents had had horrific childhoods. The woman had been sexually abused by her father while the man had been raised in <a href=\"/wiki/Foster_care\" title=\"Foster care\">foster care</a> and had become a petty criminal at an early age. They are both unemployed and live off generous <a href=\"/wiki/State_benefits\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"State benefits\">state benefits</a>, supplemented by income from <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moonlighting\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wiktionary:moonlighting\">moonlighting</a>. Both exhibit a sense of entitlement and a lack of responsibility. They order consumer goods off catalogues, including three <a href=\"/wiki/Television_set\" title=\"Television set\">television sets</a> and five <a href=\"/wiki/Stereos\" title=\"Stereos\">stereos</a>, but never pay for these items. Their domestic arrangements are wanting as well. Their house is filthy and constantly in the dark, with the bulbs painted black. Their relationship too is abusive and codependent. The murder of the children is described at length and in detail. The parents excuse their actions by saying that they did not want their children to be taken away by the state and put into foster care, and that they did not want them to suffer in life as they themselves had done. At the very end of the play, doubt is thrown over the veracity of their testimony. \n</p><p>With its difficult subject-matter and frequently graphic detail, <i>Aalst</i> has been described as a 'disturbing' and 'complex' play, one that raises hard questions about individual morality and the <a href=\"/wiki/Welfare_state\" title=\"Welfare state\">welfare society</a>. \n</p><p>The play has been produced in theatres and festivals across Europe. The Scottish writer <a href=\"/wiki/Duncan_McLean_(writer)\" title=\"Duncan McLean (writer)\">Duncan McLean</a> has also adapted <i>Aalst</i> into a <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland\" title=\"Scotland\">Scottish</a> version. In March 2007, this version made its UK debut at the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tramway_theatre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Tramway theatre (page does not exist)\">Tramway theatre</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Glasgow\" title=\"Glasgow\">Glasgow</a> as a joint production of Victoria and the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Theatre_of_Scotland\" title=\"National Theatre of Scotland\">National Theatre of Scotland</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Kate_Dickie\" title=\"Kate Dickie\">Kate Dickie</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/David_McKay_(actor)\" title=\"David McKay (actor)\">David McKay</a> played the lead roles under Heyvaert's direction. The play then went on tour and made its <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a> debut in April 2007 at the <a href=\"/wiki/Soho_Theatre\" title=\"Soho Theatre\">Soho Theatre</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aalst_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/story/0,,2032538,00.html\">Guardian story</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2045188,00.html\">Guardian review</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/arts/2007/03/26/btaalst126.xml\">Telegraph review</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1689690.ece\">Times Review</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1332\nCached time: 20180907161349\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.016 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 39/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:10962721-0!canonical and timestamp 20180907161349 and revision id 833683985\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Belgian_plays"},{"sortkey":"","*":"2005_plays"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Plays_based_on_actual_events"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Plays_set_in_Belgium"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Plays_set_in_the_1990s"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Filicide_in_fiction"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Aalst,_Belgium"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Aalst, Belgium"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Belgian"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Canada"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"David McKay (actor)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dimitri Verhulst"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Documentary film"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Duncan McLean (writer)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Europe"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Foster care"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ghent"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Glasgow"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kate Dickie"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"London"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Theatre of Scotland"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pillow"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pol Heyvaert"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scissors"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scotland"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soho Theatre"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"State benefits"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Stereos"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Television"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Television set"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Victoria (theatre company)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Welfare state"},{"ns":0,"*":"Luc de Winne"},{"ns":0,"*":"Maggie Strobbe"},{"ns":0,"*":"Tramway theatre"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/story/0,,2032538,00.html","http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2045188,00.html","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/arts/2007/03/26/btaalst126.xml","http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1689690.ece"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The background","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Aalst_(play)","byteoffset":420,"anchor":"The_background"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The play","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Aalst_(play)","byteoffset":938,"anchor":"The_play"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Aalst_(play)","byteoffset":3742,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Aalst (play)","iwlinks":[{"prefix":"wiktionary","url":"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moonlighting","*":"wiktionary:moonlighting"}],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4661406"}]}}
