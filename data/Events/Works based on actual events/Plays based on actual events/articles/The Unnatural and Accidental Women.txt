The Unnatural and Accidental Women is a play by Metis playwright Marie Clements about the disappearance of multiple Indigenous women  from the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver whose deaths of extremely high blood-alcohol levels were all caused by one man, Gilbert Paul Jordan. In an attempt to reclaim the lives and importance of the victims, which was largely ignored by press coverage of the Jordan case, Clements' play is a surrealist exploration that jumps around in time to show the women in the final days before their deaths. Through the figure of the daughter of one of the victims, who is searching for answers to her mother's disappearance, the women are brought back to life and talk about their hopes, desires, and challenges as residents of "Skid Row" in Vancouver.  The Unnatural and Accidental Women premiered on November 2, 2000, and ran until November 25 at the Firehall Arts Centre in Vancouver.  Produced by Native Earth Performing Arts at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre from November 18 to December 5, 2004.
