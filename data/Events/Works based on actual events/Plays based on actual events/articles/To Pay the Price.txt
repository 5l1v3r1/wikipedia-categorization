To Pay the Price is a 2009 play by Peter-Adrian Cohen based in part on the letters of Israeli hero Yonatan Netanyahu, who was killed in action during Operation Entebbe at Entebbe airport, by Ugandan soldiers, when the Israeli military rescued hostages after an aircraft hijacking by Palestinian terrorists.  Netanyahu was the leader of the assault, and the only Israeli military fatality of the raid. The play, produced by North Carolina's Theatre Or   opened off-off Broadway in New York in June 2009 during the Festival of Jewish Theater and Ideas.'   In addition to Netanyahu's letters, the playwright drew on interviews he conducted with Netanyahu's friends and family.   The play had been scheduled to run at the New Repertory Theatre company near Boston, Massachusetts.  The run was canceled by the Netanyahu family because the theater was intending to run the play as a companion piece to My Name is Rachel Corrie.
