 One Flea Spare, by Naomi Wallace, is an award-winning play set in plague-ravaged 17th Century London. A wealthy couple is preparing to flee their home when a mysterious sailor and a young girl appear sneaking into their boarded up house. Now, quarantined together for 28 days, the only thing these strangers fear more than the Plague is each other. Definitions of morality are up for grabs and survival takes many forms in this dark, fiercely intense & humorous play.  The play deals with the clash of cultural, social, and sexual boundaries. The play is published by Broadway Play Publishing Inc. The title is derived from the poem The Flea by John Donne.
