A record fair is an event where individuals can buy, sell, and/or trade recorded music, which is generally in the form of vinyl records. Most record fairs are open to anyone, but they are of special interest to individuals (such as record collectors, disc jockeys, and record producers) who are looking for recordings that are rare, out-of-print, difficult to find, or produced in limited numbers.
