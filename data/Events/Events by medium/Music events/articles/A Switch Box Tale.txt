A Switch Box Tale is a part of the Danish activities for the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and aims to examine and show how online media can facilitate musical exchange and expression. The project lets five Danish artists work with musical partners with roots in Guadalupe, Algeria, France and Mali. Each constellation creates two tracks by means of long-distance dialogue in cyberspace. After two days of rehearsal the tracks are performed live at SPOT Festival (June 5, 2008, in Aarhus) and STRØM Festival (August 14, 2008, in Copenhagen).  A Switch Box Tale is carried out by ROSA - The Danish Rock Council in collaboration with Cirius – a part of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark. Pharfar & Cali P. DJ, producer and singer Pharfar from the Copenhagen reggae scene (Bikstok Røgsystem, Djosos Krost, etc.) has invited Swiss Cali P., who has his roots in Guadeloupe. Brought up in the Rastafari tradition, Cali P is a drummer, MC and reggae star both in his home country and abroad. Donna Cadogan & Malik Adouane Danish Donna Cadogan is an experienced and versatile singer on the Danish pop/rock/soul stage, who will here take on Algerian-born, French resident Malik Adouane, who brings his entire music tradition to SPOT – not least rai. A household name on clubs around the world. As In RebekkaMaria & Tez In the course of this last year RebekkaMaria has made the transition from indie rock singer to artful electro pop princess. With the French human beat boxer Tez she has a partner who attracts international attention with his body language – and justly so.  Varano/Moussa Diallo & Mama Draba For this project the Danish electronica star Morten Varano has teamed up with bassist Moussa Diallo, who grew up in Mali but now lives in Denmark, to work with Mamba Draba with the clear and sonorous voice. Residing in Paris, Draba belongs to one of the biggest griots of Mali right now.
