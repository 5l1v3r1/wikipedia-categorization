 Carla Marangoni, better known as Clara Marangoni (13 November 1915 â€“ 18 January 2018), was an Italian gymnast who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics. She was born in Pavia as "Carla," but she is usually (mistakenly) mentioned in the official statistics as Clara. In 1928, she won the silver medal as member of the Italian gymnastics team and was therefore among the first Italian women to win an Olympic medal.  She was also the last surviving athlete from 1928 Summer Games.   Marangoni died on 18 January 2018 at the age of 102 years.
