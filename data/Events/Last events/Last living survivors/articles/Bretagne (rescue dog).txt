Bretagne (c. September 1999 – June 7, 2016 ) was a Golden Retriever rescue dog who searched for survivors at Ground Zero after the September 11 attacks.   It was the first assignment for her and her owner and trainer, Denise Corliss.  She appeared on the Today Show along with  NBC News’ Tom Brokaw.  She later participated in rescue efforts after Hurricanes Katrina and Ivan.   She was retired at the age of 9. After her retirement, she continued her community service as a reading dog at a local elementary school. First grade students who were shy about reading aloud were more willing when Bretagne was there lending a friendly listening ear.  She is believed to have been the last surviving dog from the attacks when she was euthanized in Texas in 2016; she was 16 years old and suffering from kidney failure.
