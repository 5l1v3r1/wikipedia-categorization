Ángela Loij (died 28 May 1974) was the last surviving full-blooded Ona native woman of Tierra del Fuego.  The Ona were decimated by loss of habitat, European diseases and the Selk'nam genocide. She was studied by anthropologist Anne Chapman.  Loij was born at Sara, north of the Río Grande, where her father worked as shepherd.
