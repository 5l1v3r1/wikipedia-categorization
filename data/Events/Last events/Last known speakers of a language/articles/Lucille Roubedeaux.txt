Lucille Roubedeaux (died 2005)   was the final surviving native speaker of the Osage language of Oklahoma. A program had been initiated to revive the language before the death of the last speaker, but to not much avail: "This is the last train out. If we can't get it done this time around, then that's it. There is no more after this. That's it," said "Uncle Mogre" of the Osage who had been working to preserve the language.  At the time of Mrs. Roubedeaux's death, the Osage language had been dwindling for nearly 200 years.
