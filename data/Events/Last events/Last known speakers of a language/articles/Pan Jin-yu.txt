Pan Jin-yu (Chinese: 潘金玉, 21 July 1914 – 24 October 2010) was the last remaining speaker of the Pazeh language of Taiwan. She was born the fifth of six children in 1914 to Kaxabu parents in Puli. Later, she was adopted by parents who were Pazeh speakers living in Auran village (Taiwanese: Ailan), which is now part of Puli township.  She was said to be fully fluent in the language, despite being the only remaining speaker.  However, Taiwanese Hokkien was the living language she spoke generally. She taught Pazeh classes to about 200 regular students in Puli and there were also classes with fewer students in Miaoli and Taichung.
