Sesostrie Youchigant, also known as Sam Young (born c.â€‰1870;  died December 6, 1948),  was a chief of the Tunica-Biloxi tribe and the last known native speaker of the Tunica language.   He worked with linguist Mary Haas in 1933 (and during four subsequent visits between 1933 and 1938) to describe what he remembered of the language, which he had learned as a child.  Haas's 1935 doctoral dissertation, A Grammar of the Tunica Language, was a result of this collaboration.  Haas's Tunica Texts (1950) and much of Tunica Dictionary (1953) are also based on her work with Youchigant.
