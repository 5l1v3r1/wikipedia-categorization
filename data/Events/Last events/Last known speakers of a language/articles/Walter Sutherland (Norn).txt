Walter Sutherland (died c. 1850) of Skaw, on the island of Unst in Shetland, was reported to be the last native speaker of Norn, a North Germanic language which had once been spoken throughout Shetland, Orkney and Caithness.   He lived in the northernmost house in the British Isles, near the present-day Unst Boat Haven.  Sutherland may, however, have been merely the last native speaker of Norn on Unst. Some unnamed Norn-speakers of the island of Foula were reported by Jakob Jakobsen to have survived much later[when?] than the middle of the 19th century.
