An escape chair or evacuation chair is a device manufactured for the smooth descent of stairways in the event of an emergency. The Evac Chair was invented in the United States in 1982.  The single-user operation device does not require heavy lifting to evacuate a person. The original Escape-Chair, with various models for various situations, addresses the need for an evacuation solution in case there is an emergency, and egress out of a structure or vessel becomes imperative. The table below is based on the Escape-Chair Standard and the Comfort model for comparison. These are based on an Evac Chair 300h Mk4 And an IBEX Transeat Enhanced models can have chairs that require two-person operation; however, these are more commonly used in ambulances. Lifting handles are used for descent and ascent of stairs. Caterpillar tracks are also used on the stairs. The DDA ACT  says that every person is to have a safe entrance into and egress from a building. Another law regarding chairs is the RRFSO.  Created in 2005, this regulation states that fire officers are not required to enter buildings. Failure to follow the above laws can result in serious issues. If a person was to perish in the building due to a lack of adequate evacuation equipment, the owners or operators of the building could be charged with Corporate manslaughter.
