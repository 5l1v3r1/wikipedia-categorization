On the sea theater, Russian naval forces, unlike Japan, had no aircraft carriers and battleships. However, the chances of those vessels appearing in the Gulf of Korea or the Japan Sea were low, since Russian air domination was complete.\n</p><p>On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Army began the <a href=\"/wiki/Sungari_Offensive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sungari Offensive\">Sungari Offensive</a>.

On the same day, Japanese <a href=\"/wiki/Garrison\" title=\"Garrison\">garrisons</a> in Port Arthur and Dairen laid down their arms, and the Russian Pacific navy hoisted the Soviet naval ensign over Port Arthur fortress.\n</p><p>It was the Pacific Fleet's aviation group that opened hostilities by delivering heavy strikes against the Japanese-controlled Korean ports of <a href=\"/wiki/Unggi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unggi\">Yuki</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Najin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Najin\">Rashin</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Chongjin\" title=\"Chongjin\">Seishin</a>, which served as the Japanese naval bases in <a href=\"/wiki/North_Korea\" title=\"North Korea\">North Korea</a>.

The sea and air attacks seriously weakened the defenses of the three cities, causing the Japanese to lose as many as twenty transports and other vessels.\n</p><p>The purpose of the Seishin landing operation, achieved during the first days of the war, was to capture the Japanese naval base in order to deprive the enemy of the ability to transport reinforcements, equipment, and ammunition from Japan, and also to prevent the evacuation of troops and equipment to Japan proper. Seishin was a fortified district with 4,000 officers and men, protected from the sea by coastal artillery. The Pacific Fleet's intention was to make a sudden landing to capture the port's moorage line and reconnoiter enemy forces. It was planned to subsequently land the main forces, occupy the city and hold it until the arrival of the 25th Soviet Army's troops advancing along the coastline.\n</p><p>The main landing force included the 355th Separate Marine Battalion under Major <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M._Barabolko&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"M.

As the vanguard of this landing party advanced along the streets of Seishin, Japanese resistance became fiercer. The sailors advanced slowly while engaged with the enemy in hand-to-hand fighting. On the morning of August 14, fighters of the first echelon landed in Seishin, with the second echelon landing on August 15. There was no need to land the third echelon, since the six thousand sailors who had already entered Seishin were sufficient to capture the city. By the afternoon of August 16, the sailors, cooperating with the 393rd Infantry Division of the 25th Soviet Army, had captured the city.\n</p><p>The success of the landing was largely possible thanks to the effective support provided by warships and naval aviation. The destroyer <i>Voikov</i>, the minelayer <i>Argun</i> and other warships opened fire against the enemy sixty-five times.

Hundreds of Soviet officers and men were awarded orders and medals.\n</p><p>After taking Seishin, Pacific Fleet sailors under the command of Studenchikov captured two more major strongholds: the ports of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Odetsin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Odetsin (page does not exist)\">Odetsin</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Genzan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Genzan\">Genzan</a>, where 6,238 Japanese officers and men were taken prisoner.\n</p><p>One particular case as the action sustained by Japanese against Soviets in Kotou Fortress, as part of Japanese Army Frontier <a href=\"/wiki/Fortified_district_(Japan)\" title=\"Fortified district (Japan)\">Fortified Districts</a>, located near Ussuri River in the Soviet-Manchurian border.

On the way, they witnessed Japanese military convoys fleeing south, in contrast to General Yamada's assurances that \"the Japanese army are gaining and destroyed many aircraft and enemy tanks\".
