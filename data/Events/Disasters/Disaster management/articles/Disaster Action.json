In the late 1980s, there were a number of serious incidents in which many lives were lost, such as the sinking of the <a href=\"/wiki/MV_Jupiter_(1961)\" title=\"MV Jupiter (1961)\">MV Jupiter (1961)</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hillsborough_Disaster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hillsborough Disaster\">Hillsborough</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Herald_of_Free_Enterprise\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Herald of Free Enterprise\">Herald of Free Enterprise</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lockerbie\" title=\"Lockerbie\">Lockerbie</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Marchioness_disaster\" title=\"Marchioness disaster\">Marchioness</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Piper_Alpha\" title=\"Piper Alpha\">Piper Alpha</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/UTA_Flight_772\" title=\"UTA Flight 772\">UTA Flight 772</a>. One individual from the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Herald_Families_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Herald Families Association (page does not exist)\">Herald Families Association</a> began to realise that the issues the Herald families were experiencing would almost certainly be encountered by others in similar disasters.  <a href=\"/wiki/Maurice_de_Rohan\" title=\"Maurice de Rohan\">Maurice de Rohan</a> therefore gathered together a group of people in circumstances that paralleled his, and so the charity Disaster Action was set up. By 2014, members had personal experience of 29 disasters, including rail, air and maritime as well as natural disasters and terrorist attacks in the UK and overseas.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Purpose_and_Objectives\">Purpose and Objectives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Disaster_Action&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Purpose and Objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The charity was founded on the principles of accountability, support and prevention and to represent the interests of those on the receiving end of disaster. Its founding objectives were to:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Offer support to those directly affected by major trauma</li>\n<li>Raise awareness of the needs of survivors and the bereaved in the short- and longer-term aftermath</li>\n<li>Help create a safety climate in which disasters  are less likely to occur</li></ul>\n<p>Rather than functioning as a frontline responder following a disaster, Disaster Action acted primarily as an advisory and advocacy service to central government, local authorities, the statutory services, voluntary bodies and commercial companies, such as railway operators and airlines, about the human aspects of planning and responding to disasters and emergencies.\n</p><p>An important aspect of Disaster Action's foundation also lay in supporting and guiding survivors and bereaved affected by disasters. Information is among the greatest needs of those directly affected by disaster and so Disaster Action members drew on their personal and collective experience to develop a series of leaflets, which are available free and online for those who are bereaved and survivors (see When Disaster Strikes at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.disasteraction.org.uk/when_disaster_strikes/\">http://www.disasteraction.org.uk/when_disaster_strikes/</a>).\n</p><p>The website also includes extensive resources for emergency planners, responders, the media and academics (see Guidance for Responders at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.disasteraction.org.uk/guidance_for_responders/\">http://www.disasteraction.org.uk/guidance_for_responders/</a> and Guidance for the Media at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.disasteraction.org.uk/guidance_for_the_media/\">http://www.disasteraction.org.uk/guidance_for_the_media/</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development\">Development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Disaster_Action&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The organisation evolved and developed through the years, while adhering to its founding principles. One significant thread was the introduction of legislation to provide for remedies against <a href=\"/wiki/Corporate_manslaughter\" title=\"Corporate manslaughter\">Corporate manslaughter</a>, which culminated with a new law coming into force on <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1_April_2008&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"1 April 2008 (page does not exist)\">1 April 2008</a>.\n</p><p>Another was to draw together and learn from the collective experience of its members and offer information, guidance and support to others affected in future disasters; this culminated in the series of leaflets, which are available online.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_strands\">Other strands</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Disaster_Action&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Other strands\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A third strand was to act as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lay-advisors&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lay-advisors (page does not exist)\">lay-advisors</a> to central government departments and others to remind them of their ongoing responsibilities when disasters happen.\n</p><p>A fourth strand was to offer presentations based on members' experience. The charity generated some income through charging fees for the presentations by members on training courses for the police, local authorities and private companies.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Funding_and_Status\">Funding and Status</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Disaster_Action&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Funding and Status\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust funded much of the organisation's work on corporate responsibility as well as offering core funding for five years from 2003. The Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and then the Golden Bottle/Bulldog trusts also gave grants for core funding. Disaster Action cherished its independence, not receiving funding from sources that might have created a conflict of interest with its work in supporting survivors and the bereaved.\n</p><p>In 2015 the decision was taken to no longer to offer a proactive response to major emergencies or offer presentations. However, some former members continue to speak, give presentations and work within the field of disaster management in their own right, and the extensive resources, including access to the Charity\u2019s key publications, remain available through the website: www.disasteraction.org.uk.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Further_Reading.2C_Publications_and_Key_Achievements\"></span><span
