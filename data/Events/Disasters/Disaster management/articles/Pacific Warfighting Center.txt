The Pacific Warfighting Center (PWC) is located on Ford Island in Honolulu, Hawaii within the Ford Island Historic Management Zone / Aviation Facilities Sub-Area, part of the Pearl Harbor National Historic Landmark.   The Pacific Warfighting Center is primarily used to direct forces during disaster relief efforts as needed within the USPACOM.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held August 29, 2007.   Speakers at the event included U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye  and Navy Admiral Timothy J. Keating, commander of USPACOM.  During the ground breaking ceremony, which took place at the site of Hanger 38, which was destroyed during the attack on Pearl Harbor,  U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye stated, "If you're prepared for war, countries that may be thinking about doing mischief have second thoughts, so to prevent war, be ready."  The two-story building is 34,300 square feet. The center replaced the previous 7,000 square foot simulation center that was located on Camp H.M. Smith and housed in a 60 year old former hospital.  The facility provides space for joint/combined force commanders and staff for live, virtual, or network real-life scenarios.   The facility includes a theater, video-teleconferencing center, computer room, administration offices and warehouse spacing.   The facility is equipped with the infrastructure needed to train and prepare forces for managing crisis situations through the USPACOM AOR. The PWC Supports USPACOM Joint Exercise Program:  USPACOM partners utilize the PWC to direct forces during disaster relief and war efforts.   During the opening ceremony of the Pacific Warfighting Center, Navy Adm. Robert F. Willard, told an audience that the facility helped with disaster relief efforts for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  All Partners Access Network (APAN) is headquartered out of the PWC.  APAN assisted in the 2010 Haiti earthquake disaster efforts in the coordination and communication of relief efforts.
