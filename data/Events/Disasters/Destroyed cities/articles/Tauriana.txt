Tauriana or Taureana (Taurianum in Latin, Ταυρανία in Greek) is an ancient city of the Bruttii which was located in the southern part of Calabria, in present Taurianova, Reggio Calabria province. Its ruins were located in the territory of Palmi. The city's name derives from the Italic peoples who founded it, the Tauriani.

The crypt where his remains were buried, below the 'Temple' of Santo Fantino, is the oldest Catholic place of worship in the region.
