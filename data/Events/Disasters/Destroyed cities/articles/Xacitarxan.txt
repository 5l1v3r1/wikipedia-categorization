The first mention of the town was recorded in 1333. In the 13th and 14th centuries it was one of the main trade and political centres of the Golden Horde. In 1395 the city was sacked by Timur. Astrakhan was rebuilt afterwards and became the capital of the Khanate of Astrakhan in 1459. In 1547 the city was seized by the Crimean khan Sahib Giray. In 1556 Astrakhan was besieged and burned  by Ivan the Terrible.
