The 2006 Copiapó mining accident occurred on January 20, 2006, when an explosion occurred in the underground Carola-Agustina copper mine in Copiapó, Chile after two trucks collided, covering the only escape route for the miners inside the mine.   The explosion caused two deaths and two injuries. 70 miners were trapped.  Shortly after the explosion occurred, workers at the nearby mine, "Punta de Cobre", began digging a tunnel towards the Carola-Agustina mine to assist in rescuing the trapped miners.  Rescue efforts lasted seven hours, and the trapped miners were rescued alive.
