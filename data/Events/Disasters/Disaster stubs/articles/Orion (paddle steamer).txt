  Orion was a G & J Burns paddle steamer, built by Caird & Co in 1847, which sank off Portpatrick Lighthouse,  Wigtownshire, Scotland, in June 1850 on its way from Liverpool to Glasgow, with the loss of 50 lives. The captain was found guilty of  the "culpable bereavement of the lives of the passengers" and was imprisoned for 18 months. The 2nd mate was transported.  The eminent surgeon John Burns was one of the passengers killed in the accident. The incident was recorded in the 1851 book The wreck of the Orion, a Tribute of Gratitude by Reverend Joseph Clarke who was one of the survivors.
