Lax Ksiluux is the name of a former First Nations community in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. It existed on the south side of the Nass River near a creek known as Ts'oohl Ts'ap.  Lax Ksiluux was in existence prior to the eruption of Tseax Cone in the 18th century which buried the community with thick lava flows along with the nearby community of Wii Lax K'abit.
