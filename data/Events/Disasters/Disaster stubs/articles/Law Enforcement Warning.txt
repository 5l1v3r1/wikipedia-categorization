Law Enforcement Warning (SAME code: LEW) is a warning issued through the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in the United States to warn the public of criminal events that pose a threat to public safety. These include jailbreaks, riots, and bomb explosions. An authorized law enforcement agency may blockade roads, waterways, or facilities, evacuate or deny access to affected areas, and arrest violators or suspicious persons.  The warning is usually issued by a law enforcement agency and is relayed by the National Weather Service.
