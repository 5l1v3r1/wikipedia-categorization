Local area emergency (SAME code: LAE) is an advisory issued by local authorities through the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in the United States to notify the public of an event that does not pose a significant threat to public safety and/or property by itself, but could escalate, contribute to other more serious events, or disrupt critical public safety services. Instructions, other than public protective actions, may be provided. Examples include: a disruption in water, electric or natural gas service, road closures due to excessive snowfall, or a potential terrorist threat where the public is asked to remain alert.    This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Government document  "Non-weather Related Emergency Message Description Guidelines".
