The Chasnala mining disaster was a disaster that happened on 27 December 1975 in a coal mine in Chasnala near Dhanbad in the Indian state of Jharkhand. An explosion in the mine followed by flooding killed 372 miners.  When a roof of coal caved in, 7 million imperial gallons (32,000 m3) of water per minute flooded into the mine.  The miners were trapped under a mountain of debris and drowned when the water surged into the mine. The Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), which owned the mine, said it conformed to international standards.  The film Kaala Patthar depicts the tragedy.   Shaheed Smarak was  built in the  memory of the victims.
