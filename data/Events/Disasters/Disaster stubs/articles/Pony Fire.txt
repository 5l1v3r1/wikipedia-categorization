The Pony Fire was a lightning caused wildfire in Happy Camp, Siskiyou County, California.  On June 8, a lightning storm passed through the Klamath National Forest igniting multiple small fires.  One of the strikes, near Pony Peak, quickly grew to over 150 acres (0.61Â km2) and became the Pony Fire. Efforts to extinguish the fire were hampered by steep terrain and difficult conditions.
