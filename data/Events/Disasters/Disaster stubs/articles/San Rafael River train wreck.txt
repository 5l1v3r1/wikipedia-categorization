The San Rafael River train disaster occurred on August 10, 1989, when the Rio Bamoa Bridge collapsed under an 11-car train operated by Ferrocarriles Nacionales de MÃ©xico and traveling from Mazatlan to Mexicali. Several cars fell into the San Rafael River.  The bridge's supports had been damaged by heavy rains, causing them to fail. Of the approximately 330 people on the train, 112 perished, most by drowning, and 205 were injured.
