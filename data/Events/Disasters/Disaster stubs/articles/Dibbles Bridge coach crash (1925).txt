  The Dibble's Bridge coach crash was a fatal accident that occurred on 10 June 1925 on the B6265 road, at Dibble's Bridge, below Grimwith Reservoir 1.6 miles (2.6 km) east of Hebden, in the civil parish of Hartlington in Craven, North Yorkshire, England. Seven people were killed, and a number of others injured.  The accident occurred when a coach carrying a party of members of the York Municipal Guild and their families on an outing to Bolton Abbey from York suffered brake failure as it travelled down a 1:6 (9.5°) (16.67%) gradient from Fancarl Top to the bottom of the valley downstream of Grimwith reservoir. It gained considerable speed and failing to negotiate the sharp bend at the bottom crashed through the parapet of Dibble's Bridge, landing on its roof. Many of the passengers were pinned beneath the vehicle, five being killed instantly, whilst two others died within half an hour. A number of other passengers were injured.
