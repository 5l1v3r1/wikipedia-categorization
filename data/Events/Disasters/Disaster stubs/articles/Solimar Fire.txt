 The Solimar Fire was a wildfire that broke out Christmas Day in Solimar Beach just north of Ventura, California. The fire, which burned 1,388 acres (6 km2), was the last major fire of the 2015 California wildfire season.  The fire was first reported around 11p.m. on Christmas Day. Driving by strong winds, the fire grew to nearly 900 acres (3.6 km2) in a matter of hours.  As the fire jumped Highway 101 it forced motorist to make u-turns and drive the wrong way to escape the flames.
