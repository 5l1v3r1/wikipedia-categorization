Flooding in Niger in the summer and early autumn of 2016 killed at least 38 people and left more than 92,000 people displaced, according to estimates by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).     Initial estimates by the country's government in June put the death toll at 14.  The flooding was caused by heavy summer rains beginning sometime in June and lasting until at least August.   UNOCHA also stated that Niger was not the only country affected by flooding caused by El Ni√±o weather patterns, supported in part by humanitarian aid from numerous international donors.
