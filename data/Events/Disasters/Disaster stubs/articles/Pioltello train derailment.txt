 On 25 January 2018, a commuter train operated by Trenord derailed in Pioltello when two of its carriages came off the track en route to Milan. The incident left 3 women dead and more than 100 people injured of which 46 needed medical assistance in hospital. 5 of them were in critical condition.  At about 7:00 local time, a passenger train was travelling from Cremona to Milano Porta Garibaldi when two of the carriages derailed and came to a rest at an angle.  The accident occurred between the Pioltello-Limito station and the Segrate station. Train operator Trenord say that the train was travelling at normal speed when the derailment occurred. Witnesses say that the train trembled for a few moments just before the accident happened.  Italian police began an investigation into the possible cause of the accident and said that a problem with a track switch could be the reason why the derailment occurred.  A broken rail on a section of jointed track 2.3 kilometres (1.4Â mi) from the crash site was later identified as the cause of the derailment. That section of track was scheduled for replacement.
