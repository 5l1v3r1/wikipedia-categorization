The Young Fire was reported on August 7 at 5:45 pm in the Siskiyou Wilderness of the Six Rivers National Forest. It was primarily in the Gasquet Ranger District, fueled by timber and brush.   By August 20, the Young Fire had burned 1,200 acres (5 km2), with firefighters using a containment strategy for safety reasons, due to the remote location and difficult terrain. The fire burned around the south end of Twin Peaks and on the north end of Rocky Knob. Recreational areas were impacted at this time, with Doe Flat and Young's Valley Trailheads being closed.  By the morning of August 21, the fire had expanded into the Klamath National Forest. Trailhead closures remained in place, with additional closures of the Six River Forest Boundary.  The Young Fire grew to 1,950 acres (8 km2) by August 23.  By August 25, temporary flight restrictions were put in place due to the fire and all trails, roads and land near the fire was closed.   As of the morning of August 27, the fire had bumped into the scar from a 2015, which helped stop it from spreading.  As of August 28, the fire had grown due to west winds, with an additional 50 acres expected to be burned.
