At least 62 people died in a collision between a bus and oil tanker in Sindh, Pakistan. The bus carried 62 people inside and 10 on the top, most of them sleeping at the time of the collision.  Only traveling a small distance, the bus crashed in the outskirts of Karachi on a single track road that connects to the Super Highway. One of the factors was careless driving as the driver of the tanker, who eventually survived but fled the scene, was speeding on the wrong side of the road that suffered from poor conditions.  Immediately after the crash, a gas cylinder ignited, causing the bus to catch on fire. The heat melted some of the metal frame on the bus, causing rescuers to cut open the vehicle to obtain some of the bodies.
