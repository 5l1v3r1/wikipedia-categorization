  The Chatsbury/Bungonia bushfires of 1965 was a series of bushfires that burned from March 5 to March 14, 1965.  The fires destroyed the Southern Highlands, New South Wales villages of Tallong, Wingello, and most of the surrounding orchards.  The fire is thought to be ignited by a spark from a Chatsbury Station angle grinder.  It quickly spread and covered 620,000 acres and destroyed the areas' livestock.  It is thought to be the greatest disaster in the area.  Three people were killed. 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello.  The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near Nowra on the South Coast.
