Junta Investigadora de Accidentes de Aviación Civil (JIAAC "Investigative Board of Civil Aviation Accidents") was the civil aviation accident investigation agency of Venezuela. The JIAAC had its headquarters in Chacao, Caracas, Miranda State.  Before its closure, it was an organization under the Ministry of Transport and Communications.  It was originally the Comité de Investigación de Accidentes Aéreos (CIAA, "Aircraft Accidents Research Committee").  Previously the JIAAC was an independent authority of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing.  That Ministry was known as the Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Infraestructura (Ministry of Popular Power for Infrastructure) from January 2007 to March 2009, and was previously the Ministerio para la Infraestructura (Ministry for Infrastructure, Minfra).  Lorllys Ramos Acevedo was the final director of the JIAAC.  Now Venezuela has the Dirección General para la Prevención e Investigación de Accidentes Aeronáuticos, under the Ministry of Aquatic and Air Transport.
