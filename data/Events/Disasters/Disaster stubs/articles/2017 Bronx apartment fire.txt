 On December 28, 2017, a five-alarm fire broke out in a five-story apartment building in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. It killed twelve people and injured six, four of them critically. Three children were among the dead.  Excluding the September 11 attacks, the fire was the deadliest in the city since the 1990 Happy Land fire, which killed 87 people, also in the Bronx.  In 2007, a similar incident at another home in the Bronx killed 10 people, including 9 children, after a space heater caught fire.  The fire started at about 6:51 p.m. EST on the building's ground floor and was extinguished just before 10 p.m. EST.  It spread quickly through the 25-unit apartment building, which was built in 1916 and had not been fireproofed.   Heavy winds contributed to the growth of the fire, and also brought the wind chill that night to below zero, with temperatures already in the teens.  The fire climbed upwards through the building's stairwell, blocking attempts by some residents to evacuate, though many others descended to street level through the building's exterior fire escape.  The inferno was under control after about three hours, with over 160 firefighters responding to the emergency.  The city's fire commissioner Daniel Nigro later stated that the fire had been started by a three-year-old who had been playing with a gas kitchen stove while unsupervised.   As the boy and his mother were fleeing their basement apartment, they left their door open, allowing the fire to spread up the stairwell to other units in the building.  The design of the building did not appear to be related to the spread of the fire. However, the building reportedly also had six unresolved violations of fire regulations, including a broken smoke detector on the ground floor.
