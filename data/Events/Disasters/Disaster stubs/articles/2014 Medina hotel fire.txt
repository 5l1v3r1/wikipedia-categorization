Around seven hundred pilgrims from different countries were staying at the hotel in Medina to perform the Umrah. An electrical short circuit caused a fire to break out in the hotel.

Fifteen Egyptian pilgrims were killed and one hundred and thirty other pilgrims were injured as a result of the fire.
