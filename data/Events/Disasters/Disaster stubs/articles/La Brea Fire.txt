The La Brea Fire was a 2009 wildfire which occurred in Southern California in the United States. The fire began near La Brea Creek in Santa Barbara County, in the Los Padres National Forest.  The fire burned 89,489 acres (140 sq mi; 362 km2) of chaparral between August 8 and August 22, 2009, but only destroyed two structures—a cabin and an unused ranger station.  The huge Zaca Fire burned in the same region in 2007, and some of the same fire lines were used to contain the La Brea Fire.  A propane stove at an illegal marijuana plantation inside the National Forest is believed to have ignited the fire. The plantation held approximately 30,000 marijuana plants, worth an estimated US$90 million. Prior to the blaze, seventeen other plantations hidden in the forest had been discovered by authorities, who destroyed more than 225,000 plants worth over US$675 million. No suspects were captured at the site, but investigators did find an AK-47 assault rifle, and warned the public that the suspects could be armed and dangerous.
