The Payatas landslide was a garbage dump collapse at Payatas, Quezon City, Philippines, on July 10, 2000, that officially killed 218 people and left thousands of people homeless. A large pile of garbage first collapsed and then went up in flames which resulted in the destruction of about 100 squatters' houses.
