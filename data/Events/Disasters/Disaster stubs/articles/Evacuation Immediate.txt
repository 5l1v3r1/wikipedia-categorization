Evacuation Immediate (SAME code: EVI) is a warning issued through the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in the United States to notify the public of a mandatory evacuation due to a wildfire, approaching hurricane, or an imminent explosion due to a gas leak. It is typically issued by a local or state authority and is relayed by the National Weather Service. The warning can replace a Civil Emergency Message, Fire Warning, or other warnings when required. Weather radio receivers, EAS Equipment boxes, and TV scrolls will display EVI alerts as Immediate Evacuation, and any text-to-speech voices from the EAS boxes will read the alert as "Immediate Evacuation" rather than "Evacuation Immediate"  .
