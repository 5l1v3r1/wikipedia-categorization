Civil Danger Warning (SAME code: CDW) is a warning issued by authorized public officials in the United States and is relayed by the National Weather Service for an event that presents a danger to a significant civilian population. The warning, which usually warns of a specific hazard and gives specific protective action, has a higher priority than the Local Area Emergency (LAE). Examples include contaminated water supply, major accidents, and imminent or in-progress military or terrorist attack. Public protective actions could include evacuation, shelter in place, or other actions.  Related warnings such as an Immediate Evacuation (EVI) or Shelter in Place Warning (SPW) may follow.   On January 13, 2018, a civil danger warning was issued for the entire State of Hawaii notifying the public of an “incoming ballistic missile attack” due to human error of an emergency management official. 38 minutes later, it was deemed a false alarm.  This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Government document  "Non-Weather Related Emergency Message Description Guidelines".
