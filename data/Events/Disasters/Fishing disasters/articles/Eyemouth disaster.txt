  Coordinates: 55°52′12″N 2°05′28″W﻿ / ﻿55.870°N 2.091°W﻿ / 55.870; -2.091 The Eyemouth disaster was a severe European windstorm that struck the south-eastern coast of Scotland, United Kingdom, specifically Berwickshire, on 14 October 1881. One hundred and eighty-nine fishermen, most of whom were from the village of Eyemouth, were drowned. Many citizens of Eyemouth call the day Black Friday. Some boats that had not capsized were wrecked on the Hurkar Rocks. Many houses were also destroyed. Two days later, the Ariel Gazelle turned up in Eyemouth, having braved the storm instead of fleeing.  A donation-led relief fund was established to provide financial security to families who had lost members to the storm. The response was significant, bringing in over £50,000 (£4,550,000 in 2015).   The disaster was the subject of a contemporary oil on canvas painting by Scottish artist J. Michael Brown
