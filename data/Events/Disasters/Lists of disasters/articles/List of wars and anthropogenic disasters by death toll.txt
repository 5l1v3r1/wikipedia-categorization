This is a list of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll. It covers the name of the event, the location, and the start and end of each event. Some events may belong in more than one category. In addition, some of the listed events overlap each other, and in some cases the death toll from a smaller event is included in the one for the larger event or time period of which it was part. These figures of one million or more deaths include the deaths of civilians from diseases, famine, etc., as well as deaths of soldiers in battle and massacres and genocide. Where only one estimate is available, it appears in both the low and high estimates. Iraq claims: 105,000 KIA + 50,000 in Kurdish Genocide Others claim 600,000 Iranians killed and 500,000 Iraqis These are events that entail the intentional mass murder of individuals on the basis of ethnicity, religion, or race, or death caused by the forced eviction of individuals on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity. a small amount of people also killed by human experiments inside unit 731   Japan's reasons for this was an enslavement policy towards the subjugated peoples and a belief in the superior Japanese race and a strong belief in superior Japanese values and in State Shinto. Not genocide but nonetheless extreme religious persecution of Chinese and Korean civilians in aggressive wars. Not organized in the same effective way as the holocaust. But more people inside the army took part in the atrocities committed like two Japanese soldiers that had a competition about who could murder the most Chinese civilians and described as heroes inside Japanese pappers.  Also, the intention was not to kill the Chinese people but rather enslave it.  While Imperial Japan killed more people in an aggressive war 17,000,000– 22,000,000. Most dead were by bombings and indirect consequences by Japanese warfare.  However this note only count massacres against civilians by the Japanese military and crimes against humanity.   Part of the Soviet famine of 1932–33         Some scholars dispute that the famine was deliberately engineered by the Soviet government or that it was a genocide.    Includes the Burundian genocides. Regarded as the most efficient genocide of the 20th century, the Rwandan genocide was the disorganized communal mass murder of Tutsis, by their rival tribe the Hutu through the Rwandan government and Hutu Power militias such as the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi.  Violence peaked in the hundred days between April 7, 1994 and July 15, 1994, during which time between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed.  39,193Siege of Fort Pitt victims.(U.S. only) 3,201Canadian residential school victims      7006129939300000000♠1,299,393Thousands to millions more in forced labor and unnumbered wars and massacres in Latin America.

Another term used to refer to these types of killing is politicide. This list is incomplete; please help by adding to it. See also Red Terror (disambiguation), White Terror, and Politicide.  See: Struggle session Death Toll Sources:      See Suppression of Freemasonry. This table includes deaths caused by the poor labor conditions of the systems, executions for not performing the labor satisfactorily, and killing from trying to accumulate the work force. Forced labour was used in the construction of the Burma Railway. More than 180,000 Southeast Asian civilian labourers (Romusha) and 60,000 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) worked on the railway. Of these, estimates of Romusha deaths are little more than guesses, but probably about 90,000 died. 12,621 Allied POWs died during the construction. The dead POWs included 6,904 British personnel, 2,802 Australians, 2,782 Dutch, and 133 Americans.  Massacres and unnatural deaths that occurred during wars and were committed or caused by military or quasi-military forces (including terrorism, insurgent forces, and inter-communal violence). They may not particularly target ethnic, religious, or political groups but are usually part of a military strategy that disregards civilian lives, or they may be arbitrary acts of cruelty. Please try to only include events in which the majority of victims were civilians or which are often referred to as atrocities by significant mainstream scholarship. (Holocaust, Japanese war crimes, Soviet Oppression such as Gulags and Population transfer in the Soviet Union, and Terror bombing)    La Violencia was a ten-year period of civil war and violence in Colombia from 1948–58, between the Colombian Conservative Party and the Colombian Liberal Party, fought mainly in the rural countryside.Death toll may include non-civilian victims.    See: Death toll of the Nanking Massacre. See Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War   This chart includes regimes, empires, etc. The low end is the sum of the low end of the following figures excluding the second post war famine as it's debated as to if the War or the Soviet government was more to blame, while the high end includes the high end of said famine along with the high end of the other events. Famine: 1.8  to 4.8 million  Ukraine 0.6 to 2.3  million Kazakhstan 2 million  North Caucasus and elsewhere 1 to 1.5 million Soviet famine of 1946-47 Gulags: 1,053,829 to 6,000,000 Great Purge: 681,692 to 1,704,230 Population transfers: 1 to 1.5 million War crimes: Occupation of Poland: 150,000 to 500,000 German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union: 600,000 to 1 million Rape during the occupation of Germany: 240,000 Siege of Budapest: 38,000 Forced labor of Hungarians in the Soviet Union: 200,000 Battle of Berlin: 125,000 NKVD prisoner massacres: 100,000 Shooting of deserters: 185,000 Only 20,000 Marsh Arabs were left in the region after the draining, though it is unknown whether this was caused by famine or migration.   The minimum estimate is the minimum estimate of civilians killed by Saddam during Iran-Iraq War, uprising and genocide of Kurds combined. The maximum estimate is the maximum total of the aforementioned, combined with the maximum demographic decline of Mesopotamian Marshes.  Note: Some of these famines diseases were partially caused by nature. This section includes famines, and disease that were caused or exacerbated by human action. The Russian Famine of 1921 as well as the Soviet famine of 1946–47 may have been exacerbated by War Communism policies, but it is debatable to which extent. 1.8 - 4.8 million Ukraine 600,000 - 2.3 million Kazakhstan 2 million Elsewhere Only riots and incidents where at least four people died are listed here. This section lists deaths from the systematic practice of human sacrifice or suicide. For notable individual episodes, see Human sacrifice and mass suicide. These are floods and landslides that have been partially caused by humans, for example by failure of dams, levees, seawalls or retaining walls.
