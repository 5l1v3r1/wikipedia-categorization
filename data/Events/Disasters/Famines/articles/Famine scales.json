The word \"famine\" has highly emotive and political connotations and there has been extensive discussion among international relief agencies offering <a href=\"/wiki/Food_aid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food aid\">food aid</a> as to its exact definition.  For example, in 1998, although <a href=\"/wiki/1998_Sudan_famine\" title=\"1998 Sudan famine\">a full-scale famine</a> had developed in <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Sudan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Southern Sudan\">southern Sudan</a>, a disproportionate amount of donor food resources went to the <a href=\"/wiki/Kosovo_War\" title=\"Kosovo War\">Kosovo War</a>.  This ambiguity about whether or not a famine is occurring, and the lack of commonly agreed upon criteria by which to differentiate food insecurity has prompted renewed interest in offering precise definitions.

In the first case, famine is defined (roughly) as the event of many people dying of starvation within a locality or region.  In the second, famine is described as a chronology beginning with a disruption or disruptions that gradually leads to widespread death.  However, these general definitions have little utility for those implementing food relief as \"region\", \"widespread\", etc. are undefined.\n</p><p>One of the earliest methods of measurement was the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Famine_Codes\" title=\"Indian Famine Codes\">Indian Famine Codes</a> developed by the colonial <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">British</a> in the 1880s.  The Famine Codes defined three levels of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine.   \"Scarcity\" was defined as three successive years of <a href=\"/wiki/Crop_failure\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crop failure\">crop failure</a>, crop yields of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress.  \"Famine\" further included a rise in <a href=\"/wiki/Food\" title=\"Food\">food</a> prices above 140% of \"normal\", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality.  The Punjab Food Code stated, \"Imminence of death is the sole criterion for declaration of famine.\"  Inherent in the Famine Codes was the assumption that famine was an event, and not a process.\n</p><p>The basic premise of the Famine Codes formed the basis of numerous subsequent <a href=\"/wiki/Early_warning_system\" title=\"Early warning system\">early warning systems</a>.  One of the most efficacious is the <a href=\"/wiki/Turkana_District\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Turkana District\">Turkana District</a> Early Warning System in northern <a href=\"/wiki/Kenya\" title=\"Kenya\">Kenya</a> in which indicators include <a href=\"/wiki/Rainfall\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rainfall\">rainfall</a> levels, <a href=\"/wiki/Market_price\" title=\"Market price\">market prices</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Cereal\" title=\"Cereal\">cereals</a>, status of <a href=\"/wiki/Livestock\" title=\"Livestock\">livestock</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rangeland\" title=\"Rangeland\">rangeland</a> conditions and trends, and enrollment on food-for-work projects.  The system identifies three levels of crisis: alarm, alert and emergency, each of which is linked to a planned response to mitigate the crisis and try to prevent a worsening of the situation.\n</p><p>International organizations responding to recent food crises created <i>ad hoc</i> measurements.  In 2002, the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Food_Programme\" title=\"World Food Programme\">World Food Programme</a> created a number of \"pre-famine indicators\" for <a href=\"/wiki/Ethiopia\" title=\"Ethiopia\">Ethiopia</a> and combined it with measurements of <a href=\"/wiki/Nutrition\" title=\"Nutrition\">nutrition</a> levels to create recommendations.    The <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Food_Security_Assessment_Unit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Food Security Assessment Unit (page does not exist)\">Food Security Assessment Unit</a> (FSAU) devised a system for <a href=\"/wiki/Somalia\" title=\"Somalia\">Somalia</a> with four levels: Non-alert (near normal), Alert (requires close attention), Livelihood Crisis (basic social structures under threat) and Humanitarian Emergency (threat of widespread mortality requiring immediate <a href=\"/wiki/Humanitarian_assistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humanitarian assistance\">humanitarian assistance</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Livelihoods_strategies\">Livelihoods strategies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Famine_scales&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Livelihoods strategies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The FSAU system is one of several recent systems that draws a distinction between \"saving lives\" and \"saving livelihoods\".  Older models concentrated simply on the mortality of famine victims. However, relief agencies gradually realized that the means by which families and individuals supported themselves were threatened first.\n</p><p>Previously famines had been perceived as a threat to individuals, even large numbers of individuals.  Inherent in the livelihoods strategies outlook is the conception of famine as a social problem.  Populations affected by increased food stress will try to cope through market structures (i.e. selling possessions for food) and reliance upon community and family support structures.  It is only when such social structures collapse under the strain that individuals are faced with the malnutrition and starvation that has commonly been viewed as \"famine\".\n</p><p>During the 1980s and 1990s, studies of the process by which populations adapted to food stress as food security worsened received much attention.  Four stages of the process were identified:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Reversible strategies, in response to 'normal' food stress, such as rationing food or diversifying <a href=\"/wiki/Income\" title=\"Income\">income</a></li>\n<li>Irreversible strategies in response to prolonged food stress, such as selling breeding livestock or mortgaging land, which trade short-term survival for long-term difficulty</li>\n<li>The failure of internal coping methods and total dependence on external food aid</li>\n<li>Severe malnutrition leading to weakened <a href=\"/wiki/Immune_system\" title=\"Immune system\">immune systems</a>, illness and death, in the event of the failure of the first three levels of coping.  Death caused directly by <a href=\"/wiki/Starvation\" title=\"Starvation\">starvation</a> forms a fraction of deaths in a famine.</li></ol>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nutrition_levels\">Nutrition levels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Famine_scales&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Nutrition levels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Various <a href=\"/wiki/Nutrition\" title=\"Nutrition\">nutrition</a> benchmarks have been proposed as the cut-off points for food insecurity levels.

Some argue that a crude mortality rate of one death per ten thousand people per day is already a full-scale emergency.  Others note that while most indicators are focused on children, parents will often reduce their own food consumption in favor of their children.  Child malnutrition may thus be a <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Trailing_indicator&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Trailing indicator (page does not exist)\">trailing indicator</a>, indicating non-emergency levels even after adult malnutrition has reached crisis levels.  It has also been noted that malnutrition is often not directly related to food availability; malnutrition is often the result of disease or poor child-care practices, even with adequate food availability.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Combined_intensity_and_magnitude_scales\">Combined intensity and magnitude scales</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Famine_scales&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Combined intensity and magnitude scales\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In an influential paper published in 2004, Paul Howe and Stephen Devereux, both of the <a href=\"/wiki/Institute_of_Development_Studies\" title=\"Institute of Development Studies\">Institute of Development Studies</a> at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Sussex\" title=\"University of Sussex\">University of Sussex</a>, set forth a measurement of famine with scales for both \"intensity\" and \"magnitude\", incorporating many of the developments of recent decades.
