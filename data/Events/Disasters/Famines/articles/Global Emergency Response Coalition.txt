The Global Emergency Response Coalition formed in 2017 in response to hunger crises affecting more than 20 million people in Nigeria, Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and neighboring countries. Eight of the world’s largest U.S.-based international relief organizations united to launch a joint fundraising appeal, the Hunger Relief Fund, to the American public to respond to the unprecedented hunger crisis. The Global Emergency Response Coalition consists of CARE, International Medical Corps, International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, Oxfam, Plan International, Save the Children and World Vision. The coalition has been covered by ABC News.,  CNN,  The Washington Post,  Devex,  PBS,  Glamour,  FOX,  and more. George Clooney participated in a PSA  for the coalition, as did Lily Donaldson  All funds raised by the coalition are allocated to the member agencies equally, and at the discretion of each member. At least 85% of all donations will go directly to support the communities affected. Corporate partners of the coalition include BlackRock, PepsiCo., PepsiCo. Foundation, Visa, Google, PMX Agency, Porter Novelli and Twitter. The causes of the crisis in each country range from drought to ongoing violence, but the consequences are the same: children and their families are struggling to survive or are starving to death. They are also at increased risk of succumbing to diseases – including cholera and measles – that induce severe diarrhea and dehydration. More than 20 million people are facing the threat of starvation in the coming months and nearly 1.4 million children are severely malnourished and at risk of death without immediate help. https://www.globalemergencyresponse.org/
