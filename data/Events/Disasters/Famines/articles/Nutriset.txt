Nutriset is the French manufacturer and trademark  owner of Plumpy'nut, the peanut-based food for use in famine relief. It was formulated in 1997 by Andr√© Briend, a French pediatric nutritionist.  The majority of Plumpy'nut is produced in a Nutriset factory in France, and Unicef purchases 90 percent of the supply from that factory for humanitarian aid.
