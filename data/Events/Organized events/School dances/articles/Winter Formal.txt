Winter formal, also called Winterfest, Winter Ball, Sweethearts, Christmas Ball, Snow Ball, Queen of Hearts Dance, or simply Formal, is a dance held by high schools in the United States and Canada. It takes place between homecoming and prom, usually between December and March. At some schools, this dance may supplement or replace a Sadie Hawkins dance.  It has many of the same characteristics as a prom with a band to play music and catering service. This dance is often provided to high school students as a school-sponsored event for the long period between Homecoming in Autumn and prom in May. The influence of Christmas or New Year's Eve formal events and Valentine's Day may pique students' interest in holding their "own" dance during this time.    It is thought in some cases as a "pre-prom" dance, and is often not held at the school if the school can afford to hold it elsewhere. It might be held at a catering hall or ballroom facility. Mormal is the equivalent of winter formal or prom for youth in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or Mormon Church ("Mormal" is the Mormon formal).   It does not necessarily replace formal at school. This event is most common in California.
