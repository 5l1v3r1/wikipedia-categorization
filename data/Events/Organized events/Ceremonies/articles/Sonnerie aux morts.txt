"La Sonnerie aux Morts" is a bugle call of the French Armed Forces used at funerals and the commemoration of battles and wars. Struck by the impact that the Last Post, of the UK and the Commonwealth of Nations, and Taps, of the United States, had on ceremonies and their participants, General Gouraud took the initiative to call by the head of the music of the Republican Guard, Major Pierre Dupont, and requested a composition of an appropriate bugle call.  La Sonnerie aux Morts was played for the first time at a ceremony for the rekindling of the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe on 14 July 1931.
