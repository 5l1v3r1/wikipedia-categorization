A wetdown is a ritual celebrated by many volunteer fire departments in the United States in which squads of firefighters from neighboring towns ritualistically commission a new fire apparatus by anointing it with water sprayed from the visitors' firefighting equipment. If two new apparatus' are commissioned, then it is considered to be a "Double Wetdown". If three new apparatus' are commissioned, then it is called a "Triple Wetdown". Or if four new apparatus' are commissioned, then it is considered as a "Quadruple Wetdown".
