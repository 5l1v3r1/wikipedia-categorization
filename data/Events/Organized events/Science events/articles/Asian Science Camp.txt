The Asian Science Camp (ASC) is an annual forum for pre-collegiate and college students which aims at promoting discussion and cooperation among Asian students for the betterment of science in the Asian region. The first ASC was held at Taipei in 2007, and was subsequently held at Bali (2008), Tsukuba (Japan) (2009), Mumbai (2010), Daejeon (South Korea) (2011), Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Jerusalem, Israel) (2012). This idea of an annual camp was co-proposed by Yuan Tseh Lee and Masatoshi Koshiba at the 2005 Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau. The ASC is modeled after the Lindau meetings.    The idea of the Asian Science Camp  was co-proposed in September 2005 after the 55th Annual meeting of Nobel Laureates and Students in Lindau, Germany, by Professor Yuan Tseh Lee (1986 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry) from Chinese Taipei,  and Professor Masatoshi Koshiba (2002 Nobel Laureate in Physics) from Japan. The proposal expressed the aim to enlighten science talented youths through discussions and dialogues with top scholars in the world, and promoting international friendship and cooperation among best young students of the next generation in Asia. The Lindau Meetings will serve as a model.  The Asian Science Camp would invite a dozen Nobel Laureates or world-distinguished scientists as speakers and devise an interesting program to attract all the participants, including plenary sessions, round table discussions, student master dialogues, a creative poster competition, social events and excursion. The working language would be English. This proposal was soon discussed in a board meeting of the Wu Chien-Shiung Education Foundation and was approved unanimously by the board. The governing body of the Asian Science Camp is the International Board of Asian Science Camp (IBASC). IBASC is a not- for- profit organization, consisting of non-governmental educational institutions. The 2007 Asian Science Camp was organized by the Wu Chien-Shiung Education Foundation with the assistance of Academia Sinica in Taiwan. This non-government Foundation was established in 1995 to commemorate the monumental contributions of Madame Dr. Wu Chien-Shiung to physics and her lifelong love for science education. Since its inauguration in Taiwan in August 2007, the Asian Science Camp has become an International annual event in Asia.  2018 -  Manado, Indonesia 2017 -  Kampar, Malaysia 2016 -   Bengaluru, India 2015 -  Bangkok, Thailand 2014 -  Singapore 2013 -  Tsukuba, Japan 2012 -  Jerusalem, Israel  2011 -  Daejeon, South Korea 2010 -  Tsukuba, Japan 2009 -  Mumbai, India 2008 -  Bali, Indonesia 2007 -  Taipei, Taiwan The First Asian Science Camp was held at Taipei, Taiwan 5 August to 11 August 2007.

The Sixth Asian Science Camp hosted by Israel took place in the Hebrew University Safra Campus Jerusalem in 2012 was, by then, the largest event in terms of the number of students from when the project first began. Approximately 300 students, 5 Nobel Prize recipients, and 20 leading experts attended the event. Asian Science Camp 2016, was organised by jointly by Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and Indian Institute of Science from 21 August to 27 August 2016. The venue for the program was J N Tata Auditorium, Indian Institute od Science, Bangalore, India.
