 The Battle of Hastings reenactment is a yearly reenactment of the Battle of Hastings, held at Battle Abbey in Battle, East Sussex, UK, and drawing participants from around the world.   It takes place every year on the weekend nearest 14 October on the site of the historical battle, although is often arranged across the hill rather than up it, to take account of the smaller number of participants and the need for spectators. The event is run by English Heritage, which owns the site, and attended by several thousand people yearly.  For many years it was an event for amateur groups of reenactors, but more recently has involved scenes by professional actors. Every five or six years since 1984 it has been the site of major reenactments – 1984, 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2006. At the 2000 reenactment, called "Hastings 2000", about 1000 reenactors on foot,  100 cavalry and between 50 and 100 archers from 16 different countries took part. The 2006 event Hastings 2006 was, for a while, referred to as TNBO, "The Next Big One." The phrase was coined in 2001 or 2002 by an Australian re-enactor following the event in 2000 when questions began being asked about when 'The Next Big One' would be held. The 2006 event saw a much larger attendance than in 2000.   A total of 3,400 reenactors registered, and about 2,400 people took part on each of the two days, watched by a total crowd of about 30,000 paying public.  As such, it is believed to have been the largest pre-gunpowder reenactment ever held anywhere.
