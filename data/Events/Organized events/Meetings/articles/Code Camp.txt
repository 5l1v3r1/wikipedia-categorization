Code Camp is a form of an unconference. Originally begun with the goal of helping developers who could not make it to work during regular hours, the project offers technical presentations and provides access to technical content.  Started in Boston by Thom Robbins and a handful of local developer community leaders, Code Camps went on to influence the creation of other "Camp" style events such as barcamp.  As they have evolved, Code Camps have moved away from being strictly limited to the Microsoft Windows or .NET platforms.   Code Camps are free to attend and they do not take place during the typical work week. Like most unconferences, Code Camps are focused on the local or regional development community. Presenters are typically also members of the community. Presentation topics are suggested by attendees, and often presented by those who originally suggest them.
