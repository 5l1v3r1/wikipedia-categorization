To facilitate movement of participants, the chairs in the room are often organized in two circles or facing rows of desks. \n</p><p>The host opens the first round of meetings, usually with a bell or buzzer.  The two participants in each meeting introduce themselves, briefly summarizing their business histories and goals.

Prior to coming to the event, participants fill out a questionnaire listing their business background (job title and industry) and whom they wish to meet (suppliers, customers or vendors). The profiles are then matched electronically and a list of meetings is generated for participants based on their preferences. At the event, numbered stations are set up where participants meet with their assigned partners according to their list for a set period of time. A typical station-based speed networking event may yield 7 to 10 contacts during an hour-long event.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Group-based\">Group-based</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Speed_networking&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Group-based\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the Group-based model, participants are assigned to a sequence of tables. Each table seats a specific number of participants, depending on attendance. A typical event may call for tables of four to 10. Table assignments are often predetermined by computer software but other techniques can be used to determine the groups each attendee participates in. Each participant at the table takes a few minutes \u2013 the length of these introductions can also be set \u2013 to introduce him or herself. Time at the table varies based on how the event organiser coordinate the event but usually lasts five to 15 minutes.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Applications\">Applications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Speed_networking&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Applications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Speed networking has many applications. Many organizations use speed networking to structure events: alumni associations, chambers of commerce, business associations, universities and trade shows. Events that benefit from speed networking include: membership drives, networking events, mentoring programs, career fairs, team building exercises and vendor pairings. Speed networking is particularly useful \"when many organisations are gathering at large events.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Speed_Mentoring\">Speed Mentoring</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Speed_networking&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Speed Mentoring\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In speed <a href=\"/wiki/Mentoring\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mentoring\">mentoring</a>, the goal is to facilitate suitable relationships between mentors and mentees.matches.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>  Speed mentoring sessions are typically \"a series of short, focused conversations about specific questions. You will meet with a limited number of mentees in 10-minute time slots each. When directed, mentees will proceed to their mentor's table.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Speed mentoring is effective because the mentee experiences several different interactions with prospective mentors in a short period of time. This maximises the opportunity to find a suitable mentor.\n</p><p>Speed mentoring events can be traced back to the architectural profession.  In  2001-2003, Grace H. Kim, <sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> through her work as the <a href=\"/wiki/Intern_Development_Program_(IDP)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intern Development Program (IDP)\">Intern Development Program</a> (IDP) Washington State Coordinator advocated for interns to find a mentor outside their firm.  However, she found that many young interns, especially those new to Seattle, had a difficult time identifying potential mentors.  In 2006, after Kim and Lee W. Waldrep co-hosted an <a href=\"/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architecture_Students\" title=\"American Institute of Architecture Students\">American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)</a> salon on mentorship at the National <a href=\"/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architects\" title=\"American Institute of Architects\">American Institute of Architects</a> Convention, the idea of Speed Mentoring was born. <sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At the 2007 National AIA Convention, Kim and Waldrep co-presented a session entitled Speed Mentoring: Developing You, an Emerging Professional and over 100 attendees participated - representing the spectrum of interns to senior leadership.  After a brief overview of mentorship and the available resources, this interactive session required attendees to participate in a live demonstration of the program.  They were asked to stand in a line based on their number of years in the profession.  Then the line was folded in half and individuals were asked to move their chairs to face one another.  A bell was rung at which time the two facing individuals traded business cards, introduced themselves and shared what they were looking for in a mentoring relationship.  At five minutes, the bell was rung again and one row of people moved two seats down.  This process was repeated four times.  While they were not asked to rank their top choices, the idea was that if this exercise were repeated at a local chapter or in a large office, the interns could rank their mentor preferences.  And likewise, the mentor could rank their preferences for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2013 hopefully resulting in a better mentor match.\nThe session was a success and was subsequently repeated at two National AIA Conventions (San Antonio and Boston).  More importantly, the participants took the idea home to implement in various settings.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Speed_mentoring_sponsors\">Speed mentoring sponsors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Speed_networking&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Speed mentoring sponsors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some universities have also established speed mentoring events including:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Kentucky\" title=\"University of Kentucky\">University of Kentucky</a>, which has also developed a mentorship tool kit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/City_College_of_New_York\" title=\"City College of New York\">City College of New York</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/California_Polytechnic_State_University\" title=\"California Polytechnic State University\">California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Maryland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Maryland\">University of Maryland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California_-_Berkeley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of California - Berkeley\">University of California - Berkeley</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>Other industries in which speed mentoring events have been publicized include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Interior_Design_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"International Interior Design Association (page does not exist)\">International Interior Design Association</a> (NY Chapter)  \u2013 Oct 10, 2012 (Annual)</li>\n<li>NEWH (Hospitality Industry Network)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/American_Society_of_Media_Photographers\" title=\"American Society of Media Photographers\">American Society of Media Photographers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Information_Architecture_Institute\" title=\"Information Architecture Institute\">Information Architecture Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Wings_of_Hope_Children%27s_Charity\" title=\"Wings of Hope Children&#39;s Charity\">Wings of Hope</a> (UK)</li>\n<li>Women of the World Festivals (UK)</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advantages_and_disadvantages\">Advantages and disadvantages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Speed_networking&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Advantages and disadvantages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Speed networking has advantages over typical meet-and-greet events.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"For_participants\">For participants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Speed_networking&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: For participants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Speed networking facilitates the meeting of individuals who may not have had the opportunity to exchange information without a structured environment.

It rids the awkward \"exit\" by having time limits \u2013 no need to find a way to bow out of a conversation gracefully \u2013 and therefore increases the number of potential new meets.\n</p><p>However, there are also risks for attendees, and these relate to an unfortunate perception that a business relationship can also be speed-tracked, as well as a misconception that quantity is of prime importance. Members still need to take time to develop relationships with individual fellow members outside the networking event and the importance of this cannot be overestimated.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
