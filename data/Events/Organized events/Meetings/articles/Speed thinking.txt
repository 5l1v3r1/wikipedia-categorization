Speed thinking is a type of thinking technique proposed by authors such as Dr Ken Hudson, Malcolm Gladwell and Edward de Bono that, according to the authors, could accelerate the pace of thinking and improve how an individual or group thinks, creates, solves and acts. Structurally, Hudson's speed thinking involves two-minute bursts whilst trying to generate nine possibilities in a five-step process (start, enhance, connect, evaluate, action).
