The Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump was a meeting arranged by two professors at the University of Toronto in December 2016,   in an effort to pre-emptively preserve US government climate data from possible deletion by the Administration of Donald Trump.   During his run for presidency, President Trump had expressed, in various occasions, climate change denialism  calling the climate change as Chinese hoax "in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive", and voiced his hostility towards climate science and Paris climate agreement.   In early December 2016, a prominent climate change sceptic, Scott Pruitt was selected as a new administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  These proceeding had raised concerns among academic community that the scientific opinion on climate change might be suppressed during Trump's presidency. Indeed, according to Reuters sources, in 25 January 2017, Trump's administration instructed United States Environmental Protection Agency to remove climate change page from their website.  Fearing for possible deletion, or alteration of the US government websites containing the government climate data, as happened in Canada,  people from various academic backgrounds and training such as coders, environmental scientists, social scientists, archivists, and librarians gathered together in order to save US government websites at risk of changing or disappearing during or after government transition.   The event collaborated with the Internet Archive's End of Term project.
