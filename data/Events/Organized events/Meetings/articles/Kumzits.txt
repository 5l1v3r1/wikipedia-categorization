Kumzits (קומזיץ) is a compound-word in Hebrew derived from the Yiddish words קום (come) and זיץ (sit). The word is used to describe an evening gathering that Jews partake in.  Everyone sits together, be it on the floor or on chairs, and sings spiritually moving songs. In order to establish a certain ambiance the lighting is often low and candles are primarily used, or if taking place outdoors it is usually around a campfire. If it is not the Jewish Sabbath then there will usually be musical instruments, such as guitar or violin. An orator  will usually tell short inspirational folk-stories between songs. Originally the word was coined by the Biluim. Despite the opposition of some who preferred to use the more distinctly Hebrew שב-נא Shev-na  "please sit" or Persian/Arabic טוזיג "Tozig" (via the Talmud),  the word has since stuck and is used mainly by the religious but sometimes also the secular public.  Among Slonimer Chassidim, a similar gathering is called a "zitzen", which is Yiddish for "sitting", and is conducted by the Chassidim after the Rebbe's Tish, without the presence of the Rebbe. Often, a kumzits will take place after the Sabbath, and as such some erroneously use the term interchangeably with Melava Malka. When a kumzits takes place Friday night, it is often called an "oneg shabbos" (a Hebrew phrase meaning "Sabbath pleasure").  Generally, slow, moving songs are sung during a kumzitz. Songs composed by Shlomo Carlebach are very popular, as well as songs by the more recent Jewish singing group Dveykus. If the kumzits takes place on the Jewish Sabbath, songs with a Sabbath theme can be sung. If the kumzits is held on Rosh Chodesh or near the date of another Jewish holiday, songs associated with that holiday can be sung. Here is a partial list of the more popular kumzits songs:
