A cuddle party (or a cuddle puddle or snuggle party) is an event designed with the intention of allowing people to experience nonsexual group physical intimacy through cuddling.  Cuddle parties are touch and communication workshops that are typically 3-4 hours long starting with a one-hour introduction to explain the cuddle party rules  followed by two hours of freestyle cuddling where participants can practice saying yes and no to requests for touch.  "Cuddle parties are fully clothed events that offer a safe space to receive the positive, non-sexual touch that every human needs but with very clear boundaries and while actively practising consent."  Cuddle party workshops start by explaining the cuddle party rules  to all participants. This takes approximately one hour and includes a few icebreaker games so participants can practice the rules. All participants must agree to follow the rules before taking part in the freestyle cuddling section of the workshop. Reid Mihalko  and Marcia Baczynski,  a pair of self-described "relationship coaches" in New York City, founded Cuddle Party in New York on February 29, 2004.  According to their website, the events were initially created for friends who were too intimidated to attend Mihalko's informal massage workshops.  Upon publication of the Cuddle Party website, the events were opened to the general public, and, thanks to a swarm of media attention, became a phenomenon in New York.     In order to meet the demand for Cuddle Parties in other cities, Mihalko and Baczynski began a training and certification program in January 2005, and have since trained a number of individuals to facilitate Cuddle Parties in various cities.
