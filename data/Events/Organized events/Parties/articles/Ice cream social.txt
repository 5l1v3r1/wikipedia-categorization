An ice cream social (also known as an ice cream party) is a planned event the primary focus of which is ice cream served to the guests. It is often a neighborhood event or welcoming party, normally held during the summer.  Ice cream socials are a traditional gathering dating back to the 18th century in North America. The first ice cream social in America was in 1744, when Maryland governor Thomas Bladen served ice cream for a dinner party. The first ice cream social in the White House was in 1802 with the 3rd U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson. When ice cream became more common to the public in the 1800s, organizations such as schools and churches started hosting ice cream socials. Churches frequently organized ice cream socials since the 1860s, fashioned after the "ice cream gardens" that were common in society at the time.   Today, ice cream socials still take place in government and upper class, but have spread to all classes and different organizations.
