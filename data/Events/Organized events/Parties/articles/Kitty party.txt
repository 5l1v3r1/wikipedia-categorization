Kitty parties are popular ways in India and Pakistan for women to socialise within the context of an informal savings club. It is a kind of party usually organised by women and held in the afternoon on a monthly basis.  Kitty refers to the amount collected at the party, every member contributing a certain sum of money each month.  The kitty is  handed over to one member of the group every month.  The chit funds operate along similar principles.  It is usually held at a specified time each month, by a specific group of women. Every member of the group has to host a party at least once. The hosting member organises food and other logistics, and the party is usually a gossiping place for women.  In most of India and Pakistan, it is usually simply referred to as a 'committee'. The party may include games, and may involve a theme of discussion on a topic with other members.
