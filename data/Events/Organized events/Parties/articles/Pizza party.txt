A pizza party is a social gathering at which pizza is served.    Typically, a pizza that is 10 to 14 inches wide will feed two people.   Since pizzas can include a very wide variety of toppings, one particular type of pizza party allows the party-goers to create their own custom-made pizza, using a selection of ingredients from among the toppings provided by the party's host.  When a pizza party does not include any custom-made pizzas, and the particular preferences of the guests are unknown, it is common to include at least one plain cheese-only or vegetable-only pizza for people who are averse to meats or other available toppings.
