A season premiere is the first episode of a new season of an established television show.  In the United States, many season premieres are aired in the fall time or, for mid-season replacements, either in the spring or late winter.  In countries such as Australia and the UK, a season premiere can be broadcast at any time of the year. In Australia, the premieres of several shows are in mid- to late summer, late January or early February; even a soap opera would begin a new season at this time of the year.
