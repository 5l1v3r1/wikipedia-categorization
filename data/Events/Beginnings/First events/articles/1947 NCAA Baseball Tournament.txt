The 1947 NCAA Baseball Tournament was the first NCAA-sanctioned baseball tournament that determined a national champion.  The tournament was held as the conclusion of the 1947 NCAA baseball season, beginning on June 20.   The 1947 College World Series was played at Hyames Field on the campus of Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan from June 27 to June 28.  The first tournament's champion was California, coached by Clint Evans. The tournament was divided into two regional brackets, the Eastern Playoff and the Western Playoff.  Each region played a single elimination bracket, with the champion advancing to the College World Series. The tournament field was determined by regional committees, some of whom held playoffs, while others selected specific conference champions, and still others simply selected their representatives.  The eight teams were divided among the East and West brackets.  At Yale Field, New Haven, Connecticut    At Denver, Colorado   The first College World Series was a best of three series. Future President of the United States George Bush was Yale's captain and appeared in the 1947 and 1948 College World Series. (Bush was actually waiting on-deck when Cal recorded the final out in the second game of the 1947 series.)
