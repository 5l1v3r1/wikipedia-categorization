Status quo is a Latin phrase meaning the existing state of affairs, particularly with regard to social or political issues.  In the sociological sense, it generally applies to maintain or change existing social structure and values.  With regard to policy debate, the status quo refers to how conditions are at the time and how the affirmative team can solve these conditions for example "The countries are now trying to maintain a status quo with regards to their nuclear arsenal which will help them if the situation gets any worse."  It is the nominal form of the prepositional Latin phrase "in statu quo" â€“ literally "in the state in which", which itself is a shortening of the original phrase in statu quo res erant ante bellum, meaning "in the state in which things were before the war". To maintain the status quo is to keep the things the way they presently are. The related phrase status quo ante, literally "the state in which before",  means "the state of affairs that existed previously".  Social movements are an example of times when the status quo might be challenged. In these instances status quo refers to the current state of affairs around a particular issue, or perhaps the current culture or social climate of an entire society or nation.  The status quo is generally perceived negatively by supporters of the social movement, and people who want to maintain the status quo can be seen as being resistant to progress.  Politicians sometimes refer to a status quo. Often there is a policy of deliberate ambiguity, referring to the status quo rather than formalizing the status. Clark Kerr is reported to have said: "The status quo is the only solution that cannot be vetoed".  Karl Marx viewed organized religion as a means for the bourgeoisie to keep the proletariat content with an unequal status quo,  and education is seen by others[who?] as a means of maintaining the status quo of society.
