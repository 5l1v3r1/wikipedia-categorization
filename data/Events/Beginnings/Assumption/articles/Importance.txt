Importance is a subjective indicator of value. As a concept, importance is the recognized attribution of a subject's significance or value as defined by a perspective. In its most basic form, importance is used to define subjects that are essential and relevant from those that are not. A subject that is defined as of having no importance is often seen as having no value. Merriam-Webster defines "important" as "marked by or indicative of significant worth or consequence: valuable in content or relationship".  Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary defines "important" as "having serious meaning or worth, deserving or requiring serious attention, and having power, authority, or influence".  It has been suggested that "the concept of importance appears to be so fundamental that a satisfactory analysis of it may not be possible at all".
