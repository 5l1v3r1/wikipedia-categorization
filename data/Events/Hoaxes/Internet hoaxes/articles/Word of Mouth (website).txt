Word of Mouth is a scam website promoted by spam e-mail. "Word of Mouth" spam mails state that an anonymous person posted a secret about the recipient and that he needs to pay a fee in order to see the message. The editors of Snopes examined the scheme and concluded that the scheme is a likely scam, as the owner claims to have substantial information when he has nothing. Other sources, such as Ziff Davis, take the same conclusion. The website has taken several domain names. Snopes identifies Share Your Experiences as a variant of the same "Word of Mouth" scheme using a different name    .
