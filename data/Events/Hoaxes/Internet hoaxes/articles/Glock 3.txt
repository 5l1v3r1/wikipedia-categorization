  Glock 3 is a web site that appeared in 1996 that claimed to be for a gang in Detroit, Michigan. The web site was prominently featured in news articles and segments on television news. Its members claimed to be involved in extortion, robbery and other crimes. After being shut down by their Internet access provider, they received an offer by an individual going by the name of 'Sinister' in New Zealand, who proceeded to revamp the site and pay for hosting. It was later discovered that the site was a hoax originated by Nick Woomer, then a 16-year-old from the Michigan suburbs whose knowledge of gangs came from movies, gangsta rap, and Alex A. Alonso's website on Los Angeles street gangs.  Woomer created the original site, whose name came from the Glock pistol and the fact that there were three people involved.
