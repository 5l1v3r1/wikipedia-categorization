The bikini bridge was an Internet hoax. It originated in the United States  on January 5, 2014, created by users of the "/b/" section on the imageboard 4chan as a parody of popular thinspiration memes.  It is defined as "when bikini bottoms are suspended between the two hip bones, causing a space between the bikini and the lower abdomen".  According to a posting on the website, users intended to spread content across social media regarding bikini bridges, but then similarly disseminating them "throughout parts of the Internet known to be biased on the subject of weight" to deliberately cause offence.  On January 6, the online publication The Daily Dot reported it as a hoax,  as did U.S. television program Today on January 7.  Several commentators critiqued the hoax for displaying insensitivity or being "dangerous"  for women with an eating disorder.    The phenomenon has been ranked as an unhealthy body image obsession in the West along with "ab crack" and "thigh gap", which rode a media wave in 2012â€“2013;  and the Chinese trends, the "Collarbone Challenge", and the "A4 Challenge" in 2016 in China.
