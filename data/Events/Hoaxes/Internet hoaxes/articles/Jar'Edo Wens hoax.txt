The Jar'Edo Wens hoax was a deliberately fictitious Wikipedia article, which existed for almost 10 years before being spotted and deleted in March 2015. At the time, it was the longest-lasting hoax article discovered in the history of Wikipedia. The unsourced article claimed to be about an Australian Aborigine god ("of earthly knowledge and physical might, created by Altjira to ensure that people did not get too arrogant or self-conceited. He is associated with victory and intelligence."), and was likely simply the name "Jared Owens", with different punctuation and capitalization.      The author, an unregistered user at an Australian IP address, was active over an eleven-minute period in May 2005. Their only other contribution was to also add "Yohrmum" (obviously being a re-spelling of "Your Mum") to a list of Australian deities. This was more quickly spotted and removed. The hoax was negligently copied into a book on atheism in 2012, as part of a long list of "gods and religions in history that have fallen out of favour".  Since 2005, due to the Seigenthaler incident, article creation has been restricted to registered users, making fake articles more difficult to establish.  However, people could still edit using IP addresses, but some articles are protected against vandalism (visible as a lock on the edit button).
