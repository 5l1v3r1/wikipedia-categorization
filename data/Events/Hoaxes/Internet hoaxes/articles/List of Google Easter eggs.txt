The technology giant    Google "prides itself on being a playful company" and has added Easter eggs and April Fools' Day jokes and hoaxes into many of its products and services, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Android since at least 2000.  Easter eggs are hidden features or messages, inside jokes, and cultural references inserted into media. They are often well hidden, so that users find it gratifying when they discover them, helping form bonds between Google and its users. The easter eggs are sometimes created by employees during their 20% time. Google avoids adding easter eggs to popular search pages, as they do not want to negatively impact usability.

Late 2011, Google added a graphical calculator to search results.   By using natural language processing, Google's algorithms have calculated  that the result might be mathematical in nature.  Woven into this feature are several not entirely academic understandings, which might be considered Easter eggs.  A Google web search for: Results may be calculated; for example: "the number of horns on a unicorn plus the answer to life the universe and everything( see it )" will return "43".  Google offers interfaces for several different fictional languages. Users can set any language (except pig latin) as their preferred language in their search settings.
