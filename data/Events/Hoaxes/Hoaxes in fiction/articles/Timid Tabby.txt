Timid Tabby is a 1957 one reel animated Tom and Jerry short, directed and produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera with music by Scott Bradley. The cartoon was animated by Lewis Marshall, Kenneth Muse, Irvin Spence, Ken Southworth and Bill Schipek, with backgrounds by Roberta Gruetert and layouts by Richard Bickenbach. It was released on April 20, 1957 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. This short is one of the select few in which Tom emerges victorious over Jerry. The short begins with Tom chasing Jerry in circles until he gets a letter that says his (identical) cousin George, who has a fear of mice, is coming to visit.  Tom boards up Jerry's hole to prevent him from scaring George. But Jerry escapes and unexpectedly encounters George, who immediately tries to get as far away from him as possible. Jerry, not knowing about Tom's cousin, believes that the terrified cat is Tom and tries several attempts to frighten him, including saying "boo" and pulling scary faces. But he gets confused when the real Tom shakes off Jerry's scaring and whacks him with his fist. Having had enough of Jerry bothering George, the two cats play a trick on him by pretending to be a two-headed, four-armed and four-legged monster which terrifies Jerry and makes him flee the house and also overcoming George's fear of mice. A frightened Jerry runs to a house that has a gate with the words "Home For Mice With Nervous Breakdowns" and enters immediately.
