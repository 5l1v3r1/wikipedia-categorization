Ivan Renko was a fictitious Yugoslav basketball player created by Bobby Knight when he was the head coach for the Indiana University Hoosiers. In January of the 1992-93 college basketball season, Knight commented on his Sunday television show that the 6'8", 230 lbs Renko was coming to Indiana and that he was very pleased to get this commitment.   Knight created Renko in an attempt to expose disreputable basketball recruiting experts. Even though Renko was completely fictitious, several recruiting services started listing him as a prospect with in-depth descriptions of his potential and game style. Some of the more reputable recruiting gurus claimed to have never heard of Renko, whereas some other "experts" even claimed to possess or to see film of him actually playing basketball.
