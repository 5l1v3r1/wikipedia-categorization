They invented nonsensical <a href=\"/wiki/Free_verse\" title=\"Free verse\">free verse</a> poetry and submitted it to the paper in Ashbless's name, where it was reportedly enthusiastically accepted. \n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The college paper printed poetry, and it was close enough to the \u201960s that the poetry was all just horrible free verse about children and flowers and rainbows. So we figured we could write poetry that would sound very portentous but be, in fact, meaningless. \u2026 We needed a name for our poet and [came up with] \u2018Ashbless.\u2019 The paper published them, so we wrote another lot that was dumber, and they published that. \u2026 We said [Ashbless] was hideously deformed and couldn\u2019t attend any readings or meetings, but he had given us these poems to read in his stead. \u2026 Blaylock and I would often break out laughing in the middle of reading them, which people thought was very insensitive of us, to be laughing at the poetical efforts of our deformed friend.</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>Tim Powers on William Ashbless, <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ashbless is, however, best known in his incarnation as a 19th-century poet, in which guise he appears in Powers' <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Anubis_Gates\" title=\"The Anubis Gates\">The Anubis Gates</a></i> (1983) and as a lesser character in Blaylock's <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Digging_Leviathan\" title=\"The Digging Leviathan\">The Digging Leviathan</a></i> (1984). Neither author was aware that the other's novel contained a William Ashbless until the coincidence was noticed by the editor responsible for both books, who suggested that the two consult one another so that their references would be consistent.\n</p><p>In 1985, Powers and Blaylock produced <i>Offering the Bicentennial Edition of the Complete Twelve Hours of the Night: 1785-1985</i>, a prospectus for a non-existent collection of Ashbless poetry, published by <a href=\"/wiki/Cheap_Street\" title=\"Cheap Street\">Cheap Street</a> Press. (\"The Twelve Hours of the Night\" had been mentioned in <i>The Anubis Gates</i> as Ashbless's most famous work.) The prospectus included a sample poem and a replica of Ashbless's signature (the \"William\" was signed by one, and the \"Ashbless\" by the other, of the authors). This was followed in 2001 by <i>On Pirates</i> (<a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-931081-22-0\" title=\"Special:BookSources/1-931081-22-0\">1-931081-22-0</a>) \u2014 supposedly written by Ashbless, with an introduction by Powers, an afterword by Blaylock, and illustrations by <a href=\"/wiki/Gahan_Wilson\" title=\"Gahan Wilson\">Gahan Wilson</a> \u2014 and in 2002 by <i>The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook</i>.\n</p><p>In his 1992 novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/Last_Call_(novel)\" title=\"Last Call (novel)\">Last Call</a></i> (<a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-688-10732-X\" title=\"Special:BookSources/0-688-10732-X\">0-688-10732-X</a>), Tim Powers includes a poem attributed to William Ashbless in the introduction to Book One.
