Kodee's plight was detailed in letters published in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daily_Egyptian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Daily Egyptian\">Daily Egyptian</a></i>, a student newspaper for <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Illinois_University_Carbondale\" title=\"Southern Illinois University Carbondale\">Southern Illinois University</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Carbondale,_Illinois\" title=\"Carbondale, Illinois\">Carbondale, Illinois</a>, beginning in 2003.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Hoax\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Hoax</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Exposure\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Exposure</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Investigation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Investigation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hoax\">Hoax</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kodee_Kennings&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Hoax\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The story was concocted by <b>Jaimie Reynolds</b>, a woman who claimed to be <b>Colleen Hastings</b>, caregiver of the fictional Kodee. Reynolds allegedly passed a letter supposedly written by \"Kodee,\" to Michael Brenner, who was then a sports editor at the <i>Egyptian</i> which prompted a feature story published May 6, 2003. In the article, \"Kodee\" told how upset she was by an <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-war\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anti-war\">anti-war</a> protest at the university campus, and of her worries about her father \"Dan\" who was shipping off to Iraq with the <a href=\"/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division\" title=\"101st Airborne Division\">101st Airborne</a>. Kodee's mother was said to be dead.\n</p><p>Over the next year, the <i>Egyptian</i> would publish, unedited, notes and letters from \"Kodee\", liberally strewn with misspellings and phonetic English, to update their readers about Dan's Iraq service or Kodee's daily life. A young friend of Reynolds, Caitlin Hadley, the daughter of a <a href=\"/wiki/Church_of_the_Nazarene\" title=\"Church of the Nazarene\">Nazarene</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Minister_of_religion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Minister of religion\">minister</a>, was recruited to play the part of Kodee for photographs, and a nurse, Patrick Trovillion, played Dan. Both believed that they were playing parts in a movie. \"Kodee\" was taken to the <i>Egyptian</i> newsroom and other Carbondale locations. \"Dan\" was photographed wearing <a href=\"/wiki/Camouflage\" title=\"Camouflage\">camouflage</a>, sitting on a <a href=\"/wiki/Tank\" title=\"Tank\">tank</a>, and meeting with school children in <a href=\"/wiki/Michigan\" title=\"Michigan\">Michigan</a>. \"Dan\" also called the newsroom and maintained an e-mail address at <a href=\"/wiki/Yahoo!\" title=\"Yahoo!\">Yahoo!</a> \"Dan\" was even portrayed as having been injured in a December, 2004 explosion in a mess hall at a base near <a href=\"/wiki/Mosul,_Iraq\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mosul, Iraq\">Mosul, Iraq</a>. He reportedly returned to duty just weeks later, and was later injured by an <a href=\"/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device\" title=\"Improvised explosive device\">roadside bomb</a> which struck a <a href=\"/wiki/Humvee\" title=\"Humvee\">Humvee</a> in which he was traveling.\n</p><p>Reynolds also apparently penned a guest editorial published in the name of a real war widow,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> wherein the author claimed that her late husband had been a war buddy of Kennings'.\n</p><p>To further attempt to turn her hoax into reality, Jaimie Reynolds would dial the <i>Daily Egyptian</i> newsroom and \u2013 unbeknown to DE staff \u2013 allegedly disguise her voice to pretend to be the fictional girl \"Kodee Kennings\" wanting to talk to staff.\n</p><p>Throughout the hoax, Jaimie Reynolds also passed herself off as the twin sister of the fictional \"Colleen Hastings\" and visited the <i>Daily Egyptian</i> newsroom alternating as either Jaimie or \"Colleen.\" Reynolds was a broadcast-journalism student at Southern Illinois University and graduated in 2004, putting her in classes alongside <i>Daily Egyptian</i> staff.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exposure\">Exposure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kodee_Kennings&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Exposure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The hoax unraveled when Reynolds claimed in August 2005 that Kennings had died in Iraq. This news was published in the <i>Egyptian</i>, leading reporters from the <i>Tribune</i> to seek an interview with \"Hastings.\" These reporters became suspicious when Reynolds routed interview requests through Brenner, who had become a close friend of hers.\n</p><p>Reynolds and Hadley (as \"Hastings\" and \"Kodee\"), along with members of the <i>Egyptian</i> staff, attended a memorial service arranged at the local <a href=\"/wiki/American_Legion\" title=\"American Legion\">American Legion</a> outpost. After openly weeping at the service, Reynolds and Hadley met with <i>Tribune</i> reporters briefly at a restaurant, where they were told that media liaisons at <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" title=\"United States Department of Defense\">The Pentagon</a> were unable to confirm the existence of Kennings. Reynolds refused to provide any proof of Kennings' existence. Days later, reporters located her at her mother's home in <a href=\"/wiki/Marion,_Illinois\" title=\"Marion, Illinois\">Marion, Illinois</a>, where she admitted to participating in the hoax.\n</p><p>Brenner was duped by Reynolds. After numerous articles in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the Associated Press, the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> and the <i>Daily Egyptian</i> itself, it appeared no crime was committed. The parents of Hadley were particularly upset, however and considered a <a href=\"/wiki/Restraining_order\" title=\"Restraining order\">restraining order</a> against Reynolds.\n</p><p>Subsequent attempts to contact Reynolds after news of her hoax broke were unsuccessful. Reynolds went so far as to change the identity of her cell-phone voicemail from the fictional \"Colleen Hastings\" to \"Blank Blank.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Investigation\">Investigation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kodee_Kennings&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Investigation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <i>Daily Egyptian</i> subsequently investigated the hoax that had been perpetrated on its own paper. In part due to that investigation, the <i>Egyptian</i> won the Illinois College Press Association's General Excellence Award in 2006, as well as first place in the Investigative Reporting category.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kodee_Kennings&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\">Goldsmith, Shayla (August 26, 2005). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110516104628/http://newshound.de.siu.edu/voices04/stories/storyReader%24487\">\"Voices&#160;: 'Freedom don't come free<span style=\"padding-right:0.2em;\">'</span>\"</a>. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daily_Egyptian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Daily Egyptian\">Daily Egyptian</a></i>.
