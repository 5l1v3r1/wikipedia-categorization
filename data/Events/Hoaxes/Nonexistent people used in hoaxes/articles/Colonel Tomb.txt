Colonel Tomb, also "Nguyen Toon" (Nguyễn Tuân)  or "Colonel Toon" was a mythical North Vietnamese fighter pilot and flying ace who allegedly shot down 13 American aircraft during the Vietnam War.  According to legend, he was killed in action on May 10, 1972, by the U.S. Navy F-4 Phantom crew of pilot Lt. Randy "Duke" Cunningham and radar operator Lt.(jg) William "Irish" Driscoll.    The name 'Colonel Tomb' rose to prominence among U.S. Navy aviators during the latter part of the war. Photos of a North Vietnamese MiG-17 with the tail number 3020 bearing numerous red victory stars contributed to the rumor, and was occasionally identified as the Colonel's aircraft. However, it was normal practice in the Vietnamese People's Air Force to add victory stars to an aircraft for all claims in the aircraft, regardless of the pilot flying it. A photo of a MiG-21, with tail number 4326, was reported in a Vietnamese official magazine to have been flown by at least nine different airmen.  This aircraft also had numerous red victory stars.  Six of its pilots received the title "Hero of the People's Armed Forces".  Information on Toon/Tomb's life and career was never published by the North Vietnamese, nor did they release a photo of him.  MiG-17 number 3020 was confirmed shot down and destroyed, and its Vietnamese pilot killed, on May 10, 1972, by Cunningham and Driscoll following a protracted air fight. Much of the information the U.S. obtained about the North Vietnamese air force came from radio signals intelligence or "SigInt", which monitored enemy radio transmissions. Though Tuân is a Vietnamese name, Toon and Tomb are not. It is likely that a name similar in sound to Tomb was used as a radio callsign, and was responsible for the creation of the story of a Colonel Tomb.
