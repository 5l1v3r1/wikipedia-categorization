Rochester Sneath</b> <a href=\"/wiki/Master%27s_degree\" title=\"Master&#39;s degree\">MA</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts\" title=\"Bachelor of Arts\">L-\u00e8s-L</a> (c. 1900 &#8211;&#160;?) was the nonexistent <a href=\"/wiki/Headmaster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Headmaster\">headmaster</a> of the also nonexistent Selhurst School (\"near <a href=\"/wiki/Petworth\" title=\"Petworth\">Petworth</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sussex\" title=\"Sussex\">Sussex</a>\") who wrote many bizarre <a href=\"/wiki/Hoax_letter_writers\" title=\"Hoax letter writers\">letters to public figures</a> in 1948. Selhurst supposedly had 175 male students.\n</p><p>In March 1948, several <a href=\"/wiki/Headmaster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Headmaster\">headmasters</a> of British <a href=\"/wiki/Public_school_(UK)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Public school (UK)\">public schools</a> began to receive letters from Sneath. The Master of <a href=\"/wiki/Marlborough_College\" title=\"Marlborough College\">Marlborough College</a>, F. M. Heywood, was livid when Sneath asked how he had \"engineered\" a recent visit of the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_family\" title=\"Royal family\">royal family</a>. Next, he received a letter in which Sneath warned that he should not hire a French teacher, 'Robert Agincourt', because he had climbed a tree naked. Finally, when asked to recommend a <a href=\"/wiki/Private_detective\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Private detective\">private detective</a> and a competent nursery maid, Heywood wrote back, \"I am not an agency for domestic servants. I really must ask you not to bother me with this kind of thing.\"\n</p><p>Sneath wrote to the headmaster of <a href=\"/wiki/Stowe_School\" title=\"Stowe School\">Stowe School</a> to ask if he should provide sex education for the school maids. He complained to the headmaster of <a href=\"/wiki/Oundle_School\" title=\"Oundle School\">Oundle School</a> that the school chaplain was hopeless as a rat catcher. He asked <a href=\"/wiki/Haileybury_and_Imperial_Service_College\" title=\"Haileybury and Imperial Service College\">Haileybury</a> for a reference for a teacher who had a club foot and warts. Sneath even wrote to the headmaster of <a href=\"/wiki/Eton_College\" title=\"Eton College\">Eton</a> to apply for his job. Some of the headmasters answered politely to a person they thought to be a fellow headmaster. One headmaster even recommended Selhurst to a parent of a prospective pupil. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw\" title=\"George Bernard Shaw\">George Bernard Shaw</a> received an invitation to speak at an annual celebration at Selhurst (he declined). Architect Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Giles_Gilbert_Scott\" title=\"Giles Gilbert Scott\">Giles Gilbert Scott</a> was informed of the possibility of designing a new main building for the school (he declined, as well). Conductor Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Boult\" title=\"Adrian Boult\">Adrian Boult</a> was invited to conduct the school orchestra (he was not enthusiastic, either). Two of Sneath's correspondents detected the hoax: one was Walter Oakeshott of <a href=\"/wiki/Winchester_College\" title=\"Winchester College\">Winchester College</a>, who declined an invitation because he was attending a commemoration of a remote ancestor at Salt Lake City, Utah.  The other was John Sinnott, rector of <a href=\"/wiki/Beaumont_College\" title=\"Beaumont College\">Beaumont College</a>. When invited to lead an <a href=\"/wiki/Exorcism\" title=\"Exorcism\">exorcism</a>, Sinnott requested a packet of salt \"capable of being taken up in <a href=\"/wiki/Grain_of_salt\" title=\"Grain of salt\">pinches</a>\" be ready for him. \n</p><p>Selhurst School and Rochester Sneath were the inventions of <a href=\"/wiki/Humphry_Berkeley\" title=\"Humphry Berkeley\">Humphry Berkeley</a>, then an undergraduate student at <a href=\"/wiki/Pembroke_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Pembroke College, Cambridge\">Pembroke College</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Cambridge\" title=\"University of Cambridge\">Cambridge</a>. Berkeley had ordered headed notepaper printed with Selhurst's name and initially arranged with the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Mail\" title=\"Royal Mail\">Post Office</a> to have mail sent to Selhurst School to be redirected to him, although the post office later refused to redirect mail from a nonexistent address. Sneath had to resort to asking correspondents to write to him care of \"my sister Mrs Harvey-Kelly\" at a Cambridge address (which was that of a fellow student).\n</p><p>On 13 April 1948, Sneath's letter was published in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daily_Worker\" title=\"Daily Worker\">Daily Worker</a></i>, complaining of the difficulty in importing <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_language\" title=\"Russian language\">Russian</a> textbooks for compulsory Russian lessons in his school. The <i><a href=\"/wiki/News_Review\" title=\"News Review\">News Review</a></i> asked to interview Sneath to discover more about this unusual school, but Sneath's \"secretary\", \"Penelope Pox-Rhyddene\", claimed he was ill. The journalist then visited Petworth to discover that there was no Selhurst School there, and subsequently turned up on the doorstep of Berkeley's friend's lodgings. A story in the <i>News Review</i> on 29 April revealed that Berkeley was behind the hoax.\n</p><p>Berkeley was sent down (excluded from university) for two years. He was elected <a href=\"/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)\" title=\"Conservative Party (UK)\">Conservative</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Member_of_Parliament\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Member of Parliament\">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/Lancaster_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)\">Lancaster</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1959\" title=\"United Kingdom general election, 1959\">1959 general election</a>. The Rochester Sneath letters were published in 1974 under the title <i>The Life and Death of Rochester Sneath</i>, together with illustrations by <a href=\"/wiki/Nicolas_Bentley\" title=\"Nicolas Bentley\">Nicolas Bentley</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Books\">Books</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=H._Rochester_Sneath&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Books\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\"><a href=\"/wiki/Humphry_Berkeley\" title=\"Humphry Berkeley\">Berkeley, Humphry</a> (1974). <i>The Life and Death of Rochester Sneath</i>.
