Velvet Cacoon is a black metal band from Portland, Oregon, United States. According to members, the band was formed in 1996, although no material was released publicly until 2002. Due to the lack of information being provided by its members, it has proved very difficult to discern what is truth and what is fiction about Velvet Cacoon. As of December 2009, Velvet Cacoon have broken up. However, Josh has posted on several forums that he has begun a new project entitled Clair Cassis. Clair Cassis released their album on vinyl LP record via Full Moon Productions in 2010, and two EPs releases through Khrysanthoney Co.
