Ghost Bath is an American black metal band from Minot, North Dakota, formed in 2012. They have released three studio albums and one EP to date, combining influences ranging through black metal, post-metal, and shoegazing. They gained notoriety for claiming to be from China and marketing themselves that way.   Originally the band claimed to have been from Chongqing, China.  Their 2014 record, Funeral, was released on Chinese label, Pest Productions. However, with their second studio record, Moonlover, released in 2015 they have signed to German label Northern Silence Productions.  Upon gaining increased media attention including critical acclaim from the music websites Pitchfork and Stereogum the band was revealed to be from Minot, North Dakota and fronted by Dennis Mikula.  When asked why the band did not correct the media reporting that the band was from China, Mikula claimed that it was an issue of privacy and further stated "We refused to correct people because we do not wish to put actual faces onto our music. It is our wish as a band to connect to all human beings."  Ghost Bath is often categorized as a blackgaze band. They employ a mixture of harsh black metal elements, including tremolo picked guitars and harsh vocals, and the atmospheric qualities of post-rock.  This style has been frequently compared to fellow American black metal band, Deafheaven and their breakthrough 2013 album, Sunbather.
