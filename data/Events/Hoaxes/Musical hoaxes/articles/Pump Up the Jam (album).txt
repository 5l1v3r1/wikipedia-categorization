Pump Up the Jam (also known as Pump Up the Jam: The Album in North America) is the debut studio album by Belgian dance act Technotronic. It was released on 28 November 1989. When it was discovered that model Felly lip-synched to vocals that were actually performed by Belgian emcee Ya Kid K, the album's artwork, which had featured a picture of Felly, was changed to feature Ya Kid K instead. The album reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart.
