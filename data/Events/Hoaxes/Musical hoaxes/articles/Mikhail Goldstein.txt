Mikhail Emmanuilovich Goldstein (Russian: Михаил Эммануилович Гольдштейн; pen name: Mikhailo Mykhailovsky; 8 November [O.S. 26 October] 1917 – 7 September 1989), was a Soviet composer and violinist of Ukrainian-Jewish origin, brother of prominent violinist Boris Goldstein. Goldstein was born in Odessa in 1917. He was the author of the celebrated musical hoax "Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky's Symphony No. 21" as well as several others, notably "Expromt" by Balakirev", "Albumblatt" (Листок из Альбома) by Glazunov"' the "Viola Concerto in C Major" by Ivan Khandoshkin, etc. He concentrated on composition after his career as a violinist was curtailed by a hand injury. On New Year's Eve 1942, Goldstein was at an open air party held by the Soviet commissars to honor visiting artists, musicians, and actors during a lull in the Battle of Stalingrad. Horrified by the utter destruction all around, he played his violin over the loudspeakers, playing even German music, though it had been banned by the Soviets and all went quiet. After he had finished, the German lines shouted for a ceasefire so he could play more Bach. Goldstein obliged. He was a winner of three prizes at the 1963 All-Union Composers' Competition (compositions for violin and cello). Apparently he submitted his entries under pseudonyms.  After this incident his political difficulties increased. He took a teaching position in East Berlin in 1964. He moved to Vienna and Jerusalem in 1967, moved to London in 1968, and finally to Hamburg, Germany in 1969, where he died. He gave concerts with Galina Kowal and Michael Minsky. His musical and civic activities were recognized in Germany with the Bundesverdienstkreuz medal. He died in Hamburg in 1989, aged 71.
