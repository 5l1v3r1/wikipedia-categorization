An impersonator is someone who imitates or copies the behaviour or actions of another.   There are many reasons for impersonating someone: Celebrity impersonators are entertainers who look similar to celebrities and dress in such a way as to imitate them. Impersonators are known as look-alikes, impressionists, imitators tribute artists and wannabees. The interest may have originated with the need or desire to see a celebrity who has died.  One of the most prominent examples of this phenomenon is the case of Elvis Presley. There are claimed to be more Elvis impersonators and tribute artists in the world than for any other celebrity.  Edward Moss has appeared in movies and sitcoms, impersonating Michael Jackson.  Tom Jones has attracted his share of impersonators from different places around the world. From the United States, to South East Asia, to the UK, there are performers who either sound like him or imitate his act.     Although in a recent case, an immigrant was charged with "criminal impersonation" for using another person's social security number when signing up for a job, some courts have ruled that this is not an actual crime. The ruling hinges on whether there was harm to the other person.
