Juan Carlos Guzmán-Betancourt (born 1976) is a Colombian criminal and impostor. Guzmán is believed to have stolen at least $1 million in various countries.  He has used at least ten different false identities and has been pursued in Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Canada, Russia, Thailand and Japan.  Guzmán was born in 1976 in Roldanillo, Colombia.  On June 4, 1993, he arrived to Miami as a wheel-well stowaway, calling himself Guillermo Rosales.  As an unnamed male, "13 years old", he was listed in the FAA report on flights with stowaways.  Betancourt was first arrested in the United Kingdom in 1998 on suspicion of four burglaries at the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, and of using a stolen credit card. In the U.S. states of Virginia and New York, Guzmán was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud in Florida, being deported from the U.S. three times.
