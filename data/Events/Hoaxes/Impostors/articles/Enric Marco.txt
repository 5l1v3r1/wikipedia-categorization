Enric Marco (born 1921 in Barcelona) is an impostor who claimed to have been a prisoner in Nazi German concentration camps Mauthausen and Flossenbürg in World War II.  He was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi by the Catalan government in 2001 and wrote a book on his experiences.  In 2005 he admitted his claims were false and returned his medal, after his deception was revealed by university researcher Benito Bermejo. Marco told Catalan TV: ""I wasn't in a concentration camp. I was held in captivity and the Nazis did impose penalties on me. But that does not exonerate me from being an impostor." He said he was released after being mistreated for several weeks and returned to Spain in 1943. Marco claimed he had volunteered in 1941 to work in Kiel for the Nazi war industry. In his made-up story called Memoir of Hell Marco wrote he had been involved in the French resistance and captured by the Gestapo in southern France.  After 2001 Marco represented an association of survivors of the thousands of Spaniards who had truly been deported to Nazi concentration camps. In the period 1978–1979 Marco, a metal worker, had been the General Secretary of the Spanish anarchist Union CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo), from which he was expelled in 1980.
