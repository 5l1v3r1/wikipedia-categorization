She claimed to have been asked to help out by some firemen and that she did not hesitate for a moment.\n</p><p>She was widely hailed as a \"heroine\", after her accounts of treating the seriously injured were carried out by the press, especially in New Zealand. Subsequently, the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Zealand_Herald\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Zealand Herald\">New Zealand Herald</a>, among others, researched her background and found that she was not a doctor, but an editor of a BMA publication, a job that did not require medical qualifications.   \n</p><p>The media's suspicion was triggered by an account by Oates-Whitehead of how she heard a controlled explosion of another bomb by the police while she was busy tending to the victims. <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland_Yard\" title=\"Scotland Yard\">Scotland Yard</a>'s denial of such an explosion and the absence of her name on either of the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</a> or the New Zealand Medical Council registers of doctors strengthened the suspicions. Nor could the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Auckland\" title=\"University of Auckland\">University of Auckland</a> confirm that she was a graduate of the institution. Oates-Whitehead contested the newspaper's contention and threatened to sue it for defamation, but resigned from her post on health grounds when BMA announced an inquiry into her antecedents. The controlled explosion that Oates-Whitehead heard was later reported by others.\n</p><p>According to the Richmond and Twickenham Times newspaper there was a controlled explosion of a suspect package on the bus: \n'Sergeant Graham Cross and his unit of five were trying to set up a cordon around the King's Cross bombing when the number 30 bus was blown up in Tavistock Square.   \n\"We were only 100 metres away,\" Mr Cross said.  \t \nTeam member PC Ashley Walker was looking at the bus as it exploded before his eyes.   \nAs they ran closer, they saw \"people's body parts and lumps of flesh\", PC Walker remembers. One man's legs were trapped under a bench, while another mangled victim hanged with his head over the edge of the bombed top deck. <br />  \nThen they spotted a microwave box near a window. Another bomb?   \nThey thought it was.  \n\"But we had no choice, really,\" Mr Graham says. \"We had to go get people off the bus.\"   \nA bomb disposal unit later blew up the package in a controlled explosion.' <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>Testimony given at the Coroner's Inquest confirms the controlled explosion of the microwave oven</b>:\n</p><p>Transcript:\n</p><p>Q.
