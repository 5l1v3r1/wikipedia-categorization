A look-alike, double, or doppelgänger is a person who closely resembles another person in appearance. Celebrity look-alikes—those who resemble well-known entertainers, politicians, and other public figures—can work as entertainers themselves, impersonating their targets in a variety of venues, including movies, television, stage shows, parties, and corporate functions. These professional look-alikes are often represented by talent agencies that specialize in celebrity impersonators.
