 William Hamman (born 1952) is an American pilot. Hamman taught doctors and pilots in Milwaukee. He also talked to many people at seminars. He claimed to have a medical and doctoral degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but when his credentials were checked by the Associated Press there wasn't anything stating this. It was discovered in December 2010 that he was not a doctor, one of his colleagues said that he did not need to be a doctor to do his job.         Hamman also claimed to have a PhD.  Of the six papers he published, one has been retracted.
