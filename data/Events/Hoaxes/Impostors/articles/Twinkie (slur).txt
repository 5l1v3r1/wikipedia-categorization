Twinkie is a racial pejorative used by most American Indians to refer to a European American, with little or no social or blood links to any tribe, who claims to be an American Indian. Particularly applies to those who claim to be shaman, healers, or other prominent respected positions in Indian culture. They try to incorporate New Age ideas such as "Energy Healing", "Atlantis" and Tantric sex into a fanciful Native American spirituality.  Twinkieism is seen by many as an example of cultural appropriation. It is used as a humorous comment and not as a racial slur. Natives who fall for New Age falsehoods may also be teased as being "twinkies".  Another use of the pejorative can be in describing Asian Americans (along with others) who has become completely (or almost completely) integrated into White American, or mainstream American culture, thus losing their traditional Asian values (and etc.). A reference to "Twinkie" can be seen in the 2004 film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, where Harold, a Korean American, is referred to as a "Twinkie". This term is derived from the traditional metaphor "banana" and means "yellow on the outside, white on the inside". This teen is also used in the film, Crazy Rich Asians
