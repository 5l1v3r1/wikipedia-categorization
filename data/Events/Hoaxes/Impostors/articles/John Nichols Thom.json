He was baptised in the parish church on 10 November 1799. His parents were William and Charity Tom who kept the Joiners' Arms.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Tom went to school in <a href=\"/wiki/Penryn,_Cornwall\" title=\"Penryn, Cornwall\">Penryn</a>, attending Bellevue Academy (a \"Classical and Commercial Academy\"). At the age of about fourteen he transferred to the private school in <a href=\"/wiki/Launceston,_Cornwall\" title=\"Launceston, Cornwall\">Launceston</a> that was run by <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Cope_(minister)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Richard Cope (minister)\">Reverend Richard Cope</a>, pastor of the local Congregational Church.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tom stayed at school until he was eighteen and was then articled to solicitor Mr Paynter of St Columb. He decided, however, against a career in the law and left after three years. After a short spell as an innkeeper in <a href=\"/wiki/Wadebridge\" title=\"Wadebridge\">Wadebridge</a> he settled down as a clerk in the firm of Lubbock and Co, wine merchants of <a href=\"/wiki/Truro\" title=\"Truro\">Truro</a>, and took over the business when the partners retired, extending it to include <a href=\"/wiki/Malting\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Malting\">malting</a>. In 1821 he married Catherine Fisher Fulpitt, the daughter of a market gardener in Truro.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Tom was a tall, strongly built, good-looking man, who became known in Truro for his skill as a cricketer.

His mother Charity was removed to Cornwall Lunatic Asylum in 1827, and died there. Then, in 1828, his business premises in Pydar Street burnt down. Tom claimed the insurance and was able to rebuild the premises.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> At the <a href=\"/wiki/Quarter_Sessions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quarter Sessions\">Quarter Sessions</a> held at <a href=\"/wiki/Bodmin\" title=\"Bodmin\">Bodmin</a> on 15 July 1828, Tom applied successfully for the return of \u00a3304 paid in <a href=\"/wiki/Excise_duty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Excise duty\">excise duty</a> on <a href=\"/wiki/Malt\" title=\"Malt\">malt</a> destroyed in the fire at his malthouse on 17 June 1828.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> In 1831 Tom received treatment from a surgeon for an attack of insanity but recovered and the following spring sailed from Truro to Liverpool with a cargo of malt. He wrote to his wife from Liverpool to tell her he had sold the malt, and wrote again from Birmingham to tell her he was going to France. Nothing more was heard from him until over a year later, when his family heard that a man who fitted his description and went by the name of Sir William Courtenay was being held in Maidstone prison.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canterbury\">Canterbury</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_Nichols_Thom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Canterbury\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In September 1832 Thom arrived in <a href=\"/wiki/Canterbury\" title=\"Canterbury\">Canterbury</a>, dressed in exotic costumes and wearing long hair and a beard. He put up at the Rose Inn at the junction of Rose Lane and the main street and went first by the name of Count <a href=\"/wiki/Rothschild\" title=\"Rothschild\">Rothschild</a>, and then by the name of Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta, heir to the <a href=\"/wiki/Earl_of_Devon\" title=\"Earl of Devon\">Earl of Devon</a> and the Kentish estates of Sir Edward Hales.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although many people realized he was an imposter he nevertheless became a colourful and popular figure in the town, partly because he frequently made comical and insulting speeches directed at the unpopular mayor and magistrates of the city and the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the December 1832 general election Liberal support in the town was so strong that the Conservatives decided not to field candidates. Stung by jeers about not standing, some local Conservatives asked Tom to stand as an independent candidate for <a href=\"/wiki/Canterbury_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)\">Canterbury</a>, hoping he would inconvenience the Liberals. He polled a creditable 375 votes (against 834 for <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Watson_(politician)\" title=\"Richard Watson (politician)\">Richard Watson</a> and 802 for <a href=\"/wiki/George_Cowper,_6th_Earl_Cowper\" title=\"George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper\">Viscount Fordwich</a>, the Liberal candidates).<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> He then decided to stand in the <a href=\"/wiki/East_Kent_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"East Kent (UK Parliament constituency)\">East Kent</a> election, but polled only three votes, and turned his attention to publishing a weekly paper, <i>The Lion</i>. Eight issues of the paper were produced. Full of biblical quotations, it argued for the rights of the poor, expressed loyalty to the Crown, and was critical of the clergy, aristocracy, town corporations and Parliament.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Tom's biographer described the views expressed in <i>The Lion</i> as showing \"amazing common sense... far in advance of those generally held in his time\", for example, regarding rents, taxation, the Irish problem, and corporal punishment, although these \"occasional shafts of light\" were surrounded by \"turgid nonsense\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Barming_Heath\">Barming Heath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_Nichols_Thom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Barming Heath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At the beginning of March 1833, Thom intervened in the case of some Faversham smugglers, acting as a witness for the defence. The smugglers were nevertheless convicted, and Tom was prosecuted for <a href=\"/wiki/Perjury\" title=\"Perjury\">perjury</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> His trial took place on 25 July at the Kent Summer Assizes at <a href=\"/wiki/Maidstone\" title=\"Maidstone\">Maidstone</a> before Mr Justice Parke and a crowded court. Evidence was heard from the Vicar of <a href=\"/wiki/Boughton-under-Blean\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Boughton-under-Blean\">Boughton-under-Blean</a> that Tom had been at church when he claimed to have witnessed events off the <a href=\"/wiki/Goodwin_Sands\" title=\"Goodwin Sands\">Goodwin Sands</a>. In spite of the testimony of a number of character witnesses, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and Tom was sentenced to three months imprisonment and seven years <a href=\"/wiki/Penal_transportation\" title=\"Penal transportation\">transportation</a> to Australia.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tom's family in Truro had heard about the trial and Catherine Tom arrived in Maidstone in August to see if Courtenay was her missing husband. He was produced by the governor of Maidstone Gaol and she made a positive identification. Although Tom always denied any connection with the Truro family, Catherine Tom was believed. She told the authorities about her husband's previous attack of insanity; he was then examined by two surgeons who declared him of unsound mind. Tom was transferred to <a href=\"/wiki/Oakwood_Hospital\" title=\"Oakwood Hospital\">Barming Heath Asylum</a> on 28 October 1833.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tom was a model patient in the asylum and in 1837 the superintendent suggested to his wife that she should petition the home secretary for his release.

Vivian, after his election, took the matter up with the home secretary, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell\" title=\"John Russell, 1st Earl Russell\">Lord John Russell</a>, and Tom was granted a free pardon by <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Victoria\" title=\"Queen Victoria\">Queen Victoria</a>, on condition he was returned into the care of his family in Cornwall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Thom was still refusing to acknowledge the Cornish family and, instead of returning to Cornwall, went to live with a local farmer and supporter, Mr Francis of Fairbrook, Boughton-under-Blean, who had offered to be his guardian. This was permitted, due to some ambiguous wording on the pardon, and in October 1837, four years after his admission to the asylum, Tom was released.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Battle_and_death\">Battle and death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_Nichols_Thom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Battle and death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Bossenden_Wood\" title=\"Battle of Bossenden Wood\">Battle of Bossenden Wood</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg/220px-Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"226\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg/330px-Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg/440px-Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"601\" data-file-height=\"617\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Plaque_in_Hernhill_Churchyard.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Plaque in <a href=\"/wiki/Hernhill\" title=\"Hernhill\">Hernhill</a> churchyard</div></div></div>\n<p>By January 1838, Tom had fallen out with Mr Francis, and he spent the next few months riding through East Kent, relying on the hospitality of supporters.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> With promises of a better future, fairer distribution of wealth and greater equality, he attracted a following of agricultural labourers, artisans and small-holders. In particular, he addressed their concerns about low wages, lack of work, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Poor_Law_Amendment_Act_1834\" title=\"Poor Law Amendment Act 1834\">New Poor Law</a>, which ordered all able-bodied men to <a href=\"/wiki/Workhouse\" title=\"Workhouse\">workhouses</a> if they could not find work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Until the end of May, the activities of Tom and his small band of followers were entirely peaceful as they marched around the local countryside trying to drum up support amongst the workers. Some wealthier landowners were however becoming alarmed and, on 31 May 1838, a local magistrate, Dr Poore, issued a warrant for Tom's arrest for inciting workmen to leave their work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Early on the morning of 31 May, the parish constable of Boughton-under-Blean enlisted the help of his assistant and also of his brother, Nicholas Mears, and set off to find Tom.

The constable and his assistant fled.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> News of the murder reached the magistrates and soldiers were called out from the barracks at Canterbury.

Tom's followers numbered between thirty and forty (a few having managed to escape after the killing of the constable), and, with the exception of Tom and one other who had pistols, were armed only with sticks. As the soldiers advanced, Lieutenant Bennet was shot dead by Tom. In the ensuing confrontation, which lasted only a few minutes, Tom and eight of his followers were killed or mortally wounded by the soldiers, and a young special constable who was helping the soldiers was caught in their fire and killed.
