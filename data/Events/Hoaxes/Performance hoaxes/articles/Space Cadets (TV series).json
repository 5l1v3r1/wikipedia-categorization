The production crew went so far as to replace light switches and electrical outlets in the barracks with Russian standard, and smokers amongst the production crew were given Russian <a href=\"/wiki/Cigarette\" title=\"Cigarette\">cigarettes</a> to smoke in case any of the cadets discovered the butts. In addition, three of the Cadets were actors, included to misdirect any suspicious Cadets and to help reinforce the illusion.\n</p><p>Channel 4 had contingency plans if the contestants realised the hoax; Johnny Vaughan repeatedly suggested they would have to play old rerun episodes of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Jamie%27s_School_Dinners\" title=\"Jamie&#39;s School Dinners\">Jamie's School Dinners</a></i>, and after the \"launch\" some unchosen Cadets would have been used as a backup crew.\n</p><p>The show was originated by comedy writers Ben Caudell and <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Osman\" title=\"Richard Osman\">Richard Osman</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Participants\">Participants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Space_Cadets_(TV_series)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Participants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Andrew Carter, 19, a student from <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>.</li>\n<li>Sarah-Jane Cass, 19, a <a href=\"/wiki/Media_studies\" title=\"Media studies\">media studies</a> student from <a href=\"/wiki/Kent\" title=\"Kent\">Kent</a>.</li>\n<li>Cheryl Dearie, 23, a <a href=\"/wiki/Housing_association\" title=\"Housing association\">housing association</a> assistant (receptionist) from <a href=\"/wiki/Glasgow\" title=\"Glasgow\">Glasgow</a>.</li>\n<li>Paul French, 26, a <a href=\"/wiki/Plasterer\" title=\"Plasterer\">plasterer</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Bristol\" title=\"Bristol\">Bristol</a>.</li>\n<li>Keri Hassett, 25, a college administrator from <a href=\"/wiki/Birmingham\" title=\"Birmingham\">Birmingham</a>.</li>\n<li>Billy Jackson, 25, a <a href=\"/wiki/Recruitment_consultant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Recruitment consultant\">recruitment consultant</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Kent\" title=\"Kent\">Kent</a>.</li>\n<li>Ryan McBride, 28, an <a href=\"/wiki/Electrician\" title=\"Electrician\">electrician</a> living in <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>.</li>\n<li>Louise Nisbet, 23, a <a href=\"/wiki/Teacher\" title=\"Teacher\">teacher</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Whitstable\" title=\"Whitstable\">Whitstable</a>.</li>\n<li>Astrid Roberts, 19, a <a href=\"/wiki/Call_centre\" title=\"Call centre\">call centre</a> worker from <a href=\"/wiki/Glamorgan\" title=\"Glamorgan\">Glamorgan</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>French, Hassett and Jackson were chosen for the fake flight.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Actors\">Actors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Space_Cadets_(TV_series)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Actors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The three actor Cadets were <a href=\"/wiki/Charlie_Skelton\" title=\"Charlie Skelton\">Charlie Skelton</a>, Ranie Daw and Steve Hester.

Examples include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Cadet lectures that were \"about 80% true\", the rest being ludicrous rubbish; many of these lectures were of little practical use to cosmonauts (e.g. memory tests of the planets in the <a href=\"/wiki/Solar_system\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Solar system\">solar system</a>)</li>\n<li>Stereotyped characters, including a slow-talking <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Air_Force\" title=\"Royal Air Force\">Royal Air Force</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Squadron_Leader\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Squadron Leader\">Squadron Leader</a> with a luxuriant <a href=\"/wiki/Handlebar_moustache\" title=\"Handlebar moustache\">handlebar moustache</a></li>\n<li>Stupid training exercises (e.g. communications training involving reporting ever more implausible emergencies, ending with monkeys rampaging through the spacecraft, and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Rambo\" title=\"John Rambo\">Rambo</a> giving <a href=\"/wiki/The_Fonz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Fonz\">The Fonz</a> a high five)</li>\n<li>Nonsense Russian (e.g. having the Cadets salute a 'Russian Poem' which was actually the recipe for <a href=\"/wiki/Toad_in_the_hole\" title=\"Toad in the hole\">toad in the hole</a> or having the Russian pilot wear makeup, place plastic spoons in his hair and insist the Cadets act out <i><a href=\"/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alice in Wonderland\">Alice in Wonderland</a></i>)</li>\n<li>Nonsensical <a href=\"/wiki/Category:Space_science_experiments\" title=\"Category:Space science experiments\">space experiments</a>, including tests to make <a href=\"/wiki/Balloon_animal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Balloon animal\">balloon animals</a></li>\n<li>The motto of the establishment <i>S.T.A.R.</i> is '\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435'. The mission commander claimed this means 'We, the adventurers', but it actually means 'It's not rocket science', a phrase meaning that something is very easy, here taking on a double meaning.</li>\n<li>During the training lectures, the cadets were told that Russia's first cosmonaut to successfully orbit and return to earth was a monkey called Minsky (who is supposedly stuffed and kept on display at <i>S.T.A.R.</i>), and that the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Minsk\" title=\"Minsk\">Minsk</a> is named in her honour.</li>\n<li>According to one of the \"pilots\", if the shuttle was unable to land at the <i>S.T.A.R.</i> base in Russia, one of the back-up sites was at <a href=\"/wiki/Woodbridge,_Suffolk\" title=\"Woodbridge, Suffolk\">Woodbridge, UK</a>.

The Cadets were prepared for a <a href=\"/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Extra-vehicular activity\">spacewalk</a>, but once in the module Vaughan showed them a montage of their suspicions, finishing with an outside shot of the simulator, which was the moment when the \"cadets\" knew they had not left the Earth.

As the Cadets spent five days inside the simulator, there was considerable attention and budget given to its plausibility, including extensive <a href=\"/wiki/Surround_sound\" title=\"Surround sound\">surround sound</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pneumatic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pneumatic\">pneumatic</a> cushions, and a custom-built projector screen to display <a href=\"/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery\" title=\"Computer-generated imagery\">CGI graphics</a> of the Earth's surface.\n</p><p>The hangar, called Hush House, is formed from insulated <a href=\"/wiki/Stainless_steel\" title=\"Stainless steel\">stainless steel</a> walls and features an elaborate exhaust facility that enables the engines of <a href=\"/wiki/Jet_aircraft\" title=\"Jet aircraft\">jet aircraft</a> such as the <a href=\"/wiki/F-16_Fighting_Falcon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"F-16 Fighting Falcon\">F-16</a> to be tested with minimal interruption to local residents and livestock.
