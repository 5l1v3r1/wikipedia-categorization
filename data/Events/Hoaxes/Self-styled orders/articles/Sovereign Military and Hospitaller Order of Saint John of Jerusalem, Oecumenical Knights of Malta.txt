The Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Oecumenical Knights of Malta is one of the 26 unrecognised (self-styled) orders of St. John active in 2010.  The order is not affiliated with the genuine Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, Venerable Order of St John and Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg), which are, respectively, a Roman Catholic, Anglican and Protestant order of Knights-Hospitallers; neither of the genuine Orders of Saint John is fully oecumenical.  Their conjoint Committee on Orders of Saint John considers the so-called "Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Oecumenical Knights of Malta" to be a "false" order.  The "Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Oecumenial Knights of Malta" is linked to the Glorus Foundation, a so-called charitable trust and shareholder in the Euro-America Finance Holding International - Cayman Islands - Panama.  In Germany the same organisation is called the "Kreuz des SÃ¼dens" or "Cross of the South". The false name uses the reputation and the trust that are given to the genuine Orders of Saint John.  It attracts investors, mainly in the Caribbean, with promises of tax exemptions.
