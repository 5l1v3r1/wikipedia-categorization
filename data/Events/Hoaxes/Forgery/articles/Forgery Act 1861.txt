The Forgery Act 1861 (24 & 25 Vict c 98) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (as it then was). It consolidated provisions related to forgery from a number of earlier statutes into a single Act. For the most part these provisions were, according to the draftsman of the Act,  incorporated with little or no variation in their phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the criminal law consolidation Acts 1861. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It is essentially a revised version of an earlier consolidation Act, the Forgery Act 1830 (11 Geo 4 & 1 Will 4 c 66) (and the equivalent Irish Act), incorporating subsequent statutes.  Most of it was repealed by the Forgery Act 1913, and today forgery is mostly covered by the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 and the Identity Documents Act 2010. However three offences under the 1861 Act remain in force today (in sections 34, 36 and 37). These deal with forgery of registers of births, marriages and deaths, and with impersonation of a surety. This Act was repealed for England and Wales and Northern Ireland by the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, s.30 & Sch., Pt.I, so far as unrepealed, except ss. 34, 36, 37 & 55. It was repealed for the Republic of Ireland by section 3(1) of, and Schedule 1 to, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001. Certain kinds of forgery used to be high treason until this Act downgraded them to felonies. The Act does not apply to Scotland.  Section 1 - Forging the Great Seal, Privy Seal, etc. This section made it a felony to forge the great seal, privy seal, the Royal sign manual etc.. This had previously been high treason under the Forgery Act 1830. The 1861 Act reduced the penalty from death to penal servitude for life. This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the Forgery Act 1913. It was however replaced with section 5 of that Act, which made similar provision.
