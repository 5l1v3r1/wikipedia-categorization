The security features governing the security of an identity can be divided into three levels of security, i.e. Level 1 Security (L1S) (Overt), Level 2 Security (L2S) (Covert) and Level 3 Security (L3S) (Forensic). The three levels of security, in combination, provide comprehensive security coverage for identities and related documents to ensure their validity and authenticity. These are typically used to protect identity information on crucial documents such as identity cards, driving licenses and passports to ensure originality and accuracy of the identities they represent. The diagram below illustrates the different levels of security and how they ensure complete security coverage of an identity. Several kinds of technology that are new or in the process of being developed offer considerable potential for the creation of new types of document that identify individuals in a unique manner, can be rapidly and accurately read by machines and are difficult to falsify because they rely on information stored in a database out of the reach offenders rather than information provided in the document itself.
