Febold Feboldson is an American folk hero who was a Swedish American plainsman and cloudbuster from Nebraska.   His exploits were originally published in 1923 in an independent newspaper and the character is now largely considered a part of fakelore as opposed to a genuine folk hero. ("Febold" is also not a Swedish name.)
