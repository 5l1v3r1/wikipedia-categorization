The CERN ritual is a video that depicts an alleged occult ritual occurring in the grounds of CERN, a European nuclear research organization. The video showed several men dressed in black cloaks surrounding a statue of the Hindu deity Shiva and apparently stabbing a woman in a mock human sacrifice. The video ended with the man filming crying out and running away.  The video went viral in August 2016 and fueled many conspiracy theories concerning CERN. CERN later stated in its FAQ that the video was "fiction" and the actions violated its professional guidelines.  A CERN spokesperson stated that the video was a hoax and that no one was actually harmed.  The enactment was performed without any official permission. CERN stated that it "doesn't tolerate this kind of spoof" and that it can "give rise to misunderstandings about the scientific nature of our work‚Äù.  The video caused a lot of controversy and ignited conspiracy theories about CERN's activities. Given that the ritual was performed in front of a statue of a deity, many believed the ritual was satanic in nature. This further fueled theories that CERN's goal was to use their Large Hadron Collider to create a portal to hell, summon the antichrist, or resurrect the ancient gods.
