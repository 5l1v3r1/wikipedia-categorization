Palladists is a name for an alleged Theistic Satanist society or members of that society.  The name Palladian comes from Pallas and refers to wisdom and learning.   It is of no relation to the architectural palladian style of Andrea Palladio. In 1891 Léo Taxil (Gabriel Jogand-Pagès) and Adolphe Ricoux claimed to have discovered a Palladian Society.  An 1892 French book Le Diable au XIXe siècle (The Devil in the 19th Century", 1892), written by "Dr. Bataille" (actually Jogand-Pagès himself)  alleged that Palladists were Satanists based in Charleston, South Carolina, headed by the American Freemason Albert Pike and created by the Italian liberal patriot and author Giuseppe Mazzini.  Arthur Edward Waite, debunking the existence of the group in Devil-Worship in France, or The Question of Lucifer, ch. II: "The Mask of Masonry" (London, 1896),  reports according to "the works of Domenico Margiotta and Dr Bataille" that "[t]he Order of Palladium founded in Paris 20 May 1737 or Sovereign  Council of Wisdom" was a "Masonic diabolic order".  Dr. Bataille asserted that women would supposedly be initiated as "Companions of Penelope".   According to Dr. Bataille, the society had two orders, "Adelph" and "Companion of Ulysses"; however, the society was broken up by French law enforcement a few years after its founding.   A supposed Diana Vaughan published Confessions of an Ex-Palladist in 1895. On April 19, 1897, Léo Taxil called a press conference at which, he claimed, he would introduce Diana Vaughan to the press. At the conference instead he announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious. He thanked the Catholic clergy for their assistance in giving publicity to his wild claims.  The Palladists are the name of the Greenwich Village Satanist society in Val Lewton's film The Seventh Victim. The Palladists play a major role in the latter part of Umberto Eco's novel The Prague Cemetery (2011).
