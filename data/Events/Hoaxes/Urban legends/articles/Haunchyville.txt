Haunchyville is a mythical village of dwarfs in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States.  It is rumored to be located near Mystic Drive in Muskego, WI. Locals say that within the woods near Muskego, Wisconsin lives a conclave of dwarves whose homes are built-to-scale and in the woods. In the mythical village is said to live an old albino man, who serves as their protector. Legend has it, if trespassers are caught, the unruly dwarves cut their legs from the knees down, so they are forced to live like one of them.  In Punisher #16-17 (2002), Garth Ennis used the legend as basis for a two-part story in which "little people formed their own mob and cut off their rival mobsters' legs from the knees down, as Haunchyville residents supposedly do to trespassers. According to the legend, after continuous exploitiation of a number of circus dwarfs, they revolted against their ring leader. After killing their master they hanged him in a wooded area, after first cutting off his arms and legs. To avoid being arrested, or even worse consequences from the circus community, the dwarves set out to create their own community, built exclusively for dwarves.  The story goes that in the woods lives an old man, among the dwarfs. He is said to wait at the end of Mystic Drive, shot-gun in hand, to ward off anyone trying to cause trouble to the dwarves. The story also goes that he first met the group of dwarves as a child. As a young boy he accidentally stumbled upon Haunchyville, upon instantly treating them as equals, they sheltered the young boy and raised him as one of their own. As he grew up, he notoriously defended the dwarves, often resorting to violence.
