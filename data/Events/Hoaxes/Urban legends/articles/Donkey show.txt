A donkey show is a type of sexual performance most often associated with Tijuana, Mexico, in which a woman engages in bestiality with a donkey.   Local taxi drivers offer tourists a ride to see a donkey show in the red light district.  The shows are difficult to verify and may be urban legends, but anecdotal accounts are frequent.   Author Jim Dawson writes: "No doubt there are clandestine clubs that have put these sordid floorshows on display, but if every man who claims he actually saw one is telling the truth, there must be a lot of bowlegged women hobbling around Tijuana."  Gustavo Arellano, in his Â¡Ask a Mexican! column, argues that donkey shows are not real.  The "donkey show" in Tijuana myth is deeply embedded in American film, including Losin' It (1983), Bachelor Party (1984), The 40-Year Old Virgin (2005), Clerks II (2006), The Heartbreak Kid (2007), and Cake (2014).  In the 2005 book The Godfather Returns written by Mark Winegardner, Fredo Corleone's wife Deanna Dunn insists on attending one: "on a whim, they'd headed to Mexico. When they'd gotten there, Deanna Dunn, insisted on going to see a donkey show. ... who thought that watching a donkey fuck a teenage Indian girl was a hoot."  It is occasionally given as a reason to visit Tijuana. From time to time one may come across naive tourists going up and down La Coahuila street, unsuccessfully trying to find the show.  More recently the term has been used to describe a situation that has become a "complete mess".
