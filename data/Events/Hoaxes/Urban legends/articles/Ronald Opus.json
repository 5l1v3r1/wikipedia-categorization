Investigation to that point had revealed that the <a href=\"/wiki/Decedent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Decedent\">decedent</a> had jumped from the top of a ten-story building with the intent to commit <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide\" title=\"Suicide\">suicide</a>. (He left a <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide_note\" title=\"Suicide note\">note</a> indicating his despondency.) As he passed the 9th floor on the way down, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, killing him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a <a href=\"/wiki/Safety_net\" title=\"Safety net\">safety net</a> had been erected at the 8th floor level to protect some window washers, and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even if the mechanism might not be what they intended, is defined as having committed suicide. That he was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to <a href=\"/wiki/Homicide\" title=\"Homicide\">homicide</a>, but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had <a href=\"/wiki/Homicide\" title=\"Homicide\">homicide</a> on his hands.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Further investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9th floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. He was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight. Therefore, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife, and the pellets went through the window, striking the decedent.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>But further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal <a href=\"/wiki/Accident\" title=\"Accident\">accident</a>. That investigation showed that the mother (the old lady) had cut off her son's financial support, and her son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, Ronald Opus himself, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a <a href=\"/wiki/Shotgun\" title=\"Shotgun\">shotgun</a> blast through a 9th story <a href=\"/wiki/Window\" title=\"Window\">window</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>The medical examiner closed the case as a <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide\" title=\"Suicide\">suicide</a>.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_popular_culture\">In popular culture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Opus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: In popular culture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The case has appeared in the following shows and film:\n</p>\n<ul><li>TV series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Homicide:_Life_on_the_Street\" title=\"Homicide: Life on the Street\">Homicide</a></i>, episode 6.11 - \"<a href=\"/wiki/Homicide:_Life_on_the_Street_(season_6)#ep88\" title=\"Homicide: Life on the Street (season 6)\">Shaggy Dog, City Goat</a>\".</li>\n<li>the case was reported as true on Art Bell's Coast to Coast am in 1995.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Law_%26_Order\" title=\"Law &amp; Order\">Law &amp; Order</a></i>, in which <a href=\"/wiki/District_Attorney\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"District Attorney\">District Attorney</a> Ben Stone merely offered a hypothetical example of a man who jumped off the <a href=\"/wiki/Empire_State_Building\" title=\"Empire State Building\">Empire State Building</a> because he wanted a ham sandwich and was shot on the way down by someone who thought he was committing suicide.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/wiki/Australian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Australian\">Australian</a> TV show <i><a href=\"/wiki/Murder_Call\" title=\"Murder Call\">Murder Call</a></i>, in a 1998 episode.</li>\n<li>In the 1999 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Magnolia_(film)\" title=\"Magnolia (film)\">Magnolia</a></i>, written and directed by <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson\" title=\"Paul Thomas Anderson\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>, although in this version some parts of the story are changed and several details are added to give more consistency to the plot.</li>\n<li>In the <i><a href=\"/wiki/CSI:_Miami\" title=\"CSI: Miami\">CSI: Miami</a></i> episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Spring_Breakdown_(CSI:_Miami)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spring Breakdown (CSI: Miami)\">Spring Breakdown</a>\", a man was pushed off a building and was shot by a <a href=\"/wiki/Flare_gun\" title=\"Flare gun\">flare gun</a> on the way down.</li>\n<li>In the popular game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hitman:_Blood_Money\" title=\"Hitman: Blood Money\">Hitman: Blood Money</a></i>, after the player finishes the second last mission, Amendment XXV, there will be a news article about a man who committed suicide after failing to kill two Russian exchange students by poisoning their drinks and loading their gun with a bullet in hopes they will shoot each other during a Russian roulette.
