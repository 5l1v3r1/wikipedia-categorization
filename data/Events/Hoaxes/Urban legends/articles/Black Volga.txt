Black Volga (Polish: czarna wo≈Çga) refers to an urban legend widespread in Poland, Hungary, Russia,  Belarus, Ukraine, and Mongolia,  mainly in the 1960s and 1970s.     It was about a black (or in some versions red ) Volga limousine that was allegedly used to abduct people, especially children.  According to different versions, it was driven by priests, nuns, Jews, vampires, satanists or Satan himself.  The car is described as having white wheel rims, white curtains or other white elements.  Children were kidnapped to use their blood as a cure for rich Westerners or Arabs  suffering from leukemia; other variants used organ theft as the motive, combining it with another famous legend about kidney theft by the KGB. The legend surfaced again in the late 20th century, with a BMW or Mercedes car taking the Volga's place, sometimes depicted with horns instead of wing mirrors.  In this version, the driver would ask passers-by for the time and kill them when they approached the car to answer. In another version of the legend, the victim would die at the same time a day later.  Many[who?] suspect[original research?] that the story was circulated by the Polish secret police in order to detract validity from stories of real kidnappings by the government.
