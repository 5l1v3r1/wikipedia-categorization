The Sony timer (ソニータイマー) or Sony kill switch is a rumored element of Sony electronic products which causes them to fail soon after their warranty expires.  While it is unknown whether Sony is explicitly adding expiration devices to their hardware, the "Sony Timer" has also been taken to mean that Sony manufactures devices to withstand just enough use for Sony to produce a new line of the device. At the annual shareholders' meeting held on June 21, 2007 in Japan, Sony president Ryoji Chubachi said that he knew the word "Sony Timer".
