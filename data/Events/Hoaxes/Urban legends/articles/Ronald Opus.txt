Ronald Opus is the subject of a fictional murder case, often misreported as a true story. The case was originally told by Don Harper Mills, then president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, in a speech at a banquet in 1987. After it began to circulate on the internet as a factual story and attained the status of urban legend, Mills stated that he made it up as an illustrative anecdote  "to show how different legal consequences can follow each twist in a homicide inquiry".  The story first appeared on the Internet in August 1994  and has been widely circulated since, on webpages, in chat rooms, and even print publications. The reprints often include Mills's name and place it at a 1994 event, or attribute it to a supposed Associated Press report of the banquet.  Mills expresses little surprise, calling it "a fabulous story", and has fielded numerous inquiries about it over the years.  The incident has been adapted for various media, notably the Paul Thomas Anderson film Magnolia (1999) in which the protagonist is reimagined as "Sydney Barringer". The popular account of the story is told as follows: The case has appeared in the following shows and film:
