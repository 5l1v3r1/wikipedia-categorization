Kay's Cross was a large stone cross (roughly 20 feet (6.1 m) high by 13 feet (4.0 m) wide) located at the base of a hollow in northeastern Kaysville, Utah, United States.  Its origins are disputed, and several urban legends are tied to the site.  The cross was demolished with explosives by unknown persons in 1992. One account of the origin of the cross states it was built in 1946 by locals influenced by Krishna Venta, a religious leader in the 1940s and 50s, who claimed to be the Second Coming of Christ and led a small sect based out of Simi Valley, California. However others locals dispute this and say the cross was built by followers of a Mormon offshoot group lead by a man named Kingston.  On 15 February 1992, the cross was destroyed by an explosion; police made no immediate arrests.  In 2013, a "haunted" tour of Kay's Cross and the surrounding forest was started, stirring interest again in the decades-old legend.
