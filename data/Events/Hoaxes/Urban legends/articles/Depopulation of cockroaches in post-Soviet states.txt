A mass depopulation of cockroaches has been observed since the beginning of the 21st century in Russia and other countries of the former USSR. Observers have noted a quick disappearance of various types of cockroaches from cities and towns in Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus. Scientists from Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg have suggested that the Oriental cockroach should be added to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.   The depopulation of cockroaches may be exaggerated, or this phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic.    A number of explanations of the phenomenon are discussed in the media, of varying degree of credibility.
