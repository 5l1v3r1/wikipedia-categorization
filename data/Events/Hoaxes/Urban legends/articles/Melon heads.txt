In the American folklore of Michigan, Ohio, and Connecticut, Melon Heads are beings generally described as small humanoids bulbous heads who occasionally emerge from hiding places to attack people. Different variations of the legend attribute different origins to the entities.  The melon heads of Michigan are said to reside around Felt Mansion, although they have also been reportedly seen in southern forested areas of Ottawa County.  According to one story, they were originally children with hydrocephalus who lived at the Junction Insane Asylum near Felt Mansion.  The story explains that, after enduring physical and emotional abuse, they became feral and were released into the forests surrounding the asylum. The Allegan County Historical Society asserts that the asylum never existed, although it was at one point a prison;  however, the story has been part of the local folklore for several decades. Laketown Township Manager Al Meshkin told the Holland Sentinel that he had heard the tales as a teenager, noting that his friends referred to the beings as "wobbleheads". Some versions of the legend say that the children once lived in the mansion itself, but later retreated to a system of underground caverns (or caves in a nearby hill left over from an abandoned zoo).  Some versions of this legend say that the children devised a plan to escape and kill the doctor that abused them. It is said that the children had no place to hide the body, so they cut it up in small pieces which they hid around the Mansion. Rumors exist that teenagers who had broken into the mansion saw ghosts of the children and claimed to see shadows of the doctor's murder through the light coming from an open door. The legend has spread throughout the region, even becoming the subject of a 2011 film simply titled The Melonheads, which is based around the West Michigan legend.   The melon head stories of Ohio are primarily associated with the Cleveland suburb of Kirtland. According to local lore, the melon heads were originally orphans under the watch of a mysterious figure known as Dr. Crow (sometimes spelled Crowe, Trubaino, Krohe or Kroh or known as Dr. Melonhead ). Crow is said to have performed unusual experiments on the children, who developed large, hairless heads and malformed bodies.  Some accounts claim that the children were already suffering from hydrocephalus, and that Crow injected even more fluid into their brains.  Eventually, the legend continues, the children killed Crow, burned the orphanage, and retreated to the surrounding forests and supposedly feed on babies. Legend holds that the melon heads may be sighted along Wisner Road in Kirtland, and Chardon Township.   The melon head legend has been popularized on the Internet, particularly on the websites Creepy Cleveland and DeadOhio where users offer their own versions of the story.  A movie, "Legend of the Melonheads" was released in 2010 which is based on the Ohio legend and various other legends in the Kirtland area.
