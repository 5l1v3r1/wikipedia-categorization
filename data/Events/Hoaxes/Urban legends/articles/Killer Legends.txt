Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills investigate the origins of several urban legends: After directing Cropsey, a documentary that examines the similarities between a New York urban legend and a real-life kidnapper, Zeman approached Chiller with the idea of a series based on the intersection of urban legends and true crime.  For business reasons, the series was retooled into an anthology TV film.  Clowns were not initially planned to be a subject covered in the documentary, but Mills uncovered a large amount of information on them.  Upon bringing this to Zeman's attention, he agreed to expand the documentary to include them.  Killer Legends played for one night at the Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, New York on March 13, 2014.   Chiller aired it on March 16, 2014.   Breaking Glass Pictures released the DVD on July 1, 2014.   It was one of the top ten best-selling independent film on iTunes in July 2014.  Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and called it "a wholly fascinating experience on a lot of levels", though he criticized it for focusing so much on the filmmakers.
