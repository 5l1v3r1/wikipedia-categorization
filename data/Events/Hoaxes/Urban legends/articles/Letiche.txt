The letiche is a creature in Cajun folklore in Louisiana, United States, which haunts the bayous (swamps). It is variously described as the soul of an illegitimate unbaptized infant   or a human child raised by alligators.  The letiche is said to lurk in the bayous and upset boats and attack travelers.
