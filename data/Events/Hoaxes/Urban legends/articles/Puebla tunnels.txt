The Puebla tunnels are a system of tunnels under the Mexican city of Puebla. Long considered to be an urban legend, they were rediscovered in 2015. They are believed to be up to 500 years old.  The tunnel system is believed to extend for more than 10 kilometers. The city is planning to renovate part of the system and to open it for public viewing.   As of 2017, tunnels are open for tours from 10am-4pm and cost $25 Mexican pesos.
