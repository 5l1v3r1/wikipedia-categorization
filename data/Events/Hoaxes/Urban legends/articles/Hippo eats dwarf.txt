Hippo Eats Dwarf is the title of a hoax news article which claims that a dwarf was accidentally eaten by a hippopotamus. The urban legend has been circulating via the internet since the mid-1990s.  The article states that, in a "freak accident" at a circus in northern Thailand, a dwarf bounced off a trampoline and into a yawning hippopotamus' mouth, where he was abruptly swallowed whole. The hoax news story has been circulating the internet since 1994, when it was posted to Usenet.  Karl Pilkington, of The Ricky Gervais Show, once told the story in a segment called "Educating Ricky" in which Karl believed the story to be true. This led to both Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant laughing hysterically.  Comedian Lewis Black references it in a joke during a stand-up appearance.  A book entitled Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S., written by Alex Boese, takes its name from the popular hoax. It was published in 2006.
