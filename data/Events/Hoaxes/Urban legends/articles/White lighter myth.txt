The white lighter myth or white lighter curse is an urban legend based on the 27 Club of which several musicians and artists died while in possession of a white lighter, causing white lighters to be blamed for bad fortune.   The myth is primarily based on the deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse. The myth has been integrated with cannabis culture.     In 2017, Snopes.com published an article discrediting the theory, noting that Bic did not begin producing white disposable lighters until several years after the deaths of members of the 27 Club including Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison, and Winehouse, and that disposable lighters produced by other companies were not widely available at that time.
