Protest camps are physical camps that are set up by activists, to either provide a base for protest, or to delay, obstruct or prevent the focus of their protest by physically blocking it with the camp. They began in the 1920s and became famous in 1982 due to the publicity generated by the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp in England.
