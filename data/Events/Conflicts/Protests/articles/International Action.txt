International Action is a small, non-violent, political group in Hong Kong campaigning for a range of issues such as non-violence, social justice, human rights and democracy. The group was founded in 2004 and is made up of expatriate permanent residents and locals. Their website  claims that they represent the new breed of foreigners who reside in Hong Kong without the expatriate perks. International Action is not a closed group and welcomes anyone who may want to join. The group uses mixed campaign strategies of forging support and attention both in public and private spaces. The group's website states that it believes the democratic movement in Hong Kong needs to change its strategy to be more effective in the fight for real power for the people. It says the democratic camp should consider using tactics that are right for the cultural, social and political situation of Hong Kong in 2008.
