In the <a href=\"/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages\" title=\"Late Middle Ages\">Late Middle Ages</a> the bishop's thrones in the region were predominantly filled by members of comital families or the families of hereditary <a href=\"/wiki/Noblemen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Noblemen\">noblemen</a> (<i>Edelherren</i>). These families, like the <a href=\"/wiki/County_of_Mark\" title=\"County of Mark\">counts of the Mark</a>, attempted to secure episcopal seats for their sons. Even less powerful families took the opportunity to increase their influence, at least occasionally, over an ecclesial territory. To this group belonged the <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Lippe\" title=\"House of Lippe\">lords of Lippe</a>, who occupied the bishop's throne in <a href=\"/wiki/Bishopric_of_Paderborn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bishopric of Paderborn\">Paderborn</a> several times. The <a href=\"/wiki/County_of_Hoya\" title=\"County of Hoya\">counts of Hoya</a> were successful in the <a href=\"/wiki/Bishopric_of_Osnabr%C3%BCck\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck\">Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck</a>. In the <a href=\"/wiki/Bishopric_of_Minden\" title=\"Bishopric of Minden\">Bishopric of Minden</a> this was true of the houses of <a href=\"/wiki/County_of_Diepholz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"County of Diepholz\">Diepholz</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Schaumburg-Lippe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Schaumburg-Lippe\">Schaumburg</a>. In the mid-15th century, however, the <a href=\"/wiki/County_of_Moers\" title=\"County of Moers\">counts of Moers</a> were foremost in this regard. Especially after <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dietrich_of_Moers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Dietrich of Moers (page does not exist)\">Dietrich of Moers</a> had become <a href=\"/wiki/Archbishop_of_Cologne\" title=\"Archbishop of Cologne\">Archbishop of Cologne</a>, the family was able to secure the majority of the bishop's seats in the northwest German area. Their main rival in the Bishopric of M\u00fcnster was the Hoya family.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Internally, some of the <a href=\"/wiki/Prince-bishop\" title=\"Prince-bishop\">prince-bishops</a>, most recently <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Otto_IV_of_Hoya&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Otto IV of Hoya (page does not exist)\">Otto IV of Hoya</a>, had expanded their territory and got rid of smaller internal lordships. By contrast it was clear that the bishops in the 13th and 14th centuries had largely lost control of their capital, M\u00fcnster. The city acted independently almost as if it were a rich <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_immediacy\" title=\"Imperial immediacy\">imperially immediate</a> city. In addition, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/St%C3%A4nde\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St\u00e4nde\">St\u00e4nde</a></i>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Cathedral_chapter\" title=\"Cathedral chapter\">cathedral chapter</a>, knights and towns had gained influence and sharply reduced the power of the bishops.\n</p><p>After the death of Bishop Otto IV, Dietrich of Moers succeeded in getting his brother, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Henry_II_of_Moers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Henry II of Moers (page does not exist)\">Henry II of Moers</a>, into the M\u00fcnster bishopric against the will of the city of M\u00fcnster. After the archbishop, due to internal diocesan disputes, had secured the Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck for Erich of Hoya, he placed Henry there as administrator. He oriented his policy sharply towards his brother's interests and supported him strongly during the <a href=\"/wiki/Feud_of_Soest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feud of Soest\">Feud of Soest</a>. The House of Hoya, who also held the bishoprics of <a href=\"/wiki/Bishopric_of_Verden\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bishopric of Verden\">Verden</a> and Minden, saw the counts of Moers as intruders in their own area of interest. Apart from the <a href=\"/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Cologne\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archdiocese of Cologne\">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>, M\u00fcnster and Osnabr\u00fcck, the House of Moers ruled Paderborn and parts of the <a href=\"/wiki/Bishopric_of_Utrecht\" title=\"Bishopric of Utrecht\">Bishopric of Utrecht</a>. The warlike stance of Henry in supporting his brother did not help the diocese, rather it resulted in a sharp increase in its debt and a decline in prosperity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Start_of_the_conflict\">Start of the conflict</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%BCnster_Diocesan_Feud&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Start of the conflict\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Within the diocese, the estates were in open revolt by Henry's death. From now on, the aspirations of the House of Moers ran into resistance. Despite that, Dietrich did everything possible to continue to occupy M\u00fcnster with a member of his family. As a successor he had provided his brother Walram of Moers, but this brought him into conflict with the House of Hoya. John of Hoya had not forgotten that Dietrich of Moers was exchanged for members of his family. In particular, he had not forgotten his own six years imprisonment in connection with the fighting around Osnabr\u00fcck. He wanted to make his brother, Erich of Hoya, successor.\n</p><p>In addition to the two main rivals for the episcopacy, there were other contenders. The town of Osnabr\u00fcck strongly supported <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Conrad_III_of_Diepholz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Conrad III of Diepholz (page does not exist)\">Conrad of Diepholz</a>. He was the <a href=\"/wiki/Cathedral_provost\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cathedral provost\">cathedral provost</a> (<i>Dompropst</i>) in Osnabr\u00fcck and a nephew of the Bishop of Utrecht, <a href=\"/wiki/Rudolph_of_Diepholz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rudolph of Diepholz\">Rudolph of Diepholz</a>. He supported the candidacy, but arrived too late to actively promote his nephew.\n</p><p>Dietrich of Moers gave away large bribes to win a majority in the cathedral chapter for his brother. He had, until recently been a supporter of the <a href=\"/wiki/Council_of_Basel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Council of Basel\">Council of Basel</a>, before he changed sides to the Roman <a href=\"/wiki/Curia\" title=\"Curia\">curia</a>. Dietrich succeeded in getting the majority of the cathedral chapter on side at a meeting in <a href=\"/wiki/Hausd%C3%BClmen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hausd\u00fclmen\">Hausd\u00fclmen</a> on 15&#160;July 1450. But John of Hoya campaigned for his brother, Erich. He won over the citizens of the city of M\u00fcnster and the nobility to his cause. Within the city he was mainly supported by the guilds and the commoners, while the hereditary patricians on the council did not want confrontation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>John of Hoya was elected by the secular estates as the diocesan administrator (<i>Stiftsverweser</i>). He was to officiate until the Pope had appointed a bishop acceptable to both citizens and lords. In a letter to the Pope they explained their reasons for this unusual procedure were that Walram was allegedly responsible for two murders as well as other crimes in the past. By contrast, Erich of Hoya had led a supposedly blameless life and had had an academic education. A minority of thirteen canons and all the clergy of the city supported this position. In Osnabr\u00fcck, John of Hoya, succeeded his brother <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Albert_of_Hoya&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Albert of Hoya (page does not exist)\">Albert of Hoya</a> to become the administrator. Thus, the position of the family was further strengthened in the battle for the Diocese of M\u00fcnster.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As administrator, John of Hoya brought most of M\u00fcnster's <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_castle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Royal castle (page does not exist)\">royal castles</a> (<i>Landesburgen</i>) under his control. In order to reduce his own costs as far as possible, he seized the estates of the bishop and income of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cathedral_canon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cathedral canon\">cathedral canons</a> (<i>Domherren</i>). In addition, he introduced an <a href=\"/wiki/Excise_duty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Excise duty\">excise duty</a> on trade goods. The supporters of Walram in the cathedral chapter were prepared to negotiate in this eventuality. An agreement was reached that the Hoyas largely honoured, according to which at the next <i><a href=\"/wiki/Landtag\" title=\"Landtag\">Landtag</a></i> all the estates would appeal to the Pope to award the office of bishop to Erich of Hoya. In return the canons were guaranteed their former rights and income.

On 11&#160;June 1451, the Treaty of Haus D\u00fclmen was signed, sealing an alliance between Cleves and John of Hoya. As a reward for his support in the battle against Walram of Moers Cleves was given the estates of D\u00fclmen and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stromberg_Castle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Stromberg Castle (page does not exist)\">Stromberg</a>. Cleves was not just a valuable military ally. Also important was his advocacy through <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_III_of_Burgundy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Philip III of Burgundy\">Philip of Burgundy</a>, an uncle of the duke, in Rome. Following the signing of the treaty, Cleves declared war on Walram of Moers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Kohl_177_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Kohl_177-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On the same day news arrived in M\u00fcnster that Emperor <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_III_(HRR)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Frederick III (HRR)\">Frederick III</a> had conferred the <a href=\"/wiki/Regalia\" title=\"Regalia\">regalia</a> on Walram.

Nicholas of Cusa, however, expressed opposition to the Hoyas. With the fall of Vreden, Walram also lost his last town in the Diocese of Moers. He notified Cusa on 21 January 1452 of his willingness to renounce the bishopric, provided it was possible to remove keep the Hoyas out and to make Conrad of Diepholz bishop instead.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The latter was supported <i>inter alia</i> by his uncle, Bishop Rudolph of Utrecht. From now on the Hoyas encountered increasingly strong military action, for example at the Siege of Ahaus. At the start of 1452 a mercenary arm defeated Hoya and the M\u00fcnster troops and took large numbers of prisoners. On 2&#160;February the supporters of Diepholz declared a feud against their opponents. Walram pledged the latter the remaining settlements he owned - Ahaus and Ottenstein - to Rudolph of Utrecht. In the diocese itself, sympathy grew for Conrad of Diepholz, whose candidature appeared to be an increasingly attractive alternative to the former aspirants. The estates sought therefore, on 6&#160;October 1452 in <a href=\"/wiki/Coesfeld\" title=\"Coesfeld\">Coesfeld</a>, to reach a compromise, in order to get rid of both Walram of Moers and Erich of Hoya. All episcopal decisions since the death of Bishop Henry were declared null and void. In any case, these peace attempts failed. One reason was probably that John of Cleves continued to support Erich of Hoya.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>John of Hoya, who had previously left the town, returned to M\u00fcnster. Supported by the lower levels of the town of M\u00fcnster, John of Hoya transferred the diocesan regency in 1453 <i>de jure</i> to his brother Erich, so that the latter could prove himself as regent. Although the mayors of the towns opposed this, they eventually had to accept it under pressure from their townsfolk. Erich of Hoya was thereupon rendered homage in all the towns.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spread_of_the_conflict\">Spread of the conflict</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%BCnster_Diocesan_Feud&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Spread of the conflict\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This pitched the conflict into a new phase. Rudolph of Utrecht declared a feud against the town of M\u00fcnster and its three allies on 7&#160;July 1453. He succeeded in capturing the town of Vreden which, shortly thereafter was retaken by John of Hoya. Rudolph of Utrecht took advantage of disputes in the enemy camp and took a number of towns. Against the background of the triumphant advance of his opponent, in 1454 John of Hoya forced the re-election of the town council in M\u00fcnster which was sympathetic to his cause. The majority of the council came from the guilds and the common people, only a few hereditary patricians (<i>Erbm\u00e4nner</i>) were represented. In M\u00fcnster resistance to the harsh rule of the Hoyas started to increase. Moreover, in October 1454, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hansetag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hansetag\">Hansetag</a> demanded the restoration of the old council constitution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The allies around Walram of Moers and the Bishop of Utrecht managed to obtain assurances from the Pope, that all complaints from the opposite side to the Pope about spiritual penalties imposed by Walram were invalid. Those who aligned themselves with Walram were assured that they would receive absolution from any excommunication. Coesfeld was the first town to take advantage of the offer. This became the Walram's residence.\n</p><p>Because John of Cleves was temporarily unable to provide support due to his wedding, John of Hoya turned to Duke <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_II_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Frederick II of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg\">Frederick of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg</a> with a request for assistance. With his help John of Hoya attacked, plundering and destroying, the area of Coesfeld and the <a href=\"/wiki/County_of_Bentheim\" title=\"County of Bentheim\">County of Bentheim</a>, which supported his enemies. Walram and Dietrich initially lacked the means to defend themselves against it. In July, a body of troops belonging to the archbishop arrived in D\u00fclmen. Through a tactical mistake by Count John of Hoya, Duke Frederick's troops were alone when an allied army led by Dietrich of Moers, Walram of Moers, Rudolph of Utrecht, Bernard II of Bentheim, <a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_VII_of_Lippe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bernard VII of Lippe\">Bernard of Lippe</a> and Conrad of Diepholz attacked and inflicted a crushing defeat on their opponents in the Battle of Varlar. The Duke was captured. One more vigorous attack might have brought total success, but the allies were hampered by internal disputes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Minor_war_and_more_negotiations\">Minor war and more negotiations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%BCnster_Diocesan_Feud&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Minor war and more negotiations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>John of Hoya noticed that the mood in M\u00fcnster was turning against him. He offered to transfer all the towns and castles to Cleves. But John of Cleves now had other plans. He wanted to give the diocese to Simon of Lippe, while Eric of Hoya was to get the Diocese of Osnabr\u00fcck. He thus hoped that this would help to expel Bishop Rudolph from Utrecht. A short time later the latter died after he had ceded his rights to Ahaus and Ottenstein to Conrad of Diepholz. With his death, the allies of the House of Moers and Conrad of Diepholz lost their strongest supporter. The latter became Bishop of Osnabr\u00fcck, but did not give up his aim of becoming the bishop in M\u00fcnster as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the Diocese of M\u00fcnster, Walram of Moers continued to be opposed by John of Hoya. However, Dietrich of Moers did not pursue the matter with any great effort. So the fighting continued in the form of a minor war. In addition, negotiations took place which led to no result. One major success in early 1456 was the conquest of Coesfeld by John of Hoya. Then, in October 1456, Walram of Moers died in Arnhem. John of Hoya now relied on the support of the Duke of Burgundy. On behalf of Eric of Hoya he appealed for support to <a href=\"/wiki/Pope_Callistus_III\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pope Callistus III\">Pope Callistus III</a>, who was hoping that Burgundy would help him win the <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_Wars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ottoman Wars\">Ottoman Wars</a>. The strong support of Philip of Burgundy for Hoya's cause meant that the towns now aligned themselves more firmly on the side of John of Hoya than they had in recent years. Eric of Hoya was proposed as bishop by two of the canons. However, the majority of the canons chose Conrad of Diepholz. Both sides asked Rome for a decision.\n</p><p>John of Hoya sought to strengthen his position in M\u00fcnster by obtained citizenship in early 1457 and joining the Blacksmiths' Guild. A short time later he was elected to the Council. However, the Pope decided upon <a href=\"/wiki/John_of_Palatinate-Simmern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John of Palatinate-Simmern\">John of Palatinate-Simmern</a>, who had been totally uninvolved in the previous disputes. John of Hoya looked in vain to the support of Cleves and Burgundy once more. But even Conrad of Diepholz's aspiration to maintain his position failed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Outcome_and_aftermath\">Outcome and aftermath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%BCnster_Diocesan_Feud&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Outcome and aftermath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On 23 October 1457 the Treaty of Kranenburg was signed that ended the conflict. It stipulated that Eric of Hoya should receive a lifetime income equivalent to that of the Cologne provost office. The city of M\u00fcnster undertook to recognize the new bishop, to allow him to enter the town and to pay homage to him. In return, the new bishop agreed to recognize the existing privileges of the town. The new bishop also recognized the enfeoffment of the estates of D\u00fclmen and Stromberg to the Duke of Cleves. The latter also received compensation of 11,000 Rhenish guilders. In early November, the new bishop arrived in M\u00fcnster, swore the oath of office and the <a href=\"/wiki/Electoral_capitulation\" title=\"Electoral capitulation\">electoral capitulation</a>.\n</p><p>Earlier, John of Hoya had secretly left the town. Eric of Hoya died in 1458. <a href=\"/wiki/Bevergern_Castle\" title=\"Bevergern Castle\">Bevergern Castle</a> which had been enfeoffed to him was returned to the diocese. After the peace treaty, life in the diocese quickly returned to normal. The dominant position that the patrician's (<i>Erbm\u00e4nner</i>) had long held on M\u00fcnster's town council was broken, as the guilds secured the right to be represented by their members. The <i>Erbm\u00e4nner</i> only had half of the Council. In the end it was clear that the diocese had just become an object in the power game between noble families. The Emperor and Pope had lost any real influence. In the era of Henry and Walrams of Moers, some of the bishops had virtually lost any sense of their calling in faith to serve God and neighbour, but were simply out for themselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%BCnster_Diocesan_Feud&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 170\u2013171.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 171\u2013175.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 175\u2013176.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 176</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 176\u2013177.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Kohl_177-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Kohl_177_6-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Kohl_177_6-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 177.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">On the role of Burgundy see: <i>Burgund und das Reich: Sp\u00e4tmittelalterliche Au\u00dfenpolitik am Beispiel der Regierung Karls des K\u00fchnen (1465\u20131477).</i> Munich, 2002, pp.&#160;43\u201346.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 177\u2013178.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 178-179</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 179.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-11\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-11\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 180.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-12\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-12\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 181.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-13\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-13\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 181\u2013182.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-14\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-14\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 182.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-15\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-15\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 182\u2013183.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-16\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-16\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kohl (1999), 183\u2013184.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Literature\">Literature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%BCnster_Diocesan_Feud&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Literature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Wilhelm Kohl. <i>Die Bist\u00fcmer der Kirchenprovinz K\u00f6ln.
