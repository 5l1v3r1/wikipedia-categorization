Devaluation  and deregulation of foreign exchange brought windfall profits to agro-exporters, and were widely seen as a \u201cpolitical triumph\u201d for its main traditional exports.\n</p><p>In 1978 the United Coconut Planters Bank was given legal authority to purchase coconut mills, ostensibly as a measure to cope with excess capacity in the industry. At the same time, mills not owned by coconut farmers\u2014that is, Cocofed members or entities it controlled through the PCA\u2014were denied subsidy payments to compensate for the price controls on coconut-based consumer products. By early 1980, it was reported in the Philippine press that the United Coconut Oil Mills, a PCA-owned firm, and its president, Cojuangco, controlled 80 percent of the Philippine oil-milling capacity.[5] Minister of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile also exercised strong influence over the industry as chairman of both the United Coconut Planters Bank and United Coconut Oil Mills and honorary chairman of Cocofed. An industry composed of some 0.5 million farmers and 14,000 traders was, by the early 1980s, highly monopolized.[5]\n</p><p>In principle, the coconut farmers were to be the beneficiaries of the levy, which between March 1977 and September 1981 stabilized at P76 per 100 kilograms. Contingent benefits included life insurance, educational scholarships, and a cooking oil subsidy, but few actually benefited. The aim of the replanting program, controlled by Cojuangco, was to replace aging coconut trees with a hybrid of a Malaysian dwarf and West African tall varieties. The new palms were to produce five times the weight per year of existing trees. The target of replanting 60,000 trees a year was not met.[5] In 1983, 25 to 30 percent of coconut trees were estimated to be at least 60 years old; by 1988, the proportion had increased to between 35 and 40 percent.[5]\n</p><p>When coconut prices began to fall in the early 1980s, pressure mounted to alter the structure of the industry. In 1985, the Philippine government agreed to dismantle the United Coconut Oil Mills as part of an agreement with the IMF to bail out the Philippine economy. Later in 1988, United States law requiring foods using tropical oils to be labeled indicating the saturated fat content had a negative impact on an already ailing industry and gave rise to protests from coconut growers that similar requirements were not levied on oils produced in temperate climates.[5]\nPhilippine earnings, nevertheless, did not rise equally owing to worsening terms of trade. The country experienced severely declining terms of trade and great price instability for its agricultural exports from 1962 to 1985. These price movements were \u201cthe result of external political and economic forces over which the Philippines could exercise little control.\u201d<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The result was a redistribution of income from agro-export elite as a whole to a politically well-connected subset of that elite.\n</p><p>In declaring martial law, Marcos promised to save the country from \u201can oligarchy that appropriated for itself all power and bounty.\u201d But while he did indeed tame selected oligarchs most threatening to his regime, was a \u201cnew oligarchy\u201d of Marcos and his relatives and cronies which achieved dominance within many economic sectors. While foreign loans sustained decrease in the 1970s, crony abuses brought economic disaster in the early 1980s (de Dios, 1984). Most fundamentally, martial law perpetuated important shortcomings of the Philippine capitalism, because Marcos was merely expanding earlier patterns of patrimonial plunder. Particularistic demands continued to prevail, the difference being that one ruler now appropriated a much larger proportion of the state apparatus toward the service of his own private end. As the economic crisis intensified \u2013 especially after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino \u2013 the IMF transformed itself from \u201cdoting parent\u201d to\" vengeful god\" and forced a wrenching process of economic stabilization that induced severe recession. This heightened the regime\u2019s unpopularity, assisted the continuing growth of both leftist and moderate resistance throughout the archipelago, and paved away for the Marcos regime\u2019s demise amid the \u201cpeople power\u201d uprising of February 1986. More thoroughgoing attempts at reform awaited the advent of a new democratic era.\nMarcos increased the stature of technocrats within the government and, through their public rhetoric in favor of policy reform, help to ensure the continued flow of loans into the country. Over time, however, became increasingly clear that technocracy would have to give way to an acquisitive and more influential diversified family conglomerates. Marcos and his cronies used access to the political machinery to accumulate wealth, and \u2013 like the major families of the pre-martial law years - had little loyalty to the nation. The cronyism of the Marcos regime was more obvious than the cronyism of either the pre-1972 period or the post-1986 years, since the regime had more centralized control over the state apparatus and enjoyed much longer tenure in office.\nWhile special interest groups continued to prevail, the difference was that a dictator now had a much firmer grip on the state apparatus to service his own private end.\nOligarchic plunder was manifest in the crony capitalists that controlled the industries during the dictatorial regime. Crony capitalists \u201cwere businessmen who walk the corridors of the presidency and by virtue of this proximity to Marcos drove policy making and by doing so were able to control specific sectors of the economy.\u201d\n</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Battle_for_stabilization.2C_1983-1986\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Battle_for_stabilization,_1983-1986\">Battle for stabilization, 1983-1986</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Battle for stabilization, 1983-1986\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<p>The mixed but generally positive results of the stabilization period were\naccompanied by rising domestic political tensions and violence.

The campaign and election were\nalso more violent than previous elections; by one estimate, two hundred\npeople were killed during the campaign (Shaplen 1979, 21 1).

At that point in time, the country had debt that began crippling the country which slowly made the Philippines the \u201cLatin-American in East Asia\u201d as it started to experience the worst <a href=\"/wiki/Recession\" title=\"Recession\">recession</a> since the post-war era.\n</p><p>Most of the immediate efforts of the Aquino administration was directed in reforming the image of the country and paying off all debts, including those that some governments were ready to write-off, as possible. This resulted in budget cuts and further aggravated the plight of the lower class because the jobs offered to them by the government was now gone. Infrastructure projects, including repairs, were halted in secluded provinces turning concrete roads into asphalt. Privatization of many government corporations, most catering utilities, was the priority of the Aquino administration which led to massive lay-offs and inflation. The Aquino administration however, was persistent in its belief that the problems were caused by the previous administration.\n</p><p>Growth gradually began in the next few years of the administration. Somehow, there was still a short-lived, patchy, and erratic recovery from 1987 to 1991 as the political situation stabilized a bit. With this, the peso became more competitive, confidence of investors was gradually regained, positive movements in terms of trade were realized, and regional growth gradually strengthened.\n</p><p>There were other key events in the administration that affected the economy. Perhaps the first most important, aside from the ratification of the <a href=\"/wiki/1987_Constitution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"1987 Constitution\">1987 Constitution</a>, would be the administration\u2019s pushing for a more open political framework where the administration somehow gave in to the interests of new economic actors. This approach, which also proved important in regaining the confidence of investors, whether domestic or foreign, was definitely unthinkable during the Marcos era. The administration was also characterized by the rescheduling and management of international debts, an exhibition perhaps of the fact that other external entities also sympathized with what happened to the Philippines and also allowed the Philippines to get back on track before anything else.\n</p><p>Development in this administration, however, was slightly bothered by some unforeseen circumstances such as organized coups by the Reformed Armed Forces Movement in 1991. Negotiations with Mindanao also stalled development along with the coup attempts. The Philippines was also hit by the oil price hike effects of the <a href=\"/wiki/Gulf_War\" title=\"Gulf War\">Gulf War</a>. Pressure on government spending and safety nets was intensified as natural calamities like earthquakes and the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo plagued the country, just as if the daily brownouts were not bad enough.\n</p><p>One of the most important policies of the administration is the launching of the <a href=\"/wiki/Comprehensive_Agrarian_Reform_Program\" title=\"Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program\">Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program</a> in June 1988, which involved the acquisition and redistribution of all agricultural lands within a time frame of 10 years. So far, the law has already had numerous accomplishments since it was actually passed. There were setbacks, however, in the overall implementation of this reform program such as the Garchitorena scandal (1989) tainting the <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Agrarian_Reform\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department of Agrarian Reform\">Department of Agrarian Reform</a> (DAR) and supposedly exposing inefficiencies in the government bureaucracy. Another important breakthrough involved in the program was the fact that the program was also seen as a way to address poverty and equity issues.\n</p><p>Also important in the administration were the trade reforms. The trade reforms pushed by the administration were those that improved export growth and foreign trade through the abolishing of export taxes, the gradual liberalization of imports, and the imposition of an anti-export bias ideal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The reforms also involved the reduction in trade barriers, more specifically by removing restrictions on imports and reforming the import-licensing system. Tariff rates were also eventually reduced to encourage more foreign trade.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The administration was also a big part in the realization of the <a href=\"/wiki/ASEAN_Free_Trade_Area\" title=\"ASEAN Free Trade Area\">ASEAN Free Trade Area</a> which also served as encouragement for foreign trade.\n</p><p>Some other policies in the administration included fiscal contraction in order to control and manage inflation (Balisacan and Hill, \u201cThe Philippine Economy\u201d 110). The administration was also able to reorganize the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Economic_and_Development_Authority\" title=\"National Economic and Development Authority\">National Economic and Development Authority</a>, or NEDA, to its present form last July 22, 1987 and the Philippine Exporters\u2019 Confederation (PHILEXPORT) in October 1991. The administration was also instrumental in introducing a new framework for infrastructure development which said that \u201cthe government should provide the enabling policy environment for greater private sector participation in infrastructure provision\u201d (Balisacan and Hill, \u201cThe Dynamics\u201d 330). As for industry dispersal and regional growth, the administration conceptualized and enforced the Local Government Code of 1991 which increased the autonomy and development of Local Government Units through decentralization.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ramos_administration\">Ramos administration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Ramos administration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Ramos administration basically served its role as the carrier of the momentum of reform and as an important vehicle in \u201chastening the pace of liberalization and openness in the country\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The administration was a proponent of <a href=\"/wiki/Capital_account\" title=\"Capital account\">capital account</a> liberalization, which made the country more open to foreign trade, investments, and relations. It was during this administration when the <a href=\"/wiki/Bangko_Sentral_ng_Pilipinas\" title=\"Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</a> was established, and this administration was also when the Philippines joined the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Trade_Organization\" title=\"World Trade Organization\">World Trade Organization</a> and other free trade associations such as the <a href=\"/wiki/APEC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"APEC\">APEC</a>. During the administration, debt reduction was also put into consideration and as such, the issuance of certain government bonds called <a href=\"/wiki/Brady_Bonds\" title=\"Brady Bonds\">Brady Bonds</a> also came to fruition in 1992. Key negotiations with conflicting forces in Mindanao actually became more successful during the administration, which also highlighted the great role and contributions of Jose Almonte as the key adviser of this liberal administration.\n</p><p>By the time Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already burdened with a heavy budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the <a href=\"/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund\" title=\"International Monetary Fund\">International Monetary Fund</a> and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned the formation of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, on the part of the Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).\n</p><p>The daily brownouts that plagued the economy were also addressed through the enactment of policies that placed guaranteed rates. The economy during the first year of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent brownouts, each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The economy seemed to be all set for long-run growth, as shown by sustainable and promising growth rates from 1994 to 1997. However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, was that it was able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis better than anybody else in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Perhaps some of the most important policies and breakthroughs of the administration are the Capital Account Liberalization and the subsequent commitments to free trade associations such as APEC, AFTA, GATT, and WTO. The liberalization and opening of the capital opening culminated in full-peso convertibility in 1992.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Balisacanand_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Balisacanand-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> And then another breakthrough is again, the establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which also involved the reduction of debts in that the debts of the old central bank were taken off its books.\n</p><p>In line with the administration\u2019s \u201cPhilippines 2000\u201d platform, the administration gave more favor to privatization and targeted the proliferation of cartels and monopolies, especially in some key industries such as telecommunications. To further raise revenues, President Ramos also administered the privatization of Petron, Philippine National Bank (PNB), Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewage System (MWSS) and military-based lands such as Fort Bonifacio and Clark Air Base. As part of the administration\u2019s competition policy, the administration also advocated for deregulation of service industries to promote foreign investment and increase private sector participation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> For monetary policy, the administration focused on \u201cinflating targeting and the imposition of a floating exchange rate with a managed band\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Balisacanand_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Balisacanand-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> With this, inflation stayed under control in the 1990s and indeed, the 1990s became an era of reform and at the same time, a period of optimism.\n</p><p>For fiscal policy, on the other hand, the administration worked on bills to expand the scope of VAT.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Due to the need to reduce budget deficit, tax-enhancement measures were imposed. Among these were the \u201cupward adjustment in the excise tax on cigarettes, withholding VAT or value-added tax on government contractors and suppliers, and establishment of a large taxpayers\u2019 unit in the Bureau of Internal Revenue\" which increased tax revenue of government. There was even a budget surplus in the years 1994 to 1996 due to the effective tax-enhancement program by the administration.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Ramos administration basically continued the actions of the Aquino administration for infrastructures and industry dispersal. This administration, however, would also have some contributions to welfare. The administration\u2019s population policy promoted population management and family planning, while the administration\u2019s Social Reform Agenda (SRA) addressed poverty through flagship programs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Completion of the CARP, or Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, was one such breakthrough incorporated in the SRA. By June 1998, it was reported by the government that it had only managed to accomplish 57%, a figure still far from the planned total ten year target from the original timetable for land distribution (Ochoa 167).\n</p><p>Furthermore, Ramos was wholly focused on institutional reform in an attempt to capture the international community\u2019s perception of an improving a Philippine economy, with the agenda of increasing global competitiveness. The rural sector\u2019s interest was not much represented. Farmers had insufficient funding for rural infrastructure and support services while real estate developers agreed on better deals.  To quote Ochoa, \u201cthe liberalization of agriculture ensured their dependence on so-called safety nets that could not significantly resuscitate the sector. Six years of \u2018dipping productivity, declining incomes, dwindling farmlands and pervasive poverty\u2019 will be hard to forget\" (165).\n</p><p>In the end, the Philippine economy under the Ramos administration gained recognition in breaking out of its deficit-laden stature in Asia. \u201cThe confidence generated by the administration among local and international players and analysts resulted from wide\u2010ranging reforms rooted primarily in a sound macroeconomic and investor\u2010friendly regime as well as global competitiveness\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> From 1993, one year\u2019s time after Ramos assumed presidency, the economy already started to recover from stagnation with real GDP growth peaking at 5.8% in 1996. Aside from this, it was also during his administration that allowed for the escape of the Philippine economy from recession, during the Asian Financial Crisis, unlike its Asian neighbors like Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. His reforms have brought gains, broad spillover effects on the rest of the economy and possible positive long-term effects on economic growth. Surely, it is of no doubt that Ramos is commendable to have established strong political leadership that was mandatory in handling the reforms, prior to the weak state of the economy he inherited.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Estrada_administration\">Estrada administration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Estrada administration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Although Estrada\u2019s administration had to endure the continued shocks of the Asian Crisis contagion, the administration was also characterized by the administration\u2019s economic mismanagement and \u201cmidnight cabinets.\u201d As if the pro-poor rhetoric, promises and drama were not really appalling enough, the administration also had \u201cmidnight cabinets composed of \u2018drinking buddies\u2019 influencing the decisions of the \u2018daytime cabinet\u2019\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>). <a href=\"/wiki/Cronyism\" title=\"Cronyism\">Cronyism</a> and other big issues caused the country\u2019s image of economic stability to change towards the worse. And instead of adjustments happening, people saw further deterioration and hopelessness that better things can happen. Targeted revenues were not reached, implementation of policies became very slow, and fiscal adjustments were not efficiently conceptualized and implemented. All those disasters caused by numerous mistakes were made worse by the sudden entrance of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Jueteng\" title=\"Jueteng\">Jueteng</a></i> controversy, which gave rise to the succeeding EDSA Revolutions.\n</p><p>Despite all these controversies, the administration still had some meaningful and profound policies to applaud. The administration presents a reprise of the population policy, which involved the assisting of married couples to achieve their fertility goals, reduce unwanted fertility and match their unmet need for contraception. The administration also pushed for budget appropriations for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped due to the fact that the church condemned it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program \u201cSustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Macapagal-Arroyo_administration\">Macapagal-Arroyo administration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Macapagal-Arroyo administration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Arroyo administration, economically speaking, was a period of good growth rates simultaneous with the USA, due perhaps to the emergence of the <a href=\"/wiki/Overseas_Filipino\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Overseas Filipino\">Overseas Filipino</a> workers (OFW) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Business_Process_Outsourcing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Business Process Outsourcing\">Business Process Outsourcing</a> (BPO). The emergence of the OFW and the BPO improved the contributions of OFW remittances and investments to growth. In 2004, however, fiscal deficits grew and grew as tax collections fell, perhaps due to rampant and wide scale <a href=\"/wiki/Tax_avoidance_and_tax_evasion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tax avoidance and tax evasion\">tax avoidance and tax evasion</a> incidences. Fearing that a doomsday prophecy featuring the [Argentina default] in 2002 might come to fruition, perhaps due to the same sort of fiscal crisis, the administration pushed for the enactment of the 12% VAT and the E-VAT to increase tax revenue and address the large fiscal deficits. This boosted fiscal policy confidence and brought the economy back on track once again.\n</p><p>Soon afterwards, political instability afflicted the country and the economy anew with <a href=\"/wiki/Abu_Sayyaf\" title=\"Abu Sayyaf\">Abu Sayyaf</a> terrors intensifying. The administration's Legitimacy Crisis also became a hot issue and threat to the authority of the Arroyo administration. Moreover, the Arroyo administration went through many raps and charges because of some controversial deals such as the NBN-ZTE Broadband Deal. Due however to the support of local leaders and the majority of the House of Representatives, political stability was restored and threats to the administration were quelled and subdued. Towards the end of the administration, high inflation rates for rice and oil in 2008 started to plague the country anew, and this led to another fiscal crisis, which actually came along with the major recession that the United States and the rest of the world were actually experiencing.\n</p><p>The important policies of the Arroyo administration highlighted the importance of regional development, tourism, and foreign investments into the country. Therefore, apart from the enactment and establishment of the E-VAT policy to address the worsening fiscal deficits, the administration also pushed for regional development studies in order to address certain regional issues such as disparities in regional per capita income and the effects of commercial communities on rural growth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The administration also advocated for investments to improve tourism, especially in other unexplored regions that actually need development touches as well. To further improve tourism, the administration launched the policy touching on Holiday Economics, which involves the changing of days in which we would celebrate certain holidays. Indeed, through the Holiday Economics approach, investments and tourism really improved. As for investment, the Arroyo administration would normally go through lots of trips to other countries in order to encourage foreign investments for the betterment of the Philippine economy and its development.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Benigno_Aquino_III_administration\">Benigno Aquino III administration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Benigno Aquino III administration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Philippines consistently coined as one of the Newly Industrialized Countries has had a fair gain during the latter years under the Arroyo Presidency to the current administration. The government managed foreign debts falling from 58% in 2008 to 47% of total government borrowings. According to the 2012 World Wealth Report, the Philippines was the fastest growing economy in the world in 2010 with a GDP growth of 7.3% driven by the growing business process outsourcing and overseas remittances.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PHGrowth_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PHGrowth-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The country marked slipped to 3.6% in 2011 less emphasis on exports and the government spent less on infrastructure. Also the disruption of the flow of imports for raw material from floods in Thailand and the tsunami in Japan have affected the manufacturing sector in the same year. \"The Philippines contributed more than $125 million as of end-2011 to the pool of money disbursed by the International Monetary Fund to help address the financial crisis confronting economies in Europe.This was according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which reported Tuesday that the Philippines, which enjoys growing foreign exchange reserves, has made available about $251.5 million to the IMF to finance the assistance program\u2014the Financial Transactions Plan (FTP)\u2014for crisis-stricken countries.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-PHLeander_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PHLeander-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Remarkably the economy grew by 6.59% in 2012 the same year the Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href=\"/wiki/Renato_Corona\" title=\"Renato Corona\">Renato Corona</a> was impeached for a failed disclosure of statements of assets, liabilities and network or SALN coherent to the anti-corruption campaign of the administration.<sup id=\"cite_ref-CJConviction_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CJConviction-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> The Philippine Stock Exchange index ended in the year with 5,812.73 points a 32.95% growth from the 4,371.96-finish in 2011.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PSEi_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PSEi-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>BBB- investment grade by Fitch Ratings on the first quarter of 2013 for the country was made because of a resilient economy by remittances, growth despite the global economic crisis in the last five years reforms by the VAT reform law of 2005, BSP inflation management, good governance reforms under the Aquino administration.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Invest_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Invest-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_issues_and_prospects\">Special issues and prospects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: Special issues and prospects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_harmony_of_the_deep_determinants\">The harmony of the deep determinants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: The harmony of the deep determinants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One of the biggest issues of development is the management of the so-called \u201cdeep determinants\u201d of economic growth and development. Thus, an issue for the economy today is to keep these determinants and factors in check. The determinants that countries have to keep in check would include physical infrastructure, demographics, population, geography, political and social stability, and investment atmosphere, among others. Now a question to raise here is how is the Philippines actually doing when it comes to these determinants?\n</p><p>The Philippines is falling behind neighbors when it comes to physical infrastructure. This period of global development is such a crucial period, and countries definitely cannot afford to \u201cunderinvest\u201d in infrastructure development. Population, on the other hand, definitely has to be checked out. As of this moment in time, it seems as if the population is starting to become a slight puzzle to development and thus, issues directed towards population, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/RH_Bill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"RH Bill\">RH Bill</a> issue, need to be resolved quickly. Moreover, aside from labor, the economy and institutions really have to start looking for more productive uses of population, or maybe ways in which population growth can be made to synch with economic growth. Population growth is also higher in the Philippines than in any of the neighboring countries so maximization of such a development can be of great help.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, when it comes to the environment and natural resources, the Philippines continues to be plagued by the degradation and loss of precious natural resources. Typhoons like the ferocious tandem of Ondoy and Pepeng in 2009, as well as earthquakes, also continue to plague the country\u2019s resources. So aside from some explicit policies for environmental development and preservation such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)\" title=\"Clean Air Act (United States)\">Clean Air Act</a> and policies that regulate the waste materials of factories, the economy and the institutions should continue to address the problems faced by natural resources.\n</p><p>Political and social stability are also important in maintaining sustainable development. Elections and competent leadership have to be kept organized and consistent with the kind of political organization that serves as a good premise for development. Legal and judicial processes have to undergo reform and the systems must become quicker this time. Consistency of policies is also an important thing to observe in the future because it seems that in the past administrations, many inconsistencies, most especially when it comes to economic policies, actually come into the picture as regimes change. Conflicts with Mindanao also have to be resolved once and for all.\n</p><p>One more major concern plaguing the country is the investment atmosphere prevalent in the country. Aside from the already mentioned underinvestment in infrastructure, some more investment issues that need to be addressed include the attention that must be given to corporate governance and the stock market and the protections that have to be developed for investments and property rights. The investment environment is still shaky, perhaps also because of the quality of government in the Philippines. Perhaps it is clear that the country and the institutions need to push for improved quality of governance for the betterment of the investment atmosphere in the country.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Poverty_alleviation_and_economics_with_heart\">Poverty alleviation and economics with heart</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Poverty alleviation and economics with heart\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Generally, during the period in question, roughly a third of the population of the Philippines was below what is called the Threshold Family Income(TFI). Even until now, this continues to be true. Villegas presented that in 1991, poverty incidence hit 39.9%, and 4,780,865 families actually fell below the TFI value. Things became a bit better in 1994, with poverty incidence dropping to 35.5%. Gradually, poverty incidence dropped to around 26% in 2001 (586-588). This, however, still isn\u2019t something to applaud about. Until now, the distribution of wealth in the country is still inequitable, and the lowering of poverty incidence does not mean that it is really low enough to serve as a premise for development. And even though poverty incidence keeps on getting lower and lower, other crucial welfare factors, such as education, are still left unanswered. Malnutrition, low life expectancy, substandard housing, and child labor are still rampant even today, and there is this clear need for food and nutrition, health, education, housing, utility improvements, just so the poor families can have better grasps of subsistence.\n</p><p>Villegas enumerated some measures or ways to address poverty. Perhaps the first and most important of which is to \u201cefficiently use the poor\u2019s most abundant asset, which is labor\u201d (597). Aside from these of course can come the provision of basic needs and the enactment of macroeconomic adjustments directed towards the development of the poor. Safety nets and other adjustment programs can also help.\n</p><p>Each administration during the period in question also responded to calls to eradicate poverty in their own ways. The Aquino administration touched on the generation of employment opportunities and the promotion of social justice. Moreover, the administration also pointed to the CARP as another institutionalized means to address poverty and social development through profit sharing, wealth redistribution, and labor administration. Meanwhile, the Ramos administration pushed forward the Social Reform Agenda which instituted flagship programs for the poor provinces in the country and prioritized the basic needs of people before attending to other economic demands.\n</p><p>Although Estrada\u2019s poverty alleviation platform dubbed \u201cErap Para sa Mahirap\u201d seemed to be full of rhetoric and drama elements, there still seems to be this intent to actually address poverty and this acknowledgement that every administration has to at least heed the call. Estrada\u2019s poverty alleviation plan included the delivery of social development services, the removal of policy impediments to effective resource allocation, and the enactment of Lingap Para sa Mahirap where the 100 poorest families were identified and given packages of assistance. Arroyo would then follow this up with KALAHI (Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan) and programs for asset reform, provision of human development services, creation of employment, and social protection, among others.\n</p><p>Though development and poverty alleviation cannot be acquired by an economy instantly, it would be honorable even just to try to show everyone that honest efforts are actually being exerted. The conceptualization, development, and enactment of policies are definitely not enough. Belief in the spirit of creative entrepreneurship and the devotion of policymakers to the people and stakeholders that they govern are at least equally, if not more important, for poverty alleviation to actually come to fruition.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_informal_economy\">The informal economy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: The informal economy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The informal economy or the <a href=\"/wiki/Informal_sector\" title=\"Informal sector\">informal sector</a>, also referred to by the names \u201cblack market\u201d and \u201cunderground market,\u201d consists of entrepreneurs who engage in economic activities that fail to fulfill certain legal requirements even though their objectives are actually lawful. Perhaps the talipapa and sidewalk vendors can be good examples of this sector of the economy. Other examples could include the street children who sell sampaguita, or even people who engage in criminal acts affecting the economy, such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, and theft. The other more popular forms of informality can perhaps be the informal financial sector (loan sharks) and the proliferation of informal settlements, or squatters\u2019 areas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> People normally dive into the informal sector due to poverty where they are somehow forced to produce or create income, or even due to the feeling that they are not being treated fairly by economic institutions. People who engage in informal activities somehow believe that informal economic activity is an expression of freedom from all the binding policies of the economy, and it is only then when they finally feel the true essence of being in a free market economy.\n</p><p>Informal economic activity accounts for between 25 and 40 percent of Gross National Income. Meaning, some  informal income is not really accounted for in the aggregate production figures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Informal economic activity really has to be addressed, and perhaps one of the best ways to do so is to study the roots of such activity and phenomenon, namely the loopholes of the legal system and mercantilist thought. In the legal system, there always seems to be injustice and in such a system, there would always be favored entities and forgotten entities. The current legal system also appears to be full of loopholes which give rise to many illegitimate opportunity structures, giving people some chance to actually get around the legal system. Thus, it would definitely be important to constitute reforms in the legal system to ensure fair play in the economy. If the atmosphere of fair play can be fostered and taken care of, then it is likely that informal players would go back to the formal economy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Economic_crisis_and_response\">Economic crisis and response</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economic_history_of_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33\" title=\"Edit section: Economic crisis and response\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <b>global economic crisis</b> of 2008 pulled countries around the globe into a <a href=\"/wiki/Recession\" title=\"Recession\">recession</a>.
