Male unemployment is unemployment, being out of work and actively seeking to work, among men. The 2008â€“2012 global recession has been called a "mancession" because of the disproportionate number of men who lost their jobs as compared to women.  This gender gap became wide in the United States in 2009, when 10.5% of men in the labor force were unemployed, compared with 8% of women.    Three quarters of the jobs lost in the recession in the U.S. were held by men.   Unemployment has been linked to extremely adverse effects on men's mental health.  Professor Ian Hickie of the University of Sydney said that evidence showed that men have more restricted social networks than women, and that those they do have are heavily work-based. Therefore for men the loss of a job means the loss of a whole set of social connections as well. This loss can then lead to men becoming socially isolated very quickly.  In the US, only 100 men for every 135 women are receiving bachelor's degrees because of the feminization of the education system over the last 20 years.
