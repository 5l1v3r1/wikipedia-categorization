Many factories, electrical plants, and transportation facilities were built along these lines. The most dramatic showpiece was the Moscow subway. The <a href=\"/wiki/Moscow_Metro\" title=\"Moscow Metro\">Moscow Metro</a> opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. <a href=\"/wiki/Lazar_Kaganovich\" title=\"Lazar Kaganovich\">Lazar Kaganovich</a> was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example,  the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus.\" (Soviet man).<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  Soviet workers did the labor and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground.

With the end of large-scale immigration, populations stabilized and the plentiful jobs in the cities pulled families upwards in terms of social mobility. Investment in office buildings, stores, factories, utilities, streets, and, especially, apartments and single-family homes, added substantially to the infrastructure, and contributed to the notion that better times lay ahead. However, after 1929, the optimism ebbed away, overwhelmed by a deepening pessimism that made long-term private investment seem inadvisable.\n</p><p>The Depression's damage to large cities, suburbs, towns and rural areas varied according to the economic base.  Most serious in larger cities was the collapse of the construction industry with new starts falling to less than 10% of the norm of the late 1920s.  Although much needed work was deferred, maintenance and repair of existing structures comprised over a third of the private sector construction budget in the 1930s. Devastating was the disappearance of 2 million high paying jobs in the construction trades, plus the loss of profits and rents that humbled many thousands of landlords and real estate investors.\n</p><p>Second came the general downturn in industry, especially heavy manufacturing. Steel in <a href=\"/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Gary,_Indiana\" title=\"Gary, Indiana\">Gary, Indiana</a>, and automobiles in <a href=\"/wiki/Detroit\" title=\"Detroit\">Detroit</a> took the heaviest hits, along with railroads and <a href=\"/wiki/Coal_mining\" title=\"Coal mining\">coal mining</a>. In these sectors, the largest cities suffered somewhat less than smaller mill towns, mining camps and railroad centers.  Unemployment was a problem everywhere, but it was less severe among women than men, among workers in non-durable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs.  A sharp educational gradient meant that the less skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates than the high-school and college educated men who lived in outer zones and suburbs.\n</p><p>Although suburbia stopped growing, it did not suffer nearly as much as the central cities.  While some unemployed came to the cities looking for relief, it appears that even larger numbers of unemployed returned to family farms. For the first time ever, the movement of native population was away from cities and toward rural America.\n</p><p>The fiscal soundness of city and county governments was challenged by the rise in relief expenditures and the sharp fall in tax collections. The <a href=\"/wiki/Herbert_Hoover\" title=\"Herbert Hoover\">Hoover</a> Administration had encouraged state and local governments to expand public works projects, which they did in 1930 and 1931. While this expansion may have slowed the rise in unemployment, the spending was a luxury that could not be borne in the face of falling tax revenues and the unwillingness of investors to put more money into municipal bonds. After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Relief\">Relief</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cities_in_the_Great_Depression&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Relief\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While local relief before 1932 focused on providing small sums of cash or baskets of food and coal for the neediest, the federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Deal\" title=\"New Deal\">New Deal</a> tried to use massive construction projects with prevailing wages to jumpstart the economy and solve the unemployment crisis.  ERA, <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration\" title=\"Federal Emergency Relief Administration\">FERA</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration\" title=\"Works Progress Administration\">WPA</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Public_Works_Administration\" title=\"Public Works Administration\">PWA</a> built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. In sharp contrast to Britain, where private housing construction pulled the country out of depression, American cities saw little private construction or investment, and so they languished in the economic doldrums even as their parks, sewers, airports and municipal buildings were enhanced. The problem in retrospect was that the New Deal's investment in the public infrastructure had only a small \"multiplier\" effect, in contrast to the high multiplier for jobs that private investment might have created.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Deal_politics\">New Deal politics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cities_in_the_Great_Depression&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: New Deal politics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> had a magnetic appeal to the city dwellers&#8212;he brought relief and recognition of their ethnic leaders and ward bosses, as well as labor unions. Taxpayers, small business and the middle class voted for Roosevelt in 1936 but turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 seemed to belie his promises of recovery. Roosevelt's <a href=\"/wiki/New_Deal_Coalition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Deal Coalition\">New Deal Coalition</a> discovered an entirely new use for city machines in his three reelection campaigns of the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Deal\" title=\"New Deal\">New Deal</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second World War\">Second World War</a>. Traditionally, local bosses minimized turnout so as to guarantee reliable control of their wards and legislative districts. To carry the <a href=\"/wiki/Electoral_college\" title=\"Electoral college\">electoral college</a>, however, Roosevelt needed to carry the entire state, and thus needed massive majorities in the largest cities to overcome the hostility of suburbs  and towns.\n</p><p>With <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Hopkins\" title=\"Harry Hopkins\">Harry Hopkins</a> his <a href=\"/wiki/Majordomo\" title=\"Majordomo\">majordomo</a>, Roosevelt used the WPA as a national political machine.  Men on relief could get WPA jobs regardless of their politics, but hundreds of thousands of well-paid supervisory jobs were given to the local Democratic machines.  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% of their ballots for Roosevelt. The vibrant labor unions, heavily based in the cities, likewise did their utmost for their benefactor, voting 80% for him, as did <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Irish American\">Irish</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Italian_American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Italian American\">Italian</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jewish American\">Jewish</a> voters. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt won reelection in 1940 thanks to the cities.  In the <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_United_States\" title=\"Northern United States\">North</a>, the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored Willkie 52%-48%. It was just enough to provide the critical electoral college  margin. With the start of full-scale war mobilization in the  summer of 1940, the cities revived. The new war economy pumped  massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock  munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Organized_crime\">Organized crime</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cities_in_the_Great_Depression&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Organized crime\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/American_mafia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American mafia\">American mafia</a> and some other <a href=\"/wiki/Organized_crime\" title=\"Organized crime\">organized crime</a> syndicates, which had emerged during Prohibition, usually retained power despite heavy pressure from the FBI and federal authorities.
