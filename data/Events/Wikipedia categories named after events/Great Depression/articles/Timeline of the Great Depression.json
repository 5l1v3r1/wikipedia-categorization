The initial decline lasted from mid-1929 to mid-1931. During this time, most people believed that the decline was merely a bad recession, worse than the recessions that occurred in 1923 and 1927, but not as bad as the <a href=\"/wiki/Depression_of_1920-21\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Depression of 1920-21\">Depression of 1920-21</a>. Economic forecasters throughout 1930 cheerily predicted an economic rebound come 1931, and felt vindicated by a stock market rally in the spring of 1930. \n</p><p>The stock market crash in the first few weeks had a limited direct effect on the broader economy, as only 16% of the U.S. population was invested in the market in any form. But thousands of investors and banks lost money when 10% of invested wealth was lost almost overnight, with prospect of further losses. The crash created uncertainty in people\u2019s minds about the future of the economy. This distrust in future income reduced consumption expenditure.  As demand for commodities decreased, so did their prices.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Temin_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Temin-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> However, many banks that had engaged in risky investments in the stock market, and/or had lent money to individuals engaged in trading, suffered balance sheet losses that reduced their capital ratios. Mounting losses from further stock market declines and a worsening macroeconomy would further strain the banking system. Over $34 million in wealth would be lost from the collapses in leverage investment products in 1929 offered by Goldman Sachs alone.\n</p><p>An increasing number of bank failures in late-1930 interrupted the process of credit creation and reduced the money supply, harming consumption. After a second round of banking panics in mid-1931, there was a major change in people\u2019s expectations about the future of the economy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Temin_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Temin-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This fear of reduced future income coupled with the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" title=\"Federal Reserve System\">Fed\u2019s</a> deflationary <a href=\"/wiki/Monetary_policy\" title=\"Monetary policy\">monetary policy</a> resulted in a deflationary spiral that cratered consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production. This further depressed the economy until <a href=\"/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt\" title=\"Franklin D.

The gold standard made the involved nations interdependent on each other's policies. Due to a <a href=\"/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fixed exchange rate\">fixed exchange rate</a>, the only way to affect the demand for gold was through interest rates. For example, if interest rates were high in one country, then investors would have no reason to exchange currency for gold and the gold reserves would remain stable. However, if interest rates were low in a different country then its investors would elect to move their funds abroad where interest rates were higher.  In order to stop this from happening, each nation within the gold standard union had no choice but to raise its interest rates in correspondence with its fellow nation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ben_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ben-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This interconnectivity of deflationary policy amongst so many nations resulted in the prolongation of the greatest economic downturn.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#1929\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1929</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#1930\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1930</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#1931\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1931</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#1932\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1932</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#1933\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1933</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1929\">1929</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Great_Depression&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: 1929\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>January - June:</b> the <a href=\"/wiki/Roaring_Twenties\" title=\"Roaring Twenties\">Roaring Twenties</a> continue unabated.

Further decreases in trade of manufactured products led to layoffs and reduced corporate profits, weakening the economy. General consensus among economists is that the Smoot-Hawley Act did not cause the Depression, but did worsen it and stunted recovery efforts after 1933.

Creditanstalt represented 16% of Austria's GDP, and could not find another institution to guarantee liquidity. 140 million Austrian Schillings were lost. The collapse of Creditanstalt caused the Bank of France, the National Bank of Belgium, the Netherlands Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to begin a run on the U.S. Dollar for their gold reserves, and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates from 1.5% to 3.5% to maintain the gold standards, which in turn contributed to the deepening of the Depression and the second round of banking failures in the U.S. during the summer of 1931. <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>May:</b> The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate bottoms out at 1.5%.\n</p><p><b>May\u2013June:</b> Second major round of U.S. bank failures and worsening economic situation contributes to permanent change in people's expectation of the economy.

Although private banks in New York City and the Bank of England begin emergency lending to Germany, the banking crisis spills over into Hungary and Romania, and the collapse of the economy paves the way for Adolf Hitler's rise in the July 1932 and March 1933 elections.

The New York Fed had loan $150 million in gold (some 240 tons) to European central banks, and the wisdom of this was questioned as European countries rapidly abandoned the gold standard.
