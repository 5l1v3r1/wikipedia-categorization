The Great Depression which followed the US stock market crash of 1929 badly affected the countries of Latin America.  Chile, Peru, and Bolivia were, according to a League of Nations report, the countries worst-hit by the Great Depression. The rise of fascism also became apparent in Latin American countries in the 1930s due to the Great Depression. Fascist governments were the result of a desire for nationalism, which rulers like  Get√∫lio Vargas of Brazil  played on through propaganda.  Haiti, for its part, came out of the Great Depression as an independent country after the US pulled out their troops in 1936. In Brazil and in other Latin American countries such as Mexico, responses to the Great Depression also led to a strengthening of the industrialization process (begun in the nineteenth century). Brazil needed an economic alternative to the highly devalued coffee, its main commodity at the time. The Vargas government started to purchase and burn coffee from the farmers, in order to avoid their complete bankruptcy.
