During the 1930s  the United States was facing its longest and deepest economic downturn, the Great Depression. Spending money on entertainment was out of the question for most people. The United States put the nation back to work, including artists and entertainers in its assistance programs. The entertainers, in turn, provided cheap or free amusements for people, which allowed them to forget about their troubles for a while.  Many films still highly cherished today were created during the 1920s. During that period, Walt Disney, the pioneer animator, produced films Americans loved to see. One of his best known animations was the tale of the Three Little Pigs, originally produced in 1933. This is another of his that became a part of American culture. Half a century later, his productions are still famous and frequently viewed by children and adults. Many flicks were created during this time, including, "42nd Street", "The Wizard of Oz", and "Gone With the Wind". Comedies were popular films in the 1930s. A good laugh eased the mind and brought joy in a time of adversity. Towards the late 1930s, films that showed how America was fighting against the Great Depression became popular as well. Listening to radio broadcasting became a source of nearly free entertainment for millions of Americans. The radio stations had a little bit of everything for all ages, young and old. One of the most common radio shows for young children was Little Orphan Annie.  The show is about an adventurous young girl who had an equally adventurous dog named Sandy. Together, Annie and Sandy would try to solve mysteries. The show was so loved by children that they soon began to purchase small items of merchandise such as pins of Annie. Later, an actual film was released to the public.  Adults listened to newscasts, radio theater, the Grand Ole Opry, soap operas, and sermons as well.
