 The Great Contraction is Milton Friedman's term for the recession which led to the Great Depression.  The term served as the title for the relevant chapter in Friedman and Schwartz's 1963 work A Monetary History of the United States. The chapter was later published as a stand-alone paperback entitled The Great Contraction, 1929â€“33 in 1965. Both books are still in print from Princeton University Press, and some editions include as an appendix a speech by Ben Bernanke honoring Milton Friedman.  Friedman argued that the Federal Reserve could have lessened the severity of the Depression, but failed to exercise its role of managing the monetary system and ameliorating banking panics. The authors got an endorsement from an unlikely source during an event in their honor when Ben Bernanke made this statement: "Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."  Economists such as Paul Krugman refer to the similarly named (and sometimes confused with) Great Compression as a period during which economic equality rose due to the progressive tax policies instituted during the years of World War II and the policies of the Roosevelt Administration.
