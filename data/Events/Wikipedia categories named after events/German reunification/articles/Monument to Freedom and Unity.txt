The Monument to Freedom and Unity (German: Denkmal für Freiheit und Einheit) is a planned national German monument in Berlin commemorating the country's peaceful reunification in 1990 and earlier 18th, 19th and 20th century unification movements. It was agreed on 9 November 2007 by a decree of the Bundestag.  The decree proposed the site of the former National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument on the Schlossfreiheit for the new structure, next to the site of the City Palace Berlin that is reconstructed since 2013. The monument would carry on its surface the slogans of the 1989 demonstrations: "Wir sind das Volk, Wir sind ein Volk" which means (We are the People, We are one People).  In early June 2017, the Bundestag decided to start construction of the memorial in front of the City Palace according to the design of Milla & Partner. It is to be inaugurated on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 2019.  Coordinates: 52°30′59.0″N 13°24′00.0″E﻿ / ﻿52.516389°N 13.400000°E﻿ / 52.516389; 13.400000
