Floodwall, an installation by Jana Napoli, is composed of drawers salvaged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.  In 2005, two months after Hurricane Katrina and the collapse of the levee system, Napoli collected debris from the storm. She retrieved 750 drawers from dressers, kitchen cabinets, desks and bureaus.  The empty drawers were cleaned, and the addresses of the houses were marked on the back.  Napoli stated that "Floodwall was made in an attempt to give voice to the silence of a city in ruin and a people in diaspora."  The  contents  that remained were then photographed. The resulting  objects along with the recorded oral histories make up the installation.  Floodwall poses the question to its onlookers: what price are we willing to pay for the protection of the intimacy of our households?   From Floodwall's first construction in 2007, Napoli has installed it in multiple ways. Sometimes installed as a monumental wall, Floodwall stands eight feet tall and stretches as long as 192 feet.  Floodwall has been displayed on the floor like tombstones in a cemetery, sometimes functioning as a memorial and other times a room that envelops the spectator.  The installation has also been used as a setting for collaborative theater performances involving singing and dance. Drawers and Personal Stories: part of the exhibition is a collection of recorded oral histories from the original drawer owners. This gathering of these oral histories is an ongoing project that assembles audio recordings—interviews. A selection of these recordings may be heard here:  The list of  drawer owners may be viewed here:  • New York, New York- January 4 – February 9, 2007.
