Build Now is a non-profit organization located in New Orleans, Louisiana, that works with clients whose homes were destroyed as a result of Hurricane Katrina to build new homes on their property.  Build Now was founded by New Orleans native William Monaghan and is now directed by his daughter Tess Monaghan.   Build Now is a licensed and insured residential contractor, and constructs site-built, elevated houses that reflect the style and quality of traditional New Orleans architecture.  Since 2008, Build Now has built new homes for nearly a dozen New Orleans families, with 7 houses currently under construction around the city. Build Now moved their first resident home in January 2009 and have moved several other families back home since.  Hundreds of additional families have benefitted from the organizationâ€™s educational programs on topics such as   how to obtain the money you need to elevate your home, how to improve your credit score and qualify for a loan, and how to improve the indoor air quality of your home.  Build Now offers 14 different house plans that range in price from $105,000 to $165,000.  The designs mix traditional New Orleans architecture with basic green features such as energy-efficient wall construction, heavy-duty roof insulation and large windows to reduce reliance on electric lights.
