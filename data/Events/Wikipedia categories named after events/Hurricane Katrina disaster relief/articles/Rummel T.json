After <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina\" title=\"Hurricane Katrina\">Hurricane Katrina</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Archdiocese_of_New_Orleans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archdiocese of New Orleans\">Archdiocese of New Orleans</a> realized the need for a temporary school for displaced students from Catholic high schools in the devastated <a href=\"/wiki/New_Orleans\" title=\"New Orleans\">New Orleans</a> area. <a href=\"/wiki/Archbishop_Rummel_High_School\" title=\"Archbishop Rummel High School\">Archbishop Rummel High School</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Metairie,_Louisiana\" title=\"Metairie, Louisiana\">Metairie, LA</a>, volunteered to take on the monumental task of accepting 1300 more students to their campus. Rummel set up a platooning schedule, with traditional Rummel Students going from 6:30 to 12:30 every morning and Transition students going from 1:30 to 6:00 PM. Thus Archbishop Rummel Transition School (ARTS or Rummel T) was born. The school featured students from various Catholic schools along the <a href=\"/wiki/Gulf_Coast\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gulf Coast\">Gulf Coast</a>, including <a href=\"/wiki/St._Stanislaus_High_School\" title=\"St. Stanislaus High School\">St. Stanislaus</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Bay_St._Louis,_MS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bay St. Louis, MS\">Bay St. Louis, MS</a>.

Students took six classes, and the rotation was Day A (Periods 1,2,3) and Day B (Periods 4,5,6). Student's schedules were geared towards making the transition back to their home schools as easily as possible. <a href=\"/wiki/Honors_course\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Honors course\">Honors courses</a> were available; however, no <a href=\"/wiki/Advanced_placement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Advanced placement\">AP</a> classes were scheduled, much to the dismay of AP students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Athletics\">Athletics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rummel_T&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Athletics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Rummel T fielded several girls athletic teams, including <a href=\"/wiki/Volleyball\" title=\"Volleyball\">volleyball</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Basketball\" title=\"Basketball\">basketball</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Swimming_(sport)\" title=\"Swimming (sport)\">swimming</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Cross_country_running\" title=\"Cross country running\">cross country</a>.

The day school also opened many of its activities to the Transition school; most notable was the campus ministry nights once a month. Also, a dance committee was formed to organize the \"Homegoing Dance.\" The committee hosted bakesales and even a day of Christmas Caroling to help fund the dance, which featured two local bands.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Announcements\">Announcements</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rummel_T&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Announcements\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A signature element of Rummel T was the afternoon announcements held at the beginning and end of each day. The day started with a traditional Rummel prayer that includes the tagline \"Thank God Almighty I'm A Raider.\" This became a running joke with the Transition students and even made it on one of the two Rummel T t-shirt designs. Every so often, \"Mr. Gabe\" would be joined by students making fools of themselves on the announcements, or Mr. Gabriel would poke fun at his fellow administrators.\n</p><p>On one memorable occasion, an administrator scolded the ladies for not wearing their uniform socks appropriately, stating that their visible ankles were distracting the male students. Of note, this co-ed high school experience was new to most students, who otherwise attended single-sex schools.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Media_coverage\">Media coverage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rummel_T&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Media coverage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Rummel T constantly made the news, as local news crews made expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9 on life after Katrina, and the Archdiocese used the school to hold many of its press conferences. Louisiana governor (then a U.S. Representative) <a href=\"/wiki/Bobby_Jindal\" title=\"Bobby Jindal\">Bobby Jindal</a> even paid a visit to the school to speak with the students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rummel_T&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.rummelraiders.com\">Web page for the Rummel Raiders.</a></li></ul>\n<p><span id=\"coordinates\" class=\"metadata coord-missing\"></span>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1274\nCached time: 20180905050855\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.026 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 65/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 436/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 123/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    7.422      1 Template:Coord_missing\n100.00%    7.422      1 -total\n 21.72%    1.612      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:3512268-0!canonical and timestamp 20180905050855 and revision id 809238375\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Louisiana_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_coordinates"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Hurricane_Katrina_disaster_relief"},{"sortkey":"Archbishop Rummel Transition School","*":"Defunct_Catholic_secondary_schools_in_Louisiana"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Advanced placement"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Archbishop Rummel High School"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Archdiocese of New Orleans"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Basketball"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bay St. Louis, MS"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bobby Jindal"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Brother Martin High School"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cross country running"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gulf Coast"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Honors course"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hurricane Katrina"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Metairie, Louisiana"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mount Carmel Academy (Louisiana)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Orleans"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"St. Mary's Dominican High School"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"St. Stanislaus High School"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Swimming (sport)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ursuline Academy (New Orleans, Louisiana)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Volleyball"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Coord missing"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"}],"images":["Button2_4x4_copy.jpg"],"externallinks":["http://www.rummelraiders.com"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Academics","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Rummel_T","byteoffset":1197,"anchor":"Academics"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Athletics","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Rummel_T","byteoffset":1634,"anchor":"Athletics"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Extracurriculars","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Rummel_T","byteoffset":1960,"anchor":"Extracurriculars"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Announcements","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Rummel_T","byteoffset":2357,"anchor":"Announcements"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Media coverage","number":"5","index":"5","fromtitle":"Rummel_T","byteoffset":3171,"anchor":"Media_coverage"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"6","index":"6","fromtitle":"Rummel_T","byteoffset":3494,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Rummel T","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7379316"}]}}
