McKenna was introduced to two of the criminals who would carry out the raid \u2014 Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards \u2014 by London solicitor's clerk Brian Field. His name was kept secret, and he was known to the robbers only as \"The Ulsterman\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The raid was devised over a period of months by a core team: Goody and Edwards, along with <a href=\"/wiki/Bruce_Reynolds\" title=\"Bruce Reynolds\">Bruce Reynolds</a>, Charlie Wilson and Roy James, Reynolds assuming the role of \"mastermind\" for the robbery. This gang, although very successful in the criminal underworld, had virtually no experience in stopping and robbing trains.  So it was agreed to enlist the help of another London gang called The South Coast Raiders. This group, which included Tommy Wisbey, Bob Welch and Jim Hussey, who were already accomplished train robbers<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Other associates (including Ronnie Biggs, a man Reynolds had previously met in jail) were added as the organisation evolved, and the final gang who took part in the raid comprised a total of 16 men.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Royal_Mail_train\">Royal Mail train</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Royal Mail train\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At 18:50 on Wednesday 7 August 1963, the <a href=\"/wiki/Travelling_post_office\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Travelling post office\">travelling post office</a> (TPO) \"Up Special\" train set off from <a href=\"/wiki/Glasgow_Central_station\" title=\"Glasgow Central station\">Glasgow Central station</a> <i>en route</i> to <a href=\"/wiki/Euston_railway_station\" title=\"Euston railway station\">Euston Station</a> in London.

The train consisted of 12 carriages and carried 72 <a href=\"/wiki/General_Post_Office\" title=\"General Post Office\">Post Office</a> staff who sorted mail during the journey.\n</p><p>Mail was loaded onto the train at Glasgow and also during station stops <i>en route</i>, and from line-side collection points where local post office staff would hang mail sacks on elevated track-side hooks that were caught by nets deployed by the on-board staff. Sorted mail on the train could be dropped off at the same time.  This process of exchange allowed mail to be distributed locally without delaying the train with unnecessary stops. One of the carriages involved in the robbery is preserved at the <a href=\"/wiki/Nene_Valley_Railway\" title=\"Nene Valley Railway\">Nene Valley Railway</a>.\n</p><p>The second carriage behind the engine was known as the HVP (high value packages) coach, which carried large quantities of money and registered mail for sorting.  Usually the value of the shipment was in the region of \u00a3300,000, but because the previous weekend had been a UK <a href=\"/wiki/Bank_Holiday\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bank Holiday\">Bank Holiday</a> weekend, the total on the day of the robbery was to be between \u00a32.5 and \u00a33 million.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1960, the Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) recommended the fitting of alarms to all Travelling Post Offices with HVP carriages. This recommendation was implemented in 1961, but HVP carriages without alarms were retained in reserve.  By August 1963, three HVP carriages were equipped with alarms, bars over the windows and bolts and catches on the doors, but at the time of the robbery, these carriages were out of service, so a reserve carriage (M30204M) without those features had to be used.  The fitting of radios was also considered, but they were deemed to be too expensive, and the measure was not implemented.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PMA_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PMA-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This carriage was kept for evidence for seven years following the event and then burned at a scrapyard in Norfolk in the presence of police and post office officials to deter any souvenir hunters.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stopping_the_train\">Stopping the train</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Stopping the train\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Just after 03:00 on 8 August, the driver, 58-year old <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Mills\" title=\"Jack Mills\">Jack Mills</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Crewe\" title=\"Crewe\">Crewe</a>, stopped the train on the <a href=\"/wiki/West_Coast_Main_Line\" title=\"West Coast Main Line\">West Coast Main Line</a> at a red signal light at Sears Crossing, Ledburn, between <a href=\"/wiki/Leighton_Buzzard_railway_station\" title=\"Leighton Buzzard railway station\">Leighton Buzzard</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cheddington_railway_station\" title=\"Cheddington railway station\">Cheddington</a>. The signal had been tampered with by the robbers: they had covered the green light and connected a six-volt <a href=\"/wiki/British_Ever_Ready_Electrical_Company\" title=\"British Ever Ready Electrical Company\">Ever Ready</a> battery to power the red light. The locomotive's second crew member, known as the secondman or \"fireman\", was 26-year-old <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=David_Whitby&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"David Whitby (page does not exist)\">David Whitby</a>, also from Crewe. As a signal stop was unexpected at this time and place, Whitby climbed down from the cab to call the signalman from a line-side telephone, only to find the cables had been cut. As he made his return to the train, he was grabbed from behind and quickly overpowered by one of the robbers. Meanwhile, the driver was waiting in the cab for Whitby's return. Gang members then entered the cabin from both sides of the train, and as Mills grappled with one robber and attempted to force him off the footplate, he was struck from behind by another gang member with a <a href=\"/wiki/Club_(weapon)\" title=\"Club (weapon)\">cosh</a>, rendering him semi-conscious.\n</p><p>At this stage, the robbers had foreseen that they would encounter a problem. They had to move the train from where it had been stopped to a suitable place to load their ex-army dropside truck with the stolen money. Bridge No.127 (Bridego Bridge, now known as Mentmore<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Bridge), approximately half a mile (800 m) further along the track was the chosen location.\n</p><p>One of the robbers (masquerading as a school teacher) had spent months befriending railway staff and familiarising himself with the layout and operation of trains and carriages. Ultimately though, it was decided that it would be better to use an experienced train driver to move the locomotive and the first two carriages from the signals to the bridge after uncoupling the carriages containing the rest of the sorters and the ordinary mail.\n</p><p>On the night, the gang's hired train driver (an acquaintance of Ronnie Biggs, later referred to as \"<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stan_Agate&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Stan Agate (page does not exist)\">Stan Agate</a>\" or \"Peter\")  was unable to operate this newer type of locomotive; although having driven trains for many years (by then retired), he was experienced only on shunting (switching) locomotives on the <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Region_of_British_Railways\" title=\"Southern Region of British Railways\">Southern Region</a>.  With no other alternative available to them, it was quickly decided that Mills would have to move the train to the stopping point near the bridge, which was indicated by a white sheet stretched between poles on the track. <a href=\"/wiki/Ronnie_Biggs\" title=\"Ronnie Biggs\">Ronnie Biggs</a>'s only task was to supervise Stan Agate's participation in the robbery, and when it became obvious that Agate was not able to drive the train, he and Biggs were sent to the waiting truck to help load the mail bags.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Removing_the_money\">Removing the money</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Removing the money\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The train was stopped at Bridego Bridge, and the robbers' \"assault force\" attacked the \u2018high value packages\u2019 (HVP) carriage. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Frank_Dewhurst&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Frank Dewhurst (page does not exist)\">Frank Dewhurst</a> was in charge of the three other postal workers (Leslie Penn, Joseph Ware and John O'Connor) in the HVP carriage.

Dewhurst and Kett were hit with coshes when they made a vain attempt to prevent the robbers' storming of the carriage.  Once the robbers had entered the carriage, the staff could put up no effective resistance and there was no police officer or security guard on board to assist them.  The staff were made to lie face down on the floor in a corner of the carriage.

Leatherslade was a run-down farm 27 miles (43&#160;km) from the crime scene, between <a href=\"/wiki/Oakley,_Buckinghamshire\" title=\"Oakley, Buckinghamshire\">Oakley</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Brill,_Buckinghamshire\" title=\"Brill, Buckinghamshire\">Brill</a>  (<span class=\"plainlinks nourlexpansion\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)&amp;params=51_48_23_N_1_3_11_W_type:event\"><span class=\"geo-default\"><span class=\"geo-dms\" title=\"Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location\"><span class=\"latitude\">51\u00b048\u203223\u2033N</span> <span class=\"longitude\">1\u00b03\u203211\u2033W</span></span></span><span class=\"geo-multi-punct\">&#xfeff; / &#xfeff;</span><span class=\"geo-nondefault\"><span class=\"geo-dec\" title=\"Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location\">51.80639\u00b0N 1.05306\u00b0W</span><span style=\"display:none\">&#xfeff; / <span class=\"geo\">51.80639; -1.05306</span></span></span></a></span>). It had been bought two months earlier as their hideout.\n</p><p>At the farm they counted the proceeds and divided it into 16 full shares and several 'drinks' (smaller sums of money intended for associates of the gang). The precise amounts of the split differ according to the source, but the full shares came to approximately \u00a3150,000 each (about \u00a32.65 million today).\n</p><p>From listening to their police-tuned radio, the gang learned that the police had calculated they had gone to ground within a 30-mile radius of the crime scene rather than dispersing with their haul. This declaration was based on information given by a witness at the crime scene who stated that a gang member had told the post office workers \"not to move for half an hour\". The press interpreted this information as a 30-mile (48&#160;km) radius\u2014a half-hour drive in a fast car.\n</p><p>The gang realised the police were using a \"dragnet tactic\", and with help from the public, would probably discover the farm much sooner than had been originally anticipated.  As a result, the plan for leaving the farm was brought forward to Friday from Sunday (the crime was committed on Thursday).  The vehicles they had driven to the farm could no longer be used because they had been seen by the train staff. <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Field\" title=\"Brian Field\">Brian Field</a> came to the farm on Thursday to pick up his share of the loot and to take Roy James to London to find an extra vehicle. Bruce Reynolds and John Daly picked up cars, one for Jimmy White and the other for Reynolds, Daly, Biggs and the replacement train driver.  Field, his wife Karin and his associate \"Mark\" brought the vans and drove the remainder of the gang to the Fields's home to recover.\n</p><p>Field had arranged with \"Mark\" to carry out a comprehensive clean-up and set fire to the farm after the robbers had left, even though the robbers had already spent much time wiping the place down to be free of prints.  According to Buster Edwards, he 'nicked' \u00a310,000 in <a href=\"/wiki/Ten-shilling_note\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ten-shilling note\">ten-shilling notes</a> to help pay \"Mark's\" drink. However, on Monday, when Charlie Wilson rang Brian Field to check whether the farm had been cleaned, he did not believe Field's assurances.  He called a meeting with Edwards, Reynolds, Daly and James and they agreed that they needed to be sure.  They called Field to a meeting on Tuesday, where he was forced to admit that he had failed to \"torch\" the farm.  In the IVS 2012 documentary film <i>The Great Train Robbery</i>, Nick Reynolds (son of Bruce Reynolds) said \"...the guy who was paid to basically go back to the farm and burn it down did a runner.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-ITV2012_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ITV2012-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Wilson would have killed Field there and then but was restrained by the others.

At that period, there was no parole system in place and prisoners served the full term of the sentence.

He was unfortunate in that Brian Field's relatives had dumped luggage containing \u00a3100,000 only a mile from a site where White had bought a caravan and hidden \u00a330,000 in the panelling. In addition, a group of men purporting to be from the Flying Squad broke into his flat and took a briefcase containing \u00a38,500. Throughout his three years on the run with wife Sheree and baby son Stephen, he was taken advantage of or let down by friends and associates. On 10 April 1966 a new friend recognised him from photos in a newspaper and informed police. They arrested him at Littlestone while he was at home. He only had \u00a38,000 to hand back to them.

Samples of his pubic hair were taken to compare with those found in sleeping bags at Leatherslade Farm, but there was no match. The Flying Squad could therefore never prove that Danny Pembroke was one of the robbers as no forensic evidence linked him to the crime scene or the farm.

Williams convinced Butler to pull \"Thomas\" in for questioning and in return for releasing him and not charging his friends with more serious crimes, \u00a350,000 was to be returned.\n</p><p>On 3 December 1963, which happened to be the same day that Roy James was taken into custody, the police received an anonymous tip directing them to the money in the phone box. The money was driven up to Aylesbury and taken into custody by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Detective_Superintendent_Fewtrell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Detective Superintendent Fewtrell (page does not exist)\">Detective Superintendent Fewtrell</a>, who wondered how his London colleagues could know how much money there was.  He had to bring in bank clerks to count the damp and musty money to determine the final sum.<sup id=\"cite_ref-114\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-114\">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Williams made no admission to the recovery of the money being the result of a deal with \"Thomas\". Despite claiming that his negotiations were responsible for the return of this money, Williams in his book <i>No Fixed Address</i> (1973) claimed not to know the identity of the person who had returned the money, although he did mention several robbers to whom he had offered deals through intermediaries.  He noted that it seemed to him that Butler was sceptical of his efforts and that at the press conference Hatherill and Millen did not reveal the circumstances behind the find and that he was never asked to talk with them about it. Despite \"Alf Thomas\" being the man identified as the assailant of the train driver, Jack Mills, by Bruce Reynolds (albeit indirectly), Williams only makes mention of the assailant once in his book. In this section (often quoted by other sources), he confirms that, with Tommy Butler, he questioned the man they knew to be the assailant but that they had no evidence to convict him. Strangely, however, he makes no further mention of him.\n</p><p>This lends credence to the claim that a deal was done with \"Alf Thomas\" which later caused outrage in the police hierarchy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-115\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-115\">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup> It is hinted in several books that the deals done by Williams were responsible for his being overlooked for promotion and that Williams was unhappy that his efforts were not recognised by Butler, but were instead hidden from superiors.\n</p><p>For his part, George Hatherill, in his book <i>A Detective's Tale</i>, stated that the motive behind the return of the money was not known for certain. He said that the money was returned by \"one about whom extensive inquiries had been made and who in fact was interrogated at length. But in spite of our strong suspicions, nothing could be proved against him and so no charge could be brought. My belief is that he thought we knew more about him than we did, and thinking things were getting hot, he decided to get rid of the money to avoid being found in possession with it\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-116\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-116\">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup> Hatherill does not mention Williams at all in his book.

Much of Jimmy White's money was taken from him.\n</p><p>According to Marilyn Wisbey, her father's share was hidden by his father Tommy Wisbey Senior in the panels in the doors of his home. Butler raided them three times but he never found the train money. The majority of the money was reputedly entrusted to Wisbey's father and also to his younger brother Ron, who coincidentally had saved some money of his own that was confiscated by the police. (It was returned to Ron three months later). By the time Wisbey was released from jail all of his share had either been spent or invested. Marilyn agrees with Piers Paul Read's assessment of how her father's share of approximately \u00a3150,000 was spent. Although the Wisbey share was one that was not taken by other criminals, Marilyn Wisbey is still bitter that her relatives got to spend a fair amount of the loot while the overall sum dwindled away. However, her grandfather used some of the money to buy them a house in Upper Norwood.<sup id=\"cite_ref-117\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-117\">&#91;117&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Up to six of the robbers escaped punishment in one way or another\u2014the \"<i>Ulsterman</i>\", three robbers who were never caught, John Daly who had his charges dismissed at the trial and Ronnie Biggs who escaped from jail and managed to avoid being taken back to the UK. John Daly had entrusted his money to another crook. This man had betrayed him to the police and had absconded with the money. He died before Daly could catch up with him. Upon the release of the others in the mid-1970s, \"Bill Jennings\" got in touch with Buster Edwards and \"Frank Monroe\" got in touch with the South Coast Raiders. Both said that they had no money left. \"Alf Thomas\" had disappeared and John Daly at the time was said to be living on the dole in West Country.<sup id=\"cite_ref-118\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-118\">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup> Ronnie Biggs quickly spent his share getting a new life (the ultimate goal of some criminals).
