The press release garnered widespread national and even international media attention. The U.S. Army Air Force retracted the claim later the same day, saying instead that a weather balloon had been recovered.  Haut also received some criticism and ridicule in the nation's press for putting out the original press release.

During a March 1989 interview he said he knew \"nothing\" about what was recovered. (p.&#160;139) He described being asked by Blanchard to write the press release. \"I didn't hear about it until, I guess, Jess [Jesse Marcel, head intelligence officer, who initially investigated and recovered some of the debris] was on his way to the flightline.\" (ibid) He did, however, describe what Marcel told him: \"It was something he had never seen and didn't believe it was of this planet. I trusted him on his knowledge.\" (p.&#160;142) He further stated: \"I think there was a giant cover-up on this thing.\" (p.&#160;143)\n</p><p>An affidavit signed May 14, 1993, he repeated the above claimed sequence of events and added \"I believe Col. Blanchard saw the material, because he sounded positive about what the material was. There is no chance he would have mistaken it for a weather balloon. Neither is there any chance that Major Marcel would have been mistaken.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By this time, Haut, along with Max Littell and <a href=\"/wiki/Glenn_Dennis\" title=\"Glenn Dennis\">Glenn Dennis</a> had opened the International UFO Museum and Research Center.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Then, in a recorded interview from 2000 with Wendy Connors<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and Dennis Balthauser,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Haut claimed to have personally viewed an extraterrestrial or alien craft and a body in a Roswell Army Air Field base hangar and being present at a senior staff meeting where a <a href=\"/wiki/Cover-up\" title=\"Cover-up\">cover-up</a> of events was discussed.  Haut also placed <a href=\"/wiki/Brigadier_General\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brigadier General\">Brigadier General</a> <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Roger_M._Ramey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Roger M.

Ramey would later tell the press it was in fact a misidentified weather balloon after Haut had put out the press release of the recovered \"flying disc.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In December 2002, Haut also signed a sealed affidavit in which he went into more details about the craft, debris, bodies, and cover-up.  Both the interview and affidavit were not to be released until after his death.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The full text of the affidavit was first published in June 2007 in the book <i>Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60 Year Cover-Up</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  According to the authors, Haut had sworn to his friend Colonel Blanchard not to reveal in his lifetime the events he witnessed and therefore told researchers either that he couldn't remember or that he had only prepared and released the information that was given to him at the time and denied he knew anything else.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In his affidavit, Haut stated that on July 8, 1947, following the press release he put out in the afternoon, he was taken out to a base hangar by Colonel Blanchard.  There he saw an egg-shaped craft about 15 feet long and several small bodies about four feet tall with large heads.  He was convinced the bodies were alien and had come from a crashed spacecraft.\n</p><p>Haut also stated that there had been two major crash sites that he had become aware of the day before, the first a large <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Debris_field&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Debris field (page does not exist)\">debris field</a> about 75 miles northwest of Roswell (the site investigated by Major Marcel), and the second, about 40 miles north of town, where the main craft and bodies were found.  The north site had just been found by civilians on July 7, and apparently word had already gotten out about it in the public.\n</p><p>At the staff morning meeting on July 8, which Haut said he attended, key officers at the base were briefed and strange debris was handed around, which nobody could identify.  Haut also said there was a discussion as to what the public was to be told. General Ramey had flown in to attend the meeting.  Haut said Ramey suggested telling the public about the more distant debris field as a diversion from the more accessible and important body/craft site.  He felt Ramey was following orders from <a href=\"/wiki/The_Pentagon\" title=\"The Pentagon\">The Pentagon</a>.  Haut added he was not aware at the time exactly what information was to be divulged.  But the press release he put out a few hours later spoke of the more distant site in general terms, saying that the Army Air Force had come into possession of a \"flying disc\" with cooperation of a local rancher, and it was being flown on to \"higher headquarters\" after being examined at the base.  \"Higher headquarters\" quickly turned out to be Gen. Ramey in Fort Worth, who within a few hours said the \"flying disc\" was a misidentified weather balloon.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Walter_Haut&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Roswell_Incident\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roswell Incident\">Roswell Incident</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/UFO\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UFO\">UFO</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Walter_Haut&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Pflock, p.51</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Karl Pflock, <i>Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe</i>, p.261; <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.roswellproof.com/haut.html#anchor_9\">copy of 1993 affidavit</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Pflock, p.51</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nicap.org/bios/connors.htm\">bio - Wendy Connors</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.truthseekeratroswell.com\">Truthseeker at Roswell - Dennis Balthaser Independent Roswell Research, Journalist and Lecturer</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://roswellproof.homestead.com/Ramey_info.html\">Ramey_info</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.nicap.org/bios/connors.htm\">http://www.nicap.org/bios/connors.htm</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.roswellproof.com/haut_2000_interview.html\">transcript of interview</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.roswellproof.com/haut.html\">text of affidavit</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Roswell-Unmasking-60-Year-Cover-Up/dp/1564149439\">Witness to Roswell</a><i> by Tom J.
