The International UFO Museum And Research Center is located in Roswell, New Mexico, United States, in the down town district and is focused largely on the 1947 Roswell Crash and later supposed UFO incidents in the United States and elsewhere. It was founded in 1991 as a 501c3 nonprofit educational organization and is located in a former movie theater from the 1930s.  The museum contains an extensive library and exhibits all focused on the history of UFO encounters. The catalyst for the museum was the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, in which a rancher, W. W. "Mack" Brazel, discovered metal debris outside of Roswell, near a giant trench that spanned hundreds of feet.  The International UFO Museum and Research Center shares theories about the Roswell incident and other extraterrestrial life.  The museum also has a gift store with UFO-inspired souvenirs.
