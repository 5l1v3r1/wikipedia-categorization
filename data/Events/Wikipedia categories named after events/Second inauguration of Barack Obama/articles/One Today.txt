"One Today" is a poem by Richard Blanco first recited at the second inauguration of Barack Obama, making Blanco the fifth poet to read during a United States presidential inauguration.  "One Today" was called "a fine example of public poetry, in keeping with Blancoâ€™s other work: Loose, open lines of mostly conversational verse, a flexible iambic pentameter stanza form," by Ken Tucker in Entertainment Weekly.
