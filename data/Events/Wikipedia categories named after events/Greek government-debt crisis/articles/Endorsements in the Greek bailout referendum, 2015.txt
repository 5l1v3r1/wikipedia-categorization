During the Greek bailout referendum, 2015 a number of newspapers, individuals, politicians, political parties and organisations in Greece, Europe and internationally issued endorsements for either 'NO' to accepting the Troika bailout terms or 'YES'. This is the official list of endorsements by political parties as it was released by the Ministry of Interior:   Apart from the parties listed above, the Communist Party of Greece called for the use of a write-in ballot option, "even if they say that it is a spoiled ballot".  The Communist Party of Greece (Marxist-Leninist) and the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Greece ran a joint campaign for a boycott of the vote.  The Organization for the Reconstruction of the Communist Party of Greece also called for a boycott of the vote, calling it a 'fascist farce'.
