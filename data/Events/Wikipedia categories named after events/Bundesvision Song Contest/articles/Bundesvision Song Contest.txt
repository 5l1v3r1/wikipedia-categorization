The Bundesvision Song Contest (short BSC or BuViSoCo) was an annual song competition created by German TV entertainer Stefan Raab in 2005. For each of the 16 states of Germany a song was chosen by regional radio stations. The songs were performed on live television in order to find the most popular song in the competition. The TV format made use of premium-priced viewer interactivity, with viewers voting for their favourite songs by phone or SMS. The show was loosely based on the Eurovision Song Contest and its rules aimed at promoting German-language music by requiring that at least 50 percent of the lyrics had to be performed in German. Stefan Raab wrote the music for the German entry in the 1998 Eurovision Song Contest, Guildo Horn's "Guildo Hat Euch Lieb!", and represented Germany in the 2000 Eurovision Song Contest with "Wadde Hadde Dudde Da?". Raab cast the German entry for the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest on his TV total show in a competition he called SSDSGPS (Stefan sucht den Super-Grand-Prix-Star, Stefan seeks the super Grand-Prix star, mocking Deutschland sucht den Superstar – DSDS, the German version of the Idol franchise). The winner of this casting, Maximilian Mutzke, came in 8th place at the ESC with "Can't Wait Until Tonight". Bored with the Eurovision Song Contest, Raab came up with the Bundesvision Song Contest in 2005 (The Federal Republic of Germany officially being called Bundesrepublik Deutschland in German). The contest featured representatives from each of the 16 German states (Bundesländer) and stipulated that their song had to be (at least partly) in German. In 2010, due to Raab searching for the German representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the show Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), the 2010 edition of the show was postponed to October. 3 times 1 time
