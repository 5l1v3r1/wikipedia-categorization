 The 2015 Leeds International Piano Competition was the 18th edition of the tournament, and it was held in the University of Leeds and the Leeds Town Hall from 26 August to 13 September 2015, with the Hall√© Orchestra acting in the final conducted by Mark Elder. Russian pianist Anna Tcybuleva won the competition. Andrew Clements from The Guardian found that while Tcybuleva's playing in the final was fluent: Clements further commented that "only Petersen and Kim gave any sense that they chose music they genuinely loved" (Rachmaninov's 1st and Beethoven's 4th respectively), while describing Pisarenko as "another pianist with steely technique and limited musical imagination in the current Russian mould."
