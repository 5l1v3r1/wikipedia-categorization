There is autonomy in general, it has some specific form. And this specific form in the regional ballot has not been determined. If we are talking about the autonomy of the state, then the formation of further 10-12, or possibly 20 state and political structures in Ukraine (as, say, autonomies in Russia at the moment) could initiate interstate, inter-autonomous problems.\n</p><p>That is particularly worrisome.\n</p><p>And the status of a self-governing territory gives it the full right to dispose of its wealth, its resources, its economic, cultural and national issues.\n</p><p>\nThe main thing is that it is not a state, but a self-governing structure.
