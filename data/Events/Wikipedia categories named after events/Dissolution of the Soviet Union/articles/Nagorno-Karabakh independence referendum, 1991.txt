An independence referendum was held in Nagorno-Karabakh on 10 December 1991.  It was approved by 99.98% of voters.  It was unsuccessfully boycotted by the region's Azeri population, which then constituted 20% of its population. The referendum was held without consent of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and is not recognized internationally by the UN member states.
