An independence referendum was held in Latvia on 3 March 1991,  alongside a similar referendum in the Republic of Estonia. Known as the "Popular Survey about the independence of the Republic of Latvia", voters were asked "are you in favour of a democratic and independent Republic of Latvia".  It was approved by 74.9% of voters, with a turnout of 87.6%.  Latvian Republic civilians registered in Soviet Army units also had the right to vote in this poll.  The independence of Latvia was finally restored on August 21, 1991. Similar independence referendums were also held in Estonia on 3 March 1991 and on 9 February in Lithuania.
