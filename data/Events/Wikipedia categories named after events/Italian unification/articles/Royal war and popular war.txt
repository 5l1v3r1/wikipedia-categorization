Royal war and popular (or people's) war (Guerra regia e guerra di popolo) is a recurring concept in the historiography of the Italian Risorgimento, referring to the two possible forms in which the whole of Italy could be conquered and formed into a single independent state. In the First Independence War for italy, which ended unfavourably for the Risorgimento cause, there was a balance between two initiatives: people's war and royal war. The notable moments in the people's war were: The royal war was the campaign by the Kingdom of Piedmont, including the battles of Goito, Peschiera del Garda, Custoza and Novara. The Second Independence War was a typical example of royal war led by Victor Emmanuel II, allied to Napoleon III in conducting a war against Austria. The people's war was only a minor support Hunters of the Alps, a corps of volunteers commanded by Giuseppe Garibaldi and considered as a special unit within the royal army. The Expedition of the Thousand was entirely a people's war, with GaribaldI being its central figure. In the Third Independence War, with the Italian defeats at Custoza and Lissa, was essentially a royal war, though the corps of volunteers under Garibaldi did win a victory at Bezzecca. The same contrast between royal war and people's war can be applied to the history of the Second World War,  when a disastrous war under the royal and fascist r√©gime was followed by the people's war of the Italian Resistance.
