Duke of Savoy\">Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy</a> was the major reformer of the Savoyard Army in the 16th century</div></div></div>\n<p>The Savoyard Army was officially established in the 15th century, when the <a href=\"/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy\" title=\"Duchy of Savoy\">Duchy of Savoy</a> was created. During this period, the army of the Savoyard lands was concentrated at bases in <a href=\"/wiki/Piedmont\" title=\"Piedmont\">Piedmont</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Aosta_Valley\" title=\"Aosta Valley\">Aosta Valley</a>, where it was maintained by the local feudal lords who in exchange for the command of some regiments, maintained them for state service and stationed them on the land in the meantime. It was Duke <a href=\"/wiki/Emmanuel_Philibert,_Duke_of_Savoy\" title=\"Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy\">Emmanuel Philibert</a> who was largely responsible for the radical reforms of the army which made it a stable component of the state and disconnected it from the local feudatories at the same time. As part of this, he created the \"peasant militia\" on 5 July 1566. With this, the command of the army officially passed into the hands of the Duke of Savoy. Since there were no limits on age or length of service, many soldiers  remained in service for a very long time, which had a deleterious impact on the army. There was little or nothing in the way of training and the resulting force left a lot to be desired on campaign.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"17th_and_18th_centuries\">17th and 18th centuries</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Sardinian_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: 17th and 18th centuries\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the seventeenth century, the Piedmontese army underwent notable reforms. The cause of these substantial changes was the foreign policy undertaken by the Savoyard government and new internal conditions. During the first half of the seventeenth century, the Savoyard army was not a solid force, but varied significantly in periods of peace and war and was essentially composed of regiments recruited from the nobility in the pay of the Duke, regiments of mercenaries, and Protestant regiments (mostly consisting of French <a href=\"/wiki/Hugenots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hugenots\">Hugenots</a>). In 1664, \"proprietary\" regiments of the Duke were first created, which bore the Duke's <a href=\"/wiki/Coat_of_arms\" title=\"Coat of arms\">coat of arms</a> as a flag rather than the arms of their individual commanders.\n</p><p>Seven years later in 1671, the army was also given a uniform, which was light grey for almost all units, much like that which had recently been adopted by the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Royal_Army_(1652%E2%80%931830)\" title=\"French Royal Army (1652\u20131830)\">French Royal Army</a>, which the Ducal army had frequently encountered (as opponents and allies) in the frequent wars of the era. In this period, the Piedmontese army was very open to innovations and was constantly modernising, especially during the reign of <a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Amadeus_II_of_Sardinia\" title=\"Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia\">Victor Amadeus II</a>. The two most important reforms of these years were probably the creation of a specialised group of <a href=\"/wiki/Grenadiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grenadiers\">grenadiers</a> and the abolition of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pikemen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pikemen\">pikemen</a>, both of which took place in 1685. The second of these reforms in particular anticipated the motion of travel throughout Europe - in fact the French and the Spanish only abolished their pikemen some fifteen years later, while the Swedes still had a third of their infantry equipped with pikes in 1720.\n</p><p>Also important, somewhat later, was the Regulation of 1709, which was inspired by the discipline of the <a href=\"/wiki/Prussian_army\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prussian army\">Prussian army</a> observed during the <a href=\"/wiki/Siege_of_Turin\" title=\"Siege of Turin\">Siege of Turin</a> and by the firing tactics of the English and Dutch forces. Thus, fire of platoons in serried ranks was adopted instead of files in open ranks. The difference was that when firing in files, the soldiers were deployed in four or more files separated by four metres and all the soldiers in one file fired at the same time, with a set interval between the fire of each file, making a more constant fire possible. However, with the fire in platoons, the soldiers were separated into three close files and their front was divided into platoons, in each of which the soldiers of the three files fired at the same time, followed by the other platoons at a regular interval. This system remained the standard for all units throughout the first half of the 18th century.\n</p><p>Throughout the century, there was a general tendency to the expansion of the army. In 1691, it contained 12 regiments of infantry, 3 of <a href=\"/wiki/Dragoon\" title=\"Dragoon\">dragoons</a> and 2 of cavalry; in 1747, it exceeded 32 regiments of infantry, but the cavalry continued to be formed of 2 regiments, while the dragoons had expanded to 5 regiments.\nWith respect to numbers, we know that in 1774, the total number of Savoyard troops reached 100,000 individuals. In that year a regulation was introduced concerning the length of permanent military service. The king maintained control of the troops, supported by a defense staff, composed of adjutants and 28 experienced generals, all of aristocratic origin (nobles held 78% of the positions in the officer ranks), while in the various ranks of the infantry and cavalry forces, the bourgeois formed 20%. The rest of the army was manned by the proletariat.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nineteenth_century\">Nineteenth century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Sardinian_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Nineteenth century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Victor_Emmanuel_I_of_Sardinia.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Victor_Emmanuel_I_of_Sardinia.jpg/220px-Victor_Emmanuel_I_of_Sardinia.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"282\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Victor_Emmanuel_I_of_Sardinia.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"299\" data-file-height=\"383\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Victor_Emmanuel_I_of_Sardinia.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Victor Emmanuel I\">Victor Emmanuel I</a> established the Royal Carabinieri in 1814</div></div></div>\n<p>After the <a href=\"/wiki/Armistice_of_Cherasco\" title=\"Armistice of Cherasco\">Armistice of Cherasco</a> in 1796 and the failure of the Kingdom of Sardinia's attempt to prevent the Napoleonic invasion, the Sardinian Army was gradually demobilised and was converted into the forces of the <a href=\"/wiki/Subalpine_Republic\" title=\"Subalpine Republic\">Subalpine Republic</a> and then of the Napoleonic <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_(Napoleonic)\" title=\"Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)\">Kingdom of Italy</a>.\n</p><p>After the restoration of the kingdom in 1815, <a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Victor Emmanuel I\">Victor Emmanuel I</a> ordered the reconstruction of the Piedmontese army, organised in ten brigades of infantry and supported by cavalry and artillery. These were divided into two large armies, each of which contained two divisions and a reserve division.\n</p><p>Under <a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Victor Emmanuel II\">Victor Emmanuel II</a>, the Royal Sardinian Army was changed in many respects, with an increase in numbers and in the quality of the forces. In 1858, before the outbreak of the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Italian_War_of_Independence\" title=\"Second Italian War of Independence\">Second Italian War of Independence</a>, a new military code was introduced by the king, which regularised the period of <a href=\"/wiki/Military_service\" title=\"Military service\">military service</a>, establishing it as five years of active service then 6 years in reserve, up to the age of thirty, with 50 days of obligatory training and instruction per year. The active service was divided into two kinds: <i>ordinanza</i> and <i>provinciale</i>. The first included service in the Royal <a href=\"/wiki/Carabinieri\" title=\"Carabinieri\">carabinieri</a>, the armourers, the musicians, the musketeers, and the volunteers, while the second consisted of all the other soldiers and were obliged to remain in the army for 8 years unless the government ordered otherwise.\n</p><p>In this reform, criminals condemned to forced labour, imprisonment, and exile were excluded from military service, as were those guilty of crimes relating to the penal code, men condemned by foreign courts to similar punishments, and the executors of justice, including judges, magistrates, their children, their adjutants and the children of their adjutants.\n</p><p>The Piedmontese army in this period had a total force of 79,000 men (roughly 22,000 of which were officers and 56,000 were regular troops), in addition to around 20,000 officers and soldiers in non-Piedmontese volunteer forces, like the <a href=\"/wiki/Hunters_of_the_Alps\" title=\"Hunters of the Alps\">Hunters of the Alps</a>. The volunteers in the regular army amounted to around 20,000 men. The conscripts were chosen by lot and could escape by making a payment or substituting a relative. Division took place on the basis of age and the oldest soldiers (provided they were literate) were made <a href=\"/wiki/Corporal\" title=\"Corporal\">corporals</a>. From these the <a href=\"/wiki/Sergeant\" title=\"Sergeant\">sergeants</a> were chosen on the basis of merit. After the <a href=\"/wiki/Unification_of_Italy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unification of Italy\">unification of Italy</a> the army became the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Italian_Army\" title=\"Royal Italian Army\">Royal Italian Army</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Organisation\">Organisation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Sardinian_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Organisation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the early nineteenth century, the soldiers of the Sardinian army had the following social composition: 65% farmers, 25% labourers and artisans, 10% bourgeois and aristocrats. Only 20% were literate and a mere 5% had received secondary education. In the regiments there was a school for the soldiers in which they could learn to read, write, and keep accounts. According to the regulations of 1853, the pay of the average soldier in peacetime was 15 <a href=\"/wiki/Sardinian_lira\" title=\"Sardinian lira\">centesimi</a>, rising to 25 in wartime, in addition to a ration of bread, 830g of wood in summer and 1660g in winter (double for junior officers), and a daily subsidy for the wives of the soldiers and two rations of bread per day.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Infantry\">Infantry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Sardinian_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Infantry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg/220px-Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"156\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg/330px-Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg/440px-Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"520\" data-file-height=\"369\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Battaglia_di_Novara.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Group of infantry at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Novara_(1849)\" title=\"Battle of Novara (1849)\">Battle of Novara</a>, 1849</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bersaglieri_1855.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Bersaglieri_1855.jpg/220px-Bersaglieri_1855.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"257\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Bersaglieri_1855.jpg/330px-Bersaglieri_1855.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Bersaglieri_1855.jpg/440px-Bersaglieri_1855.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2150\" data-file-height=\"2514\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bersaglieri_1855.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Group of <a href=\"/wiki/Bersaglieri\" title=\"Bersaglieri\">Bersaglieri</a>, the special troops of the Sardinian army during the <a href=\"/wiki/Risorgimento\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Risorgimento\">Risorgimento</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Infantry were the backbone of the Sardinian army and were subdivided into different types: National Service Infantry, Light legion, infantry for external security, provincial infantry, legions of the encampments, French corps, and the territorial militia.\n</p>\n<dl><dt>National Service Infantry</dt>\n<dd>consisted of unmounted personnel (<a href=\"/wiki/Fusiliers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fusiliers\">fusiliers</a> and grenadiers) recruited from the territories of the <a href=\"/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy\" title=\"Duchy of Savoy\">Duchy of Savoy</a> and were easily employed in the territory.

The force which distinguished itself in the <a href=\"/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession\" title=\"War of the Spanish Succession\">War of the Spanish Succession</a> had 2,420 horsemen at its disposal in peacetime, but could rapidly double its numbers in times of war.

The artillery was divided into field and mountain artillery, as well as siege artillery (mortars and howitzers). A large amount of the artillery personnel were recruited from <a href=\"/wiki/Province_of_Biella\" title=\"Province of Biella\">Biella</a>, which was also where the industry that produced the artillery was located.

The officers did not have firearms; they only carried melee weapons.\n</p><p>New models of rifle were adopted in 1844, with a first attempt at using <a href=\"/wiki/Percussion_rifle\" title=\"Percussion rifle\">percussion rifles</a>. However, the transition from the firearms which used <a href=\"/wiki/Fire_striker\" title=\"Fire striker\">fire strikers</a> to more modern weapons that fired using an \"Eggs\" capsule was completed only in 1859. All rifles were equipped with bayonets with the Laukart attachment system, which meant that they could be clipped onto the rifle without obstructing fire.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Musket\" title=\"Musket\">musket</a> developed in parallel with this. The first nineteenth century models appear in 1833 and they were modified in 1844 to make them more like actual infantry rifles, except shorter and more manageable on account of their lighter weight.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Carbine\" title=\"Carbine\">carbine</a> was mainly given to sharpshooters, but was also the distinctive weapon of the carabinieri.\n</p><p>The Sardinian army was first equipped with pistols in 1847 (although some were already in use from 1844). These included the large cavalry pistol which was considered a weapon of last resort as an unsatisfactory compromise between a pistol and a musket. The pistol and cavalry pistol bullets were spherical and hollow with a diameter of 16.6&#160;mm and an explosive payload of 2.5 g.\n</p><p>From the eighteenth century, the cavalry were armed with carbines which were very accurate over short distances. The horses were mostly bay-coloured animals imported from German and they served for 4\u20136 years. A sixth were female. In the nineteenth century, the carabinieri were introduced and they formed main cavalry force, especially distinguishing themselves in the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Italian_War_of_Independence\" title=\"First Italian War of Independence\">First Italian War of Independence</a> with their splendid saber charges. The dragoons were equipped very differently - with long bayonetted rifles (although they retained the use of the sabre as traditional).\n</p><p>The typical artillery cannon of the Sardinian army was the mod.704 rearload <a href=\"/wiki/Saker_(cannon)\" title=\"Saker (cannon)\">saker</a>, which was regularly used until 1848. The heavy artillery was characterised by long cannons (8-16-32 pound <a href=\"/wiki/Culverin\" title=\"Culverin\">culverins</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Officers\">Officers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Sardinian_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Officers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Junior_officers\">Junior officers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Sardinian_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Junior officers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The junior officers were drawn largely from the ordinary soldiers on the basis of merit and ability.
