The Live Earth concert in Washington, D.C., officially known as "Mother Earth",   was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., United States and was sponsored by and held on the premises/venue of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. It was only hours before the Washington D.C. concert was scheduled to begin that organizers were able to secure a venue for the last-minute addition to the schedule. The Washington Post reported the U.S. capital had been Gore's first choice for the main concert, but the National Mall was booked. The main concert was moved to New Jersey, but Gore made a surprise announcement during a July 6 media interview that a concert would take place on the plaza of the Museum of the American Indian. "Some who don't understand what is now at stake tried to stop this event on the Mall, but here we are. [crowd  is cheering] And it wasn't the cavalry who came to our rescue, it was the American Indians," Gore said during brief opening remarks carried live on the website  . Only the first 200 attendees were able to directly view the event at the Museum. Others watched Gore speak and Brooks play from what event organizers called a "JumboTron" outside the immediate viewing area. Due to last minute organizing, there were no working audio speakers that could project sound to the JumboTron viewers.
