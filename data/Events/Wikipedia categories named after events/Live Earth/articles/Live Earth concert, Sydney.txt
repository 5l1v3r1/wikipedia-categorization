  The Live Earth concert in Australia was held at Sydney Football Stadium, Sydney on 7 July 2007, in front of around 45,000 people.  It was the first of the Live Earth concerts to kick off the day-long event and promoted by Michael Chugg and Amanda Pelman of Chugg Entertainment, Joe Segreto and Tom Lang of IMC / Homebake Festival and Mark Pope of Mark Pope Music. The event was carbon neutral with unavoidable gas emissions being offset with programs that reduce emissions elsewhere.  Tickets for the show were printed on recycled paper and included free public transport from anywhere in NSW on the day of the event.  The Sydney Morning Herald reported the following: Scores were seen leaving within the first two hours of the nine-hour festival, fed up with the lack of basic services, cutting their losses on a $99 ticket. Gate attendants were heard telling the human tide that they should complain to the promoter. It was "unAustralian", one spectator protested. "This is what happens when you let hippies organise a big event," another said...Police charged 19 people with drug offences. During the Crowded House performance the stage lights went out during "Something So Strong". The band played on, however, as the PA system was still operational. The outage was unexpected by Crowded House and unplanned by organisers.  Live coverage of the Sydney event was broadcast on Channel V and MAX. In Canada, it was shown uninterrupted on MuchMoreMusic. Live streaming of the concert was broadcast on MSN and ninemsn.
