The Live Earth concert in the United Kingdom was held at Wembley Stadium, London, England on 7 July 2007. In Britain, the BBC provided live television coverage of the show on BBC Two, followed by BBC One later on, BBC Radio 1, and BBC HD. The television coverage was presented by Jonathan Ross, Graham Norton and Edith Bowman. Coverage commenced at 13:00 on BBC Two and concluded at 17:20 continuing on BBC One at 17:30. In Ireland, RTÃ‰ Two provided live coverage starting from 12:30 until 19:00 and then again from 21:30 until 06:00 the following morning, presented by Dave Fanning. In Canada, CTVglobemedia provided uninterrupted live television coverage of the show on MuchMoreMusic.  Highlights of the show were featured on CTV throughout the day. MSN was responsible for the online broadcasting of the concert. Chris Rock's explicit language during the introduction of the Red Hot Chili Peppers caused problems with Canadian TV networks and the BBC. Rock also used the word "nigger" while being interviewed on BBC One by Jonathan Ross, alongside Ricky Gervais. Rock called the crowd "motherfuckers" and Jonathan Ross had to apologize to the viewers. He was unrepentant in later NME interviews. The BBC missed the start of the Metallica set, joining live halfway through the first song, then switched to Crowded House from Sydney just as they started to play "Enter Sandman". This resulted in 413 complaints from Metallica fans who watched the concert from home. Phil Collins sang during "Invisible Touch", "And though she will fuck up your life, you'll want her just the same." Collins has sung this as part of many Genesis concerts. BBC presenter Jonathan Ross was required to apologize on air for the expletives used by Collins and Johnny Borrell of Razorlight and vowed to give them a "talking to". The offensive language used by performers at the event and broadcast live before the watershed caused the BBC to be censured by media regulator Ofcom.
