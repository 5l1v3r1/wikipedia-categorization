The Live Earth concert for South America was held at Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 7, 2007.  It is one of two free Live Earth concerts, the other being held in Washington, D.C. It was the last concert to start during the day-long event. However, that didn't make it the last to finish, for the New York concert was still going on when things wrapped up in Rio. Lenny Kravitz was the headliner, playing a free gig there for the second time. A few days before the event, a State prosecutor tried to cancel it, due to an alleged lack of police personnel to take care of security. However, the day after that, the concert was reinstated.  Attendance was of about 400,000 people,  much less than the crowd drawn to Copacabana by the Rolling Stones free concert on February 18, 2006, which exceeded a million people.  Audience numbers were closer to those of the other Lenny Kravitz performance there, on March 21, 2005. On that occasion, Kravitz performed for 300,000  people, in a concert of his own, staged at a different location on the beach. The Rolling Stones concert and Live Earth happened at exactly the same spot, in front of the Copacabana Palace hotel. The following artists performed at the Brazilian Live Earth concert  (in order of appearance):
