Afterwards, someone said at a meeting that otherwise there might have been deaths, and got the reply \"Bollocks!\"; criminologist <a href=\"/wiki/Phil_Scraton\" title=\"Phil Scraton\">Phil Scraton</a>, interviewed during the film, stated that this reply was a sign of deep-rooted institutional complacency.</li>\n<li>In 1985 the pens were set up at Hillsborough.</li>\n<li>Six months before the disaster, a young policeman was lured into a remote place in <a href=\"/wiki/Ranmoor\" title=\"Ranmoor\">Ranmoor</a> and attacked and left handcuffed by two men in balaclavas with pistols, but they proved to be two Yorkshire policemen. The enquiry into this severe <a href=\"/wiki/Hazing\" title=\"Hazing\">hazing</a>-type assault caused disciplinary measures in which four Yorkshire policemen were sacked and two were demoted and two were transferred away, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Brian_Mole&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Brian Mole (page does not exist)\">Brian Mole</a>, who had served since the early 1980s and was very experienced in football-related matters, was transferred to <a href=\"/wiki/Barnsley\" title=\"Barnsley\">Barnsley</a>, and as man in charge at Sheffield was replaced by <a href=\"/wiki/David_Duckenfield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"David Duckenfield\">David Duckenfield</a>, who was much less experienced than his predecessor; at the briefing before the match he spoke for a long time, but never mentioned crowd safety, and fumbled the name of <a href=\"/wiki/Nottingham_Forest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nottingham Forest\">Nottingham Forest</a> club so badly that he appeared to know little about football.</li></ul>\n<h3><span id=\"The_day_of_the_disaster_.2815_April_1989.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_day_of_the_disaster_(15_April_1989)\">The day of the disaster (15 April 1989)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_(2014_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The day of the disaster (15 April 1989)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>Ninety minutes before kickoff, few fans had arrived; the big crush came in the last 20 minutes or so before kickoff. In the pens behind the goal, the two central pens were very full; the outer two pens were much less crowded. The control box was above one end of the Leppings Lane end terraces and could easily see all along those terraces. Outside, staff pulled some fans in through the turnstiles to try to relieve congestion. One policeman got so nervous at developments outside that he frantically radioed \"For fuck's sake open these gates!\" several times, despite police rules about language on radio.</li>\n<li>About 8 minutes before kickoff, Duckenfield ordered Gate C to be opened. The crowd at first walked in orderly, but up to and around kickoff this changed into a crush. Unlike in 1988, no order was given to close the entry tunnel's gate when the terrace pens were full. There was no order to delay kickoff. When the player <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Beardsley\" title=\"Peter Beardsley\">Peter Beardsley</a> kicked and the ball hit the goal's crossbar, this seemed to make the crush much harder. People tried to climb the barriers and were ordered not to. Six minutes after kickoff the referee stopped the game. Gates in the pitchside barrier were opened, and people were allowed on the pitch, and casualties laid out there. Some spectators were helped to climb up into a spectator area above the terrace. A camera view afterwards showed that some of the metal-mesh barriers were bent and crumpled. Someone compared the crush in the two pens to fish caught in a <a href=\"/wiki/Trawl_net\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trawl net\">trawl net</a>.</li>\n<li>Fans did not force the gate, which was opened by police order. However, in the control room, Duckenfield told <a href=\"/wiki/Graham_Kelly_(football)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Graham Kelly (football)\">Graham Kelly</a>, an English football administrator, that Liverpool fans had charged, forcing entry to the central pens and so caused the crush. A BBC commentator believed that statement and passed it on to camera.</li>\n<li>Emergency services failed to activate Sheffield's <a href=\"/wiki/Emergency_planning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emergency planning\">major incident plan</a> so resources were not diverted to Hillsborough. A traffic jam of ambulances developed in Penistone Road outside the stadium; the incident was at the opposite end of the pitch. Emergency equipment such as <a href=\"/wiki/Defibrillator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Defibrillator\">defibrillators</a> were not brought onto the pitch. Basic <a href=\"/wiki/Airway_management\" title=\"Airway management\">airway management</a> tools such as tubes and oxygen were in short supply.</li>\n<li>Ten of the casualties were pronounced dead in hospital; all other fatal casualties were taken into Hillsborough Stadium's <a href=\"/wiki/Gym\" title=\"Gym\">gymnasium</a>. The emergency enquiry telephone number was jammed solid with callers, and one spectator's father seeking information had to drive to Sheffield over the <a href=\"/wiki/Snake_Pass\" title=\"Snake Pass\">Snake Pass</a> with the delays caused by the narrow twisting hilly road. Friends and family searching for loved ones were directed to a Boy's Club opposite Hammerton Road police station in Sheffield and told to wait. From there they were carried in a double-decker bus to the Hillsborough stadium, and into a room, from which they were led one at a time into a room with <a href=\"/wiki/Polaroid_Corporation\" title=\"Polaroid Corporation\">Polaroid</a> photographs of the faces of the dead on a wall. In that wall-display, the photographs were not sorted by skin colour or gender or race or age, characteristics which might otherwise have helped relatives to know which part of the display to look in; and the shiny surface of Polaroids hindered visibility of the image. If a relative identified a photograph, the body was brought out in a body bag on a trolley, and the relative was asked questions including many about alcohol drinking in a rather accusatory manner. Over 400 living casualties were treated in hospital.</li>\n<li>The police who were involved in the disaster, were ordered to write their reports not in their personal notebooks, but on sheets of A4 paper which were provided. Those sheets were collected. On those sheets, much text was marked for deletion, either by <a href=\"/wiki/Strikethrough\" title=\"Strikethrough\">strikethrough</a>, or by drawing a rectangle around the text and then drawing that rectangle's diagonal lines; and words to be added were handwritten in. Those sheets were then transcribed in typewriting on other sheets of A4 paper, obeying the deletion and insertion instructions, producing apparently clean reports which were shown as authoritative evidence to the first inquest. It was noticed later that all or most of the deleted text was criticising the police's equipment supply and handling of the event.</li>\n<li>Dividing the terraces into separate pens stopped the fans from easing congestion by moving away sideways along the terraces as they had done before.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"After_the_disaster\">After the disaster</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_(2014_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: After the disaster\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>On 16 April 1989, <a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher\" title=\"Margaret Thatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_Ingham\" title=\"Bernard Ingham\">Bernard Ingham</a> and others arrived at Hillsborough.
