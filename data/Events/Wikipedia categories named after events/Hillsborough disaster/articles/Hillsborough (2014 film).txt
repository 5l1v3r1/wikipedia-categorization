Hillsborough is a 2014 documentary about the Hillsborough disaster. Directed and produced by Daniel Gordon, the 2-hour film chronicles the disaster, the investigations, and their lingering effects; it also included interviews with survivors, victims' relatives, police officers and investigators. It was co-produced by ESPN and BBC, first airing as a part of ESPN's 30 for 30 series of sports films, under its "Soccer Stories" heading. Hillsborough aired in the United States on ESPN on 15 April 2014, the 25th anniversary of the disaster.   The documentary could not be shown in the United Kingdom when it originally aired in 2014, due to the 2012 High Court inquest still being in progress. However, after the inquest verdict, the BBC aired the documentary on 8 May 2016, with additional footage from the inquest and final verdict. In 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel released its report and established an archive of media relating to the disaster. Much of the evidence reviewed by the panel had not been previously released to the public or to the media.  Daniel Gordon's film draws on this newly available evidence to describe the events of 15 April 1989, as well as their causes and their consequences.
