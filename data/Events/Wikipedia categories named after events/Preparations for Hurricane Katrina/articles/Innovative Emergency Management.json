Their areas of specialty include homeland security and emergency management, information technology, defense support, and program integration support.\n</p><p>On June 3, 2004 IEM was contracted by the <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department of Homeland Security\">Department of Homeland Security</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency\" title=\"Federal Emergency Management Agency\">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> to support development of a catastrophic hurricane response plan for Southeast Louisiana, including the City of <a href=\"/wiki/New_Orleans\" title=\"New Orleans\">New Orleans</a>. The goal of the Hurricane Pam exercise focused on how all levels of government would manage the effects of the simulated hurricane after landfall and evacuation had occurred. The contract award for this plan was approximately $500,000.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To develop the plan, IEM created a model of a simulated <a href=\"/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale\">category</a> 3 hurricane called <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Pam\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hurricane Pam\">Hurricane Pam</a> and its associated consequences. Drafts of 15 action plans were produced during the course of the first exercise, along with associated action plans, checklists, and trigger points. Three additional \"Hurricane Pam\" workshops were conducted before Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005. The last exercise using <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Pam\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hurricane Pam\">Hurricane Pam</a> was conducted on August 24, 2005, five days before <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina\" title=\"Hurricane Katrina\">Hurricane Katrina</a> made landfall. Hurricane Pam was a series of exercises to develop a comprehensive emergency response plan and is intended to be a living document, continually improved through workshops and exercises.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to <a href=\"/wiki/Greg_Palast\" title=\"Greg Palast\">Greg Palast</a>, in his film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Big_Easy_to_Big_Empty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Big Easy to Big Empty\">Big Easy to Big Empty</a></i>, IEM could not produce a copy of its hurricane evacuation plan for <a href=\"/wiki/New_Orleans\" title=\"New Orleans\">New Orleans</a> a year after <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina\" title=\"Hurricane Katrina\">Hurricane Katrina</a> hit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> However, a review of IEM's contract for <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane_Pam\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hurricane Pam\">Hurricane Pam</a> indicates that an evacuation plan for <a href=\"/wiki/New_Orleans\" title=\"New Orleans\">New Orleans</a> was never supposed to be developed as part of the contract.\n</p><p>On December 14, 2009, Madhu Beriwal announced that IEM was moving its corporate headquarters to the <a href=\"/wiki/Research_Triangle_Park\" title=\"Research Triangle Park\">Research Triangle Park</a> area near <a href=\"/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina\" title=\"Raleigh, North Carolina\">Raleigh</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/North_Carolina\" title=\"North Carolina\">North Carolina</a>.

IEM distributed nearly $1 billion to more than 11,000 New York homeowners to help them recover from Hurricane Sandy.
