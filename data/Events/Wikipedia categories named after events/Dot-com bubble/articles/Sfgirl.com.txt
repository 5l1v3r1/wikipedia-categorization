sfgirl.com was an online community founded by Patty Beron (sfgirl), a "legendary party crasher"  and "queen of San Francisco's dot-com party scene".  Beron founded the site in early 1998 to document, popularize, and promote social and business networking parties that had become part of the business culture of San Francisco's "dot com" industry,  as well as her persona as a glamorous gatecrasher.   Following the "dot com crash" of 2001, during which much of the industry collapsed, Beron began promoting "pink slip parties"   highly successful recruiting events and the "Schwag Exchange" at which people would give away promotional items they had collected.   The site is no longer active as an event page but you can visit the page to learn about the dot com party history. http://www.sfgirl.com sfgirl sfgirl.com
