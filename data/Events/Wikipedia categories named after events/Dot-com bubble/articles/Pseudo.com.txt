Pseudo.com was a website for live audio and video webcasting. Founded in late 1993, its parent company Pseudo Programs Inc. filed for bankruptcy following the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000. Its assets were purchased by INTV in 2001.  Founder Josh Harris claimed in 2008 that Pseudo was a "fake company" and "the linchpin of a long form piece of conceptual art."
