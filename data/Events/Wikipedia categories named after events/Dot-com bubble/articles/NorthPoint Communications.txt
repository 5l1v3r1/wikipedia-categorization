NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc. was a competitive local exchange carrier focused on data transmission. It leased copper telephone lines from phone companies, then provided access to internet service providers to provide DSL service to businesses and residents. The company existed and failed during the dot-com bubble. The company was founded in 1997  and went public on May 5, 1999 via an initial public offering in which it sold 15 million shares at $24 per share.  In September 2000, Verizon agreed to acquire a 55% interest in the company and merge the companies' DSL businesses.  In November 2000, as its customers failed to pay their bills, NorthPoint restated downwards its financial performance for the third quarter of 2000, lowering revenue from $30 million to $24 million.   After the earnings restatement, Verizon terminated its acquisition agreement, claiming that a material adverse change had occurred.   Northpoint sued Verizon to force it to complete the transaction.  The lawsuit was settled out of court in July 2002, with Verizon agreeing to pay $175 million to Northpoint.  On December 21, a shareholder[who?] sued NorthPoint for alleged waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and breach of contract.  In January 2001, NorthPoint filed bankruptcy.    Some internet service providers, which faced a disruption in service, blamed the banks for failing to work out a deal to save the company.  In March 2001, AT&T Corporation acquired the assets of NorthPoint for $135 million in a liquidation.
