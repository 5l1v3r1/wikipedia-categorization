The 28th World Science Fiction Convention, also known as Heicon '70, was held 20â€“24 August 1970 at the Stadthalle Heidelberg  in Heidelberg, West Germany. Manfred Kage eventually became Heicon's convention chairman, the last of more than a dozen fans who briefly held the position during the convention's rocky organizational period. The professional guests of honor were E. C. Tubb (UK), Robert Silverberg (US), and Herbert W. Franke (Germany). Elliot K. Shorter, the 1970 Trans Atlantic Fan Fund (TAFF) winner, was the fan guest of honor. The toastmaster was John Brunner. Total attendance was approximately 620. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented at Worldcon every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.
