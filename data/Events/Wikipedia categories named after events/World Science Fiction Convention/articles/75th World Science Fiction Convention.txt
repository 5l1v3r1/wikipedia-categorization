The 75th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), also known as Worldcon 75, was held 9â€“13 August 2017 at the Helsinki Exhibition and Convention Centre in Helsinki, Finland. This location was selected in August 2015 by the members of the 73rd World Science Fiction Convention in Spokane, Washington. The convention chair was Jukka Halme, and the vice-chairs were Karo Leikomaa and Colette H. Fozard.  The Guests of Honour for Worldcon 75 were Swedish author and translator John-Henri Holmberg, Jamaican author Nalo Hopkinson, Finnish author Johanna Sinisalo, French artist and illustrator Claire Wendling (absent due to illness), and American author Walter Jon Williams.  The following committees announced bids to host the 75th World Science Fiction Convention and filed all of the required paperwork before the February 2015 filing deadline:   A bid for New York City in 2017 was floated for several years but dropped before reaching the commitment stage.  The Montreal bid was originally announced for 2019 but shifted to the earlier date in 2013.  The 2017 site selected by the voters was announced during Sasquan's third World Science Fiction Society business meeting, on Saturday, August 22, 2015. With 1363 votes out of 2625 valid ballots, Helsinki won on the first ballot and will operate as "Worldcon 75". DC17 ran second with 878 votes. Montreal third with 228, and Nippon fourth with 120. Sites receiving write-in votes included Night Vale, Minneapolis in '73. Gallifrey, and All of the Above.  At the end of the convention, organizers announced a total attendance of 7,119, out of a total of 10,616 memberships and day passes sold, making Worldcon 75 the second-largest Worldcon to date and the largest ever held outside North America. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Other awards, including the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, are also presented at each year's Worldcon.
