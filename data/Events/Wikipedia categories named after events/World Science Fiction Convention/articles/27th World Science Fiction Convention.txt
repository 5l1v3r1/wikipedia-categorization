The 27th World Science Fiction Convention, also known as St. Louiscon, was held August 28â€“September 1, 1969, at the Chase Park Plaza Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, under the auspices of OSFA, the Ozark Science Fiction Association. The chairpersons were Ray Fisher and Joyce Fisher. The guests of honor were Jack Gaughan (professional) and Eddie Jones (fan artist). Jones, the Trans Atlantic Fan Fund (TAFF) winner, replaced Ted White. The toastmaster was Harlan Ellison. Total attendance was 1,534 from a registration exceeding 2,001, making it the largest Worldcon to that point in both regards.  The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year.  Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Other awards are also presented each year at Worldcon.
