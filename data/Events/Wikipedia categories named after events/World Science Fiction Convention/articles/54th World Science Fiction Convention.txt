The 54th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), also known as L.A.con III, was held August 29 through September 2, 1996, at the Hilton Anaheim, Anaheim Marriott, and the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, United States.  The convention was chaired by Mike Glyer. Total attendance was reported as 6,703 members. The Guests of Honor were James White (writer), Roger Corman (media), Takumi & Sachiko Shibano (fan). Elsie Wollheim had also been chosen as a special Guest of Honor, but died before the convention. The toastmaster was Connie Willis. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are given every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.  The 1996 Hugo Award base includes a reel of film and a moonscape as seen in the 1950 film Destination Moon as an homage to both that film and the work of artist Chesley Bonestell.
