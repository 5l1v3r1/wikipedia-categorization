The 66th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), also known as Denvention 3, was hosted in Denver, Colorado, USA on 6â€“10 August 2008, at the Colorado Convention Center and Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel (formerly known as the Adam's Mark Hotel). The organizing committee was chaired by Kent Bloom.  The attending membership at the convention was 3,751.  In addition to the Guests of Honor, the convention has announced the names of the people participating in the convention program. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Other awards, including the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and the Golden Duck Award, are also presented each year at Worldcon.  At L.A.con IV, Denver won the right to host the 66th Worldcon, on the third ballot by 12 votes in one of the closest races in Worldcon site selection history. The members of Denvention 3 selected Melbourne as the hosting city for the 68th World Science Fiction Convention, to be held in 2010.
