The 47th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), also known as Noreascon 3 (or "... Three", or "... III"), was held August 31–September 4, 1989, at the Sheraton-Boston Hotel, Hilton Hotel, Park Plaza Hotel, and the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts, United States.   The chairman was Mark L. Olson. The Guests of Honor were Andre Norton, Ian & Betty Ballantine (pro), and The Stranger Club (fan).  Seven surviving members of the latter group—the first known science fiction club in the Boston area, and responsible for organizing Boskone I, New England's first science fiction convention, in 1941—attended, including Harry Stubbs (Hal Clement).  Total attendance was 6,837, of 7,795 paid memberships. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Other awards, including the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, are also presented each year at Worldcon.  The 1989 Hugo Award base honored the 50th anniversary of both the 1939 New York World's Fair and the first Worldcon. The Fair's iconic Trylon and Perisphere were represented with the Hugo Award rocket taking the place of the 610 feet (190 m) tall Trylon spire.
