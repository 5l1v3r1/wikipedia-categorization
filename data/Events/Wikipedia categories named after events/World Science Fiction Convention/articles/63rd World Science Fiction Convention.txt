The 63rd World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) was called Interaction, and was held in Glasgow, Scotland 4â€“8 August 2005. The event was also the Eurocon. The Venue for the 63rd Worldcon was the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) with the attached Clyde Auditorium (often called "The Armadillo") and Moat House Hotel. Parties took place at the Hilton Hotel. The total registered membership of the convention was 5202, of which 4115 physically attended. The members represented 35 different nationalities. By far the largest contingents were from the USA and the UK. The organising committee was co-chaired by Colin Harris and Vincent Docherty. Due to the changes in the World Science Fiction Society rules, which reduced the lead-time from three to two years, no Worldcon site selection took place at the 2005 Worldcon. The site for the 2007 Worldcon was decided at the 2004 Worldcon in Boston under the old three year lead-time rule.  The site selection for the 2008 Worldcon, the first under the new two year lead-time rule,  took place at the 2006 Worldcon in Los Angeles. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are given every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.  In addition to the guests of honour, notable participating science fiction and fantasy writers and artists included:
