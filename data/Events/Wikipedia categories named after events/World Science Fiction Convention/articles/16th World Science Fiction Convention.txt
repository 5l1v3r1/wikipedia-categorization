The 16th World Science Fiction Convention, also known as Solacon, was held August 29â€“September 1, 1958, at the Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles, California, United States.     Solacon was physically in Los Angeles, but (by mayoral proclamation) technically in South Gate, California, to fulfill their longtime bid slogan (since 1948) of "South Gate in '58."  Superfan Rick Sneary had a cardboard sign at this convention that read "We'll do it again in 2010" that he carried to numerous future Worldcons. His death in 1990 laid that dream to rest and the 2010 Worldcon happened in Melbourne, Australia. Solacon's chair was Anne S. Moffatt. The guest of honor was Richard Matheson. The toastmaster was Anthony Boucher. Total attendance was 322. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year  at the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous calendar year. For the 1958 Hugos, Solacon presented engraved Hugo Award plaques instead of the nickel-plated Hugo rockets mounted on wooden bases, like those presented at the previous Worldcons in 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (no awards were given in 1954).  Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.
