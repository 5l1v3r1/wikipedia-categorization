The 13th World Science Fiction Convention, also known as Clevention, was held on September 2â€“5, 1955, at the Manger Hotel in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The chairmen were Nick and Noreen Falasca.  The guests of honor were Isaac Asimov (pro) and Sam Moskowitz (mystery GoH). Total attendance was approximately 380. This was the first convention at which the Hugo Awards were established as an annual feature; the first awards had been given out two years before, at Philcon II in 1953.  The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year.  Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.
