The 15th World Science Fiction Convention, also known as Loncon I, was held 6â€“9 September 1957 at the King's Court Hotel in London, England.  It was the first Worldcon held outside North America.  The chairman was Ted Carnell. The guest of honor was John W. Campbell, Jr., the editor of Astounding magazine. Total attendance was 268. Events included a "fancy dress ball" on the evening of Friday, September 6.  The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year.  Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.  The 1957 Hugo Awards given were: Because the 1957 International Fantasy Award was being given out in London at the same time, Loncon I chose not to compete with this similar literary award, which was given to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As a result, only the three Hugo Awards (above) for Best Professional Magazine and Best Fanzine were given out at the 1957 Worldcon. Both the International Fantasy Award and the Hugo Award shared the very same Chesley Bonestell-influenced finned rocketship design that year, the only time this has happened.
