The guests of honor will include academic Jocelyn Bell Burnell, editor Ginjer Buchanan, fans Mary and Bill Burns, author Diane Duane, game designer Steve Jackson, and author Ian MacDonald.  Dublin in 2019 was the only bid for hosting the 77th World Science Fiction Convention.   The members of the 75th World Science Fiction Convention voted among the bids, and selected it. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Other awards, including the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, are also presented at each year's Worldcon.  The awards will be announced at the convention.
