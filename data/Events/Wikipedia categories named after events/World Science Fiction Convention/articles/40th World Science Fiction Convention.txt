The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are presented every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year.  Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society. Other awards, including the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, are also presented each year at Worldcon.  At Chicon IV, the Hugo Awards were made of a lucite rocket on a wooden base.  This is the only time lucite was used for the award.
