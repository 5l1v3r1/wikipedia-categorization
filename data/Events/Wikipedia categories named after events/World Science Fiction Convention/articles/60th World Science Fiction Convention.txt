ConJose was the 60th World Science Fiction Convention, held in San Jose, California on August 29-September 2, 2002.  The convention was held in the McEnery Convention Center, as well as the Fairmont San Jose and the Hilton San Jose & Towers.  ConJose was co-chaired by Tom Whitmore and Kevin Standlee and organized under the auspices of San Francisco Science Fiction Conventions. Guests of Honor for ConJose were writer Vernor Vinge, artist David Cherry, fans Jan and Bjo Trimble, and the imaginary Ferdinand Feghoot. Tad Williams served as toastmaster. The Hugo Awards, named after Hugo Gernsback, are given every year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. Results are based on the ballots submitted by members of the World Science Fiction Society.  Glasgow won the vote for the 65th World Science Fiction Convention to be held in 2005, as the only bid that filed. Patrick Stewart made a special appearance at ConJose. He talked about upcoming films Star Trek Nemesis and X-Men 2, as well as his experiences on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In late 2001 and early 2002, some members of the SFSFC board expressed dissatisfaction about the progress made to date by convention management. It was proposed that the board remove Tom Whitmore as convention chair. The board decided to compromise by naming Tom Whitmore and Kevin Standlee as co-chairs of the convention. At the Hugo Awards presentation, Arthur C. Clarke gave a speech via direct video link from his home in Sri Lanka. There was a Goth dance as well as a rock and roll dance at the convention (they took place on different nights).
