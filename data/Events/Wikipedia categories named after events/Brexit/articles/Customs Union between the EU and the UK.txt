An EU-UK Customs Union is a proposal to have a Customs Union between a post Brexit United Kingdom and the European Union. As the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, then it will not be able to participate in the EU's Common Commercial Policy and so continued membership of the EU Customs Union is not seen by most commentators as being viable.  Some commentators have suggested that there should be a bilateral Customs Union between the European Union and the UK on the same model of the European Unionâ€“Turkey Customs Union.   Some critics believe that the Customs Union between the UK and the EU is a minor part of resolving  cross border delays as it does not on its own deal with Single Market issues or the ability of non EU HGV drivers to drive on EU roads.  Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party (UK), has backed an EU-UK Customs Union.  The House of Lords voted in April 2018 to force a negotiation of a Customs Union between the EU and the UK.
