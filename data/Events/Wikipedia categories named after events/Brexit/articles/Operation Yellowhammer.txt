  Operation Yellowhammer is the codename for "no-deal" contingency planning by the UK Treasury in the event Brexit negotiations for the withdrawal from the European Union fail to reach an agreement or an extension by 29 March 2019.  Should there fail to be be a negotiated settlement by 29 March 2019 then the UK would leave the European Union, leaving a hiatus impacting many aspects of the relationship between the UK and European Union.  The areas impacted would include money, citizens, trade, customs, and regulations.  The document appeared to indicate the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, a department of the Cabinet Office responsible for emergency planning, had been used in anticipation of government policy.  On 6 September 2018 a press photographer captured a snapshot of a "no-deal" planning document revealing some details of current preparations and the HM Treasury codename for those plans.
