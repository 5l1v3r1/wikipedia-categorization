 Legislation European Parliament Elections The European Union (EU) negotiating directives are negotiating directives approved on 22 May 2017 and give authority to the Council of the European Union to negotiate with the United Kingdom (UK) regarding the exit of the UK from the EU (Brexit). Supplemental directives were added on 20 December 2017 based on the negotiations to that date.  The UK filed the Article 50 notice of intention to withdraw on 29 March 2017, starting the Brexit process. Following the unanimous approval on 29 April by the leaders of the EU27 (i.e. all countries except the UK) of European Council guidelines which set out the principles for the Brexit negotiations,  negotiating directives needed to be approved by EU27. On 22 May 2017, with the required majority of 72% of the EU27 states, (i.e. 20 member states representing 65% of the population of the EU27), the negotiating directives were approved. This gave authority for the EU negotiating team to negotiate with the UK in accordance with the guidelines and directives. Key articles in the negotiating directives are set out below.  Numbers refer to negotiating directive document paragraphs.
