  The Chequers plan is the informal name for The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, a government white paper published on 12 July 2018 by the Government of the United Kingdom under Prime Minister, Theresa May. It lays out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the European Union after Brexit.   The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Brexit Secretary), Dominic Raab described it as a "detailed proposal for a principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the UK and the EU."  He also stated that, "The white paper proposes a free trade area for goods to maintain frictionless trade, supported by a common rulebook and a new facilitated customs arrangement, but only for the rules that are necessary to provide frictionless trade at the border."  The White Paper is split into four chapters: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements.   Former Brexit Secretary, David Davis resigned over the paper,  as did his Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Steve Baker and the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.
