 The World Scrabble Championship 2005 was held in the Marriott Regent's Park Hotel, London, England between 16 November and 20 November. The winner was Adam Logan of Canada.  As in previous years, the tournament began with a 24-round Swiss tournament over three days. The top two players from this phase contested a best-of-five final. The preliminary stage involved 102 players over 24 rounds, using the "Chew Pairing" system to select the draw for each round. Adam Logan beat Pakorn Nemitrmansuk of Thailand 3-0 in the final. Notably, Nemitrmansuk was also the runner-up finalist at WSC 2003. Adam won the first game 524-409.  Pakorn bingoed EDACIOUS, GRINDER and VALETiNG while Adam could only manage one (STATURE) until he ended the game with a rare triple-triple TWISTIeR, which clinched it for him as Pakorn ran out of time. Adam won the second game 520-316  with bingoes RIBANDS, GNaRRED, CLOGGER and ELODEAS while Pakorn managed CATTAILS and VAUNTIER, and lost points on letters and time once again.  Adam won the third game 465-426  to clinch the title. Bingoes from Adam were AURATES, REcOINED, ANCOnES and from Pakorn were TEAMING and BIRSLED. This was the fourth time in eight events that a Canadian had won, including one year in which a Canadian played for the United States. Places were allocated by country.
