A popular consultation to convene a referendum on repealing the law on decriminalization of abortion was held in Uruguay on 23 June 2013. The proposal failed to muster the required popular support. In 2012, Uruguay decriminalized abortion. Many politicians and advocacy groups protested its legalization.   The political positions are varied, with leaders from all the parties that think differently.  Only 8,92% of ellegible voters supported the referendum.
