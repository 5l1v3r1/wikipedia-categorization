The 1944 Winter Olympics, which would have been officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (after the cancellation of 1940's V Olympic Winter Games) (Italian: V Giochi olimpici invernali), were to have been celebrated in February 1944 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Cortina d'Ampezzo had been awarded the games in June 1939, but with the onset of World War II, the 1944 Winter Olympics were cancelled in 1941. The V Olympic Winter Games eventually took place in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in 1948; Cortina d'Ampezzo eventually hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics.
