The Esposizione universale (World's Fair) of 1942 was planned to be held in Rome. The government projected a new neighbourhood, on the south-west of Rome, called Esposizione Universale Roma, or EUR. Many references to ancient and imperial Rome were planned, such as the building of the Palazzo della Civilt√† Italiana as a cubic Colosseum, an obelisk to Guglielmo Marconi, and a projected but not built great arch, featured in the Fair posters. Italy's involvement in World War II, however, meant that the show never took place.
