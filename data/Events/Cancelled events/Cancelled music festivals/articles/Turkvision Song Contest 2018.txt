 Turkvision Song Contest 2018 (Turkish: Türkvizyon Şarkı Yarışması 2018) is tentatively scheduled to be the fourth edition of Turkvision Song Contest, and if all goes to plan, will be organised by TMB TV after two uncertain years of cancellations. Forty-four Turkic regions, which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language, confirmed their participation in the contest. Austria, Latvia, Moldova, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Stavropol Krai and Sweden hope to make their debut, while Bashkortostan, Crimea and Khakassia hope to return after a three-year absence. TMB TV are still having problems finding both a venue and an official date for the contest.  Unlike the 2015 edition which had no semi-final stage,  because of the withdrawals from several Russian states from the contest due to the international relations between the Russian Federation and Turkey in 2015,  the 2017 edition was to consist of one semi-final and a grand final taking place on 29 and 31 August 2017, but was cancelled on 20 October 2017. However, if all goes to plan in the 2018 contest, there is likely to be two semi-finals and a grand final, with host country Turkey to proceed straight to the grand final.  The following Turkic regions, which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language, have confirmed their participation in the contest.
