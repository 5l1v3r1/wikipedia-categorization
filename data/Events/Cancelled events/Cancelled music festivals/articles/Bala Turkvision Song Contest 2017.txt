Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2017 (Turkish: Bala Türkvizyon Şarkı Yarışması 2017) was to be the second edition of the Bala Turkvision Song Contest, which was to take place at the Saryarka Velodrome, in Astana, Kazakhstan; and organised by Adam Media Group. The contest was originally scheduled to take place in December 2016, but was cancelled due to on-going events in Turkey. Only five Turkic regions, which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language, confirmed their participation in the contest before it was cancelled for the second year running on October 20, 2017. As of now, the future of the Bala Turkvision Song Contest remains uncertain. The contest was originally scheduled to take place in Turkey, but was later announced as being cancelled due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings, marking the first time since the inaugural contest in 2015 that a cancellation of the contest had occurred.  In February 2017 it was announced by Ministry of Culture and Sports in Kazakhstan, that the 2017 edition would take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, and would coincide with other events taking place in the city as part of Expo 2017.  The contest was originally going to be held at the Barys Arena, in Astana, Kazakhstan.  The following list of countries and regions were on the participation list for Bala Turkvision 2016, which was cancelled due to the situation in Turkey. It is unknown if they will participate at the rescheduled edition in 2017.
