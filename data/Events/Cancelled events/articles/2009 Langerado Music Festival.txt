The seventh Langerado Festival was scheduled to be held on March 6–8, 2009. The festival was planned to move to Bicentennial Park in Miami, Florida.    This caused controversy among fans who disliked the direction the festival is heading, considering it "selling out" and saying it will lose the unique character of the festival.  Another concern was the availability of parking and places to stay in Miami, as many people who attended the previous festivals simply camped out at the park or nearby camping sites.  On February 3, it was announced that Langerado 2009 would be canceled due to sluggish ticket sales resulting from disenchantment over the new location, atypical lineup, and lack of onsite camping.  The initial lineup was posted on December 9, 2008.
