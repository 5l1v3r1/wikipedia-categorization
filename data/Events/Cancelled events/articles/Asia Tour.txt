It would have marked Dion's first concerts in Asia since the Taking Chances World Tour in 2008. While Japan and the Philippines were the only confirmed stops of the tour, it has been revealed that the singer was planned to be performing dates in several Asian countries for the very first time.  The tour was organized to support the English language album Loved Me Back to Life, and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014. Japan and the Philippines were officially announced. However, there were unofficial dates and venues for Taiwan, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand but because of the cancellation the ticket were never put on sale. In total, 14 concerts were supposed to take place. Celine's concerts in Tokyo and Osaka sold out immediately after tickets went on sale.  On 13 August 2014, Dion has announced that the tour has been cancelled due to ongoing illness and family issues.

The official setlist had yet to be announced, although in an exclusive video message to her Japanese fans, Dion promised a new show featuring songs from her latest English album, Loved Me Back to Life, as well as fan favorites from the past.  Celine was also rehearsing one song in Japanese and one in Mandarin for the tour.
