The Countrywide Basketball League or the CWBL was a planned regional basketball league in the Philippines.  On July 2016, it was announced that the planned first conference of the Countrywide Basketball League, which was tentatively set on August 7, 2016, has been cancelled after broadcast partner ABS-CBN's withdrawal of support, due to financial difficulties, according to CWBL vice president of operations Joe Lipa.   On August 2017, it was announced that the league will push through with their launch but preparations were held up once again as of 2018.  Before the league's cancellation in 2016, CWBL chairman, Rey Gamboa, stated that the coverage of the games was to focus on localities. The league was supposed to be exclusively covered by ABS-CBN Sports to aired live coverage on ABS-CBN Sports+Action and its regional counterparts with telecast nationwide and all ABS-CBN Regional Network Group. ABS-CBN Later withdrew support which also led to the league's cancellation.
