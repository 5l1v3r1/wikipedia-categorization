The 2015 Trophée Éric Bompard was the fourth event of six in the 2015–16 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating, a senior-level international invitational competition series. It was held at the Meriadeck Ice Rink in Bordeaux on November 13. Medals were awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. Skaters earned points toward qualifying for the 2015–16 Grand Prix Final. The competition was cancelled after the first day following the November 2015 Paris attacks. The short programs and short dances had been completed on 13 November, but the free skatings and free dances were to be held on the second day.   On 23 November, the International Skating Union announced that the short program/short dance results would be considered as the final results for world standing/ranking points, prize money, as well as qualifiers for the Grand Prix Final.   Skaters did not compete their free skating/free dance programs, as the second day of competition was cancelled due to the November 2015 Paris attacks. The short programs of all four disciplines finished several hours before the attacks began.
