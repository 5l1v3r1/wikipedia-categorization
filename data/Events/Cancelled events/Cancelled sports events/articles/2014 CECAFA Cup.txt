The 2014 CECAFA Cup would have been the 38th edition of the annual CECAFA Cup, an international football competition consisting of national teams of member nations of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). It was scheduled to take place in Ethiopia from 24 November to 9 December,   but the nation withdrew from hosting the tournament in October due to "domestic and international engagements",  according to CECAFA secretary-general Nicholas Musonye. Musonye also announced that Sudan as one of the countries that could have replaced Ethiopia as the hosts of the tournament.  After none of the 12 member nations of CECAFA expressed an interest in hosting the tournament on short notice, it was announced on 27 November that CECAFA had reportedly cancelled the competition, with Rwanda expected to host the 2015 edition of the competition.
