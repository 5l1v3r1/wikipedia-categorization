  The 1963 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games was cancelled, as the designated host Cambodia was not able to host the event due to unsettling in-country conditions[specify], and a disagreement with the International Amateur Athletic Federation. The 3rd SEAP Games then passed to Laos as hosts, but they begged off the 1965 event citing financial difficulties and hosted the 2009 Southeast Asian Games decades later. Malaysia stepped in. The 1965 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games was held in Kuala Lumpur with around 1,300 athletes and officials taking part. By then, the SEAP Games Federation had gained another member which is Singapore after Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia occurred in August that year.
