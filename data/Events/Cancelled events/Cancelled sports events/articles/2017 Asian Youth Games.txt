It has now been decided to postpone until 2021 in Surabaya, Indonesia.

On 15 June 2012 the president of the Olympic Council of Asia Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah announced that Hambantota had been chosen as the host of the games. Indonesia, Qatar, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan also bid to stage the games but were ultimately unsuccessful.  Sri Lanka was stripped of its hosting rights by OCA due to political interference of its government with its national Olympic committee. Indonesia was offered by OCA to take over as hosts and the games were suggested test event for the 2018 Asian Games. Sri Lanka's replacement was set to be decided at an OCA general assembly scheduled in September 2015,  but it has now been decided to postpone the event for 4 years as no replacement host city was found.
