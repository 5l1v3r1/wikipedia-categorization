The 2016 CECAFA Cup was to be the 39th edition of the annual CECAFA Cup, an international football competition consisting of the national teams of member nations of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). In September 2016, it was confirmed that Kenya would host the tournament.  Originally, it was to be hosted in Sudan.  In November 2016, Kenya announced they are not ready to host the tournament and CECAFA officials are looking to persuade Sudan to take over as hosts.  In December 2016, CECAFA announced the 2016 edition of the tournament will be canceled.
