But it was cancelled in the last moment when calendar was published on 8 April 2016 in Zürich. It was planned that Titisee-Neustadt was supposed to host world cup opening events in November, but they decided to stepped out while they have plan to renovate the hill and it wouldn't be ready right on schedule.
