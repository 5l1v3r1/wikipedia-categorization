The GCC Champions League (Arabic: دوري أبطال الخليج للأندية‎), is an annually organized football league tournament for club of the Arabian Peninsula. The 2016 edition was set to be the 31st edition.  On August 6th 2015 it was announced that the competition would be postponed until February 2016 due to the suspension of Kuwait from FIFA. Later in January 2016 it was announced that the competition would not take place at all due to a lack of sponsorship. The next edition would therefore be held in 2017.      The group stage was drawn before the tournament got cancelled.
