The 1941 FIBA European Championship, commonly called EuroBasket 1941, was a planned basketball competition in Lithuania. Most likely it would have been held in Kaunas Sports Hall as it was the first and only basketball arena in Europe. The competition was cancelled due to World War II.   As formal compensation for this competition never taking place, Lithuania was granted the right to organize EuroBasket 2011.
