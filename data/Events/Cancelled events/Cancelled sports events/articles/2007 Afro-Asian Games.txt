The Algiers Afro-Asian Games were an expected major international multi-sport event, to be held in Algiers, Algeria.  The event, however, has been postponed indefinitely. It is uncertain when it will be held. After the success of the Inaugural Afro-Asian Games, the second edition of the Games were set to go underway. However, the Algerian Government has decided to postpone the event. Algiers was "ready" to host the second Afro-Asian Games, and it was scheduled to be held from July to August, 2007. However, the Games were indefinitely postponed.  The President of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA), Lassana Palenfo, said that: It is impossible for us to host the Afro-Asian Games, as the Asians have failed to line up their gold medallists.
