The 2011 AFF U-23 Youth Championship was going to be the second edition of the tournament which was set to take place between the 16 and 26 July 2011 in Palembang, Indonesia but was postponed on 7 July because the Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium was under renovation and would be moved to Jakarta.  It was considered by the ASEAN Football Federation as the preparatory tournament for the 2011 Southeast Asian Games, which would also be held in Indonesia.  The 2011 competition was later cancelled.
