 The 2017 Tour of Qatar was a planned road cycling stage race that was originally scheduled to take place between 6 and 10 February 2017. However, in December 2016, the event was cancelled due to lack of sponsorship support.   It would have been the 16th edition of the Tour of Qatar and the third event of the 2017 UCI World Tour.  It had originally been included in the UCI World Tour calendar for the first time.
