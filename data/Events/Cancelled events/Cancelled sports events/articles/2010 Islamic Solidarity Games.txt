The 2nd Islamic Solidarity Games were going to be an international sporting event scheduled to be held in Iran on 9â€“25 April, 2010. The Games were cancelled following a dispute between the host country and Saudi Arabia. It was reported 3 May 2009, that Iran had suspended the games due to a dispute over the use of the term "Persian Gulf".  Saudi Arabia and other Arabic countries disapproved of the use of the term "Persian Gulf" on literature and medals and insisted the term "Arabian Gulf" or just "Gulf" be used instead.  Iran claimed it was still in talks to try to salvage the games.  On 17 January 2010, the governing body of the ISG reported that the event had been canceled due to the tension between Arab states and Iran over the name of the body of water.
