The 2016 Bulgarian Supercup was meant to be the 14th Bulgarian Supercup, an annual Bulgarian football match played between the winners of the previous season's A Football Group and Bulgarian Cup. The game was to be played between CSKA Sofia, winners of the 2016 Bulgarian Cup Final, and Ludogorets Razgrad, champions of the 2015â€“16 A Group.  However, prior to the match CSKA Sofia bankrupted, followed by taking another team's professional license. As a consequence, the 2016 Bulgarian Supercup final was not held.
