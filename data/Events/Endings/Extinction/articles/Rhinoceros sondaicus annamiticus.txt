 Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus  is a critically endangered subspecies of Rhinoceros sondaicus, that formerly lived in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia and may still survive in Vietnam. The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam. R. sondaicus annamiticus once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific name R.s. annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, which was part of its range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of seasonal tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.   The last known individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010, and some conservation groups believe that the subspecies is extinct.  As with many other species, the two main factors in the decline of the Javan rhinoceros populations has been loss of habitat combined with over-hunting.  Poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Because the rhinoceros' final range encompassed an area of human poverty, it was difficult to convince local people not to kill an animal which could be sold for an enormous sum of money.
