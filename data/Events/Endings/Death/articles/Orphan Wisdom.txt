Orphan Wisdom is a philosophical system invented and promoted by Stephen Jenkinson that believes what modern people "suffer from most is culture failure, amnesia of ancestry and deep family story, phantom or sham rites of passage, no instruction on how to live with each other or with the world around us or with our dead or with our history."  Before his 2010 founding of the Orphan Wisdom School, Jenkinson directed palliative care at Mount Sinai Hospital of Toronto.  Orphan Wisdom's teachings push against "'death phobia' and 'grief illiteracy'"  to promote acceptance of death well before death in order to "participate emotionally in their deaths as they participate in other big life events"  The documentary film about Jenkinson and Orphan Wisdom, Griefwalker, was produced by the National Film Board of Canada and filmed over twelve years by Tim Wilson.
