Dignified death is a somewhat elusive concept often related to suicide. One factor that has been cited as a core component of dignified death is maintaining a sense of control.  Another view is that a truly dignified death is an extension of a dignified life.  There is some concern that assisted suicide does not guarantee a dignified death, since some patients may experience complications such as nausea and vomiting.  There is some concern that age discrimination denies the elderly a dignified death.
