The thanatotranscriptome denotes (in the fields of biochemistry, microbiology and biophysics of thanatology and in particular forensic) all RNA from the transcript of the part of genome still active or awakened in the internal organs of a dead body for 24 to 48 hours following the time of the death.  ·   (It was recently showed that in these 48 hours, some genes continue to be expressed in cells, producing the mRNA and that certain genes are expressed again that had been inhibited since the end of fetal development)   It can from a serology postmortem characterize transcriptome of tissue particular cell type, or compare the transcriptomes between various conditions experimental. It can be complementary to the analysis of thanatomicrobiome to better understand the process of transformation of the necromass in the days following the death;.  Characterization and quantification of the transcriptome in a tissue "dead" given and conditions data can identify genes assets, to determine the regulatory mechanisms of Gene Expression and set networks of gene expression. The techniques commonly used for simultaneously measuring the concentration of a large number of different types of mRNA include Microarray, high throughput sequencing said RNA RNA-Seq. Clues to the existence of a post-mortem transcriptome existed at least since the beginning of the 21st century,  but in scientific publications the word thanatotranscriptome seems to have been first proposed by Javan et al. in 2015;  At the University of Washington, Peter Noble, Alex Pozhitkov and their colleagues recently (2016) confirmed that up to 2 days (48 hours) after the death of mice or zebrafish, many genes still function in their body.   changes in the quantities of mRNA in the body prove that hundreds of genes with very different functions awoke just after death 548 genes have thus awakened after the death of zebrafish and 515 in the laboratory mice.  Among the genes which thus awake, there are genes involved in the development of the organism, including genes that are normally activated only in utero or in ovo (in the egg) during fetal development.  This information could possibly in the future lead to:
