The death-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that encourages people to speak openly about death, dying, and corpses. The movement seeks to eliminate the silence around death-related topics, decrease anxiety surrounding death, and encourages more diversity in end of life care options available to the public.  The word death positivity was popularized[dubious  â€“ discuss] by Caitlin Doughty as a play on the term sex positivity. However, the ideas behind the movement have existed much longer.   The Order of the Good Death website lists the beliefs of the death-positive movement as being that cultural censorship of death and dying does more harm than good, that open discussions about death should be accepted as a natural human curiosity, that families should have full rights to care for the bodies of their loved ones without intervention from funeral businesses, and that end of life care should be diversified and performed in ways that cause less damage to the environment than our current practices.  The movement also strongly encourages participants to speak to their families about their own end of life wishes, even if they are young and healthy and is critical of the commercialized funeral industry.  It also encourages people to express their feelings about death through art.
