A dying god, or departure of the gods, is a motif in mythology in which one or more gods (of a pantheon) die, are destroyed, or depart permanently from their place on Earth to elsewhere. Frequently cited examples of dying gods are Balder in Norse mythology, or Quetzalcoatl in Aztec mythology. A special subcategory is the death of an entire pantheon, the most notable example being Ragnar√∂k in Norse mythology, with other examples from Ireland, India, Hawaii and Tahiti.  "Death or departure of the gods" is motif A192 in Stith Thompson's  Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, with the following subcategories:   A separate (although related and overlapping) category are gods who die and are also resurrected (Thompson's motif A193), see Dying-and-rising god.
