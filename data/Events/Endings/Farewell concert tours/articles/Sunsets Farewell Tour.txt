  The Sunsets Farewell Tour was a 2010 concert tour of Australian rock band Powderfinger. It was their last concert tour following the announcement on 9 April 2010 that they would be breaking up after the tour, saying it would be their last ever as the band had musically said everything they wanted to say.  It coincided with the release of their final album, Golden Rule, on 13 November 2009. In a statement read by Bernard Fanning, the band said: "With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule, we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group. We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date." The band also stated, regarding the set list, that their first album Parables for Wooden Ears probably wouldn't feature so much; Fanning laughed while saying, "we're going to play that in its entirety." Most of the songs performed were from their most successful albums – Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five and Vulture Street – as well as singles "These Days" and "Bless My Soul". This setlist was performed on October 12th, 2010, at the University of Canberra. Encore: Encore 2:
