15 The Alexisonfire Farewell Tour was the final concert tour by Canadian post-hardcore band Alexisonfire, taking place in December 2012. The band, who disbanded in August 2011, announced at the time their plans of doing one last farewell tour before officially disbanding, which will be also celebrating their 10th anniversary, though since then, nothing official about the farewell tour was announced until August 9, 2012, when the band revealed the tour dates to take place in December 2012.  The band has commented that the tour is short, due to December being the only available time window for all five members when they are free from any other commitments, especially Dallas Green who's touring with City and Colour and Wade MacNeil who's touring with Gallows. Although the band officially announced their break-up in August 2011, this will be the band's first tour in two years, as their last tour took place in December 2010, after which Green expressed his desire to leave the band, although this was never announced until 2011. On August 17, 2012, after the tickets for the London date were sold out in just 5 minutes, the band announced that they added another London date at the same venue, a day before, on December 2, 2012.
