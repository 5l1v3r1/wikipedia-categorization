Closure may be the result of a <a href=\"/wiki/Bankruptcy\" title=\"Bankruptcy\">bankruptcy</a>, where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the <a href=\"/wiki/Proprietor\" title=\"Proprietor\">proprietor</a> of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a <a href=\"/wiki/Corporate_merger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corporate merger\">corporate merger</a>.  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.\n</p><p>While a closure is typically of a business or a <a href=\"/wiki/Non-profit_organization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Non-profit organization\">non-profit organization</a>, any <a href=\"/wiki/Entity\" title=\"Entity\">entity</a> which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.\n</p><p>Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2013)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.\n</p><p>The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.\n</p><p>If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\"><span title=\"The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (December 2013)\">clarification needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.\n</p><p>If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy <a href=\"/wiki/Liquidation\" title=\"Liquidation\">liquidation</a>: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.\n</p><p>Possibly the largest \"closure\" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a> into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of <a href=\"/wiki/East_Germany\" title=\"East Germany\">East Germany</a> can be considered a <a href=\"/wiki/Merger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Merger\">merger</a> rather than a closure as <a href=\"/wiki/West_Germany\" title=\"West Germany\">West Germany</a> assumed all of the assets and liabilities of <a href=\"/wiki/East_Germany\" title=\"East Germany\">East Germany</a>. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while <a href=\"/wiki/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a> assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid <a href=\"/wiki/Parking_ticket\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Parking ticket\">parking tickets</a> accumulated by <a href=\"/wiki/Motor_vehicle\" title=\"Motor vehicle\">motor vehicles</a> operated on behalf of <a href=\"/wiki/Diplomatic_mission\" title=\"Diplomatic mission\">diplomatic missions</a> operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.\n</p><p>Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the <a href=\"/wiki/Penn_Central\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Penn Central\">Penn Central</a> railroad, the <a href=\"/wiki/Enron_scandal\" title=\"Enron scandal\">Enron scandals</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/MCI_Worldcom\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MCI Worldcom\">MCI Worldcom</a>'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into <a href=\"/wiki/Verizon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Verizon\">Verizon</a>.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP
