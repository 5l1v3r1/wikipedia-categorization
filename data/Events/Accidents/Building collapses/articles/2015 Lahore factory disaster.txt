 The 2015 Lahore factory disaster resulted when a shopping bag factory located on the Sundar Industrial Estate  near Lahore, Pakistan collapsed    on 4 November 2015, killing at least 45 people  and trapping about 150.  A large rescue operation is underway and includes a team of army engineers and urban search-and-rescue personnel.   Messages have been received via mobile phones from people trapped in the rubble.  The challenge of getting heavy machinery to the site of the collapse is hampering the rescue effort, according to an official.
