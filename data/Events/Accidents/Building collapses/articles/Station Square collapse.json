Within 10 minutes an employee noticed water spraying from an overhead pipe that had burst.  It was buckling under pressure from a roof beam that was twisting out of shape above a steel column.  The 4.5 minute-long structural failure was heard and witnessed by many of the store occupants, including several who took photographs of the twisting and crushed beam.  Evacuation alerts were issued through the public address system and the store was emptied in less than 5 minutes.  The mayor of Burnaby, Bill Copeland, who presided over the opening ceremonies, assisted in directing the evacuation of approximately 600 customers and 307 employees.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Four structural bays of the roof, measuring 27 by 23 metres (89 by 75&#160;ft), collapsed into the produce section.

In 1986 Station Square/Wesbild purchased the as-yet unbuilt project.\n</p><p>The supermarket facility was a $5.4 million part of the newly constructed mixed-use <a href=\"/wiki/Metrotown,_Burnaby\" title=\"Metrotown, Burnaby\">Station Square</a>, complex in the Metrotown area of Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The facility was owned and developed by Wesbild Enterprises and Station Square Developments Inc..  Urban Design Group were the architects. Amako Construction Ltd. was the general contractor.  Two structural engineering firms were involved: Tamm Tacy and Associates and MSS Group who were engaged during construction to provide additional structural verification.  Save-On-Foods, then owned by the <a href=\"/wiki/Overwaitea_Foods\" title=\"Overwaitea Foods\">Overwaitea Foods</a> division of Jim Pattison Industries (now <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Pattison_Group\" title=\"Jim Pattison Group\">Jim Pattison Group</a>), was a tenant, not the owner or developer of the building.<sup id=\"cite_ref-attgen_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-attgen-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Before construction started, one of the contractors bidding on the work proposed adding car parking onto the roof.  The owner asked the architects and engineers to determine if this was feasible; they did and recommended changes to the design of the structure for additional support and to provide access by way of a <a href=\"/wiki/Moving_walkway\" title=\"Moving walkway\">moving walkway</a>.\n</p><p>The structural failure was a direct result of the failure of the roof beam to support the weight of the rooftop parking structure and automobiles above.  It was determined that the steel beam was undersized for its intended purpose and did not have bracing required to resist buckling above where it was supported on the column.\n</p><p>Several factors were determined by the Commissioner of Inquiry into the collapse to have contributed to the collapse.  These included, in part or in combination, errors on the part of the engineers, contractors, and steel supplier/mill.  It has also been argued that then-industry standard procedures in engaging and valuation of engineering services and certification of contractors' work were also contributing factors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-attgen_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-attgen-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beam_size\">Beam size</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Beam size\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the design phase, the thickness of the roof beam that failed was reduced by 27% to a size incapable of supporting the loads above, even with lateral bracing.  The reasons for this change have not been determined. \"The beam was greatly under designed.  The beam column assembly lacked essential lateral supports.  Failure was inevitable.  If not under April 23 loads, then under full service loads.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-attgen_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-attgen-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>November 1987, during construction, a beam in the area of the moving walkway deflected and caused the residential structure above to tilt approximately 2 inches (51&#160;mm) from vertical.  The structural engineers reviewed the design in this area and recommended additional columns, stronger beams, and concrete reinforcing be added. This was done.  In December 1987, Wesbild/Station Square hired the MSS Group to conduct a review of the engineering design in this area.  They made recommendations, including remedial work to beams with insufficient capacity, to which Tamm Tacy concurred.  Both firms later certified that this remedial work has been completed by the contractor.\n</p><p>In March 1988 the MSS Group was hired by the tenant, Save-On-Foods, to conduct a structural review of the entire project due to concerns about deflections of roof beams above the store.  MSS found two beams to have \"insufficient capacity\" and made recommendations for correction.  Both engineering firms, the architects, developer, and contractor took steps to initiate this action.  The following day Tamm Tacy advised that this remedial work would not be necessary due to the steel mill who had fabricated the beam provided documentation indicating the actual capacity of the beam was significantly greater than documentation used during design.  MSS Group advised that the beam was therefore \"satisfactory to resist the design loadings imposed\" and \"this information is a blessing for all concerned\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-attgen_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-attgen-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Two types of failure occurred:  beam bending with buckling of the lower beam flange, and buckling of the beam-column assembly.  The first was determined to be the most probable prime failure and the second the less probably prime cause.\n</p><p>The beam that failed was a 24 inch (610&#160;mm) deep wide flange steel beam.  Failure occurred at the point where it was supported on top of a steel column.  One end of the beam was continuously supported (on other columns) and the other end was <a href=\"/wiki/Cantilever\" title=\"Cantilever\">cantilevered</a> (not supported on other columns). With the weight of the cars parking on the roof, the beam began to buckle and was photographed to have rotated approximately 90 degrees from the vertical to the horizontal position above the supporting column.  For an estimate 4 1/2 minutes, the roof deck and supporting joists sagged and functioned as a form of suspension bridge.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Concrete_topping\">Concrete topping</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Concrete topping\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The concrete topping on the roof deck was increased from 2 inches (51&#160;mm) to 3 inches (76&#160;mm) thickness.  The design of the supporting roof joists were increased to account for this increased dead load, but the beam was not.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rooftop_sidewalk\">Rooftop sidewalk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Rooftop sidewalk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The width of the rooftop sidewalk was increased from 5 feet (1.5&#160;m) to 11 feet (3.4&#160;m).  The engineer's design called for this to be concrete over styrofoam; the contractor built the extra width of solid concrete.  This increase in dead load was not known to the architects and engineers at the time and so no change to supporting structure was investigated.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Steel_strength\">Steel strength</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Steel strength\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The MSS Group recommended strengthening the beam above the column by adding a beam bracket with web stiffeners.  This change was not implemented when Tamm Tacy advised that mill certificates obtained from the steel sub-contractor indicated to be 25% higher strength than expected.  It was later determined that this type of data is not a truly representative sampling of the steel as fabricated and so is not a valid measure of actual strength.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lateral_bracing\">Lateral bracing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Lateral bracing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Lateral bracing can increase the capacity of beams. It can be provided by roof joists or beam web stiffeners. The engineering drawings did not indicate lateral bracing to be provided at the column where the collapse occurred.  The engineers did not study the reduced capacity of the beam due to lack of lateral support.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scope_of_work\">Scope of work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Scope of work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There was a misunderstanding of who was to determine the need for lateral bracing. The steel subcontractor stated they did not provide web stiffeners to the beam as they weren't indicated on the engineering drawings.  Tamm Tacy stated they believed the decision to provide the stiffeners resided with the steel subcontractor's detailer.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Live_load_miscalculation\">Live load miscalculation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Live load miscalculation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Engineers at the MSS Group made incorrect assumptions about the live loads on the roof deck in checking the design.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Industry_practices\">Industry practices</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Station_Square_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Industry practices\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Commissioner of Inquiry noted three common practices of the development and construction industry were cause for concern:  fast-tracking, bidding for professional services, and fragmentation of contractual responsibility.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Fast-track_construction\" title=\"Fast-track construction\">Fast-track construction</a> process obtaining permits and commencing construction on a portion of the project before the design is fully completed.
