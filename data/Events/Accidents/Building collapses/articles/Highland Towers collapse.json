East Creek flowed into the site of the Highland Towers before the construction of Highland Towers, so a pipe system was built to divert the stream to bypass the Highland Towers.\n</p><p>In 1991, a new housing development project, known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Bukit_Antarabangsa\" title=\"Bukit Antarabangsa\">Bukit Antarabangsa Development Project</a>, commenced construction on the hilltop behind the Highland Towers. The hill was cleared of trees and other land-covering plants, exposing the soil to land erosion that is the leading factor of causing landslides.\n</p><p>The water from the new construction site was diverted into the existing pipe system used to divert the flow of East Creek. This overloaded the pipe system and water, sand and silt from both East Creek and the construction site of Bukit Antarabangsa infiltrated the pipes. The pipes burst at several locations on the hill, and the surrounding soil (behind Block 1) had to absorb the excessive water. The monsoon rainfall in December 1993 further worsened the situation.\n</p><p>The water content in the soil became over-saturated to the extent that the soil had turned viscous, in effect becoming mud. By the end of November 1993, the hill slope had been saturated with water, and water was seen flowing down the hill slopes and the constructed retaining walls.\n</p><p>Shortly thereafter, a landslide took place and destroyed the constructed retaining walls. The landslide contained an estimated 100,000 square metres of mud \u2013 a mass equivalent to 200 <a href=\"/wiki/Boeing_747\" title=\"Boeing 747\">Boeing 747</a> jets. The soil rammed onto the foundation of Block 1, incrementally pushing it forward. After of that constant pressure, the foundations of Block 1 snapped and in December 1993, residents began to see cracks forming and widening on the road around the Highland Towers, a forewarning of collapse. Unfortunately, there was no further investigation before Block 1 collapsed on 11 December 1993.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fatalities\">Fatalities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Highland_Towers_collapse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Fatalities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The official death toll released by the authorities was 48, though other sources gave a number greater than 55.
