The collapse of Block 7 at Lotus Riverside (a 13-story apartment building) in 2009 is an accident that killed one person. Lotus Riverside (simplified Chinese: 莲花河畔景苑; traditional Chinese: 蓮花河畔景苑; pinyin: lián huā hé pàn jǐng yuàn) is a residential apartment complex located in Minhang District, Shanghai, China. On June 27, 2009 at 5:30 Am UTC+8, Block 7, one of the eleven 13-story buildings of the apartment complex, collapsed, killing one worker named Xiao Dekun. According to the Wall Street Journal, which referenced Shanghai Daily: "According to Shanghai Daily, initial investigations attribute the accident to the excavations for the construction of a garage under the collapsed building. Large quantities of earth were removed and dumped in a landfill next to a nearby creek; the weight of the earth caused the river bank to collapse, which, in turn, allowed water to seep into the ground, creating a muddy foundation for the building that toppled."
