There have been many thousands of friendly fire incidents in recorded military history, accounting for an estimated 2% to 20% of all casualties in battle.    The examples listed below illustrate their range and diversity, but this does not reflect increasing frequency. The rate of friendly fire, once allowance has been made for the numbers of troops committed to battle, has remained remarkably stable over the past 200 years.  It has been estimated that there may have been as many as 8,000 friendly fire incidents in the Vietnam War;     one was the inspiration for the book and film Friendly Fire.
