The five operators of the vehicle, U.S. Army engineers, found themselves stranded in the desert when <a href=\"/wiki/M1_Abrams\" title=\"M1 Abrams\">M1A1</a> tank and <a href=\"/wiki/Bradley_Fighting_Vehicle\" title=\"Bradley Fighting Vehicle\">Bradley Fighting Vehicle</a> units of the <a href=\"/wiki/3rd_Armored_Cavalry_Regiment_(United_States)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)\">3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment</a> approached from the north. Specialist Craig Walker tried signaling to the approaching forces by switching his <a href=\"/wiki/Night_vision_goggles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Night vision goggles\">night vision goggles</a> on and off. The armored cavalry troop had been told the airfield was defended by 500+ Iraqi soldiers, and to expect stiff resistance.  The troop commander fired warning shots in the air after requesting permission to do so from his squadron commander.  Some of the cavalry troopers saw returned fire, but whether this came from the engineers is doubtful.  The cavalry troop vehicles opened fire on the engineers with high-explosive rounds, mistaking their vehicle for an enemy position. The result of the high-explosive rounds set off demolition charges within the engineers' armored personnel carrier. The situation progressed for about seven minutes, with the troop commander calling cease fire after two volleys, thinking the \"enemy forces\" were contained and waiting for them to surrender. The squadron commander then arrived on the scene in his <a href=\"/wiki/Bradley_Fighting_Vehicle\" title=\"Bradley Fighting Vehicle\">Bradley Fighting Vehicle</a> and opened fire when he thought one of the engineers (still believed to be Iraqis) was trying to escape. When the shooting was over, one engineer was wounded and another, Corporal Lance Fielder of Tennessee, was dead from <a href=\"/wiki/Coaxial\" title=\"Coaxial\">coaxial</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Machinegun\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Machinegun\">machinegun</a> fire.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coverup\">Coverup</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Umm_Hajul_controversy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Coverup\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Shortly after the incident, false reports were filed, stating that the 3rd Cavalry took an estimated 50 Iraqi prisoners in the assault. Three <a href=\"/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal\" title=\"Bronze Star Medal\">Bronze Stars</a> were awarded on the basis of misleading statements and representations, as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GAO_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GAO-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  The squadron commander was the son-in-law of a famous Vietnam-era general, and his brothers-in-law were also general officers. He did not face repercussions and was selected for promotion to colonel.  Both the cavalry troop commander and the lieutenant in charge of the engineers at the airfield were given career-ending evaluations and forced out of the Army.  This was particularly ironic, since the lieutenant was completely not culpable. Many discrepancies uncovered in three army investigations were overlooked or ignored, and several lower-ranking soldiers and officers were threatened or coerced into remaining silent.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Investigation\">Investigation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Umm_Hajul_controversy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Investigation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>U.S. Senator <a href=\"/wiki/Fred_Thompson\" title=\"Fred Thompson\">Fred Thompson</a> of Tennessee initiated a Congressional investigation into this incident, in which Corporal Lance Fielder of Nashville, Tennessee had died.
