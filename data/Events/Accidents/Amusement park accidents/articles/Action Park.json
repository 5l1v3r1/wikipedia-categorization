<a href=\"/wiki/Mountain_Creek\" title=\"Mountain Creek\">Vernon Valley/Great Gorge</a> ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a 2,700-foot-long (820&#160;m) <a href=\"/wiki/Alpine_slide\" title=\"Alpine slide\">alpine slide</a> down one of the steep ski trails.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two <a href=\"/wiki/Water_slide\" title=\"Water slide\">water slides</a> and a <a href=\"/wiki/Go-kart\" title=\"Go-kart\">go-kart track</a>, and named the collection of rides the \"Vernon Valley Summer Park\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \"Action Park\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across <a href=\"/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_94\" title=\"New Jersey Route 94\">Route 94</a>. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Action Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count <a href=\"/wiki/Grand_jury\" title=\"Grand jury\">grand jury</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Indictment\" title=\"Indictment\">indictment</a> against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized <a href=\"/wiki/Insurance\" title=\"Insurance\">insurance</a> company.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NJ_Herald_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NJ_Herald-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five <a href=\"/wiki/Insurance_fraud\" title=\"Insurance fraud\">insurance fraud</a>-related charges.<sup id=\"cite_ref-state_investigation_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-state_investigation-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper. \n</p><p>The park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the <a href=\"/wiki/Emergency_room\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emergency room\">emergency room</a> at a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra <a href=\"/wiki/Ambulance\" title=\"Ambulance\">ambulances</a> to keep up with the volume.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In September 1989, GAR negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By the 1990s, the Action Park was being advertised as the world's largest water park.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, the park launched a website on which visitors could find information about rides, directions to the park, and lodging, and even enter a lottery for a chance to win park tickets.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> In September 1991, Great American Recreation attempted to petition the <a href=\"/wiki/Vernon_Township,_New_Jersey\" title=\"Vernon Township, New Jersey\">Vernon Township</a> Committee to put a referendum on the November ballot that, if passed, would have legalized the operation of <a href=\"/wiki/Game_of_skill\" title=\"Game of skill\">games of skill</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Game_of_chance\" title=\"Game of chance\">chance</a> at Action Park.

In early 1995, GAR operated Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and Action Park with no liability insurance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>  New Jersey did not require it, and GAR found it more economical to go to court than purchase liability insurance, since they relied on their own self-insurance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> However, they ultimately purchased liability insurance from Evanston Insurance Company in May of that year to cover Action Park and the skiing facilities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> As 1995 progressed, GAR's financial woes continued to accumulate. <a href=\"/wiki/First_Fidelity_Bank\" title=\"First Fidelity Bank\">First Fidelity Bank</a>, who lent $19 million to GAR and some 15 other connected corporations, filed suit against them in an effort to begin the process of foreclosing on the debt owed to them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>  Law firms owed money for services rendered between 1991 and 1993 also began filing suit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>  As November approached, GAR negotiated a deal with Noramco Capital Corp. and the Praedium Fund of <a href=\"/wiki/CS_First_Boston\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CS First Boston\">CS First Boston</a>, in which they would purchase the debt owed to First Fidelity, temporarily fending off an impending foreclosure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In February 1996, the creditors who had taken on GAR's debt petitioned to force GAR into bankruptcy over the $14 million owed by the struggling company.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> GAR filed for <a href=\"/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code\" title=\"Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code\">Chapter 11</a> protection that following March, but remained optimistic that they could regain their financial footing \"within a year.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Action Park closed at the end of the season as usual on <a href=\"/wiki/Labor_Day\" title=\"Labor Day\">Labor Day</a>, September 2, 1996.

In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In 1984, one man died from a <a href=\"/wiki/Myocardial_infarction\" title=\"Myocardial infarction\">heart attack</a> after experiencing the swing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><b>Roaring Rapids</b>: This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride.

Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the \"back breaker\", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby <a href=\"/wiki/Snack_bar\" title=\"Snack bar\">snack bar</a> with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost <a href=\"/wiki/Bikini\" title=\"Bikini\">bikini</a> tops, or both.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.</li>\n<li><b>Super Speed Water Slides</b>: These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water\u2014which made a large splash\u2014and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Traction_Park_3-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Traction_Park-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><b>Diving cliffs</b>: The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of <a href=\"/wiki/Grotto\" title=\"Grotto\">grotto</a>, with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving <a href=\"/wiki/Cliff\" title=\"Cliff\">cliffs</a>\u2014one 23 feet (7 m), the other 18 feet (5.4 m)\u2014above a 16-foot (5 m) deep pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them\u2014or right on top of them.  The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gethard_37-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gethard-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tom_Fergus_39-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tom_Fergus-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> Still operating, known as Canyon Cliffs.</li>\n<li><b>Colorado River Ride</b>: The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 4-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes.  Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed.  After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork.\n<ul><li><b>The Main Fork</b>: Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks.  Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a foot-high (30&#160;cm) jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.</li>\n<li><b>The Alternative Forks</b>: Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup> and another fork.  One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end.

In the <a href=\"/wiki/Mountain_Creek\" title=\"Mountain Creek\">Mountain Creek</a> era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill.  Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough.  It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to <i><a href=\"/wiki/Weird_NJ\" title=\"Weird NJ\">Weird NJ</a></i> how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Greg_Shpunder_51-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Greg_Shpunder-51\">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>  On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck \u2013 requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft \u2013 or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>  Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.</dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Aerodium\">The Aerodium</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Action_Park&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: The Aerodium\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984.  In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium.  The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the <a href=\"/wiki/Bodyflight\" title=\"Bodyflight\">bodyflight</a> instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of 6 or 7 feet (2 m) above the ground, approximately a foot or two over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Factors_contributing_to_the_park.27s_safety_record\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Factors_contributing_to_the_park's_safety_record\">Factors contributing to the park's safety record</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Action_Park&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Factors contributing to the park&#039;s safety record\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ride_design\">Ride design</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Action_Park&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Ride design\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Action Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied.
