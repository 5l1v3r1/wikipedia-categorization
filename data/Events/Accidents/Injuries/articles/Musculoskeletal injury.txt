Musculoskeletal injury (MI, not to be confused with myocardial infarction) refers to damage of muscular or skeletal systems, which is usually due to a strenuous activity.  In one study, roughly 25% of approximately 6300 adults received a musculoskeletal injury of some sort within 12 monthsâ€”of which 83% were activity-related.  MI spans into a large variety of medical specialties including orthopedic surgery (with diseases such as arthritis requiring surgery), sports medicine,  emergency medicine (acute presentations of joint and muscular pain) and rheumatology (in rheumatological diseases that affect joints such as rheumatoid arthritis). In many cases, during the healing period after a musculoskeletal injury, a period in which the healing area will be completely immobile, a cast-induced muscle atrophy can occur. Routine sessions of physiotherapy after the cast is removed can help return strength in limp muscles or tendons. Alternately, there exist different methods of electrical stimulation of the immobile muscles which can be induced by a device placed underneath a cast, helping prevent atrophies
