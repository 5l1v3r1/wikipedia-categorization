 Lists of holidays by various categorization. In the order of the Wheel of the Year: The Catholic Patronal feast day or 'name day' are celebrated in each place's patron saint's day, according to the Calendar of saints. The following holidays are observed to some extent at the same time during the Southern hemisphere's summer, with the exception of Winter Solstice. Many other days are marked to celebrate events or people, around the world, but are not strictly holidays as time off work is rarely given.  Other secular holidays not observed internationally: These are holidays that are not traditionally marked on calendars. These holidays are celebrated by various groups and individuals. Some are designed to promote a cause, others recognize historical events not recognized officially, and others are "funny" holidays, generally intended as humorous distractions and excuses to share laughs among friends.
