This is an incomplete list of fictional holidays and list of fictional holidays created by fictional characters. Some commentators suggest that fictional holidays, particularly in television shows' Christmas episodes, have become one of the many clich√©s.

It's a favorite device of TV writers, but I'm not sure why."
