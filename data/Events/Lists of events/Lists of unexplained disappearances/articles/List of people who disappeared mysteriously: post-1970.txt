 This is a list of people who disappeared mysteriously: post-1970 and of people whose current whereabouts are unknown or whose deaths are not substantiated. Many people who disappear are eventually declared dead in absentia. In 2010 a video of him, somewhat emaciated, was released in which he begs for help from the U.S. government to be released. The U.S. government has regularly raised the issue of his release with Iran as part of talks between the countries, but Iran's statements as to whether he still is in their custody or even alive have been contradictory and it has been speculated that Levinson is no longer under their control if he is still alive.  Police obtained cell phone records the next day and found that he had made his call from somewhere between Taunton and Porter, northwest of Marshall, around 25 miles (40 km) from Lynd, allowing them to find Swanson's car. Dogs picked up a trail from there and followed it 3 miles (4.8 km) to the west, at one point crossing the Yellow Medicine River. It has been suggested he drowned in the river or died of hypothermia after getting out, but no trace of him has been found despite searches of 122 square miles (320 km2) in the area.
