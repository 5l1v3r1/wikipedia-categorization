The following is a list of notable people assassinated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, commonly known as Tamil Tigers or as LTTE.   The LTTE is a now-defunct militant organisation that was based in northern Sri Lanka, which fought for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka between 1983 and 2009.  The LTTE was decisively defeated by the Sri Lankan Military in May 2009 and it has been banned by 30 countries, including the United States, Canada, India and the 27 member nations of the European Union.  At the height of its power, the LTTE possessed a well-developed militia and carried out many high-profile attacks, including the assassinations of an Indian prime minister, Sri Lankan president and several other high-ranking Sri Lankan politicians.     Some of the notable people who survived the assassination attempts of LTTE, are also included at the bottom of this list.
