This is a list of Turkish diplomats killed by Armenian militant organisations.      The list includes families of diplomats as well as local or international staff members killed as a result of direct attacks or as collateral damage victims of the attacks directed against Turkish diplomats.   The attacks that are listed here begin with the assassination of Mehmet Baydar, Turkish Consul General to Los Angeles and Bahadır Demir, Consul at the same Consulate General.  Although the attacks against Turkish diplomats begin with these assassinations in 1973 by an individual perpetrator, Kourken Yanigian, the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) has assumed – or in some cases been accused of – the responsibility of attacks against Turkish diplomats and other Turkish objectives in 16 countries between 1975 and 1983.
