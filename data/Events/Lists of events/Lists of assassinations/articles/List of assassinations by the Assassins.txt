List of assassination (attempt)s attributed to the Assassins (Hashshashins) of the Nizari Ismaili state, active in Persia and the Levant. ُThe Assassins were a group of Ismaili Shia Muslims that, by capturing or building impregnable forts, established a "state" of their own inside the hostile territories of the Seljuq Empire of Persia, a Sunni Muslim government, and later in the Levant. Lacking a conventional army, in order to survive, they started using unconventional tactics such as assassination of prominent enemy figures and psychological warfare.
