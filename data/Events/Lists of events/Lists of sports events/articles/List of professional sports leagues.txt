 This is a list of professional sports leagues. A sports league is a professional body that governs the competition of its teams.[clarification needed] They make the rules for competition and behavior and disciplines its members as necessary. This is done through a structure that varies by league. Some are made up of a board of governors that have a commissioner or president, while others are single entity organizations where the league owns the franchises and therefore does not have a board of governors.[clarification needed] This list attempts to show those sports leagues for which all players and teams are paid to play. In other words, these players can be considered to play their chosen sport as their profession. Some leagues don't pay well enough to allow players to use them as their primary or only source of income, but because the players are paid, it's still considered  professional, or semi-professional. As such, some leagues listed here may not be fully professional.  England   India  Finland  Russia  Sweden  United States and  Canada  Colombia  Dominican Republic  Mexico  Nicaragua  Panama  Puerto Rico  Venezuela  Australia  Austria  Germany  Italy  Netherlands  Sweden Major promotions Major sanctioning bodies  India  South Africa    Zimbabwe   West Indies  Bangladesh  India  Pakistan  Sri Lanka    England    Australia  New Zealand  United States  India International  United States  Canada  Japan  India  Germany  Mexico  Argentina  Brazil  India  Indonesia  Iran  Italy  Kyrgyzstan  Japan  South Korea  Portugal  Spain  Russia  Thailand  Turkey  Uzbekistan  Canada and  United States  United States only  Japan,  South Korea, and  Russia  Kazakhstan  Russia,  Belarus,  China,  Finland,  Kazakhstan,  Latvia, and  Slovakia   Russia only  Turkey  Austria,  Croatia,  Hungary,  Czech Republic, and  Italy  Austria,  Italy,  and  Slovenia  Belarus  Czech Republic  Denmark  France  Finland  Germany  Hungary and  Romania  Latvia  Lithuania  Netherlands and  Belgium  Norway  Poland  Slovakia   Switzerland  Sweden  Ukraine  United Kingdom ( England,  Scotland,  Wales, and  Northern Ireland)  Australia  International  Russia,  Maldives,  North Korea,  New Zealand,  Philippines,  Spain,  Guyana,  Chile,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Israel,  Sri Lanka,  Canada,  Argentina,  Kenya,  Saudi Arabia,  Japan and  UAE) Asia  United States and  Canada  India   United States  United Kingdom  European Union  Australia  France  England  India  New Zealand  Papua New Guinea  Russia  United States International  Argentina  Australia  Canada  England  France  Italy  Ireland  Japan  New Zealand  Russia  Scotland  South Africa  United States  Wales  India  United States  United Kingdom  India  United States  United States  China  India  South Korea  Taiwan/ Hong Kong/ Macau Southeast Asia
