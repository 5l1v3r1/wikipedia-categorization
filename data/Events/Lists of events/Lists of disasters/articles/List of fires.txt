This is a list of historic fires. Urban fires are the most numerous due to loss of life and property, but also included are lists of fires in individual structures, ships and other transportation, and mines. A few of the most important wildfires or forest fires are included, but this list is not the primary resource for the most severe wildfires, which is summarized in the List of forest fires. Not in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed. San Francisco is gone. This is a partial list of fire due to mining: man-made structures to extract minerals, ores, rock, petroleum, natural gas, etc.
