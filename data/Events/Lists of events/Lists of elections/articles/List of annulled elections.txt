This is a list of national political elections that had their results cancelled after they were held, sometimes legally, sometimes following a coup or revolution. Partial cancellations (one or some districts) are omitted. In addition, there are some elections that remain valid but are effectively overturned by the death of the winning candidate before taking office.
