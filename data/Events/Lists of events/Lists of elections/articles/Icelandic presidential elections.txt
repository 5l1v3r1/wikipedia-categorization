Legislative Judicial Icelandic presidential elections determine who serves as president of the Republic of Iceland for four-year terms. The mandate of the current president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, expired in the summer of 2016. Guðni Th. Jóhannesson won the presidential election, which was held on June 28, 2016.  It is common for there only to be one candidate declared at the time of the closure of nominations, normally the incumbent president, in which case no election is held and the incumbent is declared to be re-elected. This has happened in 1956, 1960, 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, 1992, 2000, and 2008.
