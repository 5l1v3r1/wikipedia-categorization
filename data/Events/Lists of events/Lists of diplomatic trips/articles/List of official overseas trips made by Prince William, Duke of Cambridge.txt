This is a list of official overseas visits and Commonwealth tours made by the Duke of Cambridge. Prince William, as a child, first traveled with his parents on official visits and tours. Now he is one of the United Kingdom's most important ambassadors; sometimes the Duke travels overseas as a representative of the UK.  The Duke also undertakes tours of Commonwealth realms, of which his paternal grandmother is the queen, as her representative or as a member of the realm's royal family.
