The following is a list of halftime performances that have occurred at the Grey Cup, the championship game of the Canadian Football League. Until 1989, the Grey Cup halftime performance, if one occurred, was usually a marching band.  The 1990 halftime show featured a number of dance teams, then in 1991 the modern style of a performance by a well known (often Canadian) recording artist was introduced, with Luba, Burton Cummings.
