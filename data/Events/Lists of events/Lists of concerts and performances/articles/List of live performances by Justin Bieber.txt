The EP got promoted through 2009, through performances at several award ceremonies and television shows, including the Summer Rush and the Jingle Ball as well through his first promotional tour Urban Behavior Tour.  In 2009 Bieber served as the opening act on selected dates of Taylor Swift's Fearless Tour.  In March 2010 he released his first studio album My World 2.0 which included his smash hit "Baby".
