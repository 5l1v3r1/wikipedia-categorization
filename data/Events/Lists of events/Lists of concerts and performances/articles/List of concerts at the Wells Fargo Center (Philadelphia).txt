 Since its opening in 1996 as the CoreStates Center, the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has hosted many local, regional and international artists, spanning a wide range of musical genres. The arena has a concert attendance capacity of 21,000 seated and at least 21,499 standing. A list of notable concerts are given in the table below, arranged in a chronological order. Hanging from the rafters of the Wells Fargo Center are three banners in the orange and black colors of the Philadelphia Flyers honoring Pearl Jam's 10, Billy Joel's 48 and Bruce Springsteen's 53 Philadelphia sellouts respectively. Since 2011, the iHeartMedia-owned radio station WIOQ ("Q102") hosts the Jingle Ball concerts at the Wells Fargo Center every early-to-mid December. The Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays regularly at the arena, usually during mid-December as part of their winter tours.
