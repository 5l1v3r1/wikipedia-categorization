Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai (Chinese: 蔡依林) has embarked on four concert tours, each of which has been worldwide. Her 2004 debut, the J1 World Tour, was based in Asia and visited North America.  Tsai appeared onstage on a rising platform and stroke yoga poses.  In 2006, Tsai performed on the Dancing Forever World Tour, which visited Asia, Oceania, and North America. The performances featured Tsai striking yoga poses on rings and pommel horse.  However, some critics complained that the show concentrated on "juggling", but generally the response was favorable, with over 500,000 ticket sales.  In 2010, she embarked on the Myself World Tour. The performances featured Tsai performing either aerial hoop or pole dance during the final segment.  She grossed more than NT$150 million and eventually played in front of 600,000 people in Asia, Europe, and Oceania.  In 2015, Tsai performed on the Play World Tour, which collaborated with Live Nation Entertainment and visited Asia and North America.
