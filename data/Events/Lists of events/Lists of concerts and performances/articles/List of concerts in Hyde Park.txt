Hyde Park in London, England, has been an important venue for rock music concerts since the late 1960s. The music management company Blackhill Enterprises held the first rock concert there on 29 June 1968, attended by 15,000 people. On the bill were Pink Floyd, Roy Harper and Jethro Tull. The supergroup Blind Faith (featuring Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood) played their debut gig in Hyde Park on 7 June 1969. The Rolling Stones headlined a concert (later released as  The Stones in the Park) on 5 July that year, two days after the death of founding member Brian Jones, and is now remembered as one of the most famous gigs of the 1960s. The early gigs from 1968â€“71 were free events, while later concerts were pay-to-enter.   The park has also played host to many music festivals, including Party in the Park between 1998 and 2004, The Wireless Festival between 2005 and 2012, Hard Rock Calling between 2006 and 2012, Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park since 2011 and Barclaycard presents British Summer Time since 2013.
