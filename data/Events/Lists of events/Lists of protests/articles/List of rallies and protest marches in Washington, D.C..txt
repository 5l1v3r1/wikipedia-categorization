The following is a list of rallies and protest marches in Washington, D.C., which shows the variety of expression of notable political views.  Events at the National Mall are located somewhere between the United States Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial.  The Mall is regulated by the National Park Service which is required to respect the free speech rights of Americans. Following a controversy over the Million Man March in 1995, the National Park Service stopped releasing crowd size estimates for rallies on the National Mall.   Crowd estimates after that point have come from protest organizers, researchers or news outlets.  Owing to different methodologies, estimates can vary greatly.  Most marches and rallies in Washington are one-time events.  Two exceptions are the March for Life and Rolling Thunder, both held annually.  The March for Life is a protest against abortion held on January 22 marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case legalizing abortion.  The march has been held annually since 1974, typically drawing several hundred thousand demonstrators.  Rolling Thunder is a motorcycle demonstration held since 1987 on Memorial Day to raise awareness of issues related to American Prisoner of War/Missing in action.
