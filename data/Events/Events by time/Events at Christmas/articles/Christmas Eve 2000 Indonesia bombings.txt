 On the 2000 Christmas Eve, a series of explosions took place in Indonesia, which were part of a high-scale terrorist attack by Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah.  The attack involved a series of coordinated bombings of churches in Jakarta and eight other cities which killed 18 people and injured many others. A breakdown of the bombings is as follows:  Two suspects were arrested following the bombings. Indonesian police say they found documents implicating Hambali in the bombings.  Abu Bakar Bashir was tried for involvement in the bombings in 2003 but was found not guilty; he was subsequently convicted of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombing. The Indonesian progressive metal band Kekal has cited the bombings as an inspiration for its anti-terrorism song "Mean Attraction," which appeared on its third full-length album, The Painful Experience.
