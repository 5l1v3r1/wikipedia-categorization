There was general agreement that, as was the custom on Christmas Day, Larry had been entertained with both food and drink in many of the households that he delivered mail to, and that he was seen to be intoxicated in the late afternoon.  Some people claimed that he had been accompanied by some of the gardai into a local <a href=\"/wiki/Pub\" title=\"Pub\">pub</a> but others denied this. His bicycle was found the next morning laid out neatly on the road between Stradbally and his home village, but a witness who had passed that way at 4am had not seen it there, and there were other indications that it had not been left there by Larry.\n</p><p>Residents of the village giving ever-changing and conflicting information about what they knew of Griffin's last movements to the <a href=\"/wiki/Garda_S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na\" title=\"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na\">Gardai</a> (Irish police) investigating the case and the story went round the world at the time. Witness testimony led to the arrest of ten Stradbally residents, including members of the local police force and the head of the local primary school. However, the prosecution's case fell apart in court when the key witness changed his story, supposedly under duress. No-one else was ever charged with respect to the disappearance.\n</p><p>The most likely explanation for his disappearance is that he was involved in an altercation in the pub on the evening of Christmas Day which led to his death, almost certainly accidentally.  Pubs in Ireland were not allowed to serve alcohol on Christmas Day at that time, and the people allegedly involved  - the manager of the pub, the gardai and the local teacher - would have been in serious trouble both with the law and professionally if it had been shown that they had been doing so. It is supposed that they acted together to hide the body and then lied prodigiously to cover up the affair, probably with the collusion of many of the other residents of the village.\n</p><p>Over the years, several of the people who had been arrested made substantial sums of money by suing newspapers which published information about or relating to the affair, and it was only after the death of the last of these in 1997 that it was possible to publish or broadcast information about it. Even then, the authorities refused to make files about the investigation available until 2009. Several people visiting Stradbally who asked about the case have been subject to verbal abuse, even in recent times.\n</p><p>The case has never been officially solved and Larry's body was never found.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Missing_Postman_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Missing_Postman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\"

There was a tradition of offering both money and hospitality to the postman on Christmas Day - Larry was invited to dinner in two of the households he called on, and was given drinks in many of the others. When he had finished his deliveries, he called into the Post Office as normal. At 7pm, it started snowing.  Mary waited for him to return home but he did not appear.  She guessed that he might have had too much to drink and hoped that he had decided to sleep at a friend's house, rather than risk the ride home.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Missing_Postman_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Missing_Postman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>20\u201327</span></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg/220px-Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"298\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg/330px-Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"368\" data-file-height=\"499\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Stradbally_and_Kilmacthomas.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Stradbally and Kilmacthomas</div></div></div><p>At 7:30am the next day, a local man walking along the road between Stradbally and Kilmacthomas came across a postman's bicycle lying on the road three feet from the edge, pointing toward Kilmacthomas.

They searched the countryside between Kilmacthomas and Stradbally, particularly the marshlands on either side of the road where the bike had been found.

He again said that Larry was not drunk.  When asked why he had not reported this before, he  said he did not think \"it was of any importance\".  He claimed that after leaving Larry, he returned to the centre of the village past Whelans to meet up with Cissie Whelan, daughter of the Whelans, and that they walked to Stradbally Cove, returning from there at 10pm. This was contradicted by the evidence of John Power and his friends, but Cissie Whelan backed him up.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Missing_Postman_1-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Missing_Postman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>39\u201341</span></sup>\n</p><p>Sergeant Cullinane first claimed that he had raided Whelans once at 6pm, but after other people gave statements saying that he had visited twice, he admitted that he had raided it again at 6:35pm.

Since 1927, pubs in Ireland were not allowed to serve alcohol on either Christmas Day or <a href=\"/wiki/Good_Friday\" title=\"Good Friday\">Good Friday</a> and it would have been very damaging for a Garda to have been found to be drinking illegally.\n</p><p>As January 1930 progressed, more information emerged about events on Christmas Day from new witnesses and more detailed statements from previous witnesses. The story that now emerged was that shortly after 6pm, a clearly drunk Larry Griffin had called into Garda Frawley's flat, accompanied by Garda Dullea  where they had drunk some more alcohol. The three of them then went outside, and the Gardai decided that Larry was too drunk to make his way home.  Garda Frawley went into Whelans to see if they would put him up for the night, but realising that he had been followed in by Sergreant Cullinane, he left again.  Garda Dullea then led Larry round the corner, and the two of them went in to Whelans by the back gate.  Neither of them was seen to leave again.  None of the Gardai had provided any of this information when they were first questioned.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Missing_Postman_1-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Missing_Postman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> <sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>47\u201349</span></sup>\n</p><p>Conflicting evidence was given by the Gardai about whether or not they had been given gifts of alcohol by various publicans in the area, and also about whether or not they had been drinking.  It was common practice for publicans to make gifts to the Gardai, though this could have been construed as bribery to help avoid being raided. It was found that entries in the Garda barracks diary had been altered, and that they had not made many of the patrols which were recorded there.  The Stradbally Gardai were changing their stories, contradicting each other, and eventually calling one another liars.<sup id=\"cite_ref-The_Missing_Postman_1-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-The_Missing_Postman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> <sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>49\u201356</span></sup>\n</p><p>O'Mara was now convinced that the Gardai were involved in the disappearance of Larry Griffin.

The people involved decided to cover up his death to protect their jobs and positions of power.  Patrick Whelan was already in financial difficulty and losing his licence would have been a disaster.  Cashin and the two Gardai, Dullea and Murphy would have lost their jobs if it was found that they had been drinking illegally.\n</p><p>Over the years, a variety of locations have been suggested for where Larry's body was hidden, but it remains undiscovered.
