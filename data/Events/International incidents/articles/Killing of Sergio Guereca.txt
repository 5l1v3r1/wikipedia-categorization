On June 7, 2010, Jesus Mesa Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol agent, shot and killed Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on the concrete riverbed separating Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and  El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national was standing on the Mexican side of the Mexicoâ€“United States border, while the agent was on the American side. The agent claimed after the shooting that he had used deadly force because Guereca had been throwing rocks. The shooting led to a protracted court case which examined whether the 5th amendment protected Guereca's life even though he was not standing on US soil.     The case was heard by the Supreme Court of the United States in February 2017.
