The initial small group of 104 men and boys chose the location because it was favorable for defensive purposes, but it offered poor hunting prospects and a shortage of <a href=\"/wiki/Drinking_water\" title=\"Drinking water\">drinking water</a>. Although they did some farming, few of the original settlers were accustomed to manual labor or familiar with farming. Hunting on the island was poor, and they quickly exhausted the supply of small game. The colonists were largely dependent upon trade with the Native Americans and periodic supply ships from England for their food.\n</p><p>A series of incidents with the Native Americans soon developed into serious conflicts, ending any hope of a commercial alliance with them. This forced the settlers into close quarters, behind fortified walls, severely limiting their ability to farm the area and trade with other Indian tribes. Various attempts at farming led to kidnappings and killings by the Powhatans, while expeditions to establish relations with other Native Americans resulted either in the emissaries being ambushed and killed by the Powhatans, or proved fruitless in gaining sufficient supplies.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Over the first several months of settlement, the survivors (including Smith) had gained sufficient intelligence of the surrounding tribes to start more focused diplomatic initiatives with Powhatan's enemies. Using the <i>Discovery</i>, the smallest of the three ships which had been left behind for their use, the colonists explored the surrounding area including the <a href=\"/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay\" title=\"Chesapeake Bay\">Chesapeake Bay</a>. Smith successfully traded for food with the Indian <a href=\"/wiki/Nansemond\" title=\"Nansemond\">Nansemonds</a>, who were located along the <a href=\"/wiki/Nansemond_River\" title=\"Nansemond River\">Nansemond River</a> in the modern-day <a href=\"/wiki/Suffolk,_Virginia\" title=\"Suffolk, Virginia\">city of Suffolk</a>. He had mixed results dealing with the various other tribes, most of whom were affiliated with the <a href=\"/wiki/Powhatan_Confederacy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Powhatan Confederacy\">Powhatan Confederacy</a>.\n</p><p>With the coming arrival of the new supply fleet, Captain Smith felt the colony was sufficiently reinforced to engage the Powhatan directly with a diplomatic initiative aimed at securing at least a temporary respite from sniping, kidnapping, and assaulting. Taking a small escort they made their way through incessant attacks to the capital of the Powhatan Confederacy.  During one legendary encounter with the warrior <a href=\"/wiki/Opechancanough\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Opechancanough\">Opechancanough</a>, his life was spared (according to Smith's later account) by the intervention of <a href=\"/wiki/Pocahontas\" title=\"Pocahontas\">Pocahontas</a>, the daughter of <a href=\"/wiki/Chief_Powhatan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chief Powhatan\">Chief Powhatan</a>.\n</p><p>This event proved fortuitous for the English, as Chief Powhatan was obviously unaware of the dire straits of the Colony. For shortly after Newport returned in early January 1608, bringing new colonists and supplies, one of the new colonists accidentally started a fire that leveled all of the colony's living quarters. The fire further deepened the colony's dependence on the Native Americans for food, proving to Chief Powhatan the weakness of the English colony.\n</p><p>In August 1609, Smith, who had gained the respect of the Powhatans, was injured in a gunpowder accident and had to return to England for medical treatment, leaving on October 4, 1609. With Smith gone, the Chief Powhatan felt clear to end the truce and he began a campaign to starve the English out of Virginia.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The Powhatans carried out additional attacks on other colonists who came in search of trade.

The Virginia Company's \"Third Supply\" mission was the largest yet, led by the <i>Sea Venture</i>, which had been especially built for the purpose. The <i>Sea Venture</i> was considerably larger than the other eight ships traveling with it.

Between the lack of trade with the Native Americans, and the failure of the Third Supply to arrive with expected supplies, the colony found itself with far too little food for the winter. With the new arrivals, there were many more mouths to feed. There are different interpretations as to what occurred during the horrid winter of 1609\u20131610. Some sources say that the colonists were under siege by the Powhatan Native Americans, but the lack of primary documentation reveals the hastiness in that conclusion. Others say that it was a mixture of the drought, harsh winter and deteriorating Native\u2013English relationships or that it was brought on by the English and that it was completely avoidable for various reasons.

While it can be said that Lord Delaware literally turned the colonists around, it could be equally said that John Rolfe (among the group sent back to Jamestown on June 9) was the individual most responsible for turning the failing economy of the young colony around. His fortunes and those of the Colony were both about to change.\n</p><p>Rolfe, a businessman from London, had planned to become a planter upon arrival in Virginia, and had some new ideas about exporting <a href=\"/wiki/Tobacco\" title=\"Tobacco\">tobacco</a> for profit. He knew that the native tobacco from Virginia was not liked by the English settlers, nor did it appeal to the market in England. However, he brought with him some seeds for several new strains of tobacco to experiment with. Using the sweeter strains, Rolfe is credited with being the first to commercially <a href=\"/wiki/Agriculture\" title=\"Agriculture\">cultivate</a><i> Nicotiana tabacum</i> tobacco plants in North America in 1611; the export of this sweeter tobacco beginning in 1612 helped turn the Virginia Colony into a profitable venture.

The campaign ended the Powhatan siege and resulted in the marriage of Pocahontas and John Rolfe which introduced a short period of truce between the English and the Powhatan Confederacy. Although the truce was a short one, it allowed the English to fully secure the colony's fortifications and housing, expand its farming, develop a network of alliances with other Indian nations, and establish a series of outlying smaller settlements. The Powhatan Confederacy attempted two other wars against the English, including the Second Powhatan War which was initiated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Massacre_of_1622\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indian Massacre of 1622\">Massacre of 1622</a> and the Third Powhatan War which was initiated by another surprise massacre of the colony's vulnerable women and children. However, each attack was met with stiff resistance, a counter-offensive, severe reprisals and eventual defeat of the Powhatan Confederacy. After almost forty years of tenuous existence surrounded by a generally hostile Indian nation, the Virginia Colony emerged victorious and effectively devastated the Powhatan nation and broke up the Confederacy by 1646.\n</p><p>Through the descendants of Thomas Rolfe, many of the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Families_of_Virginia\" title=\"First Families of Virginia\">First Families of Virginia</a> almost 400 years later trace their lineage to both the Native Americans of the Powhatan Confederacy and the English-born settlers of Jamestown.
