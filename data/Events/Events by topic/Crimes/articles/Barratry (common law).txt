Barratry (/ˈbærətri/ BARR-ə-tree) is a legal term with several meanings. In common law, barratry is the offense committed by people who are "overly officious in instigating or encouraging prosecution of groundless litigation" or who bring "repeated or persistent acts of litigation" for the purposes of profit or harassment.   Although it remains a crime in some jurisdictions, barratry has frequently been abolished as being anachronistic and obsolete.  If barratrous litigation is deemed to be for the purpose of silencing critics, it is known as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). Jurisdictions that otherwise have no barratry laws may have SLAPP laws. In admiralty law, barratry  is misconduct by the master or crew of a vessel against the shipowner (or demise charterer), such misconduct damaging the ship or its cargo. In Australia, the term barratry is predominantly used in the first sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant. The concept has fallen into disuse in Australia.  The offence of being a common barrator was abolished in New South Wales by Section 4A of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993. In Canada, barratry, alongside all common law offences except contempt of court, were abolished by the 1953 consolidation of the Criminal Code. In England and Wales the common law offence of being a common barrator was abolished by section 13(1)(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. Being a common barrator was an offence under the common law of England. It was classified as a misdemeanor. It consisted of "persistently stirring up quarrels in the Courts or out of them". It is uncertain whether, in the ordinary way, persons charged with commission of the offence were dealt with by indictment.  In 1966, the Law Commission recommended for the offence to be abolished.  It said that there had been no indictments for this offence for "many years" and that, as an indictable misdemeanor, it was "wholly obsolete".  Its recommendation was implemented by the Criminal Law Act 1967. In Scots law, barratry referred to the crime committed by a judge who is induced by bribery to pronounce judgment. Several jurisdictions in the United States have declared barratry (in the sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant) to be a crime as part of their tort reform efforts. For example, in the U.S. states of California, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, barratry is a misdemeanor.   In Texas, barratry is a misdemeanor on the first conviction, but a felony on subsequent convictions.  In his Inferno, Canto XXI, Dante places barrators in the Eighth Circle, fifth bolgia of Hell.
