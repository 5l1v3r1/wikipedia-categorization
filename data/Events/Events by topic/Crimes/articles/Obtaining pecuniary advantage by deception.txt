Obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception  was formerly a statutory offence in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. However, the offence still subsists in certain other common law jurisdictions which have copied the English criminal model. The offence was created by section 16  of the Theft Act 1968. At the time of its repeal it read: This offence replaced the offence of obtaining credit by fraud, contrary to section 13(1) of the Debtors Act 1869.  The elements of the actus reus are similar to the offence of obtaining property by deception: The expression "pecuniary advantage" was defined by section 16(2). The definition was "exclusive".  Section 16(2)(a) read: (a) any debt or charge for which he makes himself liable or is or may become liable (including one not legally enforceable) is reduced or in whole or in part evaded or deferred; [...] See Director of Public Prosecutions v Turner   AC 537,   3 WLR 352, 117 SJ 664,   3 All ER 124, 57 Cr App R 932,   Crim LR 186, HL, reversing sub nom R v Turner   1 WLR 653. In R v Royle,  Lord Edmund-Davies described it as "a juridical nightmare".  It was repealed by section 5(5) of the Theft Act 1978. Section 16(2)(b) covers the situation in Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Charles  (which is described in the article Deception (criminal law)) where writing the cheque backed by a card obtains an unauthorised overdraft even though the deception operates on the mind of the person accepting the cheque and not on the mind of a bank officer. In most cases, the granting of credit may be machine-based with reference to a bank officer only being made when larger sums of money are involved. Where the pecuniary advantage is the obtaining of an overdraft facility at a bank, it is only necessary to show that the facility was granted, not that the defendant actually used the facility. This included a policy or contract that was void due to the mistake induced by the deception.    See the following cases: Section 16(2)(c) clearly covers those people who claim to have qualifications which are in fact false, and because of these qualifications they are employed. Further, according to R v Callender  where a self-employed accountant made deceptions, the section was held to apply equally to employment as an independent contractor and employment as a servant. The defendant is charged under section 16 if the deception is detected before payment is made. Thereafter, the defendant has obtained payment under section 15. As to betting shops, if the defendant goes into the shop just before the horse race is due to start, places the bet and very slowly begins to count out the stake money as the commentary relays the progress of the horses, the opportunity to win has been obtained and the defendant can be convicted if they pick up the money and run out when it becomes obvious the nominated horse will not win. See the following cases: Section 16 was repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006. There are two elements to the mens rea of this offence: But there is no need to prove an intention to permanently deprive. Section 18 of the Theft Act 1968 applied in relation to section 16. As to mode of trial from 1968 to 1977, see paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1952 (as substituted by section 29(2) of the Theft Act 1968) From 1977, obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception was triable either way.  This offence was created by section 16 of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. Section 16(2)(a) was repealed by article 7(4) of the Theft (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 (S.I. 1978/1407 (N.I. 23)). Section 16 was repealed on 15 January 2007  by sections 14(1) and 15(1)(4) of, and paragraph 1(c)(iii) of Schedule 1 to, and Schedule 3 to, the Fraud Act 2006. The repeal was subject to transitional provisions and savings contained in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 to that Act. This offence was an offence against property for the purposes of section 3 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952.
