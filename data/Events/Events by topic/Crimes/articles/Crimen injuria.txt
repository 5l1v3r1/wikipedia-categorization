Crimen injuria is a crime under South African common law, defined to be the act of "unlawfully, intentionally and seriously impairing the dignity of another."  Although difficult to precisely define, the crime is used in the prosecution of certain instances of road rage,  stalking,  racially offensive language,  emotional or psychological abuse  and sexual offences against children.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard numerous cases of crimen injuria, usually coupled with assault, committed by intelligence services on both sides of the struggle against apartheid. The phrase crimen injuria is Latin, short for crimen injuria datum, meaning "offence committed without lawful cause".
