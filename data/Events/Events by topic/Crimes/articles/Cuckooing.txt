Cuckooing is a form of crime in which drug dealers take over the home of a vulnerable person in order to use it as a base for drug dealing.    As of the 2010s, cuckooing is becoming an increasingly common problem in the South of England.   The crime is named for the cuckoo's practice of taking over other birds' nests for its young.
