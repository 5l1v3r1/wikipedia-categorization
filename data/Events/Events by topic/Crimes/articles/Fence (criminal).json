As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: <i>The burglar fenced the stolen radio</i>. This sense of the term came from <a href=\"/wiki/Thieves%27_cant\" title=\"Thieves&#39; cant\">thieves' slang</a>, first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a <i>defence</i> against being caught.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a \"c\" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly <a href=\"/wiki/American_English\" title=\"American English\">American English</a>) is now spelled <i>defense.</i>\n</p><p>The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he/she is able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for \"hot\" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. The thieves who patronize the fence are willing to accept a low <a href=\"/wiki/Profit_margin\" title=\"Profit margin\">profit margin</a> in order to reduce their risks by instantly \"washing their hands\" of the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_market\" title=\"Black market\">black market</a> loot and disassociating themselves from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups their investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing <a href=\"/wiki/Serial_numbers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serial numbers\">serial numbers</a>) and reselling the goods as near to the <a href=\"/wiki/White_market\" title=\"White market\">white market</a> price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Pawnshop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pawnshop\">pawnshop</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Flea_market\" title=\"Flea market\">flea market</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Street_vendor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Street vendor\">street vendor</a>) in order to \"launder\" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. <sup id=\"cite_ref-Washington_Post_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Washington_Post-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Fencing is illegal in all countries, but legally proving a violation of anti-fencing laws can be difficult.<sup id=\"cite_ref-whatwhenhow_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-whatwhenhow-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Approach\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Approach</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#History_of_receiving\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History of receiving</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Early_modern_England\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early modern England</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Women_and_receiving\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Women and receiving</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Early_modern_English_literature\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early modern English literature</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Moll_Flanders\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Moll Flanders</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Legal_aspects\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Legal aspects</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#E-fencing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">E-fencing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Approach\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Car_window_burglary.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Car_window_burglary.jpg/200px-Car_window_burglary.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Car_window_burglary.jpg/300px-Car_window_burglary.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Car_window_burglary.jpg/400px-Car_window_burglary.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"480\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Car_window_burglary.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Car stereo thieves typically want to sell stolen items quickly. By selling to fences, they avoid the hassle and suspicion of selling directly to the final buyers.</div></div></div>\n<p>The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to pay thieves a very low price for stolen goods. Thieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort (<a href=\"/wiki/Transaction_costs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Transaction costs\">transaction costs</a>), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any <a href=\"/wiki/Used_good\" title=\"Used good\">used goods</a>, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement.\n</p><p>The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace <a href=\"/wiki/Serial_number\" title=\"Serial number\">serial numbers</a> on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognized. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle <a href=\"/wiki/Chop_shop\" title=\"Chop shop\">may be disassembled</a> so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops.\n</p><p>Fencing is often conducted through legal businesses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Washington_Post_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Washington_Post-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming \"front\" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, \"front\" businesses might be discount stores, <a href=\"/wiki/Used_goods\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Used goods\">used goods</a> stores, a coin and gem store, <a href=\"/wiki/Auction_house\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Auction house\">auction house</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Flea_market\" title=\"Flea market\">flea market</a>, or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each \"front\" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's <a href=\"/wiki/Wrecking_yard\" title=\"Wrecking yard\">salvage yard</a> may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline.\n</p><p>The prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question.  Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value.  Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items.  At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-whatwhenhow_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-whatwhenhow-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.\n</p><p>Research on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based \"wheeling and dealing\".  They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods).  Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade.<sup id=\"cite_ref-whatwhenhow_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-whatwhenhow-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorizing fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorizing fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional \"sideline\" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the \"master fences\", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-whatwhenhow_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-whatwhenhow-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_receiving\">History of receiving</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History of receiving\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_modern_England\">Early modern England</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Early modern England\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Receiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious <a href=\"/wiki/Jonathan_Wild\" title=\"Jonathan Wild\">Jonathan Wild</a>. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers,<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Receiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the <a href=\"/wiki/Transportation_Act_1717\" title=\"Transportation Act 1717\">1718 Transportation Act</a>, which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.<sup id=\"cite_ref-B189_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-B189-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\nProceedings stored in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/\">Old Bailey Online</a> archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664.

Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers,<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it.

Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.\n</p><p>Confirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Hitchen\" title=\"Charles Hitchen\">Charles Hitchen</a>, who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief-takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld.

However, overly bold receiving was his undoing,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ex_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ex-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as \"Jonathan Wild Act\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from \u00a340 to \u00a3140).<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ex_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ex-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Women_and_receiving\">Women and receiving</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Women and receiving\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>There is no registered case of female fences of the same fame of Wild or Hitchen.

She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates \"I was now at a loss for a market for my goods,[...] At last I resolved to go to my old governess.\" Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-gut_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gut-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London.\n</p><p>The Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market.

In <a href=\"/wiki/England_and_Wales\" title=\"England and Wales\">England and Wales</a>, as in many U.S. states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status.<sup id=\"cite_ref-whatwhenhow_4-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-whatwhenhow-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Pawnbroker\" title=\"Pawnbroker\">Pawnbrokers</a> have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"E-fencing\">E-fencing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: E-fencing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:US_Army_51805_Post,_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg/200px-US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"134\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg/300px-US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg/400px-US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"700\" data-file-height=\"469\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:US_Army_51805_Post,_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Stores have complained that increasingly, shoplifters are stealing goods with the intent of selling them anonymously online.

It is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website <a href=\"/wiki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a>, being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ebay_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ebay-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>   Classified websites like <a href=\"/wiki/Craigslist\" title=\"Craigslist\">Craigslist</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/AutoTrader.com\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AutoTrader.com\">AutoTrader.com</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pennysaver\" title=\"Pennysaver\">Pennysaver</a> online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal <a href=\"/wiki/Darknet_market\" title=\"Darknet market\">darknet markets</a>.\n</p><p>E-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen <a href=\"/wiki/Credit_card\" title=\"Credit card\">credit cards</a> or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with <a href=\"/wiki/Carding_(fraud)\" title=\"Carding (fraud)\">carding</a>, which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means.\n</p><p>Crime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand.  In the United States, major retailers such as <a href=\"/wiki/Walmart\" title=\"Walmart\">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Target_Corporation\" title=\"Target Corporation\">Target</a> have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing.  Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and <a href=\"/wiki/Amazon.com\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a>) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property.  Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-seattletimes_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-seattletimes-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An <a href=\"/wiki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> spokesman has stated, \"Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay,\" and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>  By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Handling_stolen_goods\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Handling stolen goods\">Handling stolen goods</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sting_operation\" title=\"Sting operation\">Sting operation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Chop_shop\" title=\"Chop shop\">Chop shop</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fence_(criminal)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.word-detective.com/2013/09/fence/\">\"Fence\"</a> in the Word Detective</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fence\">\"<span style=\"padding-left:0.2em;\">'</span>&#39;Online Etymology Dictionary'&#39;\"</a>.
