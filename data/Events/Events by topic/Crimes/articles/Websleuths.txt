Websleuths is an internet community that concerns itself mainly with crime and missing persons. The privately owned Websleuths LLC maintains a forum for registered users to discuss and classify information related to crimes, trials and unsolved cases. Tricia Griffith (not to be confused with Progressive's CEO of the same name) purchased the site in 2004.  Some content is available for viewing without registration. Members have an option to be verified with their credentials with the administrator if they have a specific expertise such as DNA analysis professionals, law enforcement, or related to a specific crime in some way.  Crimes which have received national attention are always highlighted by Websleuths. The Caylee Anthony murder drew years of interest and commentary regarding the murder, media attention to the case, and documentation of evidence and information.  The television show Law & Order portrayed Websleuths in an episode about the case named "Crimebusters". Tricia Griffith hosts a weekly podcast on Blog Talk Radio.  In 2016, Websleuths joined the producers of the television show The Killing Season in an interactive look at the unsolved Long Island serial killer cases.
