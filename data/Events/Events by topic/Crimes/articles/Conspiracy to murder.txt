Conspiracy to murder is a statutory offence in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The same offence is also covered in the Canadian Criminal Code and covered by laws in various states in Australia. Conspiracy to murder is an offence by virtue of section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977. Mens rea: Although an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is sufficient for murder, it is not sufficient for conspiracy to murder.  Jurisdiction Section 1(4) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 formerly provided that it was immaterial that the murder in question would not be triable in England and Wales if committed in accordance with the intention of the parties to the agreement. This reproduced the effect of section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. See now section 1A of the Criminal Law Act 1977. Sentence A person guilty of conspiracy to murder is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.  As to the maximum sentence in a case where the agreement was entered into before Part I of the Criminal Law Act 1977 came into force, see section 5(5) of that Act. See the Crown Prosecution Service sentencing manual. The following cases are relevant: Conspiracy to murder is an offence by virtue of article 9(1) of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (S.I. 1983/1120 (N.I. 13)). Jurisdiction See, formerly, article 9(4) of that Order. Sentence See article 11(2)(a). The offence of conspiracy to murder is created by section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.  Section 465 of the country's Criminal Code makes conspiracy to commit murder an indictable offence, punishable by a maximum term of life imprisonment.  The law varies between states with the maximum sentence for this offence being 14 years' imprisonment in Queensland and 25 years' imprisonment in New South Wales.
