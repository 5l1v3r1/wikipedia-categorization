The live streaming of crimes is a phenomenon arising in the 2010s in which criminals deliberately commit crimes while live streaming the act on social media. Due to the act being published to social media for others to see, it is often impossible to protect the privacy of the victims of these crimes.     In April 2016, Marina Lonina (18) and Raymond Gates (29) were arrested in Ohio on charges that Gates raped an underage friend of Marina's while Lonina live-streamed the crime on Periscope.    The prosecutor pointed out that Lonina, who was taken advantage of by a much older man, had gotten "caught up" in her excitement over the number of "likes" she was getting, and is shown on screen "laughing and giggling."   Joss Wright of the Oxford Internet Institute pointed out that "[given the] volume of content being created and uploaded every day [ . . . there] is almost no practical way to prevent content like this being uploaded and shared."  By May The New York Times was including the Ohio Periscope rape as one of a series of recent cases in which crimes were live streamed, including one in which a young woman in Égly, France speaks via Periscope about her distress and suicidal thoughts and is apparently encouraged by viewers to kill herself, which she does by throwing herself under a train, and the case of two teenagers who live stream themselves bragging and laughing as they beat up a drunken man in a bar in Bordeaux, France.
