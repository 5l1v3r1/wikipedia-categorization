On February 14, 2018, news spread online that Shangri-la had contacted Pestbusters, a pest control company, to disperse a well established cat colony at a nearby park because they allegedly ruined the aesthetics of the establishment. The actual numbers vary but it's been reported that at least 20, possibly up to 38 cats, that had been neutered and vaccinated by community volunteers were reported missing. Outraged netizens and animal-lovers immediately started leaving angry comments and emails to the management, and posting negative reviews. The establishment released a statement on their social media account saying that the half of the cats were adopted by its employees while the rest were claimed to have been relocated to two unspecified locations in Taguig.    The Compassion and Responsibility for Animals Welfare Philippines condemned the act saying that the hotel management was ignorant of the Philippine Animal Welfare Act and that Pestbusters violated Republic Act No. 8485 and accused the pest control firm of being motivated by "greed of money".
