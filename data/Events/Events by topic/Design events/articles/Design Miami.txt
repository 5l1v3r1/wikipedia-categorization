Design Miami/ is an international design fair held annually in December in Miami, Florida. Its sister show, "Design Miami/ Basel", occurs every June, in Basel, Switzerland. The fair was founded by real estate developer Craig Robins and design consultant Ambra Medda, who was the show's original director. Its current Chief Creative Director is Rodman Primack, with the current Chief Executive Officer being Jen Roberts.
