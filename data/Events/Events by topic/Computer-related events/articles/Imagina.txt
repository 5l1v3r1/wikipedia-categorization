IMAGINA is the name of an annual festival on computer graphics (CG) that takes place in Monte-Carlo, Monaco. It was created by The Institut national de l'audiovisuel (or INA, the French for National Audiovisual Institute). The first IMAGINA festival was held in 1981, while the actual name IMAGINA was only introduced in 1986. It is sometimes compared to the CG festival part of  SIGGRAPH. In 2000, the festival was sold to the Monte-Carlo television festival, which decided to switch towards a meeting targeting professionals.
