The Trenton Computer Festival, founded in 1976, is the oldest continuously-running personal computer show in the world.   It is considered to be the first major fair for personal computer hobbyists.   It was founded 1976 at Trenton State College by Sol Libes and Allen Katz with the assistance of the Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey (ACGNJ).   The initial event drew a crowd of approximately 1,500, and featured lectures, vendor tables, and an outdoor computer market, all aimed at the amateur computer hobbyist.  By 1992, it had moved to the Mercer County Community College,  and by 1999 it had moved to the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center in Edison, New Jersey.  In 2005, TCF returned to The College of New Jersey, formerly Trenton State College, to celebrate its 30th anniversary.
