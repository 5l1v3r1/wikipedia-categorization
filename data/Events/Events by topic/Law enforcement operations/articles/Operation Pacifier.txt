Operation Pacifier is or was a large scale hacking campaigning from the FBI launched in 2015 investigating criminal activity on the dark web. It was the largest such operation since Operation Torpedo.  Malware known to law enforcement as network investigative techniques (NITs) were used to discover the real IP addresses of Tor users from a seized child porn website called Playpen.  The international nature of the operation raised a number of legal questions about the FBI's international jurisdiction and is the subject of ongoing legal and journalistic investigations.
