The Silk Road Race is a charity rally from Milan to the capital of Tajikistan, Dushanbe. The Silk Road Race is organised by Partenza Intelligente, a no-profit cultural association based in Lainate (Milan) Italy. The first edition of the rally was launched 31 July 2010.  The Silk Road Race typically launches from Villa Litta Visconti Borromeo, an historic palace of the 16th century in Lainate near Milan, Italy, in the last week of July. The teams participate at the Start Night launch event with many people and a rock concert during the launching procedure. The teams can participate to the rally with any motor-based vehicle, there is no limit based on engine displacement or vehicle type. The main routes to Tajikistan are typically three. The northern route, from Milan to Tajikistan via east Europe: Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan; the middle route: Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan and then crossing the Caspian Sea to Turkmenistan; or the south route: Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and then Tajikistan.  However the route is totally free, teams can choose their own route to Tajikistan but they must arrive at Dushanbe in 3 weeks to join the finish party.
