The Houston Art Car Parade is an annual event in Houston, Texas, featuring a display of all types of rolling art.  The first and largest Art Car parade in the world, at any given parade spectators will see cars, bicycles, motorcycles, roller-skaters, and many other types of motorized and human-powered vehicles all decorated in various themes.  There are also classic cars, lowriders, and various other highly modified roadworthy vehicles.  The parade has been a Houston tradition since 1988, when 40 decorated vehicles were featured during the Houston International Festival.  The first art car parade took place on May 14, 1986, when 11 vehicles participated in a parade down Montrose Boulevard within the Neartown area.  In recent years, the parade has been held on Allen Parkway until the 2015 season prior to the re-routing of Allen Parkway where the westbound lanes have been converted into parking spaces; since 2016 the parade has been relocated to a section of Downtown Houston going up Smith Street with parade route going past Houston City Hall exiting westbound to Allen Parkway.
