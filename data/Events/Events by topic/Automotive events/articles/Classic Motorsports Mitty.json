Road Atlanta offered just the venue.\n</p><p>The formula was an immediate success. After observing the enthusiasm for that first event, Martha Turner, then editor of the Jaguar Marque, dubbed the proceedings the great <i>Walter Mitty Challenge</i> after the <a href=\"/wiki/James_Thurber\" title=\"James Thurber\">James Thurber</a> short story.\n</p><p>Through the years, The Mitty has become a spring tradition in Atlanta. In 2004 <a href=\"/wiki/Classic_Motorsports\" title=\"Classic Motorsports\">Classic Motorsports</a> magazine became the title sponsor and event co-promoter. The event is currently presented by <a href=\"/wiki/Hagerty\" class=\"mw-disambig\" title=\"Hagerty\">Hagerty</a> and sanctioned by <a href=\"/wiki/Historic_Sportscar_Racing\" title=\"Historic Sportscar Racing\">Historic Sportscar Racing</a>, an East Coast-based racing series that developed from the first Mitty and now sanctions six to 10 events each year.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2224\nCached time: 20180918212028\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 5/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:21889890-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918212028 and revision id 860179313\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Automotive_events"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Braselton, Georgia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Classic Motorsports"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hagerty"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Historic Sportscar Racing"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"James Thurber"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Road Atlanta"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"A brief history of The Mitty","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Classic_Motorsports_Mitty","byteoffset":294,"anchor":"A_brief_history_of_The_Mitty"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Classic Motorsports Mitty","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5128189"}]}}
