Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este ("Competition of Elegance of Villa d'Este") is a Concours d'Elegance event for classic and vintage cars. It has taken place every year since 1929 during the last weekend of May near the Villa d'Este hotel in Cernobbio, on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. Since 2011, the event takes place in the second half of May. BMW Group has organised the event, jointly with the Villa d'Este hotel, for the last ten years.     Visitors can admire about fifty cars, all built between the 1920s and the 1970s, organized in different categories. Car makers also take advantage of the event to showcase some of their upcoming models. For example, a working Aston Martin One-77 was officially unveiled to the press during the event.
