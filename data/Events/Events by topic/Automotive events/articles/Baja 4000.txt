The Baja 4000 is an off-road charity rally and road trip organized by the creators of the largest amateur rally in the world, the Budapest-Bamako . It's a low budget, amateur version of the famous Baja 1000 and Dakar Rally. The first edition is expected to be held in January 2017.  The rally will start in Los Angeles and travel 4000 kilometers on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico  . The guiding principle of the Baja 4000 is the same as the Budapest-Bamako's, Anyone, By Anything, In Any Way.  There are no restrictions on the vehicles or individuals that can enter, and no set routes. Participants have to complete daily stages between Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas and back. It is not a timed event. Points are awarded for completing daily stages in certain time periods. In addition there are geocaching challenges along the way for additional points. If a team does not complete a stage, they are still in the race. Cars do not have to arrive at the finish line, only participants. Teams can participate in racing or touring categories.  The rally will spend a long day in California before entering Mexico at Mexicali. Teams will drive south on the Sea Of Cortez side of the peninsula and will have to drive north on the Pacific Ocean side. More than 4,000 kilometers will be covered within 10 days. Teams can enter in the competitive category where navigational points need to be reached and daily stages completed. It is a point race and not a timed event. In touring category teams travel at their own pace and there is no competition. The Baja 4000 is primarily a charity event, that raises donations for abandoned children and orphans in Mexico through Corazon de Vida.
