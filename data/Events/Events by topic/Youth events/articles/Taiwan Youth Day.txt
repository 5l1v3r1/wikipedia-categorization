Taiwan Youth Day (Chinese: 台灣青年日, abbreviated TYD) is a youth-oriented Catholic Church event in Taiwan, organized by Youth Desk of Chinese Regional Bishops' Conference (CRBC). Seven dioceses in Taiwan take turn to plan and execute TYD. In 2004, the first ever TYD was created and it was decided to hold it every three years. However, in 2008, they have decided to have the TYD once a year. During the meeting week, young adults enrich their spirituality through prayer, personal development, and faith sharing. At the same time, the organization hopes to encourage more youths to discover and renew their faith and to proclaim the word of the lord with justice and peace. In 2004, several young adults returned from the World Youth Day, gathered, and decided to create a similar experience where young Taiwanese Catholics can come together and support each other in group gatherings. Since then, they have also begun to encourage other youth desks to work together and build a network with each other. Ever since the first TYD, youth leaders from each Taiwanese archdiocese have gathered and worked towards creating an Asian Youth Day or an International experience where the Catholics from all over can come together and share their culture, language, and ethnicity.
