Miss Teen Canada was a personality and beauty competition in Canada for women aged 14 to 17. The event started in 1969 and was televised on CTV. The pageant was named Miss Teenage Canada for its first three years and was originally sponsored by A&W Drive-Ins. Cleo Productions, who owned the event for most of its years, closed the contest down in 1990 due to financial concerns.

The winner of Miss Teenage Canada goes on to compete at Miss Teen Universe. The following is a complete list of winners of the Miss Teen Canada competition (1969â€“1992):
