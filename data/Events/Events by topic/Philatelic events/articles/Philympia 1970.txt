The Philympia 1970 International Stamp Exhibition was an international stamp exhibition held under Fédération Internationale de Philatélie (FIP) patronage. It was held at the Empire Hall, Olympia, London from 18 to 26 September 1970. Special three-colour postmarks were used on each of the eight days of the exhibition.  A 66 ft (20 m) octagonal tower of British stamps designed by Andrew Chadwick of Hulme Chadwick & Partners with graphics by Barry O'Dwyer, was the main feature.

They were designed by David Gentleman and depicted the 1840 Penny Black (5d.), the 1847 1s. embossed (9d.) and the 1855 4d. surface-printed stamp (1/6).   A 5/- stamp booklet containing 12 5d. stamps was also issued. The main awards went to the following exhibits:  The Grand Prix went to Roger-Louis Loeuillet (France) for ‘France, 1849-70’.
