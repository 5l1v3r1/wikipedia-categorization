  Each year the Association of British Philatelic Societies (ABPS) holds a national congress, the Philatelic Congress of Great Britain. The first Congress was held in 1909 in conjunction with a stamp exhibition at Hulme Town Hall in Manchester. They continue to this day, each year in a different location. The business of the first Congress included the formation of a National Society or Federation, the desirability of a Collectors’ Catalogue, unnecessary issues, deceased collector’s stamps and an encyclopaedia of philatelic literature.  The Congress is an opportunity for philatelists to network, view displays and attend the Congress Banquet. Each year a Congress Medal is presented and the new signatories to the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists sign the Roll. Papers are given on philatelic subjects, for instance at the 88th Congress in 2006 David Beech of the British Library gave a paper on "The Philately of the Edwardian era as shown in its literature".
