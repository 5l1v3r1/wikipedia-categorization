A publicity stunt is a planned event designed to attract the public's attention to the event's organizers or their cause.  Publicity stunts can be professionally organized, or set up by amateurs.  Such events are frequently utilized by advertisers, and by celebrities who notably include athletes and politicians. Organizations sometimes seek publicity by staging newsworthy events that attract media coverage.  They can be in the form of groundbreakings, world record attempts, dedications, press conferences or organized protests.  By staging and managing the event, the organization attempts to gain some control over what is reported in the media.  Successful publicity stunts have news value, offer photo, video and sound bite opportunities, and are arranged primarily for media coverage.  It is sometimes hard for organizations to design successful publicity stunts that highlight the message instead of burying it.  For example, it makes sense for a pizza company to bake the world's largest pizza but it would not make sense for the YMCA to sponsor that same event.  The importance of publicity stunts is generating news interest and awareness for the concept, product or service being marketed.
