Hayati Fashion Week (HFW) is an annual series of events when modest fashion collections from Nigeria and other African countries are shown to the press and general public. HFW was founded by Fatima Togbe in 2017   . The inaugural event took place in 2017 and was sponsored by the Medicaid Cancer Foundation (MCF)     . Other sponsors include Dunes Center, Pandora, Nestle brand Maggi, Vlisco and Arith & Paul. Hayati Fashion Week was created as a response to the lack of representation of modest fashion on major Nigerian fashion platforms. It has provided designers, models, artists and other businesses who cater to the Nigerian modest industry, a platform to showcase their creativity, passion, and work, directly to their desired audience . The event features Runway shows, exhibitions, and a networking soiree.
