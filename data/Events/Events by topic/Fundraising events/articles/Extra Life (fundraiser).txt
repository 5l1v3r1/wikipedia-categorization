Extra Life is a fundraising event,  the proceeds of which go to branches of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.  100% of all donations go directly to the hospitals.  Extra Life was formed in 2008 to honor Victoria Enmon, who died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It was aided by the Sarcastic Gamer community, who sent gifts and video games to her.
