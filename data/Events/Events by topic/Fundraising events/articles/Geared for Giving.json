Payroll Giving (also known <a href=\"/wiki/Give_As_You_Earn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Give As You Earn\">Give As You Earn</a> ) is a scheme of making charitable tax-efficient donations by giving directly from payroll to any charity. Currently 1 million employees give to charity through the system raising \u00a3130m a year for charities.  Through Payroll Giving, any donation is tax free, which means that charities will benefit by at least 25% more on top of employee donations. When it comes to higher rate tax payers, charities benefit even further, receiving 66% or 81% extra on top of the donation \u2013 unlike any other form of giving. \n</p><p>Building upon this success, in October 2016 the campaign was relaunched to maximise the huge potential of employee giving through pay. Geared for Giving continues as a fundraising campaign, this time with a new mission to double the amount raised by Payroll Giving for charities to \u00a3260m annually, by increasing the number of employees giving through pay from 1 million, to 2 million. The campaign is calling for all businesses with over 250 employees to offer Payroll Giving to their staff. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Geared_for_Giving&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.professionalfundraising.co.uk/home/content.php?id=1242/.php\">Bannatyne helps gear business for Workplace Giving</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Geared_for_Giving&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.gearedforgiving.org\">www.gearedforgiving.org Official Site</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2235\nCached time: 20180916023259\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.045 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 87/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 335/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 81/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 459/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.005/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   32.713      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   32.713      1 -total\n 10.89%    3.564      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:17486252-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916023259 and revision id 849846041\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Geared For Giving","*":"Charities_based_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"Geared For Giving","*":"Fundraising_events"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Anne Snelgrove"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Duncan Bannatyne"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Give As You Earn"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.professionalfundraising.co.uk/home/content.php?id=1242/.php","http://www.gearedforgiving.org"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Geared_for_Giving","byteoffset":1503,"anchor":"References"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Geared_for_Giving","byteoffset":1531,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Geared for Giving","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Geared For Giving"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5529474"}]}}
