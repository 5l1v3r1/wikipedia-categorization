The February 9 Killer is an unidentified suspected serial killer     believed to be responsible for the 2006 murder of Sonia Mejia and her unborn baby and the 2008 murder of Damiana Castillo in Salt Lake County, Utah. The murders were committed on the same day, February 9, hence the name. In 2009, the unsolved murders of Sonia Mejia in Taylorsville and Damiana Castillo in West Valley City were linked through DNA analysis.  The corresponding police departments concurrently released a description of the perpetrator as a Hispanic male in his late teens or early 20s.  A twenty-man task force was then formed. As of  2011[update], the case is classified as a cold case.
