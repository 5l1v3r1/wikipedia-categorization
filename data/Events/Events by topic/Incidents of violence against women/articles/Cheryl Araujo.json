She was gang-raped in 1983 at age 21 by four men in a tavern in <a href=\"/wiki/New_Bedford,_Massachusetts\" title=\"New Bedford, Massachusetts\">New Bedford, Massachusetts</a>, while other patrons watched but did not intervene. During the prosecution, the defendants' attorneys <a href=\"/wiki/Cross-examined\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cross-examined\">cross-examined</a> Araujo to such an extent about her own life and activities that the case became widely seen as a template for \"<a href=\"/wiki/Blaming_the_victim\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blaming the victim\">blaming the victim</a>\" in rape cases. Her case was widely known as the \"Big Dan's rape,\" after the name of the bar in which the attack occurred. Ostracized in New Bedford, Araujo moved with her family to <a href=\"/wiki/Miami,_Florida\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Miami, Florida\">Miami, Florida</a>, to make a new life. She died a few years later in a drunk driving car accident.\n</p><p>Her case prompted national debate at the time over broadcasting of the trial, in which her name was released. Some states have passed legislation to protect the names of rape victims, and court cases have attempted to settle issues of newsworthiness, freedom of the press, and state interest, as well as personal privacy.

The store she usually purchased from was closed, so she stopped at Big Dan's tavern. Two men approached and asked her to leave with them. When she refused, a third man grabbed her from behind and threw her onto the bar's pool table. She was stripped below the waist, and several men raped her. According to Araujo's original report to police, she heard people \"laughing, cheering, yelling\", but no one responded to her cries for help.  As Araujo seemingly admitted later, there was no crowd cheering on the rape.<sup id=\"cite_ref-friendly_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-friendly-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Eventually, Araujo fought off her attackers and ran half-naked into the street, screaming that she had been raped.  Three college students passing by in a van came upon Araujo in the street and drove her to the nearest <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital\" title=\"Hospital\">hospital</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prosecution\">Prosecution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cheryl_Araujo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Prosecution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Six men were originally charged with the rape, though only four, Victor Raposo, John Cordeiro, Joseph Vieira and Daniel Silva, were eventually tried. Two separate trials were conducted to avoid the men testifying against each other during trial. The trials attracted international attention, and people in the Portuguese community felt the case was a catalyst for stirring anti-Portuguese discrimination and sentiment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-friendly_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-friendly-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In addition, the press coverage and trial cast new light on how victims are treated in rape cases. Defense attorneys questioned the victim about her personal life, suggesting she had invited or somehow deserved the attack. During live TV coverage of the trial in the US, the victim's name was broadcast. After allowing TV coverage, the courts had the right to prevent disclosure of the woman's name but did not. The courts later admonished the press for releasing her name.<sup id=\"cite_ref-identify_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-identify-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The three college students who drove Araujo to the hospital testified as to her state of terror when they encountered her.

He felt the publicity might discourage rape victims from trying to get justice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> There was considerable controversy at the time over broadcasting the rape trial. The broadcasts received wide ratings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-kaplan_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kaplan-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> As one study later noted, \"Publication of a rape victim's name severely invades the personal privacy interests of the victim and exposes the victim to a variety of social and psychological problems.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-identify_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-identify-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There was national debate about the issue of releasing the victim's name, and United States Senator <a href=\"/wiki/Arlen_Specter\" title=\"Arlen Specter\">Arlen Specter</a> of Pennsylvania held subcommittee hearings on the issue of televised trials after the conclusion of this case. Supporters of broadcasting criminal trials felt that newscasters should have used their editing capacity to delete Araujo's name.<sup id=\"cite_ref-kaplan_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kaplan-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> As noted by Peter Kaplan, Specter said, \"Some hard thinking has to be done in protecting the rights of witnesses and defendants.\"  He added, \"If this could be achieved, it would be highly desirable to televise rape cases, child-abuse cases and other crimes.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-kaplan_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kaplan-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Other supporters also believed that it was important to show the judicial process.<sup id=\"cite_ref-kaplan_6-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kaplan-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Other concerns about media coverage of this case related to the press' repetition of the first police report, without adequate attribution. They published Araujo's initial account of a crowd cheering in the bar. It was found that there were fewer men in the tavern than she claimed; during the trial, she said the attack resulted in her being distraught and distorting the number. But the dramatic first account had staying power; it was repeated even after more factually accurate accounts were published and broadcast.<sup id=\"cite_ref-friendly_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-friendly-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_life_and_death\">Later life and death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cheryl_Araujo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Later life and death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Araujo was essentially ostracized in New Bedford.

Araujo had entered school to become a secretary, was making a life for herself, and had found some measure of happiness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On December 14, 1986, she lost control of her car while taking her daughters to a Christmas show and struck a <a href=\"/wiki/Utility_pole\" title=\"Utility pole\">utility pole</a>. The girls were injured, but survived. Araujo died in the crash.  She was 25 years old.
