Farzana Parveen Iqbal was stoned to death on 27 May 2014 outside a court in Lahore, Pakistan.  Her father, two brothers and former fianc√© were among the nearly twenty attackers. Farzana, who was pregnant by her husband Muhammad Iqbal, was killed following the tradition of honour killing.    By his own admission, Muhammad Iqbal strangled his first wife in 2008 out of love for Farzana Parveen, and so that he would be free to marry her.  Police said he had been released after that murder when a "compromise" was reached with his first wife's family.  Iqbal and Farzana had an engagement that had lasted years.  When she became pregnant by him, they decided to marry.  According to Iqbal, Farzana's father, Muhammad Parveen, withdrew support for the marriage after Iqbal refused his demands for more money, beyond the originally agreed bride-price.  On 27 May 2014, Farzana Iqbal, 30, was attacked by about a dozen male family members in front of a Pakistani High Court.  The attackers were led by her father, Muhammad Parveen, but included her two brothers and other family members.  They began by punching and kicking, then it escalated to using clubs and bricks, then hurling stones.  She was killed for eloping and marrying Muhammad Iqbal, 45, whom she loved and by whom she was pregnant.    Farzana Iqbal was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Most of the attackers initially escaped except for Farzana's father, Muhammad Parveen, who was arrested. Police investigator Mujahid quoted the father as saying: "I killed my daughter as she had insulted all of our family by marrying a man without our consent, and I have no regret over it."    As of 5 June 2014, 12 people have been arrested in connection with Iqbal's death, including her father.
