The brazen nature of the crime sparked widespread media interest and a <i><a href=\"/wiki/Crimewatch\" title=\"Crimewatch\">Crimewatch</a></i> appeal. It also sparked the largest ever man-hunt, at the time, by <a href=\"/wiki/Northumbria_Police\" title=\"Northumbria Police\">Northumbria Police</a>. Assertions by the police that the crime had been a case of opportunistic abduction from the home by a stranger were initially met with scepticism, given the seemingly unbelievable nature of the crime.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Voisey's conviction also sparked a review of the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), which govern the monitoring of past offenders.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Abduction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Abduction</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Arrest\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arrest</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Conviction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Conviction</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Abduction\">Abduction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Willington_Quay_child_abduction_case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Abduction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The girl was abducted from her ground-floor bath as her mother was in the next-door room. She was driven around the local area for 20 minutes, before being found naked in a snow-covered back alley. Initially, police only had the girl's eyewitness account of a \"man in a red car\" identified by her as a <a href=\"/wiki/Vauxhall_Astra\" title=\"Vauxhall Astra\">Vauxhall Astra</a>, with no other witnesses present.<sup id=\"cite_ref-cw_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cw-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The only forensic evidence the police could obtain was a footprint in the bathroom, and a partial DNA trace from the girl's fingernail. Through careful interview with the girl, it was ascertained from the route she was driven, that the offender had a good knowledge of the local area. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arrest\">Arrest</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Willington_Quay_child_abduction_case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Arrest\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Voisey, who was also known as Peter Smith, was originally questioned as part of a wide sweep of local people who might be of interest because he was a registered sex offender. Police were first aware of him as a sneak thief, committing high risk burglaries with a chance of discovery,<sup id=\"cite_ref-cw_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cw-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> but in 2001, he had been convicted of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl in a swimming pool changing room in Cheshire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-bbc20Oct2006_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-bbc20Oct2006-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> He was not initially considered a priority lead, as he had been classified low risk due to good behaviour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-cw_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cw-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Voisey initially appeared good natured, and had a good account of his movements. He continued to strenuously deny any involvement when interviewed further.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conviction\">Conviction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Willington_Quay_child_abduction_case&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Conviction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>With no strong evidence, Voisey was convicted from a multitude of lesser clues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-cw_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cw-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This included his local knowledge and his mobile phone records, which proved he was not where he claimed to be at the time. The trainer print had been matched to a pair he owned, only five of which had been sold in the North East that year. He had made a cryptic diary entry for the day in question, \"Phew it's over, chill now\", which he claimed referred to Christmas. He had also owned a red Astra, although this was scrapped before it could be seized as evidence. It was also concluded, although a partial match, that there was a high chance of the DNA found being Voisey's.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span
