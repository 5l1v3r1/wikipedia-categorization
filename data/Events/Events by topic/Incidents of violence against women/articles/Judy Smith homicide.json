Jeffrey, a divorc\u00e9 with a grown daughter, began dating Judy, who also had two adult children from a previous marriage, and in September 1996 the two wed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Jeffrey's work as a lawyer was also related to health care; he represented the Northeast Pharmaceutical Conference, an organization of researchers and executives primarily from <a href=\"/wiki/New_England\" title=\"New England\">New England</a>.

New <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration\" title=\"Federal Aviation Administration\">FAA</a> regulations at the time required that airlines verify passengers' identities before allowing them to fly. Judy told her husband she would return to their home to get it and then take a later flight; that evening she caught up to him in the holiday of the <a href=\"/wiki/DoubleTree\" title=\"DoubleTree\">DoubleTree</a> hotel in <a href=\"/wiki/Center_City,_Philadelphia\" title=\"Center City, Philadelphia\">Center City Philadelphia</a> where the conference was being held, apologizing for her mistake and bringing flowers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The next morning Jeffrey awoke before his wife and went downstairs to get breakfast. He returned to the room afterwards and found her awake, in the shower. He told her the breakfast was exceptional and that she should have it for herself.

The night before, the couple had agreed that Judy, who was making her first visit to Philadelphia, would go visit the city's tourist attractions such as <a href=\"/wiki/Independence_Hall\" title=\"Independence Hall\">Independence Hall</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Liberty_Bell\" title=\"Liberty Bell\">Liberty Bell</a>, and then reunite at the hotel at the end of the day for the conference's cocktail party at 6 p.m.. When Jeffrey finished moderating the last of the day's sessions, he returned to their room. Judy was not there.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>He assumed she had returned, changed, and gone down to the party ahead of him, perhaps having gotten confused about their plans. When he went downstairs to check on this, however, she was not there. After going back and forth between the party and the room several times, he grew concerned and informed a <a href=\"/wiki/Concierge\" title=\"Concierge\">concierge</a>, who began calling area hospitals.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There were many reasons why Judy might have been delayed, Jeffrey knew. She would not have thought twice to have helped a stranger in need, as she had helped a sick passenger suffering from <a href=\"/wiki/HIV/AIDS\" title=\"HIV/AIDS\">AIDS</a> on another flight the year before. But if she did something like that, she usually called or tried to let someone know.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Jeffrey left the cocktail party and paid a cab driver to slowly follow the route of the <a href=\"/wiki/Philadelphia_PHLASH\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Philadelphia PHLASH\">Philadelphia PHLASH</a> tourist bus, which Judy had told him she was planning to use, for any sign of her. He called his stepchildren in Boston and asked one of them to go to their house and check their <a href=\"/wiki/Answering_machine\" title=\"Answering machine\">answering machines</a> for any messages. None of those options yielded any useful information. Finally he went to the <a href=\"/wiki/Philadelphia_Police_Department\" title=\"Philadelphia Police Department\">Philadelphia police</a> around midnight to report Judy missing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Investigation\">Investigation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Judy_Smith_homicide&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Investigation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Philadelphia police told Jeffrey that he could not file a <a href=\"/wiki/Missing_person\" title=\"Missing person\">missing person</a> report until 24 hours after he had last seen Judy. He recalls that a detective said that if he wanted to \"push it\", he could file his report in the morning. After spending the remainder of the night sleepless in his hotel room, he did.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Before Jeffrey did, however, he talked to <a href=\"/wiki/Mayor_of_Philadelphia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mayor of Philadelphia\">Philadelphia mayor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Ed_Rendell\" title=\"Ed Rendell\">Ed Rendell</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Perzel\" title=\"John Perzel\">John Perzel</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_House_of_Representatives\" title=\"Pennsylvania House of Representatives\">Pennsylvania House of Representatives</a> from the city, who were both attending the conference, about what he felt was the police's dismissive attitude to his complaint. He said later that he believed those conversations had made a difference, as when returned to the police station to make his report, two detectives were waiting to take it and he was treated with courtesy and respect; he said he even overheard one saying on the telephone that <a href=\"/wiki/Police_commissioner\" title=\"Police commissioner\">Commissioner</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Neal_(police_officer)\" title=\"Richard Neal (police officer)\">Richard Neal</a> was to receive a copy of the report.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Nevertheless, Jeffrey said several months later that there was some resistance. One detective, he claimed, was still saying four days later that he thought Judy had just had a <a href=\"/wiki/Midlife_crisis\" title=\"Midlife crisis\">midlife crisis</a> and had done this just for the attention; the detective later repeated that speculation, with some qualification, to <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Boston_Globe\" title=\"The Boston Globe\">The Boston Globe</a></i>. Jeffrey also believed the police, while cooperative overall, seemed to be inordinately focused on him as a suspect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \"When you look at the statistics, 85 to 90 percent of females [who are murdered] are killed by someone very close to them: a family member, spouse, boyfriend\", police captain John McGinnis explained later. \"Statistically, we have to look at Jeffrey Smith as a suspect, until it's proven that he is not a suspect\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Second_City_Paper_story_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Second_City_Paper_story-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While Jeffrey understood and cooperated when they asked to interview his stepdaughter without him present, since she told the police he \"[didn't] cheat on his taxes\", he was distressed that they expressed doubt that Judy had ever been in Philadelphia to begin with. If, they asked, Judy was the experienced traveler who had once gone to <a href=\"/wiki/Thailand\" title=\"Thailand\">Thailand</a> on her own to visit the family of a grateful patient, why had she forgotten her driver's license? Jeffrey later explained in response to the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Paper\" title=\"Philadelphia City Paper\">Philadelphia City Paper</a></i> that the rule had only been in effect for 18 months and Judy had only flown once during that time, so it was entirely possible that she made an honest mistake.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Second_City_Paper_story_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Second_City_Paper_story-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to police, only one other witness, a desk clerk, could corroborate him on having seen Judy at the hotel, which did not have a <a href=\"/wiki/Guestbook\" title=\"Guestbook\">guest register</a>, until another conference attendee recalled in August that he had seen her in the lobby when she arrived (even so, police were still cautious since he did not know Judy personally). A female detective who searched the Smiths' hotel room said it struck her as unusual that the clothes Judy left behind did not appear to have been worn at all, suggesting she had worn the same clothes both on her flight from Boston and the day she disappeared; nor did she appear to have brought any <a href=\"/wiki/Cosmetics\" title=\"Cosmetics\">cosmetics</a>. But her daughter said that was typical travel behavior for her mother.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Second_City_Paper_story_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Second_City_Paper_story-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The police also made much of what they asserted was Jeffrey's refusal to take a <a href=\"/wiki/Lie_detector\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lie detector\">lie detector</a> test. He says he never refused; he only insisted that any such test be administered by the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation\" title=\"Federal Bureau of Investigation\">FBI</a> and that if he passed, the police formally request that the bureau assist with its investigation. But according to McGinnis, at the time he made that demand Jeffrey already knew the FBI would not join the investigation, and still declined to submit to the test even when the Philadelphia police arranged for it to be administered by the <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Police\" title=\"Massachusetts State Police\">Massachusetts State Police</a>. \"Certain conditions were met, but as far as I'm concerned he refused\", said deputy commissioner Richard Zappile.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Second_City_Paper_story_5-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Second_City_Paper_story-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Possible_sightings\">Possible sightings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Judy_Smith_homicide&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Possible sightings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the days after Judy disappeared, <a href=\"/wiki/Media_in_Philadelphia\" title=\"Media in Philadelphia\">Philadelphia newspapers and television</a> ran stories about the case. Jeffrey and friends and family put up flyers with her picture seeking information. These led to reports of sightings, some of which Jeffrey found credible. Most were in the city, but later reports came from outside the city.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A number of reports described a woman who matched Judy's description but appeared to have psychological issues. She was described by staff at the <a href=\"/wiki/Society_Hill\" title=\"Society Hill\">Society Hill</a> Hotel as their \"weirdo of the week\" when she stayed there between April 13 and 15, signing in as \"H.K.

But both the police and the family believe that those who saw her confused Judy with a homeless woman in the area who strongly resembled her, so much that even Judy's son thought the woman was his mother when he saw her from across the street.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>However, one other homeless man in Penn's Landing, when shown Judy's picture, insisted he had seen her and not the other homeless woman, sleeping on a bench next to him the night before. On April 15, he told the family that they had just missed this woman, but they were unable to locate her in the vicinity. The family believed this was significant because it was the last time anyone had identified Judy based on seeing her picture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Sightings that seemed a more positive identification were centered around the PHLASH bus and its route. A hotel employee said she had asked later on the morning of April 10 where she could catch the bus nearby; a driver said he had picked her up at <a href=\"/wiki/Front_Street_(Philadelphia)\" title=\"Front Street (Philadelphia)\">Front</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/South_Street_(Philadelphia)\" title=\"South Street (Philadelphia)\">South</a> Streets early in the afternoon and may have let her off near the hotel. She was also reportedly seen entering and leaving the city's <a href=\"/wiki/Greyhound\" title=\"Greyhound\">Greyhound</a> bus terminal, possibly to use the bathroom, her family believes. The terminal is near Philadelphia's <a href=\"/wiki/Chinatown,_Philadelphia\" title=\"Chinatown, Philadelphia\">Chinatown</a>, and since Judy loved <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_American_cuisine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese American cuisine\">Chinese</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Thai_food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thai food\">Thai food</a> she might have gone there to eat; however, no one at any of the many restaurants in the neighborhood recalled her.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another report surfaced that Judy had been seen shopping for dresses at <a href=\"/wiki/Macy%27s\" title=\"Macy&#39;s\">Macy's</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Deptford_Mall\" title=\"Deptford Mall\">Deptford Mall</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Deptford,_New_Jersey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deptford, New Jersey\">Deptford, New Jersey</a>, across the <a href=\"/wiki/Delaware_River\" title=\"Delaware River\">Delaware River</a>.

A salesperson and customer at Macy's gave an account of the actions of a woman there who may have been Judy, saying she had said she was shopping for her daughter even though her daughter often disliked what she bought her\u2014which rang true to her family\u2014and giving a description that included the distinctive red backpack she carried almost everywhere, especially when traveling. As the woman left, they recalled, she had tried to get a younger woman, whom they assumed at the time was the woman's daughter, to leave with her.<sup id=\"cite_ref-First_City_Paper_story_2-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-First_City_Paper_story-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There were also reports that she had been seen in <a href=\"/wiki/Easton,_Pennsylvania\" title=\"Easton, Pennsylvania\">Easton</a>, 55 miles (89&#160;km) north of Philadelphia, a few days after going missing.

A detective there asked Jeffrey for his wife's <a href=\"/wiki/Dental_records\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dental records\">dental records</a>, which he provided; they were then sent to the medical examiner in Asheville.

In order to identify her killer, they would probably need to figure out how she got to North Carolina in the first place.

A clerk at a local retailer said: \"She seemed very alert to me. She was very pleasant. I didn't see anything about her that would indicate that she wasn't right in any way\".
