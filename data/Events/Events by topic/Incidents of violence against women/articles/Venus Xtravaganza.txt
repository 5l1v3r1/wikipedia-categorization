Venus Xtravaganza (May 22, 1965 – December 21, 1988) was an American transgender performer. She came to national attention after her appearance in Jennie Livingston's 1991 documentary film Paris Is Burning, in which her life as a trans woman forms one of the film's several story arcs. Venus was born May 22, 1965, in Jersey City, New Jersey Her parents were of Italian American and Puerto Rican descent.  She took the name Venus in her early teens. Venus states in Paris is Burning that she began performing after leaving home "at 13 or 14," placing her earliest performances around 1978 or 79. Her ball career began in 1983, when Venus was invited to join the House of Xtravaganza by its founder, Hector Xtravaganza. Angie Xtravaganza, another transgender performer and the first to join Hector's house, took on Venus as her mentee and "drag daughter." Venus and the house's other "fem queens" achieved high success on New York's competition circuit and were dubbed "impossible beauties. " At the time of filming, Venus was also an aspiring model.  On Christmas Day, 1988, Venus was found strangled under a bed at the Duchess Hotel in New York.   It was estimated her body had been there for four days before discovery. Paris is Burning was still shooting at the time of Venus' death; the film's closing features characters reacting to her death, including house mother Angie Xtravaganza. Most suspect that Venus, a sex worker, was murdered by a vengeful john who discovered she was a transgender woman, a narrative consistent with an interview shown earlier in the film where Venus admits narrowly escaping a similar instance of retaliation. Her killer has never been found.  She is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey.
