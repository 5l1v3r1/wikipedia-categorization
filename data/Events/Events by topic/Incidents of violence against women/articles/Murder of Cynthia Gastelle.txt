Cynthia Joan Gastelle was a formerly unidentified American murder victim who disappeared on April 3, 1980.  Her body was found two years later, but remained unidentified for 30 years before matching of mitochondrial DNA entered into the national DNA database provided her identity.   Cynthia was last seen heading to a job interview at a deli in Takoma Park. She had left home around 10:30 and had boarded a Ride On bus to Silver Spring according to her brother Peter Gastelle.  Cynthia had run away twice before so her family waited a few days before reporting her missing.  Cynthia's skeletal remains were found on February 12, 1982   on Bull Run Mountain in Haymarket, Virginia; they were located in a secluded wooded area.  In 2001 DNA from Cynthia's relatives were entered into the national DNA database. It was revealed in June 2012 that a match had been made.
