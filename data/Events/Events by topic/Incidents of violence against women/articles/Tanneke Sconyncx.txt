Tanneke Sconyncx (1560 â€“ 2 June 1603) was an alleged Flemish witch from Gottem in Flanders. Her case is among the most notable of the period in Belgium. Sconyncx was described as a wealthy beautiful merchant. She was accused of witchcraft by the bailiff in the city of Deinze, who also performed the arrest. She denied the charges and claimed that the bailiff had made his accusation as revenge because she had refused him sexually. She died during torture after having been tortured day and night without respite from 23 May to 2 June. A statue was made of "the witch of Tielt" and placed in the market square of Tielt, West Flanders.
