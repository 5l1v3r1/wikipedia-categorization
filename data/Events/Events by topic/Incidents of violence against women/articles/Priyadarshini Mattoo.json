The original acquittal was overturned and Santosh Singh was found guilty of murder and rape.\n</p><p>The case is one of several in India that highlight the ineffectiveness of traditional criminal law system, especially when it comes to high-profile perpetrators, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Murder_of_Jessica_Lall\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Murder of Jessica Lall\">Murder of Jessica Lall</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sanjeev_Nanda\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sanjeev Nanda\">Sanjeev Nanda</a> acquittals.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Childhood\">Childhood</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Priyadarshini_Mattoo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Childhood\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After Priyadarshini finished school from the Presentation Convent School in <a href=\"/wiki/Srinagar\" title=\"Srinagar\">Srinagar</a>, she migrated with her family to <a href=\"/wiki/Jammu\" title=\"Jammu\">Jammu</a>.

However, at one point, he started stalking her, and her family lodged several <a href=\"/wiki/First_Information_Report\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First Information Report\">FIRs</a> with the police. A police escort was provided for some time, but the stalking continued.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_murder\">The murder</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Priyadarshini_Mattoo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The murder\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Priyadarshini was in the third-year of her law program, when she was found strangled in her uncle\u2019s  residence. She had been raped, struck 14 times with a motorcycle helmet, and finally strangled with a wire. Santosh Kumar Singh, her senior in college, had been stalking and harassing her for several years, and was the immediate suspect. But Santosh came from an influential family - his father J.P. Singh was then Inspector General of Police in the state of J&amp;K<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> - in the course of the trial he served as Joint Commissioner of Police in Delhi, where the crime had been committed. In view of these connections, the court handed over investigation of the case to the <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation\" title=\"Central Bureau of Investigation\">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> (CBI). In 1995, Priyadarshini had complained that Santosh Singh was harassing and stalking her. She had been provided with a personal security officer at the time. In retaliation, Santosh had lodged a complaint with the university alleging that she was pursuing two degrees simultaneously. However, it turned out that Priyadarshini had passed M.Com in 1991 and the complaint was merely malicious. On the morning of January 23, 1996, Santosh was seen knocking for entrance into Priyadarshini's uncle's house, where she was living, in the Vasant Kunj area of Delhi. A servant saw Santosh entering her house, apparently saying that he wanted a compromise in their legal complaints. Subsequently he raped her, strangled her with an electric wire and then battered her face beyond recognition with a motorcycle helmet. Santosh's presence in the house after the murder was also established by the prosecution.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trial_Court_Judgment\">Trial Court Judgment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Priyadarshini_Mattoo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Trial Court Judgment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Delivering the ironical and widely criticized judgment in the trial court proceedings in 1999, the Additional Sessions Judge. G.P. Thareja said of Santosh, that though he knew that \"he is the man who committed the crime,\" he was forced to acquit him, giving him the benefit of doubt.\n</p><p>In a 450-page judgment the judge came down heavily on the role of Delhi Police; \u201cThere has been particular inaction by Delhi Police\u201d, he said, while commenting that the accused\u2019s father may have used his official position to influence the agencies. \u201cThe influence of the father has been there in the matter and there was deliberate inaction\u201d (at the time his father was second in command of the police forces in Delhi).\n</p><p>The helmet was found with a shattered <a href=\"/wiki/Visor\" title=\"Visor\">visor</a> - however the evidence was so poorly presented that the defense was able to discount it.\n</p><p>He further stated that the rule of law doesn\u2019t seem to apply to the children of those who enforce it.\n</p><p>The Delhi police according to the judge, attempted to assist the accused during the investigation and trial. \"Lalit Mohan, the Inspector was instrumental in creating false evidence and false defense for the accused. The witnesses of the police including a Sub-Inspector deposed falsely\".\n</p><p>The judgment held the CBI responsible for unfair investigation and failure to produce Virender Prasad, Mattoo\u2019s household help, which resulted in the obstruction of justice.  The police had claimed Prasad had gone missing and was not traceable, yet  in the aftermath a journalist could easily find him in his Bihar village.\n</p><p>The judge added that the CBI fabricated the DNA test in the rape case as it was not obtained in accordance with the judicial procedure and could not therefore be admitted in evidence in view of Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act.\n</p><p>The \"state  had failed to bring home the charge of rape against the accused\", and while indicting Santosh as \"the man who committed the crime\", the judge was constrained to acquit him, because of \"the benefit of doubt\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"High_Court_Appeal\">High Court Appeal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Priyadarshini_Mattoo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: High Court Appeal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Following a public outcry, the CBI then appealed the district court's verdict in Delhi High Court on February 29, 2000. Initially, the trial was not a priority, and there was no presentation of evidence or hearings in the Delhi High Court well into 2006.  However, intense public scrutiny was mounted in the case after the acquittals in the <a href=\"/wiki/Jessica_Lal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jessica Lal\">Jessica Lal</a> case, with Priyadarshini's aged father Chaman Lal Matoo making frequent appearances on TV, bringing the judiciary under intense pressure.\n</p><p>On August 31, 2006, six years after the initial appeal by CBI,  justices RS Sodhi and PK Bhasin took up the case on a day-to-day hearing basis, which is extremely rare in India. Judgment was reached within 42 days which is quite unprecedented.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Verdict\">Verdict</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Priyadarshini_Mattoo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Verdict\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>On October 17, 2006, Santosh Singh, who meanwhile had married and become a practising lawyer in Delhi itself, was found guilty under <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code\" title=\"Indian Penal Code\">Indian Penal Code</a> sections 302 (murder) and 376 (rape).

However, the bench agreed with the trial's court observation that police were reluctant to act on repeated complaints of harassment and stalking against Singh as his father was the senior <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Police_Service\" title=\"Indian Police Service\">IPS</a> officer (now retired) Director-General of Police J.P. Singh.\n</p><p>The verdict says \"junior staff do not react to complaints against the relatives of their fraternity\" and referred to the trial court's observation that the approach and working of the subordinate staff of Delhi Police clearly reflected that the rule of law \"is not meant for those who enforce the law nor for their near relatives\".\n</p><p>The verdict was reached on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence. Santosh's father J.P. Singh was in court.

Santosh was sitting just five-feet away from the jam-packed court. The court had convicted Santosh of the crime earlier that month.\n</p><p>The two-judge bench, comprising Justice R. S. Sodhi and Justice P. K. Bhasin, heard both sides before pronouncing the verdict. The court said Santosh Singh had been given many chances to reform by the police when Priyadarshini had complained that he was stalking her. However, he didn't mend his ways and eventually raped and killed her.\n</p><p>\"There is absolutely no doubt in our mind that what was required of Singh was exemplary behaviour being a son of police officer and a lawyer himself. Yet with a pre-meditated approach, he continued to harass the victim for two years,\" the Bench said.\n</p><p>\"In spite of repeated warnings by the police and his undertakings to them, he went about committing the most ghastly act.
