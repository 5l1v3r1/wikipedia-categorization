Jacksonville Jane Doe (officially known as  Jane Doe 95-7000) is the name given to a set of female human remains, discovered in Jacksonville, Onslow County, North Carolina on December 6, 1995.   The woman has yet to be identified.   Her face has since been reconstructed, in 2D as well as 3D, as an attempt to show what she may have looked like when she was alive.    The body was found in a field, believed to have been disposed around two years before.  She stood at approximately between 5'5" and 5'8" tall and her weight could not be estimated due to the condition of her body. The victim's age range was estimated to have been between the early and late 30s, although The Doe Network reports that the age range was as large as 25 to 40.   Near the skeleton was a strand of reddish hair that may have belonged to her. She had various evidence of dental work on her teeth, although some had protruded from her mouth. Examination of her body also indicated she had a divided rib.   Items such as a Nike shoe, gold jewelry, hoop earrings, red, black and yellow clothing, a hotel key, and subway tokens were also present at the scene.    No evidence of foul play was found on her bones, although it is believed that she was murdered.  The case remains unsolved, although in 2012 police had a suspect in Matt Adler, who had a possible connection with her death.  He was imprisoned in 1995 for the rape and murder of Lisa Gipson.   In 2013, he pleaded guilty to the murder of Wanda Musk. He currently is serving a life sentence for his crimes.   The Jane Doe's case was featured on the website for America's Most Wanted but did not lead to her identification.
