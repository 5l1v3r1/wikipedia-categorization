The Kandhamal gang rape case was a crime in Ranaghat, Nadia district, of the Indian state of West Bengal, in March 2015. A 71-year-old Syro-Malankara Catholic nun was gang raped by eight men who robbed a Catholic missionary school. Before the attack, school officials told police that they received death threats.                   On March 26, 2015, two men were arrested for the crimes.   Two Bangladeshi nationals were detained on March 20, 2015, on suspicion of their involvement in the sexual assault of the 71-year-old nun at the Ranaghat convent school six days prior, police said. North Dinajpur Superintendent of Police S. W. Reza said that the two suspects — Mukul Alam (28) and Md Majid (29) — bore a striking resemblance to those caught on the CCTV camera at the Convent of Jesus and Mary school on March 14, one of them having 75 percent similarity.   Cardinal Baselios Cleemis met the victim in the hospital and told the press that "such inhuman acts should be stopped. We request the authorities to ensure that justice is done and made visible".
