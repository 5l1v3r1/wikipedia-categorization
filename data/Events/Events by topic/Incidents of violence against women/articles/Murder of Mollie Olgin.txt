Mollie Olgin, 19, was murdered on June 22, 2012 in Violet Andrews Park in Portland, Texas. David Malcolm Strickland, 25, sexually assaulted her and her girlfriend Mary Kristene "Kris" Chapa, 18, before shooting them both execution-style.   Olgin was pronounced dead at the scene and Chapa was taken to hospital in critical condition due to a bullet wound in her head.  Following intensive care and concerns that the bullet may have left her completely paralyzed,  Chapa regained mobility in the left side of her body.  On September 28, 2016 a jury found Strickland guilty of capital murder and aggravated sexual assault. Since the prosecution did not seek the death penalty for Strickland, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
