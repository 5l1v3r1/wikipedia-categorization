Naga Vaishnavi (January 21, 2000 â€“ February 2, 2010) was the daughter of Palagani Prabhakara Rao, a noted businessman Andhra Pradesh, India, and his second wife Narmada.  Vaishnavi was kidnapped on January 30, 2010,  and murdered by her kidnappers on February 2. That incident caused tremendous shock for her father, resulting in cardiac arrest and death.   She had previously been kidnapped in 2005. Her murder caused widespread outrage throughout Andhra Pradesh.  Her older brother, Sai Tejesh, escaped from the truck when Vaishnavi was kidnapped. Her father had seeked justice for his daughters murder,  and has now died due to a heart attack. A Vijayawada Women Sessions Court in June 2018 sentenced the three accused to life imprisonment.  Both of Nagas parents died before the accused were sentenced.
