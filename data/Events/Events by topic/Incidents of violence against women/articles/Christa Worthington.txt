Christa Worthington (December 23, 1956 â€“ January 6, 2002) was a United States fashion writer who worked for Women's Wear Daily, Cosmopolitan, ELLE, Harper's Bazaar, and The New York Times. She was also a co-author of several books on fashion and formerly dated Stan Stokowski, the oldest son of Gloria Vanderbilt and Leopold Stokowski.  Worthington was stabbed to death at her home in Truro, Massachusetts (on Cape Cod).  Her body was found on January 6, 2002, with her two-year-old daughter, Ava, clinging to it.  The child was unharmed. On April 15, 2005, a local garbage collector, Christopher McCowen, was arrested and charged with her rape and murder. On November 16, 2006, he was found guilty in Barnstable Superior Court of first-degree murder, rape and burglary, and sentenced to life without parole.  In January 2008, a hearing was held due to three jurors' separate allegations that racism was involved in the deliberations.   In December 2010, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied an appeal for a new trial.  Links to some articles written by Worthington:
