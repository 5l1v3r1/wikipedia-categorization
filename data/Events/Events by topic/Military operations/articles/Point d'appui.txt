A point d'appui (French for fulcrum), in military theory, is a location where troops are assembled prior to a battle. Often a monument is erected to commemorate the point d'appui for notable battles. In some battles there may be more than a single point d'appui.  In Scotland, the Catto Long Barrow is located at the point d'appui of a historic battle  between Vikings and Picts in eastern Aberdeenshire.
