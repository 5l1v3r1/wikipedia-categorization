Relief, as a military term, refers to the breaking of a siege or an encirclement by an outside force.  Relief may occur in conjunction with a breakout. It is one of four possible conclusions of investment, the others being a breakout, surrender or reduction. The force that effects relief is known as the "relieving force". Following relief, the town or fortification is said to have been "relieved".
