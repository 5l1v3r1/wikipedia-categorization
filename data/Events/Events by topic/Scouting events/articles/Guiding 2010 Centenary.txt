 The Guiding 2010 Centenary consisted of celebrations around the world in which Girl Guides and Girl Scouts celebrated 100 years of the world Guide and Scout movement. It took place over three years, 2010-2012, reflecting the founding dates of many World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts member organisations. National Guide and Scout movements added local celebrations to the international ones. There were three Centenary Celebration Days. On 10 April each year, celebrations were  held around the world under a unifying theme. The theme for 2010 was plant. The theme for 2011 was grow, and the theme for 2012 was share. Girlguiding UK started its Centenary celebrations on 4 September 2009.  The Centenary Camp was held from 2010-07-31 to 2010-08-07 at Harewood House. In September 2009, a maze to celebrate the beginnings of Guiding at Crystal Palace opened in Crystal Palace Park. The tall ship Lord Nelson made a 100-day voyage around the coast of the UK to celebrate the centenary. The Lord Nelson set sail from Glasgow on 7 June 2010.
