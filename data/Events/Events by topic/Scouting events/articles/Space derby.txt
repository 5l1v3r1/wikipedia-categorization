The space derby is a racing event for Cub Scouts in the Boy Scouts of America that is similar to the pinewood derby car race.  Cub Scouts (the young-age division of the Boy Scouts of America) race miniature balsa wood gliders that are propelled by a rubber band and propeller. The space derby kit consists of a balsa wood block, propeller assembly, rubber bands, plastic sheet (for fins), and a mounting bracket. The wood block comes out of the box with a drilled out center hole. The block is carved into the desired shape, sanded and painted. The mounting bracket and fins can be added either before or after painting. The rubber band is inserted through the center hole with one end on the propeller and the other held in a cross-piece at the rear. The completed gliders are wound up with as many as 100 or more turns on the propeller and suspended on a string from a separate bracket with the propeller held in place. Two, three or four string lanes are typically used. The gliders are held in place and launched when the mechanism releases the propeller. Space derby at Curlie (based on DMOZ)
