The World Scout Winter Games is an international winter sports event for Scouts. The First World Scout Winter Games was held at Kandersteg International Scout Centre between February 28 and March 3, 2008. Nine teams, representing eight countries participated. The events included cross country skiing, curling, slalom racing, synchronised skiing and a triathlon. The overall winners were Sweden, with a team from Svenska Scoutr√•det, the Swedish Guide & Scout Council.  The 2nd World Scout Winter Games were to be held in 2010, also in Kandersteg, but had to be cancelled due to a low number of participating countries.
