  The Fellsman is an annual organised walk and fell race of about sixty miles in the Yorkshire Dales from Ingleton to Threshfield. The event was devised by Don Thompson and the Brighouse District (Brigantes) Rover Crew and the first hike was held in 1962, with the route then running in the opposite direction from the present one. The organisation was later taken on by the Keighley Scout Service Team.  The Team has since changed its name to Keighley Scout Service Network. The route includes Ingleborough, Whernside, Gragareth, Great Coum, Dent, Blea Moor, Great Knoutberry, Snaizeholme, Dodd Fell, Fleet Moss, Middle Tongue, Cray, Buckden Pike, Great Whernside before finishing in Threshfield. During the course of the race, participants will climb over 11,000 feet (3,400Â m) and will cover some very testing terrain, some of which is off waymarked paths so navigational skills and experience with a map and compass are a necessity.  Much of the course is on private land with secured access from the land-owners for the race period only.  The winners of the event have been as follows.
