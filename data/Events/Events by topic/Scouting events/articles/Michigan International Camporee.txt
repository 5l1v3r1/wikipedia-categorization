The Michigan International Camporee is a camporee attended by Scouts from the United States, Canada and other counties. It is hosted by the Michigan Crossroads Council of the Boy Scouts of America and is recognized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). The theme is international friendship and fellowship. The Michigan International Camporee provides an opportunity for local and international Scouts to attend a Jamboree at a fraction of the cost of traditional International Scout Jamborees. One patrol of Scouts from any country outside the U.S. and Canada may attend free of charge. A small fee is charged for local Scouts and Venturers, but is still a fraction of the cost of participating in a World Scout Jamboree. Generally every four years (1997, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016), contingents of Scouts, both all boys and mixed boys and girls, from over 20 countries, gather for 8 days of fun and various activities in Michigan].  The next Michigan International Camporee will be held from Sunday afternoon, July 19, to Sunday morning, July 26, 2020, at Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation, 6278 Texas Drive, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49009. International participants home stay with mid-Michigan Scouts as they explore mid-Michigan with their host families. The next week all the International Scouts and local Scouts, along with Scouts from other states, converge at a Michigan Crossroads Council Camp for 8 more days of fellowship and learning. Events include music and dance performances, camping, campfires, pioneering, team building events, international cooking, scoutcraft, shooting sports, water sports, Native American activities, and international festival day.  Past Michigan International Camporees have included contingents from: Bonaire (2012) Cruacao (2012) Ethiopia (2012) Republic of Korea, 2008, 2012) Taiwan (2008, 2012)
