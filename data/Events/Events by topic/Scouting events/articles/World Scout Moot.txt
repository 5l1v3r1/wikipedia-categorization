The World Scout Moot is an event for senior branches (traditionally called Rovers) and other young adult members, gathering up to 5,000 people. Moots provide an opportunity for young adults in Scouting to meet together with the objective of improving their international understanding as citizens of the world. Moots are held every four years and are organized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM).  Participants must be 18â€“25 years old at the time of the event. If you are 26 or older you can take part as International Service Team (IST, volunteer staff). The first World Scout Moot was in 1931 and following ones were held almost every four years until 1961. Originally entitled the "World Rover Moot", the Moot was replaced by World Moot Years between 1965 and 1982. This was done with the aim of increasing the number of events and accessibility to Rovers. In 1985, the World Scout Conference decided to reinstate the World Scout Moot and, in 1993 decided to hold the Moot every four years. The 13th World Scout Moot was held in Kenya in 2010 - the first ever such event to take place in Africa. The 15th World Scout Moot was in Iceland in the summer of 2017; the next 16th World Scout Moot will be in Ireland in 2021.
