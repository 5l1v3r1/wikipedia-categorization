National Dance Day was created by Nigel Lythgoe, the co-creator of So You Think You Can Dance and co-president of the Dizzy Feet Foundation. It takes place in the United States on the last Saturday in July.  It was founded and officially recognized in 2010 when American congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a National Dance Day resolution to promote dance education and physical fitness.   As of 2016, the event continues annually and "encourages Americans to embrace dance as a fun and positive way to maintain good health and combat obesity".
