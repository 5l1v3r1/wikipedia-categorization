 StyleNite is a cultural event organized by Berlin's designer Michael Michalsky. It has evolved from Michalsky's fashion shows and takes place twice a year during Berlin Fashion Week. Since January 2010 the event is officially titled StyleNite.  The event is breaking with the traditions of a conventional fashion show, by combining performances of different art disciplines. Each StyleNite is themed according to the inspirational topic of the latest collection of the designer Michalsky. Michalsky is considered a „seismograph of society"  and his collections are regularly influenced by current developments in society. These topics are picked up as central theme of the StyleNite with the aim to support a free and tolerant exchange between artists and art disciplines. In this respect, the StyleNite is considered a platform for exchange, discussion and contacts. Inherent part of the StyleNite are Michalsky's fashion shows. Alternating locations and elaborate stage-designs are setting the scene for further performances during the event. Part of the program are always live music acts of famous or newcomer bands, show performances, film premieres and fashion shows of other labels.  The evening ends with an excessive after show party. In March 2011 Michalsky announced that the following four StyleNites are going to take place at the Tempodrom in Berlin. Lady Gaga, 07/2008 Spandau Ballet, 01/2010 Hurts, 01/2010 Nadja Michael, 07/2010 Jessica 6, 01/2012 Marina and the Diamonds, 01/2012 Frida Gold, 01/2012 Icona Pop, 01/2013 MS MR, 07/2013 Michalsky always develops an elaborate and individual stage for each StyleNite interpreting the theme of the evening. For example, the stage of the StyleNite The Great Depression Part II featured a crashed airplane in a pool and thousands of stocks on the catwalk. Stage, 1/2012 Stage, 7/2012 Stage, 1/2013 Stage, 7/2013 Besides famous models there are always new faces to be spotted at StyleNite. Michalsky has always ignored the „traditional" requirements for models regarding age, origin and perfection. He would line up handicapped models as well as aged models on the runway at StyleNite. The engagement of the handicapped model Mario Galla at the StyleNite in July 2010 was considered almost scandalous among the fashion scene and caused enormous media response.  In January 2011, the models Eveline Hall and Pat Cleveland walked the runway; both women are over 60 years old. The internationally renowned German model Toni Garrn has been a regular among the models at StyleNite for several years. In January 2013 Jimi Blue Ochsenknecht was proud to present his first run on catwalk for Michael Michalsky. Jimi Blue Ochsenknecht There is no official ticket sale for the event.
