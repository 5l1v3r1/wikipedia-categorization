Three days later, on 4 June, seven of the above titles were burned in Stationers' Hall.

Weever is also the probable author of an anonymous pamphlet in 1601 entitled <i>The Whippinge of the Satyre</i>, which vindicates the decision of the bishops and attacks Edward Guilpin, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Marston_(poet)\" title=\"John Marston (poet)\">John Marston</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Jonson\" title=\"Ben Jonson\">Ben Jonson</a>.\n</p><p>The list of books is worded as follows (from Arber's translation):\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Satyres tearmed Halls Satyres, viz\u2019 Virgidemiarum, or his toothless or bitinge Satyres<br />\nPigmalion with certaine other Satyres<br />\nThe scourge of villanye<br />\nThe Shadowe of truthe in Epigrams and Satyres<br />\nSnarlinge Satyres<br />\nCaltha Poetarum<br />\nDavyes Epigrams, with marlowes Elegyes<br />\nThe booke againste woemen, viz\u2019; of miarriage and wyvinge<br />\nThe xv ioyes of marriage<br />\nThat noe Satyres or Epigramms be printed hereafter<br /> \nThat noe English historyes bee printed excepte they bee allowed by somme of her maiesties privie Counsell<br /> \nThat noe playes bee printed excepte they bee allowed by such as have auctoritie<br />\nThat all NASSHes bookes and Doctor HARVYes bookes be taken wheresouer they maye be found and that none of theire bookes bee euer printed hereafter<br />\nThat thoughe any booke of the nature of theise heretofore expressed shalbe broughte unto yow under the hands of the Lord Archbisshop of Canterburye or the Lord Bishop of London yet the said booke shall not bee printed until the master or wardens have acquainted the said lord Archbishop, or the Lord Bishop with the same, to knowe whether it be theire hand or no<br />\n\t\tJohn cantuar<br />\n\t\tRichard London<br />\nSuche bookes as can be found or are already taken of the Argumentes aforesaid or any of the bookes above expressed lett them bee presentlye broughte to the Bishop of London to be burnte<br />\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Theories_about_the_Ban\">Theories about the Ban</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bishops%27_Ban_of_1599&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Theories about the Ban\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is not entirely clear what reason or reasons prompted the ban and the subsequent book burning. Nevertheless, there are three general theories that attempt to explain the controversy.\n</p><p>The first of these supposes that the ban was simply a response to satirical writing that was getting out of hand.  Richard McCabe refers to the ban as an effort to target social critique that was \"too close to the truth for comfort.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> More recently, William Jones contends that the bishops' primary concern was the satirists' harsh, Juvenalian approach to social commentary. <sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This interpretation draws its force in part from the Bishops' sentence \"That noe <i>Satyres</i> or <i>Epigrams</i> be printed hereafter.\" However, though many of the books in question fit the generic category of \"satire,\" the Bishops' Ban problematically also limits the printing of some \"English histories\" and \"playes\", which may themselves be satiric.  \n</p><p>An alternative theory on the event supposes that Archbishop Whitgift engineered the ban specifically to protect his friend, the <a href=\"/wiki/Earl_of_Essex\" title=\"Earl of Essex\">Earl of Essex</a>, from political satire. <sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> This nuanced, political interpretation points out that Essex's failure during a military campaign in Ireland had recently captured the attention of the English public, and figures that the banned books seize upon this controversy. Because <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Tofte\" title=\"Robert Tofte\">Robert Tofte</a>'s <i>Of Mariage and Wiving</i> and the anonymous <i>xv ioyes of marriage</i> are literary translations that do not directly relate to England's contemporary political climate, some scholars suppose that the anti-marriage rhetoric of these two books was perceived as sedition against <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elizabeth I\">Elizabeth I</a>. <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A third explanation for the ban reasons that the bishops were reacting specifically to the malicious and pornographic content in the books, as opposed to their generic or political implications. Charles Gillett argues that the seven books were burned \"because of their offence against morality.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Lynda Boose has claimed further that the bishops \"attempted to cut off the hostile, malcontented political aggressions of the violently sexualized discourse they heard in these new hybrid literary constructions.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bishops%27_Ban_of_1599&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> Debora Shuger, \"Civility and Censorship in Early Modern England,\" in <i>Censorship and Silencing: Practices of Cultural Regulation</i>, ed.
