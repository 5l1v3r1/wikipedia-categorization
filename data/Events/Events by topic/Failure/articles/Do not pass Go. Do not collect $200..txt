"Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200" is a phrase used in the Monopoly board game that has become widely used in popular culture to describe an action forced upon a person that has only negative results.   The phrase comes from Monopoly, which has decks of cards called Chance and Community Chest which a player must draw from if they land on specific spaces. Each deck has a card that reads "GO TO JAIL: Go directly to Jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200."  Early in the game, going to jail usually hurts a player as it prevents them from moving, which regularly leads to earning $200 from passing Go, and from landing on and buying property, though in the later game, jail prevents them from landing on others' developed property and having to pay rent. The cited phrase, "Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200", distinguishes the effect from other cards that move players; other cards use the phrasing "Advance to [a particular location]", which does allow the player to collect $200 if they pass Go during the advance. The phrase is used in popular culture to denote a situation in which there is only one immediate, highly unfavorable, irreversible outcome and has been described as a "harsh cliche".    It has also been used in the sense of omitting intermediate tasks while performing an activity.
