The Museum of Failure  is a collection of failed products and services. The museum showcases failures to provide visitors a learning experience about the important role of failure for innovation and to encourage organizations to become better at learning from failure. The exhibition opened on June 7, 2017 in Helsingborg, Sweden.  The exhibit is scheduled to re-open at Dunkers Kulturhus June 2, 2018.  A temporary exhibit opened in Los Angeles in December 2017.  The Los Angeles museum is on Hollywood Blvd in the Hollywood & Highland Center.  The growing collection consists of over seventy failed products and services from around the world. Every item provides insight into the risky business of innovation. Some examples of the items on display: Apple Newton, Bic for Her, Google Glass, N-Gage, lobotomy instruments, Harley-Davidson Cologne, Kodak DC-40, Sony Betamax, Lego Fiber Optics, and Paolo Macchiarini's infamous plastic trachea. The museum has received international attention for its unusual collection.     The concept of the museum was inspired by a 2016 visit to Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia.  Museum founder Samuel West reportedly registered a domain name for the museum, and later realized he had misspelled the word "museum".  The museum was partially funded by the Swedish Innovation Authority (Vinnova).
