The Jersey International Air Display is an air show which is held every year on the island of Jersey, in the Channel Islands. It normally consists of one air display and two static displays - one at the airport and one in a park in St. Helier. It is a non-profit making event, and relies upon sponsorship and government funding.  The main display can be watched by the public, free of charge. Some of the aircraft carry out displays over Guernsey, as part of the Guernsey Air Display (formerly the Guernsey Battle of Britain Air Display), on the same day.  Regular performers include the Red Arrows, RAF Falcons parachute display team, and the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.  Notable appearances include; In 1997, Mike Higgins became the display organiser.  In 2009, HMS Ocean (L12) was present, and participated in the event.  The 2011 air display was canceled, due to poor visibility, shortly before it was due to start.  Most aircraft which were due to take part had already arrived on the island.
