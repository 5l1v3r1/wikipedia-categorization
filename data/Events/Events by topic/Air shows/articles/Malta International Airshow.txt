 The Malta International Airshow is an annual air show held at the Malta International Airport organized by the Malta Aviation Society.  It was first held in September 1993 over Marsamxett Harbour,  but then moved to Malta International Airport with the exception of the years 2007 and 2009. During these years, the event was held at St. Paul's Bay due to the construction of new hangars at the airport, where cranes would have been a hazard for the low flying aircraft.
