  U.S. Secretary of State U.S. Senator from New York First Lady of the United States  Most Democratic voters supported Hillary Clinton,   but some traditionally Democratic counties in the Rust Belt voted for Donald Trump. One reason given for Trump winning counties in Eastern Ohio in the Ohio Republican primary, 2016 was Democratic voters opposed to free trade who had voted in the Republican primary.  In general CNN exit polls showed Ohio Democratic voters with slightly less support for Clinton than the national average,  and Trump receiving higher support among Democratic voters in Ohio than Romney had in 2012.  Hillary Clinton had relatively low support in Appalachia from Democratic voters. In interviews with The Guardian, Appalachian Democrats voting for Trump cited concerns about NAFTA and coal-mining.  An exit poll showed Donald Trump receiving 22% of the Democratic vote in Kentucky,  a state Clinton had won overwhelmingly in the Kentucky Democratic primary, 2008.  Elliott County, Kentucky, which had the longest unbroken streak of voting Democrat of any county in the United States, went for Trump.  Some Appalachian states, such as Tennessee and West Virginia, did not have exit polls.    Overall CNN exit polls indicated Clinton received 89% of the Democratic vote,  compared with House Democrats receiving 92% of the Democratic vote.  The difference between percentage of Republicans voting for a Republican representative and voting for Trump was six points.  The Democrats who voted for Trump have been labelled "Trumpocrats".   There were also Democratic voters who favored Jill Stein. In Oregon, Stein received one percent of the Democratic vote according to CNN exit polls,  equal to the total for all third-party voting among Democrats in 2012.  This list also includes people who left the Democratic Party in 2016.
