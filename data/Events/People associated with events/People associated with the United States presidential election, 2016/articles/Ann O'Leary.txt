In an August 2000 memo to Bill Clinton's Domestic Policy Adviser Bruce Reed, O'Leary urged the government to consider an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, similar to one issued in 1941 by President Franklin D.

O'Leary also helped run the initiative, which addressed early childhood health and education.  During the 2016 campaign, O'Leary worked as an advisor to Hillary Clinton on health and education.   For her role in the campaign, Politico Magazine named O'Leary to its 2015 "Politico 50," its list of people transforming American politics in 2015.  In August 2016, O'Leary joined Clinton's planned transition team in Washington, D.C,   becoming the coâ€“executive director.
