Chung Yoo-ra (born Chung Yoo-yeon, 30 October 1996) is a South Korean equestrian.  She competed in the 2014 Asian Games, where her team won a gold medal.  She is a daughter of Chung Yoon-hoi and his ex-wife Choi Soon-sil,   who has been arrested amid the 2016 South Korean political scandal for using her friendship with the president Park Geun-hye to illegally interfere in the state affairs, and solicit business donations from top South Korean firms, including Samsung, for a non-profit fund she controlled.  During the investigations of the 2016 South Korean political scandal, Chung Yoo-ra's admission to Ewha Womans University was cancelled due to "preferential treatment in admissions and grading".    Her high school diploma has been cancelled as well due to falsified high school records.  In December 2016, South Korea put out an arrest warrant for Chung Yoo-ra for charges including obstruction of justice, after she refused to return from Germany to attend a parliamentary inquiry into her role in the scandal.  The South Korean government announced that it would invalidate her passport and seek her arrest and extradition from Germany.  The South Korean government also sought the help of Interpol to track her down.  On January 1, 2017, she was arrested in Aalborg, Denmark after a tip from South Korean journalists who had tracked her.   The German Federal Police are investigating Chung Yoo-ra and her mother for money laundering involving assets estimated at more than 1 billion US dollars.
