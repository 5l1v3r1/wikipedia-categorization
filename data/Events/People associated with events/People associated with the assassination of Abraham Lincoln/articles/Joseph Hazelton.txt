Joseph H. Hazelton (ca. 1853 â€“ October 8, 1936), aka Joseph Hazleton, was an American stage and film actor. He appeared in 30 films between 1912 and 1922. As a boy program giver at Ford's Theatre, he witnessed the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. In 1933, Hazelton gave a lecture at May Company Exposition Hall in Los Angeles and talked about watching Booth shoot Lincoln.  An article in Good Housekeeping in its February 1927 edition, titled "This Man Saw Lincoln Shot," was the basis for a leaflet that Hazleton released to raise funds later in his life.  Hazelton died in Los Angeles, California.
