Pumphrey's stable was located near the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Hotel_(Washington,_D.C.)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)

Booth had been hiring one particular horse, which he preferred, from Pumphrey.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On April 14, 1865, after learning that Lincoln would attend that evening's performance of the play <i><a href=\"/wiki/Our_American_Cousin\" title=\"Our American Cousin\">Our American Cousin</a></i>,  Booth went directly from <a href=\"/wiki/Ford%27s_Theatre\" title=\"Ford&#39;s Theatre\">Ford's Theatre</a> to Pumphrey's livery stable to make arrangements for procuring a horse.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Pumphrey informed Booth that the horse he usually hired was unavailable.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, Booth hired a different one, a swift little <a href=\"/wiki/Bay_(horse)\" title=\"Bay (horse)\">bay</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Mare\" title=\"Mare\">mare</a> with a white star on her forehead and a black tail and mane.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\nBooth told Pumphrey that he would be back to get it at around four o'clock that afternoon.\n</p><p>At the hour agreed upon, Booth arrived at the stable.

He added that he planned afterwards to stop for a drink and then take a leisurely ride.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Booth did write a letter, but not at Grover's Theatre.  He wrote the letter at the National Hotel; it was written to the editor of a Washington D.C. newspaper called the <i>National Intelligencer</i>. In the letter, he explained that his plans had changed from kidnapping Lincoln to assassinating him. In addition to signing his own name, he also added those of his co-conspirators: <a href=\"/wiki/Lewis_Powell_(assassin)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lewis Powell (assassin)\">Lewis Powell</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/George_Atzerodt\" title=\"George Atzerodt\">George Atzerodt</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/David_Herold\" title=\"David Herold\">David Herold</a>. Later, Booth did get a drink at <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Taltavull\" title=\"Peter Taltavull\">Peter Taltavull</a>'s Star Saloon located next to Ford's Theatre, but he definitely did not go on a pleasure ride. Instead, Booth approached <a href=\"/wiki/Edmund_Spangler\" title=\"Edmund Spangler\">Edmund Spangler</a>, an acquaintance and stage hand at Ford's Theatre, with the request to hold the reins of the skittish mare that he hired, while he briefly attended to some business within the theater. This business was murdering Lincoln.\n</p><p>After the assassination, Booth and Herold made good an escape to Virginia.  Prior to crossing the Potomac River and while hiding out in some woods, Herold killed Pumphrey's horse along with his own because the horses were no longer needed.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Temporary_imprisonment\">Temporary imprisonment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=James_W._Pumphrey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Temporary imprisonment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the turmoil that followed Lincoln's assassination, scores of suspected accomplices were arrested and thrown into prison by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War\" title=\"United States Secretary of War\">United States Secretary of War</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Edwin_M._Stanton\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Edwin M.

Pumphrey, having supplied the get away horse, was jailed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  Ultimately, the suspects were narrowed down to a group of eight prisoners\u2014seven men and one woman\u2014and, along with many others, Pumphrey was released.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On May 15, 1865, Pumphrey testified for the Prosecution and described the horse he provided to Booth and the details of how that transaction came about.\n</p><p>Pumphrey's last part in the events surrounding the assassination was to wait mounted on his horse for hours outside the <a href=\"/wiki/Fort_Lesley_J._McNair\" title=\"Fort Lesley J.

While Pumphrey regarded Mrs. Surratt as wholly innocent and exhibited the deepest sympathy for her, no reprieve was to come.

Pumphrey, long a prominent and active businessman of Washington, died this morning at 8:50 o'clock at his residence 477 C Street after a short illness. Mr. Pumphrey was a native of Washington, born here September 12, 1832, and lived here all his life. He was connected with the livery business for many years and an important incident in his career for which he was in no way responsible, was the circumstance that from his stables on C Street, N.W., John Wilkes Booth rented a horse prior to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and on which he afterward escaped into <a href=\"/wiki/Maryland\" title=\"Maryland\">Maryland</a> where he met his death. The spurs which John Wilkes Booth wore on this expedition were borrowed from Mr. Pumphrey, although the latter had no knowledge of the purpose for which the assassin intended to employ them. For some time after this tragic event, Mr. Pumphrey was under surveillance and was not relieved until after the trial and conviction of the parties who were accused of association with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination. At the end of these trying times, Mr. Pumphrey who had already been acquitted by the courts was also acquitted in popular estimation and continued for many years in his original business. He was active, energetic and very charitable in each and every walk of life. He had during life many friends which he continued to hold until his end.\n</p><p>While Mr. Pumphrey was identified in a striking manner with the great closing tragedy of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">Civil War</a>, he always held, and his views were believed, that the idea of assassination arose in the mind of Booth alone, and that all of the others who were accused of participation in that sad event were influenced by that peculiar and erratic character. He exhibited the deepest sympathy for <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Surratt\" title=\"Mary Surratt\">Mrs. Surratt</a> whom he regarded as wholly innocent of participation and it is said he sat mounted on his horse for hours waiting in the hope of having the privilege of carrying President <a href=\"/wiki/Andrew_Johnson\" title=\"Andrew Johnson\">Andrew Johnson</a>'s reprieve to Mrs. Surratt then imprisoned and afterward executed at the arsenal in this city.\n</p><p>Mr. Pumphrey often told his friends that his only connection with the Lincoln conspiracy was that he lost his horse. Booth had taken from the Pumphrey Stables the horse which was afterward killed by Herold, Booth's companion after escaping into Maryland to avoid detection and capture. Mr. Pumphrey was for some time under arrest, in common with almost everybody that knew anything about or had any possible connection with this incident of American history but as stated he was at the time and has since been absolved of all connection with that lamentable affair.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=James_W._Pumphrey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"Portals\" class=\"noprint portal plainlist tright\" style=\"margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em;border:solid #aaa 1px\">\n<ul style=\"display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold\">\n<li style=\"display:table-row\"><span style=\"display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png/29px-United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png\" width=\"29\" height=\"28\" class=\"noviewer thumbborder\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png/43px-United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png/57px-United_states_confederate_flag_hybrid.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"213\" data-file-height=\"209\" /></span><span style=\"display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle\"><a href=\"/wiki/Portal:American_Civil_War\" title=\"Portal:American Civil War\">American Civil War portal</a></span></li></ul></div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_assassination\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abraham Lincoln assassination\">Abraham Lincoln assassination</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=James_W._Pumphrey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kauffman. <i>American Brutus</i>.
