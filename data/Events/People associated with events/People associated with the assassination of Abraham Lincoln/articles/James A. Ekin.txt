James Adams Ekin (August 31, 1819–March 27, 1891) was a Union Army officer in the American Civil War. He achieved fame as a member of the military commission trying the conspirators involved with the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Ekin was born August 31, 1819 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to James and Susan Burling (Bayard) Ekin.  His mother was a daughter of Colonel Stephen A. Bayard of the Continental Army.  He served an apprenticeship as a steamboat builder, which eventually led to his first career as a steamboat builder in Pittsburgh. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Ekin enlisted April 25, 1861 in the 12th Pennsylvania Infantry (a 3-month regiment) as a lieutenant and was assigned regimental quartermaster.  Ekin mustered out with the regiment on August 5, 1861 at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  He was subsequently promoted captain and assistant quartermaster August 7, 1861 and served in the Quartermaster's Department.

In addition to his volunteer ranks, Ekin was made a captain in the regular army March 13, 1863, lieutenant colonel and deputy quartermaster general July 29, 1865. Despite his excellent service in the Army quartermaster department, Ekin is remembered largely for his participation as a member of the military tribunal that heard the case against eight conspirators in the assassination of President Lincoln.
