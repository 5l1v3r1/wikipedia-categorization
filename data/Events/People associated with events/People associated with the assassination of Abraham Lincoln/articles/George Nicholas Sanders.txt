George Nicholas Sanders (February 22, 1812 â€“ August 13, 1873) was a former official of the United States who was believed to have some involvement in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  Sanders was born in Lexington, Kentucky.  His father was Lewis Sanders, and his mother was Ann Nicholas. During his early career he was involved in breeding cattle and race horses.  Sanders later moved to New York and married Anna Reid in 1836.  He was involved in the Young America Movement and was an editor for the "Democratic Review." Sanders was a supporter of President James K. Polk and was later awarded the position of Consul in London.  He became involved in what, at the time, were regarded as revolutionary and anarchist causes and needed to be recalled.  He had supposedly been involved in plans to assassinate heads of state or foment causes to bring about democratic reform.  During the Civil War, he was involved in activities in Montreal that were supposed to support the Confederacy by unorthodox means.  He had also made several trips to Europe to further the cause of the Southern States. After the assassination of Lincoln, attempts were made to take Sanders into custody, but he fled to Canada and Europe.  He later returned to the United States soon before he died in 1873 in New York.  He is buried in an unmarked grave in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.
