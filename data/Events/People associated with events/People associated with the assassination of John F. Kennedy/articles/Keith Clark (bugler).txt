Keith Collar Clark (November 21, 1927 â€“ January 10, 2002)  was a bugler in the United States Army who played the call "Taps" at the funeral of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. He fluffed the sixth note, and to many this mistake was a poignant symbol of the American nation in mourning.   The bugle that Clark used is on display at the welcome center of Arlington National Cemetery. As lead bugler of the United States Army Band when Kennedy was assassinated, Clark was assigned the task of playing Taps at the president's funeral.  On the day of the funeral, Clark stood in the rain for three hours before it was time for him to play.  At 3:08 PM, after the 21 gun salute, Clark started to play Taps, and fluffed the sixth note.   After the funeral, many assumed the mistake was intentional.
