Richard Case Nagell (August 5, 1930 â€“ November 1, 1995) is a former United States military officer who, according to Dick Russell's biography of him, claimed to have had foreknowledge of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  According to Russell, Nagell also claimed to have gotten himself arrested in a bank shooting weeks before the assassination to avoid becoming a patsy.  Nagell met with New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who at the time was investigating Clay Shaw's possible complicity in the assassination.  Nagell died from heart disease on November 1, 1995 in Los Angeles, California, one day after the Assassination Records Review Board had sent him a letter for information.   He was 65 years old at the time of his death.
