The judge <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_James_Whitelocke\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir James Whitelocke\">Sir James Whitelocke</a> was a younger brother. After being educated at <a href=\"/wiki/Merchant_Taylors%27_School,_Northwood\" title=\"Merchant Taylors&#39; School, Northwood\">Merchant Taylors' School</a> under <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Mulcaster\" title=\"Richard Mulcaster\">Richard Mulcaster</a>, he was sent to <a href=\"/wiki/Christ%27s_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Christ&#39;s College, Cambridge\">Christ's College, Cambridge</a>, where he matriculated as a pensioner in November 1581, and graduated B.A. in 1585.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> His brother attests that he studied law at <a href=\"/wiki/Lincoln%27s_Inn\" title=\"Lincoln&#39;s Inn\">Lincoln's Inn</a>.\n</p><p>At Whitsuntide 1587 Whitelocke left London on a foreign tour. He visited universities in Germany, Italy, and France. Subsequently, he obtained a commission as captain of a troop of infantry from the governor of <a href=\"/wiki/Provence\" title=\"Provence\">Provence</a> (M. Desguieres), and was stationed successively at <a href=\"/wiki/Marseilles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marseilles\">Marseilles</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Grenoble\" title=\"Grenoble\">Grenoble</a>; he saw some active service during the civil wars in France. He returned to England in 1599, was in attendance at Elizabeth's court, and won a reputation for profuse display and dissolute living.\n</p><p>He was on terms of close intimacy with many of the younger nobility, including <a href=\"/wiki/Roger_Manners,_5th_Earl_of_Rutland\" title=\"Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland\">Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland</a>, and other followers of <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Devereux,_2nd_Earl_of_Essex\" title=\"Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex\">Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex</a>. Rutland invited him to visit Essex's house in London on 30 Jan. 1601, the day fixed for the Earl of Essex's insurrection. He remained in the house only a few minutes, but he incurred a suspicion of disloyalty. He was arrested as an abettor of Essex's rebellion, and was indicted of high treason, but, though brought before the <a href=\"/wiki/Court_of_king%27s_bench\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Court of king&#39;s bench\">court of king's bench</a>, was not tried, but allowed to go on parole before he obtained a final discharge. Subsequently, he came to know <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Percy,_9th_Earl_of_Northumberland\" title=\"Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland\">Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland</a>, whom he  supported in his quarrel with Sir Francis Vere in 1602. A challenge which Whitelocke carried from the earl to Sir Francis led to the issue of a warrant by the privy council for his arrest; but Whitelocke went into hiding, and escaped capture for the time.\n</p><p>He happened, however, to dine with the Earl of Northumberland and his kinsman <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Percy_(plotter)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thomas Percy (plotter)\">Thomas Percy</a> on 4 November 1605, the day before the <a href=\"/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot\" title=\"Gunpowder Plot\">Gunpowder Plot</a>. Suspicion again fell on Whitelocke, and, with his host, suffered a long imprisonment in the <a href=\"/wiki/Tower_of_London\" title=\"Tower of London\">Tower of London</a>. No evidence was produced against him, and he was released without trial. While a prisoner in the Tower he spent much time with Northumberland, who granted him a pension. Another of Whitelocke's friends was <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Radcliffe,_5th_Earl_of_Sussex\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert Radcliffe, 5th Earl of Sussex\">Robert Radcliffe, 5th Earl of Sussex</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/John_Manningham\" title=\"John Manningham\">John Manningham</a> the diarist attributes to Whitelocke's influence Radcliffe's neglect of his wife. Whitelocke was on a visit to the Earl of Sussex at <a href=\"/wiki/Palace_of_Beaulieu\" title=\"Palace of Beaulieu\">Newhall, Essex</a> in the autumn of 1608 when he was taken ill and died. He was buried in the family tomb of his host at <a href=\"/wiki/Boreham\" title=\"Boreham\">Boreham</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Whitelocke&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFACADWHTK580E\" class=\"citation encyclopaedia\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search-2016.pl?sur=&amp;suro=w&amp;fir=&amp;firo=c&amp;cit=&amp;cito=c&amp;c=all&amp;z=all&amp;tex=WHTK580E&amp;sye=&amp;eye=&amp;col=all&amp;maxcount=50\">\"Whitelock, Edmund ('Edw.')
