  Sadanand Date is an officer of 1990 batch of Indian Police Service (IPS). He has held several important posts at both state and national levels of the IPS, including serving as deputy inspector general of police in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). He gained a doctorate from Pune University (in his home town), having previously done postgraduate work in commerce. Date is also a qualified cost and management accountant. He attended the University of Minnesota under the Humphrey fellowship program, where he studied the theoretical and practical aspects of controlling white-collar and organized crime in the United States. On his return to India he was posted as additional commissioner of police (economic offences wing).  He was awarded the President's medal in 2007. Date attracted international attention during the November 2008 Mumbai attacks because of his actions resisting terrorists at the Cama and Albless Hospital for women and children, where he was seriously wounded. Responding to Date's call to Police Headquarters for backup, Ashok Kamte, Hemant Karkare, Vijay Salaskar and four constables were ambushed en route by two terrorists. The three officers and three constables were killed quickly; the surviving constable reported the events to representatives of the press. The wounded Date was eventually successfully evacuated for medical attention.
