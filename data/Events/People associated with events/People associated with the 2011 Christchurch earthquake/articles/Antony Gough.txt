Antony Thomas Gough is a New Zealand businessman and property developer, who was born and raised in Christchurch. Considered to be one of the city's most influential businessmen, he is developer of The Terrace, a major commercial development in Christchurch's retail district and part of the city's reconstruction programme following the 2011 earthquake.   Gough is a son of Owen Tracy Gough. His siblings are his twin-sister Avenal, and brothers Harcourt and Tracy. The four children are beneficiaries of the O T Gough Trust.  Their grandfather was Tracy Thomas Gough, who founded Gough, Gough and Hamer.  Tracy Thomas Gough was married twice, with Owen Tracy Gough his only son from the first marriage, and Blair Gough the only offspring from the second marriage.  The assets of this second marriage are in the B T Gough Trust, with Ben Gough and Gina Satterthwaite, the children of Blair Gough, the beneficiaries.  Gough was educated at Christ's College from 1962 to 1966.  He and his three siblings are part-owners of Gough Holdings Ltd, previously known as Gough, Gough and Hamer. The company supplies heavy equipment for the mining, forestry, transport and power industries in Australasia and employs 950 staff.  In 2013, an attempt of the B T Gough Trust to obtain a controlling stake of Gough Holdings Ltd through gaining shareholding of the O T Gough Trust went to the High Court.  The National Business Review estimates the value of the Gough family at NZ$300m.  The Gough family owned Shand's Emporium in Hereford Street, the oldest commercial building in the Christchurch Central City, since circa 1940. Gough gave away the Category I heritage building for $1 and it was transported to a new site in Manchester Street, as it was in the way of The Terrace development.    Gough graduated from the University of Canterbury with a Bachelor of Science in 1970 with honours in nuclear science,  and was awarded an honorary doctorate in commerce in April 2014 from the same institution.
