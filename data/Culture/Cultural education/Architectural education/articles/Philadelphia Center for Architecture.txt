The Philadelphia Center for Architecture is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2002  by the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The Center opened a physical space on the ground floor of the Smyth Young Field Company Building in  2008.   The building, at 1218 Arch Street, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The Center serves as a venue for public programs on architecture, urban planning, and design, including various competitions and exhibitions, as well as home to offices for AIA Philadelphia, the Community Design Collaborative, and the AIA Bookstore.    AIA Philadelphia is the second oldest Chapter of the AIA and a nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(6) status, designating it as a professional membership organization. The American Institute of Architects was founded in 1857, and the Philadelphia chapter received its charter in 1869. The Chapter includes members from Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester and Montgomery Counties.  AIA Philadelphia has a history of community engagement.  Activities include helping to create Independence National Historical Park, the Charter High School for Architecture + Design, the Community Design Collaborative, and the Philadelphia Center for Architecture.  John Claypool became Executive Director of AIA Philadelphia in 2001.  Under his leadership, the Philadelphia Center for Architecture was established as a separate nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(3) status, designating it as an educational non-profit. Its purpose was to support charitable and educational initiatives to benefit the community at large, on behalf of the architectural profession.  It developed programs in the community.  The Center soon took advantage of the opportunity to create a physical space as well as providing a set of programs.  The Center at 1218 Arch Street opened in 2008.  In 2009 the Chapter and Center boards created a framework to coordinate the two organizations.  The Chapter board holds the authority for annually appointing the Board of the Center. The Center's mission involves engaging "the public, decision leaders, thought leaders, and allied design professionals" on issues related to design and architecture, to recognize and enhance the quality of architecture in the region,  distinct from AIA Philadelphia's mission to provide architects with "opportunities for professional development, service, and collegiality among peers".  John Claypool served as executive director of both AIA Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Center for Architecture from 2001 to 2014, when he was succeeded by Rebecca Johnson.    David Bender was hired as the sole full-time employee of the center when their doors opened in May 2008 and has served as associate director of the center since January 2014.  Hilary Jay became the first director of the Philadelphia Center for Architecture in June 2013,   remaining there until May 2015.   The center's signature event, DesignPhiladelphia, was begun by Hilary Jay in 2005. She was inspired by one of the first design festivals, in London.  DesignPhiladelphia moved with Jay from the Design Center at Philadelphia University in 2005, to the University of the Arts in 2010, and finally to the Philadelphia Center for Architecture in 2013, where it remains.  The center produces a variety of annual and ongoing programs for the general public on the topics of architecture, urban planning, and design,  including: The center hosts annual and ongoing exhibitions,  including: Coordinates: 39°57′14″N 75°09′37″W﻿ / ﻿39.9538°N 75.1604°W﻿ / 39.9538; -75.1604
