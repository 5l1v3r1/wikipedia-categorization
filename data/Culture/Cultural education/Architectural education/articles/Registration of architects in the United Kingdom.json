The words in the current Act follow those of the 1938 Architects Registration Act under which it was decided that the use of the suffix \"FRIBA\" in business notepaper constituted an infringement.\n</p><p>By subsection 20(3) corporate bodies, firms or partnerships can carry on business under a name, style or title containing the word \"architect\" provided that (in broad terms) the architectural business is run by a registered person.

The result was that Parliament, as the legislator and guided by the government of the day, has had to maintain a state of benevolent neutrality among the holders of these contending views, consistent with more general public policies for business competition, employment, professional education and so on. In relation to statutory protection of title, three aspects of the field in which architects practise invite examination. In summary:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>The design quality of the built environment</i>: this is essentially a cultural concern which was and remains one of the principal reasons for the formation and continuance of the Royal Institute of British Architects as a chartered body. It has connotations not only for the United Kingdom but world wide. It is beyond the ambit of statutory protection of title.</li>\n<li><i>The technical sufficiency of buildings</i>: the public interest is secured in the United Kingdom under Building Regulations and other enactments. This too is beyond the statutory protection of the title \"architect\".</li>\n<li><i>The business of architectural practice</i>: contracts of engagement for professional services are always between a business entity (whether individual, firm, partnership, or company) and the client, and are governed by the general law, including consumer protection legislation where applicable. Protection of the title \u2018architect\u2019 for business entities is of no practical relevance for securing the performance of architectural services.</li></ul>\n<p>In the light of experience since the inception of the Register under the 1931 Act, and more particularly under the Architects Registration Board\u2019s regime from 1997, the recurring question has been whether protection of title serves useful purposes in respect of the three aspects mentioned above. The question of obsolescence has been further intensified by the <a href=\"/wiki/Directive_2005/29/EC_The_Unfair_Commercial_Practices_Directive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\">EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive</a>, effective from 2007.\n</p><p>Statutory registration had its origin within the architectural profession in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was then (as now) a matter of controversy. However, by 1905 the <a href=\"/wiki/RIBA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"RIBA\">RIBA</a> had established a policy to secure satisfactory training of architects by statutory means.\n</p><p>The basis of the policy (on registration) had always been that the profession was governed by voluntary associations of practising architects and that the profession would retain control of registration. This was reflected in the composition of the registration body (the <a href=\"/wiki/Architects%27_Registration_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Architects&#39; Registration Council of the United Kingdom\">Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom</a> - <a href=\"/wiki/ARCUK\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ARCUK\">ARCUK</a>) established by the 1931 Act. Shortly after, in the book published on occasion of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> in the concluding paragraphs of the chapter on statutory registration.,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Harry Barnes FRIBA., Chairman of the Registration Committee, wrote -\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>\" ...

Opinion within the profession was divided among those who held that statutory registration should be discontinued altogether and those who held that the registration body should be reconstituted.\n</p><p>In the event the body was reconstituted as the Architects Registration Board (1996/1997 Acts). But it was only after the event that many in the profession came to appreciate the effect of the new requirement that the majority of the Board should be non-architects and appointed by the government, as the following quotation shows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"<i>Crucially, professional control of the Register was taken away by the government's decision which was realised in the 1996/97 Act.

That is partly due to its conciseness, but this quality makes it all the more necessary to remember that the Act must be read as a whole to ascertain the meaning and effect of its various parts. Care is needed not to read into it what is not there (whatever conventional wisdom may have supposed or desired), and not to fail to notice what actually is there. In particular, like many such Acts, it can be better understood by looking at its beginning (Arrangement of Sections and long title) and its end (derivations), as well as the operative part in between.\n</p><p>Its long title is \"An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects\". The Table of Derivations printed at the end lists the enactments which it consolidated; and Schedule 3 lists the originating and two amending Acts which it repealed, namely: the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Architects Registration Act 1938 and parts of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.\n</p><p>The unbroken continuity of these enactments is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>\"the Council\" means the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.</i></dd></dl>\n<p>The changes made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act as amended can be deduced from the Table of Derivations. This also shows that, for the purpose of the consolidation, certain definitions were inserted in the \"Interpretation\" section. These included one to make clear that where there is a reference to \"unacceptable professional conduct\", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not vice versa). In subsection 14(1) the phrase is expanded as: \"conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person\".\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_.22burdens.22_and_.22choices.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_&quot;burdens&quot;_and_&quot;choices&quot;\">The \"burdens\" and \"choices\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Registration_of_architects_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: The &quot;burdens&quot; and &quot;choices&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The scheme of the consolidation Act of 1997 is identical with that of the originating Act of 1931, as amended. It is as follows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>It operates by imposing (under Part IV) one kind of burden, backed by threat of penal sanction, on persons carrying on business in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> generally, but at the same time giving to one particular group of persons a statutory right to choose instead to submit to another kind of burden, and to another group of persons the statutory right to choose to submit to a third kind of burden.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Here, the first is described as the \"general burden\"; the other two as the \"voluntary burdens\"; and the freedom to choose the \"statutory choices\".\n</p><p>The general burden is a prohibition imposed on all persons, firms, partnerships and bodies corporate carrying on business in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a>, including architects and <a href=\"/wiki/Chartered_architect\" title=\"Chartered architect\">Chartered Architects</a>. The prohibition is against practising or carrying on business under the title of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Architect\" title=\"Architect\">architect</a>\", with two exceptions, viz.:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of an individual, s/he has opted for one of the voluntary burdens and is registered or enrolled under the Act.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of a business entity (body corporate, firm or partnership) it has opted for the other of the voluntary burdens, in that its business so far as it relates to architecture satisfies the statutory requirement to be under the control, management and supervision of a registered person.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<p>Here, the first of these is described as a \"practice volunteer\", and the second as a \"business volunteer\".\n</p><p>The statutory choice is exercisable:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of a practice volunteer, by applying for registration in the <a href=\"/wiki/Register_of_Architects\" title=\"Register of Architects\">Register of Architects</a> and paying the annual retention fee (under sections 4 to 11), or by enrolling in the statutory list of visiting EEA architects (under section 12).</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of a business volunteer, by complying with the control, management and supervision requirements (of subsection 20(3)).</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<p>The voluntary burdens which result from the exercise of the statutory choice are as follows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of a registered person, to submit to the regime imposed on registered persons under sections 4 to 11 of Part II (payment of fees and satisfying requirements about qualifications and competence) and Part III \u2013 Discipline.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of a person enrolled in the list of visiting EEA architects, to submit to the regime of section 12 and of Part III \u2013 Discipline.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>In the case of a business volunteer, to submit to the regime for control, management and supervision imposed by subsection 20(3) and be liable to supply the Board with information showing compliance.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<p>In consequence:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>any person or business entity is free to supply services of the same kind as a registered person, but may only use the title \"<a href=\"/wiki/Architect\" title=\"Architect\">architect</a>\" in this connection subject to one of the voluntary burdens; and</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>a <a href=\"/wiki/Chartered_architect\" title=\"Chartered architect\">Chartered Architect</a> may only use this title in the course of professional practice if s/he has opted to submit to one of the voluntary burdens, normally as a registered person.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Side_effects\">Side effects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Registration_of_architects_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Side effects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A side effect of the Act is the imposition of burdens on third parties under Part II, namely, <a href=\"/wiki/Schools_of_Architecture,_Architects_(Registration)_Act,_1931\" title=\"Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931\">Schools of Architecture</a>, but the effect of the changes made by the 1996 Act is that Schools of Architecture have disappeared from the legislation without trace. The result has been a certain amount of wrangling between the Schools, the ARB and the RIBA which is the principal professional body, whose concerns inevitably include architectural education.\n</p><p>Another side effect has been a claim by the ARB to be able to impose on registered persons certain requirements about Professional Indemnity Insurance.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Board_and_its_duties\">The Board and its duties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Registration_of_architects_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: The Board and its duties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The membership of the Board is the result of one of the changes made by the 1996 Act to the registration body's previous constitution when its name had been the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. The Act abolished the <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_Architectural_Education\" title=\"Board of Architectural Education\">Board of Architectural Education</a>, renamed the Council as the Board, and made this Board consist predominantly of persons appointed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Privy Council of the United Kingdom\">Privy Council</a>.\n</p><p>Subsection 3(4) states \"The Board shall publish the current version of the Register annually...\". Provisions of Part II of the Act prescribe how the Register shall be kept up to date, and who shall be entitled to be registered; other provisions of Parts II and III prescribe for the Board the circumstances, events or conditions when a person's name shall be removed from the Register; and other provisions prescribe for the Board certain ancillary, or derivative and secondary, duties in connection with the Board's primary responsibility for the maintenance and regular publication of the <a href=\"/wiki/Register_of_Architects\" title=\"Register of Architects\">Register of Architects</a>.\n</p><p>Apart from officers, employees and agents of the Board, the Act creates no duties or obligations towards the Board which fall on any one else at all; and nothing in the Act itself creates any obligation which an architect owes to the Board.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Not_delegated\">Not delegated</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Registration_of_architects_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Not delegated\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Section 20 of the Architects Act 1997 mentions \"architecture\" (subsection (3)(b)) and the \"services\" of a person enrolled under the Act (subsection (5)). These are not defined by the Act, and it is quite obvious that <a href=\"/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Parliament of the United Kingdom\">Parliament</a> has not delegated to the Board the power to define them. In practice, as technology and the building process continue to evolve new specialisms, the concept of architecture can be seen as becoming ever more fluid, extensive and comprehensive, and at the same time becoming narrower while ever more ancillary specialities are identified.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Board.27s_Professional_Conduct_Committee\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Board's_Professional_Conduct_Committee\">The Board's Professional Conduct Committee</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Registration_of_architects_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: The Board&#039;s Professional Conduct Committee\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Sanctions are available to the Board under Part III of the Act against any person on the register who is found guilty under section 15 of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence, or else has been convicted with a criminal offence which has relevance to fitness to practise.\n</p><p>Although a criminal conviction is an objective criterion, no statutory definition is given that defines the level of professional conduct or incompetence that will attract a sanction, judgment in the matter being given to the Board's Professional Conduct Committee, subject to commonsense, reason and judicial review.\n</p><p>The PCC is constituted under the Act, Schedule 1 Part II, as amended. The Committee includes members of the Board, both elected and appointed, as well as persons appointed by the Board and nominees of the President of the Law Society. A bare quorum of the Committee meets for a disciplinary hearing, comprising a nominee of the President of the Law Society (invariably a <a href=\"/wiki/Solicitor\" title=\"Solicitor\">solicitor</a>), a person from the Register and another not on the Register.
