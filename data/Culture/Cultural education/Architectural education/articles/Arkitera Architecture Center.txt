The Arkitera Architecture Center is an independent architecture center based in Istanbul that has been dedicated to sustain a better architectural practice, enhance the architectural culture and to raise the quality of architecture in Turkey. The center has a different structure than those of the other centers on the world which are either supported by various funds that are reserved for NGOs or by governmental institutions. Arkitera works like an NGO that is not dependent on any institution. All the activities and events of the center are planned with regard to the needs and capacities of the architecture setting in Turkey. Arkitera Architecture Center started their first web publication Arkitera.com, on 9 October 2000 after several months of preparatory work. Following that, other publications and events were also initiated. Having supported several activities since the time it was founded, the center has collaborated with several firms, institutions and universities and has assigned the role of being a platform to discuss the problems of the built environment and the city. All the events and activities held are realized with the collaboration of various institutions and the sponsorship of several firms. The sponsorship of more than one firm enables the center to remain independent. Arkitera was awarded with the “Contribution to the Architectural Education” prize by the Turkish Freelance Architects Association (Turkiye Serbest Mimarlar Dernegi) in 2004.
