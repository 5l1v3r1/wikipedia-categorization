Aramaic studies is the study of the Aramaic language and Syriac Christianity. A specialist in Aramaic studies is known as a Aramaicist. British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by the designation Syriacist (a scholar of Syriac studies, at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside Assyrian, Syriac Christian and Maronite Christian communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between Aramaistik (Aramaic studies) and Neuaramaistik (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies). Aramaic studies is the term used at the University of Oxford and University of Leiden. At some other universities, Aramaic studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as Eastern Christianity at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, as Eastern Christianity at Duke University,  or as Semitic studies at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Most students learn the Aramaic language and Syriac language within a biblical studies program. Aramaic academic journals include the annual Aramaic Studies, a leading journal for Aramaic language and literature published by Brill Academic Publishers. The journal incorporates the previous Journal for the Aramaic Bible for a more inclusive scope, to include all aspects of Aramaic language and literature, even when not, or only indirectly, related to Biblical texts.
