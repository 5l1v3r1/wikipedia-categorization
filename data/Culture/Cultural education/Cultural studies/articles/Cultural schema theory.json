Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviours in familiar situations. Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000). Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000). Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same <a href=\"/wiki/Culture\" title=\"Culture\">culture</a> in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#How_cultural_schemas_develop\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">How cultural schemas develop</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Types_of_cultural_schemas_for_social_interactions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Types of cultural schemas for social interactions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Application_to_cross-cultural_adaptation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Application to cross-cultural adaptation</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Sojourners&#39;_axioms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sojourners' axioms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Real-world_example_\u2013_a_sojourner&#39;s_experience\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Real-world example \u2013 a sojourner's experience</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Contrasting_theory\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Contrasting theory</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Further_use_and_development_of_the_theory\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further use and development of the theory</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cultural_schema_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cultural schema theory may be a relatively new theory, but neither schema nor cultural schema are new concepts.\n</p><p>The idea of schemas existing as ideal types in the mind dates back all the way back to <a href=\"/wiki/Plato\" title=\"Plato\">Plato</a> (see also <a href=\"/wiki/Schema_(disambiguation)\" class=\"mw-redirect mw-disambig\" title=\"Schema (disambiguation)\">Schema</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Schema_(psychology)\" title=\"Schema (psychology)\">Schema (psychology)</a>) . In the 19th century German philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/Immanuel_Kant\" title=\"Immanuel Kant\">Immanuel Kant</a> developed the idea that every person's experiences are gathered in memory, forming higher order concepts. In the 1920s <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Piaget\" title=\"Jean Piaget\">Jean Piaget</a>'s work investigated schemas in infants. In the 1930s <a href=\"/wiki/Frederic_Bartlett\" title=\"Frederic Bartlett\">Frederic Bartlett</a> tested memory for schemas. From the 1970s to the 1990s, many researchers obtained loads of evidence showing that people's <a href=\"/wiki/Behaviors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Behaviors\">behaviors</a> are deeply embedded to what they store in their brains. Through these studies researchers learned that <a href=\"/wiki/Human_behavior\" title=\"Human behavior\">human behavior</a> relies heavily on past experiences and the <a href=\"/wiki/Knowledge\" title=\"Knowledge\">knowledge</a> stored in one's brain.\n</p><p>Research also revealed that schemas operate at many different levels. The experiences which are unique to individuals allow them to acquire personal schemas.  Societal schemas may emerge from a group's collective <a href=\"/wiki/Knowledge\" title=\"Knowledge\">knowledge</a> and are represented across the minds in a <a href=\"/wiki/Society\" title=\"Society\">society</a>, enabling people to think as if they are one mind (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002). However, when one's cultural environment provides experiences to which every member of that culture is exposed, their experiences allow every member to acquire cultural schemas (Nishida, 1999). Cultural schemas are <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conceptual\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:conceptual\">conceptual</a> structures which enable individuals to store perceptual and conceptual information about their <a href=\"/wiki/Culture\" title=\"Culture\">culture</a> and interpret cultural experiences and expressions. If people are not equipped with the appropriate cultural schema, they may not be able to make sense of culturally unfamiliar situations (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_cultural_schemas_develop\">How cultural schemas develop</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cultural_schema_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: How cultural schemas develop\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Unreferenced\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>does not <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\">cite</a> any <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">sources</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cultural_schema_theory&amp;action=edit\">improve this section</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.

Subsequent similar instances cause the cultural schema to become more organized, abstract, and compact. As this occurs, communication becomes much easier. Nishida (1999) simply explains that experience is the force which creates cultural schemas. As people have more experiences their developing cultural schemas become more tightly organized. The information not only becomes more complex, but more useful among members of a culture, alike or different. Beyond the <a href=\"/wiki/Cognitive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cognitive\">cognitive</a> activity of cultural schemas is the complex pattern which occurs in the <a href=\"/wiki/Brain\" title=\"Brain\">brain</a>.\n</p><p>When humans acquire and retain information from their surrounding environments, <a href=\"/wiki/Neural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neural\">neural</a> circuits are generated.

Simply put, cross-cultural adaptation is the transformation of a person's own PSI schemas into those of the host culture and acquisition of new PSI schemas in the host culture s/he is residing in. A number of different people may b e subject to cross-cultural adaptation, including <a href=\"/wiki/Immigrants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immigrants\">immigrants</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Refugees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Refugees\">refugees</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Business_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Business people\">business people</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Diplomats\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Diplomats\">diplomats</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Foreign_workers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Foreign workers\">foreign workers</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Students\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Students\">students</a>. However, this entry specifically applies cultural schema theory to <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sojourner\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:sojourner\">sojourners</a>' cross cultural adaptation. Sojourners generally spend a few years in another culture while intending to return to their home country.

For sojourner Gillian Gibbons' situation, the cultural schema theory is highly applicable. Ms. Gibbons, a <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">British</a> <a href=\"/wiki/School_teacher\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School teacher\">school teacher</a>, left <a href=\"/wiki/Liverpool,_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Liverpool, England\">Liverpool, England</a> in August 2007 to teach a group of six- and seven-year-olds at Unity School in <a href=\"/wiki/Khartoum,_Sudan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Khartoum, Sudan\">Khartoum, Sudan</a>. Shortly after her arrival, Ms. Gibbons class was due to study the habitat and behavior of bears. Upon her request, a student brought in a <a href=\"/wiki/Teddy_bear\" title=\"Teddy bear\">teddy bear</a> to serve as a case study. Students were invited to vote on a name for the bear. After considering the names <a href=\"/wiki/Abdullah_(name)\" title=\"Abdullah (name)\">Abdullah</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hassan_(name)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hassan (name)\">Hassan</a>, 20 of the 23 children voted in favor of the name <a href=\"/wiki/Muhammad\" title=\"Muhammad\">Muhammad</a>. What seemed like a harmless children's learning tool took a turn for the worse on November 25, 2007, when Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home inside the school premises; Sudanese police claimed a number of parents complained to Sudan's <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ministry_of_Education_(Sudan)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ministry of Education (Sudan) (page does not exist)\">Ministry of Education</a> about the bear. Charges against Ms. Gibbons were prepared under article 125 of Sudanese <a href=\"/wiki/Criminal_law\" title=\"Criminal law\">criminal law</a> which covers insults against faith and religions.  Ms Gibbons' particular crime: insulting Islam's <a href=\"/wiki/Prophet_Muhammad\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prophet Muhammad\">Prophet Muhammad</a>. In <a href=\"/wiki/Islam\" title=\"Islam\">Islam</a>, insulting the <a href=\"/wiki/Prophet_Muhammad\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prophet Muhammad\">Prophet Muhammad</a> is considered a grave offense.  Ms. Gibbons' was held in a <a href=\"/wiki/Khartoum\" title=\"Khartoum\">Khartoum</a> jail facing a maximum penalty of 40 lashes and 6 months in jail. Ms. Gibbons was found guilty of insulting Islam and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation from Sudan after her release. Sudanese President <a href=\"/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir\" title=\"Omar al-Bashir\">Omar al-Bashir</a> granted her a pardon after she served nine days in jail due to pressure from the British government. She immediately returned to <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">England</a> upon her release. While colleagues, friends, and family regarded the whole situation as a misunderstanding, many local Sudanese disagreed. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of the presidential palace to denounce Ms. Gibbons. Some protestors waved ceremonial swords, some voiced anger at the Sudanese government for not treating her more severely, some distributed leaflets which condemned her as an infidel and accused her of polluting children's mentality by her actions. At the edge of extreme were those who called for her execution (BBC News, 2007; CNN, 2007; New York Times, 2007; TIME, 2007; Times Online, 2007). This highly publicized incident can be explained quite well by the cultural schema theory, particularly by discussing Ms. Gibbons' status as a sojourner in an unfamiliar culture. Axiom number three and axiom number nine apply quite well to Ms. Gibbons. As a sojourner, the acquisition of host <a href=\"/wiki/Culture\" title=\"Culture\">culture</a> PSI schemas would be necessary in order for the sojourner's cross-cultural adaptation to occur. Ms. Gibbons may have lived in Sudan, but she lived inside the walls of Unity School. According to <a href=\"/wiki/BBC_News\" title=\"BBC News\">BBC News</a> (2007), once inside the walls of Unity School one would think s/he was at standing on the grounds of an Oxbridge University. This private school with children of well-to-do parents is much different than the rest of Sudan. Ms. Gibbons did not need to acquire the PSI schemas of the host culture because her native PSI schemas worked equally well inside the walls of Unity School. Had Ms. Gibbons been constantly made aware of the local PSI schemas (naming an animal after the <a href=\"/wiki/Prophet_Muhammad\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prophet Muhammad\">Prophet Muhammad</a> is unacceptable) she may have adapted and not allowed the children to name the teddy bear Muhammad. Naming a teddy bear was not a novel situation to her as a children's school teacher, but she was not in England. After the bear's naming she certainly encountered a novel situation where she experienced cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of her lack of the PSI schemas in the situation. Hence the difficulties of cross-cultural adaptation for sojourners like Ms. Gibbons. They do not intend to stay and thus will not adapt/experience the stages of axioms which will best prepare them to appropriately fit in.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contrasting_theory\">Contrasting theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cultural_schema_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Contrasting theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cultural Schema Theory is often compared and contrasted with the <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_consensus_theory\" title=\"Cultural consensus theory\">Cultural Consensus Theory</a>. Both theories present distinct perspectives about the nature of individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture.  Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand <a href=\"/wiki/Intracultural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intracultural\">intracultural</a> variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Further_use_and_development_of_the_theory\">Further use and development of the theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cultural_schema_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Further use and development of the theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Simply put, cultural schema theory can be described as cultural-specific world knowledge (Razi, 2002). As mentioned above, the concept of Cultural Schemas is not new, but the theory is.  Future studies must generate theorems and further tests must be conducted in order to better formulate theory itself and the axioms it proposes.
