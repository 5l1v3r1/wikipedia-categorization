Maurice Alfrédo Sixto (May 23, 1919, Gonaïves, Haiti – May 12, 1984, Philadelphia, USA) was a professor, a translator, tour guide and ambassador. The son of an engineer, Maurice Alfredo Sixto and Maria Bourand, he attended St Louis de Gonzague for his secondary studies; upon graduation he attended l'Academie Militaire where he remained for only three months. He eventually studied at the Faculte de Droit from 1945–1948 while working for Radio HHBM (now MBC). Sixto is remembered in Haitian culture for his contributions to oral literature.  His ability to use rich, descriptive, and iconic Haitian Creole create a narrative that displays the true face of Haitian culture. Sixto prefaces every story with Regards sur choses et gens entendu (Regarding things [seen] and People Heard). Today, the Foyer Maurice Sixto, honors his work and social commentary found in Ti Sentanize, where Sixto derides his fellow bourgeosie countrymen for their abuse and forced labor of domestic children servants also referred to as Restavecs.
