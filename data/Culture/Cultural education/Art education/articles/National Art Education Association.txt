 The National Art Education Association (NAEA) is a professional association founded in 1947 in the United States. It is the world's largest professional art education association. The NAEA's annual convention attracts thousands of art educators and offers art educators a chance to network, establish mentor relationships, and attend professional development events.   The NAEA also gives awards for Art Educator of the Year at this convention.  Along with the Art & Creative Materials Institute, in 1969, the NAEA began sponsoring March as Youth Art Month.  Since 1984, Youth Art Month has been run by the Council for Art Education, Inc., which consists of representatives of the NAEA and other art associations. As an advocacy organization, the NAEA speaks out in favor of increased funding for art education, and opposing cuts to art funding.  The NAEA publishes two journals, Art Education and Studies in Art Education.
