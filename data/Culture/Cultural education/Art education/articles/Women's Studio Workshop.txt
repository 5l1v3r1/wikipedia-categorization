Women's Studio Workshop (WSW) is a nonprofit visual arts studio and private press offering residencies and educational workshops, located in Rosendale, New York. The workshop was founded in 1974 by Ann Kalmbach, Tatana Kellner, Anita Wetzel, and Barbara Leoff Burge as an alternative space for female artists to create new work, gain artistic experience, and develop new skills. The studio operates throughout the year with artist residencies, gallery exhibitions, artist lectures, and diverse educational programs for children and adults. In addition, they operate a Summer Art Institute which includes options to study abroad. The studio supports projects in a wide range of media types, with a focus on book arts, papermaking, and printmaking methods: screen printing, letterpress, etching, intaglio.
