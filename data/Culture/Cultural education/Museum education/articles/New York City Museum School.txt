The NYC Museum School offers students access to primary resources in the sciences, history, literature and the arts. The unique use of museum collections enables students to examine evidence, illustrate ideas, provoke questions, and suggest new ways of presenting knowledge. Classroom instruction is reinforced with museum-based projects that are geared to state and local curricular mandates. Students explore, apply and create knowledge in the context of individual and group learning. The school's curriculum requires weekly visits to museums all over New York City, where an NYCMS teacher conducts class in conjunction with Museum staff. These visits supplement conventional classes held inside the school. NYCMS provides education to a heterogeneous group of students from a diverse community. The faculty includes licensed teachers and museum professionals who collaborate to design the curriculum. The school partners with museums such as the Brooklyn Museum and South Street Seaport Museum
