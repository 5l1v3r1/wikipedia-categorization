  The Dana Library and Research Centre (formerly the Dana Centre) on Queen's Gate, South Kensington, London is part of the Science Museum.  Designed by Sir Richard MacCormac of MJP Architects,  the building opened in 2003 as a public event venue in London for contemporary science debate, run largely by the Science Museum. The building itself houses offices used by the Science Museum and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The Dana Centre is not directly accessible from the main museum, and is situated on the nearby Queen's Gate street. Previously an events space and café, the building re-opened in late 2015 as the Dana Library and Research Centre, aiming to "provide a world-class environment for academic research, bringing together the museum’s thriving Research and Public History Department and access to its library and archive collections".
