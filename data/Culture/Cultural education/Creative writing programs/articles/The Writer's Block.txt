The Writer's Block is an independent bookseller, publisher, and literacy educator in downtown Las Vegas. The Writer's Block was established in 2014 by 826NYC co-founder Scott Seeley and Drew Cohen. It was opened with former BSSco. store manager Chris Molnar.    It is the first independent bookstore in Las Vegas, and second in the state of Nevada.  Behind the bookstore front is the literacy education component of the Writer's Block, known as Codex.  Similar in layout to the educational area behind 826NYC's Superhero Supply Store,   Codex also features movable walls, tables and desks.  It is used for free writing workshops for children ages 5-18, in addition to readings, signings, and ongoing series such as Neon Lit, the monthly reading by MFA and PHD writing students at UNLV.
