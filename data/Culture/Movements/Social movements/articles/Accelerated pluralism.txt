Accelerated pluralism is a theory coined by Bruce Bimber which claims that "the net is accelerating the process of issue group formation and action".  Accelerated pluralism is a method of mobilization used in the formation of social movements that is facilitated by the use of information communication technologies. This method of group formation is unique because through the use of the Internet people are able congregate in the virtual public sphere and decide which form of action to take.  According to the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Daniel Weitnzer, the Internet facilitates a “one-to-one interaction…between citizens and government” something that is missing in today's politics.  Accelerated pluralism played a major role in the mobilization efforts of the Arab Spring, Occupy and Black Lives Matter social movements by allowing the participants to congregate cheaply and quickly. ICTs in combination with accelerated pluralism played a major role in the "ignition of social protest, the cascade of inspiring images and stories"  in social movements.
