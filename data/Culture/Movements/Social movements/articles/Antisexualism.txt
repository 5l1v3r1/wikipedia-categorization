The most popular venue of antisexuals is the Antisex.info (Antisexual Stronghold) website founded by Yuri Nesterenko.  He has been widely recognized as the leading antisexual activist since he launched a FidoNet-based antisexual community in 1995.         The community claims to have created the International Antisexual Movement (IAM).  While putting forward the slogan "Say No to sex", the spokesmen  of the IAM endeavor for people to understand that no sexual urges are so violent that they may not be deterred through mental reason, or else transformed through abstinence.  Some members of the IAM say they have successfully overcome the desire for sex.
