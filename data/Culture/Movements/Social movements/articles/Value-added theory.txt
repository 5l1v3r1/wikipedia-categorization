Value-added theory (also known as social strain theory) was first proposed by Neil Smelser and is based on the assumption that certain conditions are needed for the development of a social movement.  Smelser saw social movements as side-effects of rapid social change.  Smelser argued that six things were necessary and sufficient for collective behavior to emerge,  and that social movement evolves through those relevant stages:   The concept of value added was used earlier in economics, where it refers to the increasing value of product in progressing stages of production. Critics of this theory note that it is too focused on the structural-functional approach and views all strains on society as disruptive.
