Generation text is a term referring to those members of society who have grown up with cell phones from a young age. Furthermore, it can be applied to adolescents and teenagers who feel that they are unable to function without a cell phone. The term generation text has been created by several people independently. Dr. Michael Osit published a book in 2008 called "Generation Text". A second invention of the word occurred in 2009 at a Lights concert in Winnipeg, Canada by Ian Scott. While at the concert, Scott observed that many of the teenagers were either talking on their cell phones, text messaging, or videoing concert footage using their phones. Also noticing that they appeared to be all of one specific generation, he coined the term "generation text".
