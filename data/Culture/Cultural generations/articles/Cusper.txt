Cuspers is a name given to those born during the cusp years of two generations.   Following their "BridgeWorks Generations Survey", Lancaster and Stillman described the following cuspers: Traditionalist/Baby Boomer, born 1940–1945; Baby Boomer/Generation Xer, born 1960–1965; Generation Xer/Millennial, born 1975–1980.  Other sources define the Generation X/Millennial cusp using later birth years. Xennials, a name given to those born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years, uses the late 1970s to early 1980s. Other names for those born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years include Oregon Trail Generation and Generation Catalano.      Mark Wegierski of the Hudson Institute defines the Baby Boomer/Generation X cusp as between 1958–1967.
