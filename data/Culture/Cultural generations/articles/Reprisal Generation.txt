The Reprisal Generation is the name given by sociologists to describe the generation of people, born 1512–1540.  It is an identified cohort within the Strauss–Howe generational theory.  ”They spent their childhood amid religious frenzy and a widespread erosion of social authority—and came of age in a cynical, post-Awakening era of cut-throat politics and roller-coaster markets.”  They crewed the ships during the wars of the Spanish Armada and saw the expansion of British territories and colonisation in the New World overseas.    Elizabeth I, Catherine de Medici, Francis Drake, John Hawkins, Thomas Gresham, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, Francis Walsingham, Michel de Montaigne, Walter Raleigh, Nicholas Fuller, and Edward Coke.
