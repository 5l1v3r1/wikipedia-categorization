The “ReGeneration” refers to people of all ages who share a common interest in renewable resources, recycling and other means of sustaining the earth’s natural environment. In contrast to previous age-specific generations, like the ‘Me Generation, Generation X or Generation Y, this new generation comprises globally connected and like-minded individuals using technology to harness their collective beliefs – regardless of age or geographic location.".  Social networking Web sites are enabling members of the “ReGeneration” to interact and share ideas with others based on common interests like conservation and alternative energy. While not specifically defined, the prefix ‘Re’ in “ReGeneration” could be interpreted to include widespread environmental practices such as reusing, recycling and restoring.
