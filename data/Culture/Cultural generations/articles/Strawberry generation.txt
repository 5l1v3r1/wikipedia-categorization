Strawberry generation (Chinese: 草莓族; pinyin: Cǎoméi zú;  or 草莓世代; cǎoméi shìdài)  is a Chinese-language neologism for Taiwanese people born after 1981 who  "bruise easily" like strawberries – meaning they cannot withstand social pressure or work hard like their parents' generation; the term refers to people who are insubordinate,  spoiled,  selfish, arrogant, and sluggish in work.  The term arises from the perception that members of this generation have grown up  being overprotected by their parents and in an environment of economic prosperity, in a similar manner to how strawberries are grown in protected greenhouses and command a higher price compared to other fruits. The term is starting to gain prominence in the East Asian press, as it could be a way to designate a rising demographic or psychographic in terms of consumer behavior. The Strawberry Generation, like the Post-80s of China, could be the Asian counterpart of the Millennials in the Western world. In an ironic reference to the term, a 2008 student-led political movement in Taiwan started the Wild Strawberries Movement. This movement was in response to the visit of China's ARATS chairman Chen Yunlin to the island.   Police actions on protests aimed at Chen suppressed the display of Taiwan's national flag and the playing of Taiwanese songs. This prompted a group of 400 students in Taipei, Taiwan, to begin a sit-in in front of the Executive Yuan in protest of Taiwan's Parade and Assembly Law (Chinese: 集會遊行法).
