The Botanical garden of Thutmose III (French: Jardin botanique de Thoutm√¥sis III) is an artistic representation of fauna and especially flora during the Egyptian empire at its peak. The remarkably detailed reliefs are located on the walls of the room next to the Festival Hall of Thutmose III, in the Precinct of Amun-Re, Karnak.  On land at the rear of the shrine, the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III built the Festival Hall of Thutmose III, also known as the Akh-menu. The walls were then used by royal artists who, by order of the pharaoh, engraved in stone some of the most beautiful pastoral representations of Egypt. Thutmose III, the great warrior pharaoh who expanded the boundaries of Egypt in the north and the south, collected a considerable collection of rare species of animals and lush plants. His animals and botanical collection are found engraved on the walls of the sanctuary. Through the royal artists, the pharaoh boasts of the scenic beauty, the lush flora and rich fauna he discovered during his victorious campaigns against Asiatics.
