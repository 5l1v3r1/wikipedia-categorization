The Jill Smythies Award of the Linnean Society of London was established in 1986 and is awarded annually to a botanical artist. The award was established by Bertram Smythies, in honour of his wife, Florence Mary Smythies ("Jill"), whose career as a botanical artist was cut short by an accident to her right hand.
