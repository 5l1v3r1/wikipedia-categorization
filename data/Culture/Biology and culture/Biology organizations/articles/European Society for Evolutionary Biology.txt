The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) was founded in 1987. It publishes the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, organises meetings and biannually awards a John Maynard Smith Prize.  Its objectives are to "Support the study of organic evolution and the integration of those scientific fields that are concerned with evolution: molecular and microbial evolution, behaviour, genetics, ecology, life histories, development, paleontology, systematics and morphology."  ESEB supports young researchers through sponsoring the annual EMPSEB (European Meeting of PhD Students in Evolutionary Biology) research conference for Ph.D. students.
