Life Sciences Research Organization (LSRO) is a non-profit organization based in Maryland, United States, that specializes in assembling "ad hoc" expert panels to evaluate scientific literature, data, systems, and proposals in the biomedical sciences. LSRO was founded in 1962 as an office within the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) to fulfill a US military need for independent scientific counsel. In 2000, LSRO became an independent non-profit organization.  It changed its name from Life Sciences Research Office to Life Sciences Research Organization in 2010, and in that same year announced the formation of LSRO Solutions which along with LSRO provides independent, impartial scientific analysis and advice. The organization has a reputation for conducting studies on politically charged issues which are of concern to federal agencies or corporations. Some issues include the dental amalgam controversy, dietary supplement monitoring, and "reduced risk" cigarette products. It has faced scrutiny for its private clients, particularly in relation to tobacco research.
