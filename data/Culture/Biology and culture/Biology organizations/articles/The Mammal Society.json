The Society runs national surveys for mammals, for example Mini Mammal Monitoring. You can find more information at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mammal.org.uk/surveys_and_monitoring\">mammal.org.uk/surveys_and_monitoring</a>.\n</p><p>The Mammal Society is also working to address the problem that mammals in the British Isles are severely under-recorded, resulting in a lack of mammal conservation progress. The Mammal Society is determined to overcome this by creating a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mammal.org.uk/nmap\">National Mammal Atlas</a>, the first in over 20 years, to provide vital information on mammal distribution and abundance so that informed conservation decisions can be made for species in need. In order to achieve this they are collating national mammal data and records to gather up to date information.\n</p><p>The Mammal Society offers a wide range of expert-led training courses for consultants, conservationists and enthusiasts alike, covering ecology, technical skills and surveying. A full list of these courses <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mammal.org.uk/training\">can be found here</a>.\n</p><p>The Society's president is Dr. Paul Chanin, and its current Chair is Dr <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=fiona_mathews\">Fiona Mathews</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Publications\">Publications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Mammal_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Publications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Mammal Society publishes a number of informative books for conservationists, enthusiasts and consultants alike, as well as a high impact scientific journal, <a href=\"/wiki/Mammal_Review\" title=\"Mammal Review\">Mammal Review</a>.\n</p><p>In June 2012, The Mammal Society published <a href=\"/wiki/UK_BAP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UK BAP\">UK BAP</a> Mammals: Interim Guidelines for Survey Methodologies, Impact Assessment &amp; Mitigation for species for which there was previously no available guidance.\n</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.nhbs.com/title/view/196556\">http://www.nhbs.com/title/view/196556</a>\n</p><p>The definitive publication of The Mammal Society is the 4th edition of Mammals of The British Isles Handbook. The Handbook is well established as the classic reference source detailing the biology, ecology and conservation of every mammal occurring in Britain and Ireland. The 3rd edition, dating to 1991, had long been out of press, until over 100 of the leading mammalogists, mostly members of The Mammal Society, contributed to complete this comprehensive 800-page 4th revision, published in 2008. It presents an authoritative summary of our current knowledge of mammal ecology, biology and conservation issues, with detailed accounts for every species of mammal found in or around the British Isles.\n</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://mammal.org.uk/handbook\">http://mammal.org.uk/handbook</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Mammal_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1319\nCached time: 20180909015445\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.084 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.117 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 850/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4875/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 541/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 9/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.030/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.52 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  104.940      1 -total\n 95.75%  100.480      1 Template:Infobox_Organization\n 75.54%   79.271      1 Template:Infobox\n 15.29%   16.041      2 Template:Unbulleted_list\n 11.66%   12.236      4 Template:If_empty\n  6.62%    6.950      4 Template:Comma_separated_entries\n  4.64%    4.865      1 Template:PAGENAMEBASE\n  4.14%    4.347      1 Template:Reflist\n  2.94%    3.090      2 Template:Main_other\n  1.96%    2.060      1 Template:Template_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:20333538-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909015445 and revision id 745475268\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Mammal Society","*":"Biology_organizations"},{"sortkey":"Mammal Society","*":"Conservation_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"Mammal Society","*":"1954_establishments_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"Mammal Society","*":"Scientific_organizations_established_in_1954"},{"sortkey":"Mammal Society","*":"Environmental_organisations_based_in_the_United_Kingdom"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"London"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mammal"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mammal Review"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Non-profit organization"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"UK BAP"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"University of Exeter"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox Organization"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox organization"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:PAGENAMEBASE"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:If empty"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unbulleted list"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Comma separated entries"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Longitem"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Template other"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Infobox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Navbar"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:String"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:InfoboxImage"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:If empty"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:List"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:TableTools"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Separated entries"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.mammal.org.uk/","http://www.mammal.org.uk/surveys_and_monitoring","http://www.mammal.org.uk/nmap","http://www.mammal.org.uk/training","http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=fiona_mathews","http://www.nhbs.com/title/view/196556","http://mammal.org.uk/handbook"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Publications","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"The_Mammal_Society","byteoffset":2412,"anchor":"Publications"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"The_Mammal_Society","byteoffset":3594,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"The Mammal Society","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Mammal Society"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7749827"}]}}
