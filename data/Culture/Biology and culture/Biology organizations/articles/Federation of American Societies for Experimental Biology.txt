The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, abbreviated FASEB, is a non-profit organization that is the principal umbrella organization of U.S. societies in the field of biological and medical research. FASEB organizes academic conferences and publishes scientific literature.  FASEB's mission statement is "to advance health and well-being by promoting research and education in biological and biomedical sciences through collaborative advocacy and service to our societies and their members."  Key features: Founded in 1912, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) was originally created by three independent scientific organizations to provide a forum in which to hold educational meetings, develop publications, and disseminate biological research results. What started as a small group of dedicated scientists has grown to be the nationâ€™s largest coalition of biomedical researchers, representing 30 scientific societies and over 130,000 researchers from around the world. FASEB is now recognized as the policy voice of biological and biomedical researchers.:  The American Physiological Society (APS) (1912) American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) (1912) American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET) (1912) American Society for Investigative Pathology (ASIP) (1913) American Society for Nutrition (ASN) (1940) The American Association of Immunologists (AAI) (1942) American Association of Anatomists (AAA) (1993) The Protein Society (PS) (1995)  Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) (1996) American Peptide Society (APEPS) (1996) The Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) (1998) American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) (1997) The American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) (1998) Society for the Study of Reproduction (SSR) (1998) The Teratology Society (TS) (1998) Endocrine Society (ES) (1999) The American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) (1999) International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) (2003) American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (2005) Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) (2009) Genetics Society of America (GSA) (2010) The Histochemical Society (HCS) (2011) Society for Pediatric Research (SPR) (2012) Society for Glycobiology (SfG) (2012) Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) (2013) Society for Redox Biology and Medicine (SfRBM) (2014) Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine (SEBM) (2016) American Aging Association (AGE) (2016) U.S. Human Proteome Organization (US HUPO) (2016) Society of Toxicology (SOT) (2017)
