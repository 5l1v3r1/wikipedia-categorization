The Association for Politics and the Life Sciences (APLS) was formed in 1981 and exists to study the field of biopolitics as a subfield of political science. APLS owns and publishes an academic peer-reviewed journal, called Politics and the Life Sciences (PLS), semi-annually in March and September. The journal is edited at Indiana University at Bloomington.
