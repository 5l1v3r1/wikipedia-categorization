The Biosciences Federation (BSF) was a United Kingdom body formed in 2002. The Federation aimed to unite the bioscience community over issues of common interest that related to both research and teaching. These organisations are a key component of the UK's knowledge economy. It also aimed to influence the formulation of UK policy relating to biosciences, and to promote public debate on ethical issues. Its interests were in using knowledge gained in research to benefit society, and the impact of legislation on the life sciences industry. Each November, it would hold the Life Sciences Careers Conference. During October 2009, the Biosciences Federation was merged with the Institute of Biology (IoB) to form the Society of Biology (which boasts some 80,000 members).  The last president of the Federation was Dame Nancy Rothwell (2006–9); Richard Dyer, former director of the Babraham Institute, was the chief executive officer (2006–9). Sir Tom Blundell was a former president (2004–6). From 2007, the Biosciences Federation encompassed 51 member or associated organisations that covered the entire range of life sciences; these included  The Federation responded to government consultations on biology-related issues; these responses were published on the Federation's website. It also distributed science policy news to a range of organisations that included universities, research councils, pharmaceutical companies and government bodies. The Federation hosted several life sciences careers conferences and symposia on issues such as open access publishing. It also supported the annual award for scientific communication.
