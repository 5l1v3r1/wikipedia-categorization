Autonomous Detection Systems (ADS), also called biohazard detection systems, or autonomous pathogen detection systems, are designed to monitor air in the environment and to detect the presence of airborne chemicals, toxins, pathogens, or other biological agents capable of causing human illness or death. Currently[when?] under development, these systems monitor the air continuously and send real-time alerts to appropriate authorities in the event of an act of bioterrorism or biological warfare. In the United States, an ADS system (BDS) was developed for the U.S. Postal Service following the anthrax scare of 2001. The detection systems were installed in 2006.
