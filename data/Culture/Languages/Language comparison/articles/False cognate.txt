False cognates are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same language or from different languages.  For example, the English word dog and the Mbabaram word dog have exactly the same meaning, but by complete coincidence. This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related. (For example: Spanish dependiente looks like dependent, but means employee as well.) Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them (for example by phono-semantic matching or folk etymology). The term "false cognate" is sometimes misused to refer to false friends, but the two phenomena are distinct.   False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some false friends are also false cognates, many are genuine cognates (see False friends § Causes).   For example, English pretend and French prétendre are false friends, but not false cognates, as they have the same origin.
