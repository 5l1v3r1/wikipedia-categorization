The following tables list the cardinal number names and symbols for the numbers 0 through 10 in various languages and scripts of the world. Where possible, each language's native writing system is used, along with transliterations in Latin script and other important writing systems where applicable. In some languages, numbers will be illustrated through to 20.      داسا (dasa), from Sanskrit, दश (dáśa). ڤولوه (puluh, puloh), from proto-Malayo-Polynesian *puluq, from proto-Austronesian, *puluq. limara  anemira  pitora  walora  siamira  samplora  ^a  See main article, Balinese numerals.  ^b  See main article, Javanese numerals.  ^c  Unusually for an Austronesian language, Tsat has developed into a solidly tonal language, probably as a result of areal linguistic effects and contact with the diverse tonal languages spoken on Hainan including varieties of Chinese such as Hainanese and Standard Chinese, Tai–Kadai languages such as the Hlai languages, and Hmong–Mien languages such as Kim Mun.   The ancestors of Huihui people immigrated to Hainan Island from central Vietnam about eight hundreds years ago.  Under the strong influences from neighboring tonal Chinese dialects, Huihui has developed tones and eventually became a "monosyllabic" and tonal Austronesian language.  ^d  Rapa Nui and Tahitian largely share the same numerals. Numbers higher than ten are expressed in Tahitian. ^e  Hiri Motu, one of Papua New Guinean official languages. ^f  Trans–New Guinea languages are a separate family of languages from the Austronesian languages, but tend to be strongly influenced by Austronesian languages, especially in words for numbers.  ^g  The Papuan languages are those languages of the western Pacific island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands, that are neither Austronesian nor Australian. See main article, Indo-Pacific languages.   Most of the languages follow the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.
