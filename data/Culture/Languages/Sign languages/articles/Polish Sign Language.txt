Polish Sign Language ("Polski Język Migowy", PJM) is the language of the Deaf community in Poland. Its lexicon and grammar are distinct from the Polish language, although there is a manually coded version of Polish known as System Językowo-Migowy (SJM, or Signed Polish), which is often used by interpreters on television and by teachers in schools. Polish Sign Language uses a one-handed manual alphabet based on the alphabet used in Old French Sign Language. However, the language itself derives from German Sign Language.
