The following are sign languages reported to be spoken by at least 10,000 people. Estimates for sign language use are very crude, and definitions of what counts as proficiency varied. For most sign languages we do not have even a crude estimate. For instance, there are reported to be a million signers in Ethiopia, but it is unknown which or how many sign languages they use. The 2013 edition of Ethnologue lists 137 sign languages.
