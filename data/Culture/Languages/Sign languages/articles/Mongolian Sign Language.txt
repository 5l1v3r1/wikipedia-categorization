Mongolian Sign Language (Mongolian: Монгол дохионы хэл, Mongol dokhiony khel) is a sign language used in Mongolia. Ethnologue estimates that there were between 10,000 and 147,000 deaf people in Mongolia as of  1998[update]; however, it is not known how many of those are users of MSL.   Mongolian Sign Language is widely spoken in areas where Mongolian diaspora have immigrated.  Such locations involve California, Houston, and Charleston.  Dr. Phillip McGrevis, a member of the American Center of Mongolian Studies, noted that Mongolian Sign Language is mutually intelligible with Russian Sign Language.  The large shared vocabulary could be a byproduct of the Kapusta's presence in Mongolia prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.   Linda Ball, a Peace Corps volunteer in Mongolia, is believed to have created the first dictionary of MSL in 1995.  In 2007, another MSL dictionary with 3,000 entries was published by Mongolia's Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science with assistance from UNESCO.
