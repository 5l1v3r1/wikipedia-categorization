Saigon Sign Language, also known as Ho Chi Minh City Sign Language, is the deaf-community sign language of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) in Vietnam. It is about 50% cognate with the other sign languages of Vietnam, and its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by the French Sign Language once taught in Vietnamese schools for the deaf.
