[Superseded in Glottolog: Coropo removed, Puri split] Purian (also Purían) is a pair of extinct languages of eastern Brazil: Coropó (Koropó), once spoken in Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, was added by Campbell (1997), but removed again by Ramirez et al. (2015). Purian is part of the Macro-Jê proposal. However, when Coropó is removed, there are not sufficient lexical connections to maintain this classification.
