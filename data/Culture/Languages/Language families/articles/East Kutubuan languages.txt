The East Kutubuan languages are a small family of Transâ€“New Guinea languages (TNG) in the classification of Malcolm Ross. There are just two languages,  which are not close to the West Kutubuan languages. These were linked in a "Kutubuan" family by Franklin and Voorhoeve in 1973, but that position has since been abandoned. Although East Kutubuan has proto-TNG vocabulary, Ross considers its inclusion in TNG to be somewhat questionable.
