West Bird's Head languages are a small family of poorly known Papuan languages spoken on the Bird's Head Peninsula of New Guinea. The West Bird's Head Family is a well-defined family of six languages spoken at the western end of the Bird's Head Peninsula of New Guinea and the eastern part of the island of Salawati opposite the Bird's Head's western shore. Kuwani is attested only from a single word list, but is clearly distinct.
