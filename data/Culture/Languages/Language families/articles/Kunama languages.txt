The Kunama languages are a family of languages traditionally considered dialects of a single language, spoken in western Eritrea and across the border in Ethiopia. They are included as a branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. The languages are Kunama proper, Bitama and Ilit. They may be most closely related to the Maban languages spoken in eastern Chad (Starostin 2016).
