The Araucanian languages, a small language family of indigenous languages of the Americas, is located in central Chile and neighboring areas of Argentina. The living representatives of this family are Mapudungu (ISO 639-3: arn) and Huilliche (ISO 639-3: huh).  These are sometimes considered divergent dialects of a single language isolate. It is estimated that there are approximately 200,000 Mapudungu-speakers in Chile and 40,000 speakers in Argentina. Huilliche is the native language of a few thousands of Chileans.
