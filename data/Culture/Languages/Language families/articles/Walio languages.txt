The Walio languages are a small family of clearly related languages, Walio, Pei, Yawiyo, and Tuwari, though they are not close: Walio and Yawiyo have only a 12% lexical similarity.  They are frequently classified among the Sepik languages of northern Papua New Guinea, though Glottolog leaves them out.
