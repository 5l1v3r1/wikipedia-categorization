Lafofa, also Tegem, is a Niger–Congo dialect cluster spoken in the southern Nuba Mountains in the south of Sudan. Blench (2010) considers the Tegem and Amira varieties to be distinct languages; as Lafofa is poorly attested, there may be others. Long considered one of the Talodi languages, albeit a divergent one, Blench posits that the Lafofa languages should be considered a distinct branch of Niger–Congo pending further research. They share cognates with divergent Niger–Congo languages such as Ijo that are not found elsewhere in the Kordofanian languages.
