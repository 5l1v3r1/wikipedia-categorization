Witotoan (also Huitotoan or Uitotoan,, occasionally known as Huitoto–Ocaina to distinguish it from Bora–Witoto) is a small language family of southwestern Colombia (Amazonas Department) and the neighboring region of Peru. The classification above is based on Campbell (1997), who follows Richard Aschmann's 1993 classification and reconstruction of proto-Witotoan. Nonuya is nearly extinct, but attempts are being made at revival. The following extinct languages are unclassified within Witotoan: Kaufman (2007) adds Andoque.  Synonymy note: Aschmann (1993) proposed that the Boran and Witotoan language families were related, in a Bora–Witoto stock. Echeverri & Seifart (2016) refute the connection.
