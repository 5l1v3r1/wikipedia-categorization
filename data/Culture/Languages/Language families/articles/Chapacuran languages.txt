The Chapacuran languages are a nearly extinct Native American language family of South America. There are three living Chapacuran languages, which are spoken in the southeastern Amazon Basin of Brazil and Bolivia. The Chapacuran languages appear to be related to the extinct Wamo language. Almost all Chapacuran languages are extinct, and the four that are extant are moribund. Birchall et al. (2013) classify the dozen known Chapacuran languages as follows:  All languages are rather closely related. Rocorona appears closest to Torá and Moré (Itene), but those do not cluster together in the classification above. Extinct languages for which Loukotka says 'nothing' is known, but which may have been Chapacuran, include Cujuna, Mataua, Urunumaca, and Herisobocono. Similarities with Mure appear to be loans.
