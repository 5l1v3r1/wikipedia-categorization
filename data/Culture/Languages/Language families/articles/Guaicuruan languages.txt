Guaicuruan (Guaykuruan, Waikurúan, Guaycuruano, Guaikurú, Guaicurú, Guaycuruana) is a language family spoken in northern Argentina, western Paraguay, and Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul).  The speakers of the languages are often collectively called the Guaycuru peoples. For the most part the Guaycuruans lived in the Gran Chaco and were nomadic and warlike until finally subdued by the various countries of the region in the 19th century.   Guaicuruan/Waikurúan languages are often classified as follows: Abipón, Guachí, and Payaguá all are extinct. Harriet Klein argues against the assumption that Kadiweu is Guaicuruan. Most others accept the inclusion of Kadiweu into the family.  The Guachi were absorbed by the Mbayá.  The similarities with the Mbayá language may be due to borrowing rather than a familial relationship.   Jorge Suárez includes Guaicuruan with Charruan in a hypothetical Waikuru-Charrúa stock.  Morris Swadesh includes Guaicuruan along with Matacoan, Charruan, and Mascoyan within his Macro-Mapuche stock. Both  proposals appear to be obsolete.
