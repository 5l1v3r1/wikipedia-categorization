The Nambikwaran languages are a language family of half a dozen languages, all spoken in the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil. They have traditionally been considered dialects of a single language, but at least three of them are mutually unintelligible. The varieties of Mamaindê are often seen as dialects of a single language, but are treated as separate  Northern Nambikwaran languages by Ethnologue. Sabanê is a single speech community and thus has no dialects, while the Nambikwara language has been described as having eleven.  The total number of speakers is estimated to be about 1,500, with Nambikwara proper being 80% of that number.  Most Nambikwara are monolingual but some young men speak Portuguese.  Especially the men of the Sabanê group are trilingual, speaking both Portuguese and Mamainde.
