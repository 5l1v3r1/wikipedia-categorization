Wagaydyic is a pair of closely related but otherwise unclassified Australian Aboriginal languages, the moribund Wadjiginy (Wagaydy) and the extinct Kandjerramalh (Pungupungu). Tryon (1987) notes that the two languages are 80% cognate, but there are serious grammatical differences that prevent them from being considered dialects of a single language.  The unattested Giyug may have been related.  The Wagaydyic languages have previously been classified with Malak-Malak into a Northern Daly family, but similarities appear to be due to lexical and morphological borrowing from Malak-Malak, at least in Wadjiginy.
