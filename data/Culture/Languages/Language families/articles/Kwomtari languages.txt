The Kwomtari languages are a small language family of Papua New Guinea. The family consists of at least the two relatively closely related languages Kwomtari and Nai.   Baron adds the highly divergent language Guriaso: Guriaso shares a small number of cognates with Kwomtari–Nai. Baron (1983) says the evidence is convincing once a correspondence between /ɾ~l/ and /n/ (from *ɾ) is established: * Compare Biaka -ɾo, -mo, -na. ** Metathesis of /p/ and /t/. Usher further classifies Yale (Nagatman) with Guriaso, and adds Busa, all under the name "Senu River".  There has been confusion over the membership of the Kwomtari family, apparently due to a misalignment in the publication (Loving & Bass 1964) of the data used for the initial classification. (See Baron 1983.) Because of this, Laycock classified the Kwomtari languages as part of a spurious Kwomtari–Fas family, which confusingly was also often called "Kwomtari" in the literature. However, Baron sees no evidence that the similarities are due to relationship. Usher likewise discounts the inclusion of the Fas languages. See Kwomtari–Fas languages for details.
