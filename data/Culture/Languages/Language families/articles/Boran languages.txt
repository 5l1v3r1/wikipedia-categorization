Boran (also known as Bora–Muiname, Bóran, Miranyan, Miranya, Bórano) is a small language family, consisting of just two languages: Synonymy note: Aschmann (1993) proposed that the Boran and Witotoan language families were related, in a Bora–Witoto stock. Echeverri & Seifart (2016) refute the connection.
