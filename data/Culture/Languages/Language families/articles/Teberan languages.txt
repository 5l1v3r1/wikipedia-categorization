The Teberan languages are a well established family of Papuan languages that Stephen Wurm (1975) grouped with the Pawaia language as a branch of the Transâ€“New Guinea phylum. Malcolm Ross (2005) tentatively retains both Teberan and Pawaia within TNG, but sees no other connection between them. There are just two Teberan languages, Dadibi and Folopa (Podopa).
