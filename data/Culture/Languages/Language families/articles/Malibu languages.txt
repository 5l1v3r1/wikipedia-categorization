The Malibu languages are a poorly attested group of extinct languages once spoken along the Magdalena River in Colombia.  Material exists only for two of the numerous languages mentioned in the literature: Malibú and Mocana. The Malibu languages have previously been grouped into a single family with the Chimila language.

A selection of these is provided below:
