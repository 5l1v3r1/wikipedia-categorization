The Momuna languages, Momina and Momuna, also known as Somahai, are a family of two closely related Papuan languages.  The Somahai pronouns, singular *na, *ka, *mo, are typical of Transâ€“New Guinea languages. They were placed in the Central and South New Guinea branch of that family by Wurm. Ross could not locate enough evidence to classify them. Usher found them to be closest to the Mek languages, in the Central West New Guinea, which partially overlaps with Wurm's C&SNG.
