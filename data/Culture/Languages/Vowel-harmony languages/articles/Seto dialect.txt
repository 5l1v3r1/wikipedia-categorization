Seto (seto kiil´;  Estonian: setu keel) is a dialect of South Estonian spoken by 12,549 people.  It is sometimes identified as a dialect of Võro, or the two are described as one language, Seto-Võro. However, the ethnic identity of Setos (Setokõsõq) and Võros (Võrokõsõq) is quite distinct; Setos mostly inhabit the area near Estonia's southeastern border with Russia in Setomaa, and are primarily Eastern Orthodox, while Võros are Lutherans and live in Võru County.
