Common Turkic or Shaz Turkic is a taxon in some of the classifications of the Turkic languages which includes all languages except the Oghur languages. Lars Johanson's proposal contains the following subgroups:   In that classification scheme, Common Turkic is opposed to Oghur Turkic (Lir-Turkic). The Common Turkic languages are characterized by sound correspondences such as Common Turkic Å¡ versus Oghuric l and Common Turkic z versus Oghuric r. In other classification schemes (such as Alexander Samoylovich and Nikolay Baskakov), the breakdown is different.
