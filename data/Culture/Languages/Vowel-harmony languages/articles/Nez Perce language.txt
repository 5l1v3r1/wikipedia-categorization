Nez Perce, also spelled Nez Percé or called Niimi'ipuutímt, is a Sahaptian language related to the several dialects of Sahaptin (note the spellings -ian vs. -in). Nez Perce comes from the French word, "pierced nose," but Nez Perce, who call themeselves Nimipu, meaning "the people," did not pierce their nose.  That may have occurred as a result of confusion on behalf of the French, as it was surrounding tribes who did so.  The Sahaptian sub-family is one of the branches of the Plateau Penutian family (which, in turn, may be related to a larger Penutian grouping). It is spoken by the Nez Perce people of the Northwestern United States. Nez Perce is a highly-endangered language. While sources differ on the exact number of fluent speakers, it is almost definitely under 100. The Nez Perce tribe is endeavoring to reintroduce the language into native usage through a language revitalization program, but (as of 2015) the future of the Nez Perce language is far from assured.  The grammar of Nez Perce has been described in a grammar (Aoki 1973) and a dictionary (Aoki 1994) with two dissertations (Rude 1985; Crook 1999). The phonology of Nez Perce includes vowel harmony (which was mentioned in Noam Chomsky & Morris Halle's The Sound Pattern of English), as well as a complex stress system described by Crook (1999). The sounds kʷ, kʼʷ, qʷ, qʼʷ and ʃ only occur in the Downriver dialect.  Vowels can also be accented (e.g. /á/). [further explanation needed] As in many other indigenous languages of the Americas, a Nez Perce verb can have the meaning of an entire sentence in English. (This manner of providing a great deal of information in one word is called polysynthesis.) Verbal affixes provide information about the person and number of the subject and object, as well as tense and aspect (e.g. whether or not an action has been completed). In Nez Perce, the subject of a sentence, and the object when there is one, can each be marked for grammatical case, an affix that shows the function of the word (compare to English he vs. him vs. his).  Nez Perce employs a three-way case-marking strategy: a transitive subject, a transitive object, and an intransitive subject are each marked differently. Nez Perce is thus an example of the very rare type of tripartite languages (see morphosyntactic alignment). Because of this case marking, the word order can be quite free. A specific word order tells the hearer what is new information (focus) versus old information (topic), but it does not mark the subject and the object (in English, word order is fixed — subject–verb–object). Nouns in Nez Perce are marked based on how they relate to the transitivity of the verb. Subjects in a sentence with a transitive verb take the ergative suffix -nim, objects in a sentence with a transitive verb take the accusative suffix -ne, and subjects in sentences with an intransitive verb don’t take a suffix. For example: Ergative suffix -nim  ᶍáᶍaas-nim         hitwekǘxce grizzly-ergative   he.is.chasing ‘Grizzly is chasing me’ Accusative suffix -ne (here subject to vowel harmony, resulting in surface form -na) ʔóykalo-m    titóoqan-m      páaqaʔancix      ᶍáᶍaas-na all-ergative people-ergative they.respect.him grizzly-accusative ‘All people respect Grizzly’ Intransitive subject ᶍáᶍaac  hiwéhyem grizzly has.come ‘Grizzly has come’ (Mithun 1999) This system of marking allows for flexible word order in Nez Perce: Verb–subject–object word order kii  pée-ten’we-m-e    qíiw-ne ’   iceyéeye-nm this 3→3-talk-csl-past old.man-obj coyote-erg ‘Now the coyote talked to the old man’ Subject–verb–object word order  Kaa háatya-nm páa-’nahna-m-a      ’iceyéeye-ne and wind-erg  3→3-carry-csl-past  coyote- obj ‘And the wind carried coyote here’ Subject–object–verb word order  Kawó’ kii    háama-pim    ’áayato-na   pée-’nehnen-e then  this   husband-erg  woman-obj    3→3-take.away- past ‘Now then the husband took the woman away’ (Rude 1992).
