The Karluk languages (also known as the Qarluq or Southeastern Common Turkic languages) are a sub-branch of the Turkic language family that developed from the varieties once spoken by Karluks.   Many Middle Turkic works were written in these languages. The language of the Kara-Khanid Khanate was known as Turki, Ferghani, Kashgari, or Khaqani. The language of the Chagatai Khanate was the Chagatai language.  Karluk Turkic was spoken in the Kara-Khanid Khanate, Chagatai Khanate, Yarkent Khanate, and the Uzbek speaking Khanate of Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara, Khanate of Khiva, and Kokand Khanate.
