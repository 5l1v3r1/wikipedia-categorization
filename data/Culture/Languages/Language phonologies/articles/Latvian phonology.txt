This article is about the phonology of the Latvian language. It deals with synchronic phonology as well as phonetics. Table adopted from Nau (1998:6) /n t d t͡s d͡z s z/ are denti-alveolar, while /l r/ are alveolar. The consonant sounds /f x/ are only found in loanwords. [ŋ] is only an allophone of nasals before velars /k/ and /ɡ/. Latvian plosives are not aspirated (unlike in English). Voiced and unvoiced consonants assimilate to the next-standing consonant, e.g. apgabals [ˈabɡabals] or labs [ˈlaps]. At the same time single voiced consonants (d, z, g, dz etc.) are not devoiced word-finally: dzied [ˈdzie̯d], dedz [dæd͡z]. Doubled consonants are pronounced longer: mamma [ˈmamːa]. The same occurs with plosives and fricatives located between two short vowels, as in upe [ˈupːe], and with zs that is pronounced as /sː/, and šs and žs as /ʃː/. A palatalized dental trill /rʲ/ is still used in some dialects (mainly outside Latvia) but quite rarely, and hence the corresponding letter ⟨Ŗ ŗ⟩ was removed from the alphabet. Latvian has six vowels, with length as distinctive feature: /ɔ ɔː/, and the diphthongs involving it other than /uɔ/, are confined to loanwords. The vowel length ratio is about 1:2.5. Vowel length is phonemic and plays an important role in the language. For example, koka [ˈkuɔka] means 'made of wood', kokā [ˈkuɔkaː] means 'on the tree'; pile [ˈpile] means 'a drop', and pīle [ˈpiːle] means 'a duck'. Latvian also has 10 diphthongs (/ai ui ɛi au iɛ uɔ iu (ɔi) ɛu (ɔu)/), although some diphthongs are mostly limited to proper names and interjections. Standard Latvian and, with a few minor exceptions, all of the Latvian dialects have fixed initial stress.  Long vowels and diphthongs have a tone, regardless of their position in the word. This includes the so-called "mixed diphthongs", composed of a short vowel followed by a sonorant. There are three types of tones: Besides the three-tone system of the standard variety, there are also Latvian dialects with only two tones: in western parts of Latvia, the falling tone has merged with the broken tone, while in eastern parts of Latvia the level tone has merged with the falling tone. Hence, the Central Latvian traũks, dràugs, raûgs correspond to Western Latvian traũks, draûgs, raûgs, and to Eastern Latvian tràuks, dràugs, raûgs.  This system is phonetically more or less similar to the ones found in Lithuanian, Swedish, Norwegian and Serbo-Croatian. The broken tone has some similarity to the Danish stød. Latvian roots may alternate between [v] and [u] depending on whether the following segment is a vowel or a consonant. For example, the root Daugav- ('Daugava River') in the nominative case is [dauɡavə], but is pronounced [dauɡaupils] in the city name Daugavpils. In this example, the vocalic alternant [u] is realized as the off-glide of the diphthong /au/. However, when following a vowel that does not form an attested Latvian diphthong (for example, [iu]), [u] is pronounced as a monophthong, as in [zius] ('fish-NOM.SG.'; cf. [zivis] 'fish-NOM.PL.').
