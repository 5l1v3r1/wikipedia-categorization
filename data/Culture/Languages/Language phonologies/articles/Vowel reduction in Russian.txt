Vowel reduction in Russian differs in the standard language and dialects, which differ from one another. Several ways of vowel reduction (and its absence) are distinguished. There are five vowel phonemes in Standard Russian. Vowels tend to merge when they are unstressed. The vowels /a/ and /o/ have the same unstressed allophones for a number of dialects and reduce to an unclear schwa. Unstressed /e/ may become more central if it does not merge with /i/.  Other types of reduction are phonetic, such as that of high vowels (/i/ and /u/), which become near-close so игра́ть ('to play') is pronounced [ɪˈɡratʲ], and мужчи́на ('man') is pronounced [mʊˈɕːinə]. Russian orthography does not reflect vowel reduction, which can confuse foreign-language learners. The five Russian vowels /u, i, e, a, o/ in unstressed position show two levels of reduction:  The allophonic result of the reduction is also heavily depended on the quality of the preceding consonant as well as the lack of it thereof. Thus the reduction is further grouped into three types according to the environment:  The unstressed vowels also may be grouped in series, reflecting similar patterns of the reduction:  Or otherwise: Two high vowels /u/ and /i/ are usually thought to undergo no reduction.  However, on the phonetic level they show allophonic centralization, particularly under the influence of the preceding or the following consonants. The unstressed high back vowel /u/ is either [ʊ] (after hard consonants, written ⟨у⟩) or [ʊ̈] (after soft consonants, written ⟨ю⟩, except ⟨чу⟩, ⟨щу⟩). The unstressed high front vowel /i/ is either [i] or [ɪ] (after soft consonants, written ⟨и⟩), or [ɨ] or [ɪ̈] (after hard consonants, written ⟨ы⟩, except ⟨ши⟩, ⟨жи⟩). Nevertheless, in rapid colloquial speech they both may be reduced to schwa [ə],  for example, до́брым [ˈdobrɨ̆m] ('kind', instrumental case, singular masculine-neuter) versus до́бром [ˈdobrəm] ('kind', prepositional case, sg. masc.-neut.): the case ending //-im// in the former may surface as [-əm] like the case ending //-om//, thus leading to the merger of /i/ and /o/; or де́лают [ˈdʲeləjʊ̈t] ('they do') versus де́лает [ˈdʲeləjɪt] ('he/it does'): both may surface as [ˈdʲeləɪt] or [ˈdʲeləːt]. Other than in Northern Russian dialects  Russian speakers have a strong tendency to merge unstressed /a/ and /o/, called akanye (аканье). It contrasts with okanye (оканье) pronunciations. It works in Standard Russian as follows: Across certain word-final suffixes, the reductions do not completely apply.  In certain suffixes, after palatalised consonants and /j/, /a/ and /o/ (which is written as ⟨е⟩) can be distinguished from /i/ and from each other: по́ле [ˈpolʲɪ] ('field' nominative singular neuter) is different from по́ля [ˈpolʲə] ('field' singular genitive), and the final sounds differ from the realisation of /i/ in that position.  There are a number of exceptions to the above comments regarding the akanye: The main feature of front vowel reduction is ikanye (иканье), the merger of unstressed /e/ with /i/. Because /i/ has several allophones (depending on both stress and proximity to palatalised consonants), unstressed /e/ is pronounced as one of these allophones and not actually as the close front unrounded vowel. For example, семена́ /sʲimʲiˈna/ ('seeds') is pronounced [sʲɪmʲɪˈna], цена́ /t͡siˈna/ ('price') [t͡sɨ̞ˈna]. In registers without the merger (yekanye or еканье), unstressed /e/ is more retracted. Even then, however, the distinction between unstressed /e/ and unstressed /i/ is most clearly heard in the syllable just before the stress. Thus, прида́ть ('to add to') contrasts with преда́ть ('to betray'). The two are pronounced [prʲɪˈdatʲ] and [prʲe̠ˈdatʲ] respectively. Yekanye pronunciation is coupled with a stronger tendency for both unstressed /a/ and /o/ to be pronounced the same as /i/. Speakers may switch between the two types of pronunciation because of various factors, the most important factor likely being speed of pronunciation. Yakanye (яканье) is the pronunciation of unstressed /e/ and /a/ following palatalised consonants preceding a stressed syllable as /a/ rather than /i/ (несли́ is pronounced [nʲasˈlʲi], not [nʲɪsˈlʲi]). The non-standard rural pronunciation is observed in most Southern Russian dialects, as expressed in a Russian quip (with liberal yakanye): The example also demonstrates other features of Southern dialects: palatalised final /tʲ/ in the 3rd person forms of verbs, [ɣ] instead of [ɡ] and [w] instead of [u] (in some places) and [v], clear unstressed [a] in place of [ɐ] or [ə]. Vowel reduction makes some words have spellings that contradict their etymology, such as паро́м (instead of поро́м, which was standard spelling before the Ushakov Dictionary), карава́й (instead of корова́й, the standard spelling until the reform of 1956), свидетель (instead of сведетель, with a long history). In the closely related Belarusian language, original /o/ has merged with /a/ as in Standard Russian, but the reduced pronunciation is reflected in the spelling.
