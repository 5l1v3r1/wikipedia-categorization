Kurdish phonology is the sound system of the Kurdish language continuum. This article includes the phonology of the three Kurdish dialects in their standard form respectively. Phonological features include the distinction between aspirated and unaspirated voiceless stops and the presence of facultative phonemes.   The consonants are pronounced the same in the three dialects (Northern Kurdish, Central Kurdish and Southern Kurdish), unless noted. The vowel inventory differs by dialect, some dialect having more vowel phonemes than others. /iː, ʊ, uː, ɛ, eː, oː, ɑː/ are the only vowel phonemes present in all three Kurdish dialects. The glides [w], [j], and [ɥ] appear in syllable onsets immediately followed by a full vowel. All combinations except the last three are present in all three Kurdish dialects. If the word used as an example is unique to a dialect, the dialect is mentioned.
