This article is about the phonology and phonetics of the Upper Sorbian language. The vowel inventory of Upper Sorbian is exactly the same as that of Lower Sorbian.  It is also very similar to the vowel inventory of Slovene. Upper Sorbian has both final devoicing and regressive voicing assimilation, both word-internal and across word boundaries.   In the latter context, /x/ is voiced to [ɣ]. Regressive voicing assimilation does not occur before sonorants and /ɦ/.
