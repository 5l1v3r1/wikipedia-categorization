This is a presentation of the phonological history of the Scots language. Scots has its origins in Old English (OE) via early Northern Middle English;  though loanwords from Old Norse  and Romance sources are common, especially from ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Anglo-Norman and Middle French borrowings.  Trade and immigration led to some borrowings from Middle Low German and Middle Dutch.  Some vocabulary has been borrowed from Scotland's other language, Scottish Gaelic.  Instance of /b/ between /m/ and a following /l/ or /r/ were lost or did not develop:   Certain clusters were reduced: While OE /sk/ became /ʃ/ in Modern English, Scots has retained the original pronunciation (e.g. OE sċylfe, 'shelf', became skelf).  Old English /s/ became /ʃ/ when adjacent to a front vowel (e.g. shinners from OE sinder, 'cinder'). OE /f/ was often dropped in certain contexts:  In contexts where OE /k/ and /ɡ/ palatalized to /tʃ/ and /dʒ/, respectively, in Modern English (that is, after a front vowel), Scots has retained the original velar pronunciation:  Word final OE /θ/ (written ⟨ð⟩ or ⟨þ⟩) was deleted in a few words (e.g. OE mūþ, 'mouth', became mou in Scots).   OE /x/ was lost in English, but remained in Scots, spelled ⟨ch⟩:  However, some words such as tho (though) and throu ('through') have dropped the /x/. Old English /hw/ became /xw/ for a number of speakers, though /hw/ is widespread (e.g. OE hwæt, 'what', became whit).  Metathesis occurred in some words (e.g. OE græs, 'grass', became girse).  OE /ɡ/ became vocalised after /o/ resulting in the diphthong /ʌu/ in Modern Scots (e.g. boga, 'bow', became bowe).   Similarly, in the Early Scots period, /l/ was vocalized after: The following table shows the modern realisation of the various Scots vowels along with their pronunciation in Early Scots, the Early Middle English vowels they can largely be derived from, and the main Old English sources of these vowels.

Old English and Old Norse ī and ȳ, Old English  i+ld and y+nd, as well as Old French i became /iː/ in Early Scots then /ei/ in Middle Scots and subsequently conditioned by the Scottish Vowel Length Rule to /əi/ when short and /aɪ/ or /ɑɪ/ when long in Modern Scots, for example: wyce (wise), wyte (blame), bide (remain), kye (cows), hive and fire from wīs, wīte, bīdan, cȳ, hȳf and fȳr. Similarly with Norse grice (pig), sile (strain), tyke (curr), lythe (shelter) and tyne (lose), and Romance advice, fine, cry, sybae (onion) but where Romance words entered Scots after this sound shift the original /i/ (Vowel 2) remained in Scots, for example bapteese (baptise), ceety (city), ceevil (civil), eetem (item), leeberal (liberal), leecence (license), meenister (minister), obleege (oblige), peety (pity), poleetical (political), poseetion, releegion (religion) and speerit (spirit).
