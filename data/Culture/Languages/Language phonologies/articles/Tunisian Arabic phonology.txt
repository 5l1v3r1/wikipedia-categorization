There are several differences in pronunciation between Standard and Tunisian Arabic. Nunation does not exist in Tunisian Arabic, and short vowels are frequently omitted, especially if they would occur as the final element of an open syllable, which was probably encouraged by the Berber substratum.   However, there are some more specific characteristics related to Tunisian Arabic like the phenomenon of metathesis.  Metathesis is the shift of the position of the first vowel of the word.   It occurs when the unconjugated verb or unsuffixed noun begins with CCVC, where C is an ungeminated consonant and V is a short vowel.    When a suffix is added to this kind of noun or when the verb is conjugated, the first vowel changes of position and the verb or noun begins with CVCC.    For example: Stress is not phonologically distinctive  and is determined by the word's syllable structure. Hence,  For example: Assimilation is a phonological process in Tunisian Arabic.  The possible assimilations are: Tunisian Arabic qāf has [q] and [ɡ] as reflexes in respectively sedentary and nomadic varieties: he said is [qɑːl] instead of [ɡɑːl]). However, some words have the same form [ɡ] whatever the dialect: cow is always [baɡra]  (the /g/ deriving from an originally Arabic [q]), and a specific species of date is always [digla]  (the /g/ deriving from an originally Semitic [q] - e.g. Aramaic: /diqla/: date tree). Interdental fricatives are also maintained for several situations, except in the Sahil dialect.  Furthermore, Tunisian Arabic merged /dˤ/ ⟨ض⟩ with /ðˤ/ ⟨ظ⟩.  Phonetic notes: As well as those characteristics, Tunisian Arabic is also known for differently pronouncing words according to their orthography and position within a text.   This phenomenon is known as pronunciation simplification  and has four rules:
