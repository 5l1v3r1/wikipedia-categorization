This article is about the phonology and phonetics of the West Frisian language. The vowel inventory of West Frisian is very rich. Some falling diphthongs alternate with the rising ones:  Word-final /b, d/ are realized as voiceless [p, t].  Note, however, that final /b/ is rare,  and that in loanwords from Standard Dutch, final /É£/ can also appear, and is also devoiced to [x].
