Kehu (Keu, Keuw) is an unclassified and nearly extinct language of New Guinea. Mark Donohue (2007) said that Kehu is "probably a Geelvink Bay language, but no one knows enough about those languages, systematically, to say this with confidence for [any of them] beyond Barapasi, T(ar)unggare and Bauzi"  Timothy Usher classifies it as a Lakes Plain language, closest to Awera and Rasawaâ€“Saponi.
