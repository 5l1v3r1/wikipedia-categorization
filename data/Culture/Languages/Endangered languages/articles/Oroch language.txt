 The Oroch language is spoken by the Oroch people in Siberia.  It is a member of the southern group of the Tungusic languages and is closely related to the Nanai language and Udege language.  It is spoken in the Khabarovsk Krai (Komsomolsky, Sovetskaya Gavan, and Ulchsky districts).  The language is split into three dialects: Tumninsky, Khadinsky, and Hungarisky.  At the beginning of the 21st century, a written form of the language was created. ʊ ʊː
