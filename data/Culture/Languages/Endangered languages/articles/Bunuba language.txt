Bunuba (Bunaba, Punuba, Punapa) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by some 160 older adults, most of whom live in Junjuwa, an Aboriginal community in Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. Bunuba is not related to the Pama-Nyungan language family that spans the majority of Australia, though it is a relative of Gooniyandi.  Due to the growing concern of their language becoming extinct, the elders make an effort by passing on stories to their younger people around the campfires at night. This is a way the Bunuba elders prevent the extinction of their language, passing it down through generations.
