Siberian Tatar (Siberian Tatar: Сыбырца) is a Turkic language spoken in Western Siberia region of Russia. Siberian Tatar consists of three dialects: Tobol-Irtysh, Baraba, and Tomsk. According to D. G. Tumasheva, the Baraba dialect is grammatically closest to the southern dialect of Altai, Kyrgyz, and has significant grammatical similarities with Chulym, Khakas, Shor and Tuvan. The Tomsk dialect is, in her opinion, even closer to Altai and similar languages. Tevriz speech of the Tobol-Irtysh dialect shares significant elements with Siberian Turkic languages, namely with Altai, Khakas and Shor. Although Gabdulkhay Akhatov was a Volga Tatar, he immersed into studying of the phonetic peculiarities of Siberian Tatar language of the indigenous population of Siberia, the Siberian Tatars. In his classic fundamental research work "The Dialect of the West Siberian Tatars" (1963)  Akhatov wrote about Tobol-Irtysh Siberian Tatars, a western group of Siberian Tatars, who are indigenous to the Omsk and Tyumen Oblasts. In his classic fundamental research work "Dialect of the West Siberian Tatars" (1963) Gabdulkhay Akhatov wrote about a territorial resettlement of the Tobol-Irtysh Tatars Tyumen and Omsk areas. Subjecting a comprehensive integrated analysis of the phonetic system, the lexical composition and grammatical structure, the scientist concluded that the language of the Siberian Tatars is a separate language, it is divided into three dialects and it is one of the most ancient Turkic languages.  Professor G.Akhatov named Siberian Tatar dialects of Tyumen and Omsk Oblasts dialects of the West Siberian Tatars, while dialects of Baraba and Tom Tatars he named dialects of the East Siberian Tatars. /ɴ/ can be an allophone of /ŋ/.
