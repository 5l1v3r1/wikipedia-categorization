The Proto-Philippine language is the reconstructed ancestral proto-language of the Philippine languages, a proposed subgroup of the Austronesian languages which includes all languages of the Philippines (except for the Sama–Bajaw languages) as well as the languages of the northern part of Sulawesi, Indonesia.     Proto-Philippine is not directly attested to in any written work, but linguistic reconstruction by the comparative method has found regular similarities among languages that cannot be explained by coincidence or word-borrowing. Ancient forms of roots and words have been extrapolated from the similarities. Proto-Philippine originated from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian and ultimately from Proto-Austronesian. The proto-phonemes *j and *R are not preserved as such in any Philippine language: *j became either *g or *d (e.g. *púsəj became Ilocano púsəg, Tagalog púsod), whereas *R shifted to *r (e.g. in Ilocano), *l (e.g. in Pangasinan), *g (e.g. in Tagalog) or *y (e.g. in Kapampangan).   The diphthongs are *ay, *aw, *uy, and *iw. The proto-phoneme *ə was retained in many Philippine languages, especially in the northern and southern descendants of Proto-Philippine (e.g. in Ilokano, Pangasinan, Ibanag, Maranao, Maguindanao), and also in some peripheral lects in the central area (e.g. Rinconada Bikol, Kinaray-a Visayan, Palawano). In most Visayan and Bikol varieties, *ə merged with *u, whereas in Tagalog, *ə merged with *i (*u in certain environments). Here are some words from Proto-Philippine:
