The Protoâ€“Afroasiatic language is the reconstructed proto-language from which all modern Afroasiatic languages are descended. It is believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around 12,000 to 18,000 years ago, but there is no consensus as to where the Afroasiatic Urheimat, the homeland of Proto-Afroasiatic speakers, was located. Although Afroasiatic is the earliest attested language family in the world, the reconstruction of Proto-Afroasiatic is problematic and largely lacking, which is sometimes attributed to the sheer age of the language.   Reconstructed words for fauna and flora and evidence of linguistic contact with language families known to have been spoken in Eurasia suggest that its home was in the Middle East, probably the Levant. Some geneticists and archaeologists have argued for a back migration of proto-Afroasiatic speakers from Western Asia to Africa as early as the 10th millennium BC. They suggest the Natufian culture might have spoken a proto-Afroasian language just prior to its disintegration into sub-languages.   The hypothesis is supported by the Afroasiatic terms for early livestock and crops in both Anatolia and Iran.  Evidence of Cushitic being formerly spoken in the south of Arabia also speaks for a Middle Eastern origin, but some proposals also claim Northern Africa or the Horn of Africa.    The following table shows consonant correspondences in Afroasiatic languages, as given in Dolgopolsky (1999), along with some reconstructed consonants for Proto-Afroasiatic. NOTE: Ehret (1995) reconstructs the following pronouns, most of which are supported by at least five of the six branches: Ehret (1995) reconstructs the following cardinal numbers (Ehret does not include Berber in his reconstruction): The first root for "two" has been compared to Berber (Tamazight) sin.  There are other proposed cognate sets:
