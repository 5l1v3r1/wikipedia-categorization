Nishi (also known as Nyishi, Nisi, Nishing, Nissi, Nyising, Bangni, Dafla, Daphla, Lel) is a Sino-Tibetan language of the Tani branch spoken in lower Subansiri and East Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh and Darrang District of Assam in India. According to 1991 census of India the population of the Nishi speakers is 173,791. The total population of Nishi speakers as per 1997 database  is 261,000 including 37,300 Tagins. Though there are plenty of variations across regions, the dialects of Nishi, such as Tagin, are easily mutually intelligible. 'Nisi' is sometimes used as a cover term for western Tani languages. Nishi is a subject–object–verb language. :80 The main origin of this language has been pointed out by George Abraham Grierson as ‘Dafla’.  He included different varieties under a common name which is known as North Assam group. The varieties are Abor, Miri and Dafla according to him. Daflas used to denote them as ‘Nyi-Sing’. these tribes inhabited between the Assam Valley and Tibet. Then they started to spread in Lakhimpur, Sibsagar and Darrang Districts of Assam. Mr. William Robinson in his notes mentioned that Daflas were spread over a region from 92°50’ to 94° north latitude. The word nyishi itself means "upland man", and is a compound of nyi ("man") and shi ("highland"). :4 Nishi is a tonal language that utilizes three tones: rising, neutral, and falling. :16 These can be applied to all of its vowels, and often can change the word's meaning: This is the consonants of Nyishi. Where the orthography differs from the IPA, the orthography is bolded.  Nyishi distinguishes between number, person, and case. It does not have a gender system, but special affixes can be added to nouns to denote gender. Counting system differs in case of human vs. non-human objects. Post, Mark W. (2013).
