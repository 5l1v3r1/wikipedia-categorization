Amberbaken, or Mpur (also known as Kebar, Ekware, and Dekwambre), is a divergent language of New Guinea. It is not closely related to any other language, and though Ross (2005) tentatively assigned it to the West Papuan languages, based on similarities in pronouns, Ethnologue and Glottolog list it as a language isolate.   Amberbaken or Mpur has a complex tonal system with 4 lexical tones and an additional contour tone, a compound of two of the lexicals. Its tonal system is somewhat similar to the nearby Austronesian languages of Mor and Ma'ya.  Mpur has five vowels: /a, e, i, o, u/.
