A floating tone is a morpheme  or element of a morpheme that contains no consonants, no vowels, but only tone. It cannot be pronounced by itself, but affects the tones of neighboring morphemes.   An example occurs in Bambara. Bambara has two phonemic tones,  high and low. In this language, the definite article is a floating low tone. With a noun in isolation, it is associated with the preceding vowel, turning a high tone into a falling tone: [bá] river; [bâ] the river. When it occurs between two high tones, it downsteps the following tone: Also common are floating tones associated with a segmental morpheme such as an affix.  For example, in Okphela, an Edoid language of Nigeria,  the main negative morpheme is distinguished from the present tense morpheme by tone; the present tense morpheme (á-) carries high tone, whereas the negative past morpheme (´a-) imposes a high tone on the syllable which precedes it: Floating tones derive historically from morphemes which assimilate  or lenite  to the point where only their tone remains.
