The Berta languages, or Wetawit, traditionally considered dialects of a single language, are Gebeto (Berta proper), Fadashi, and Undu. They are either a small family (or language isolate) of their own, or a primary branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Berta has the typical word order subject–verb–object.  It is a tonal language.  It has significantly influenced some of the Eastern Jebel languages.  The Arabic name "Beni-Shangul" (as in the Ethiopian province of Benishangul-Gumuz) derives from a Berta expression (with bele "rock/stone" misanalyzed as Arabic beni "sons").
