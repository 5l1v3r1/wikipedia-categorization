Gimi (Labogai) is a Papuan language spoken in Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea. Gimi has 5 vowels and 12 consonants.  It has voiceless and voiced glottal consonants where related languages have /k/ and /ɡ/. The voiceless glottal is simply a glottal stop [ʔ]. The voiced consonant behaves phonologically like a glottal stop, but does not have full closure. Phonetically it is a creaky-voiced glottal approximant [ʔ̞].  /p/ occurs word initially only in loanwords. /b/ can surface as either [b] or [β] in free variation. /z/ becomes [s] before /ɑ/. /t/ and /ɾ/ tend to fluctuate with one another word initially. The syllable structure is (C)V(G), where G is either /ʔ/ or /ʔ̞/. The final vowel of a word takes either a level or falling tone. The falling tone is written with an acute accent. Gimi uses the Latin script.
