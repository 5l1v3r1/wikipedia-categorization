Golin (also Gollum, Gumine) is a Papuan language of Papua New Guinea. Diphthongs that occur are /ɑi ɑu ɔi ui/. The consonants /l n/ can also be syllabic. /bʷ ɡʷ/ are treated as single consonants by Bunn & Bunn (1970) , but as combinations of /b/ + /w/, /ɡ/ + /w/ by Evans et al. (2005) . Two consonants appear to allow free variation in their realisations: [s] varies with [ʃ], and [l] with [ɬ]. /n/ assimilates to [ŋ] before /k/ and /ɡ/. Golin is a tonal language, distinguishing high ([˧˥]), mid ([˨˧]), and low ([˨˩]) tone. The high tone is marked by an acute accent and the low tone by a grave accent, while the mid tone is left unmarked. Examples:
