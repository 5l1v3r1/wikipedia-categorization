The Bribri language is a tonal SOV language spoken by the Bribri people from Costa Rica. It belongs to the Chibchan language family.  Today there are about 11,000 speakers left.  Bribri, like its sister language Cabécar, has nasal harmony. The Linguistics Department at the University of Costa Rica has conceived a standardized spelling system, based on several earlier attempts . Nasal vowels are indicated by a tilde:ã, ẽ, ĩ, õ, ũ (Previously indicated with a macron below: a̱, e̱, i̱, o̱, u̱), except after a nasal consonant (already indicating nasalisation of the vowel). Tones are indicated by the grave accent for the high tone and the acute accent for the low tone; these can also be placed on the nasal vowels.
