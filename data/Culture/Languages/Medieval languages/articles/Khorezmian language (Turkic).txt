Khorezmian was a literary Turkic language  of the medieval Golden Horde of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It was a preliminary stage of the Chagatay language, which would remain an important language of Central Asia until the 20th century. It was based on Old Turkic further to the east, though incorporating local Oghuz and Kipchak words.
