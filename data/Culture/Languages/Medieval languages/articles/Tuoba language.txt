Tuoba (Tabγač or Tabghach; Chinese: 拓跋) is an extinct Mongolic language spoken by the Tuoba people in northern China around the 5th century AD during the Northern Wei dynasty. Alexander Vovin (2007) identifies the extinct Tabγač or Tuoba language as a Mongolic language.  However, Chen (2005)  argues that Tuoba (Tabγač) was a Turkic language.
