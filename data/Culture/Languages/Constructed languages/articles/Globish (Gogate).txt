Globish is an artificial language created by Madhukar Gogate that attempts to simplify English.  It was presented to the Simplified Spelling Society (now known as English Spelling Society) of Great Britain in 1998. According to its creator, it can be considered an artificial English dialect, as proof of the possibility of simplifying the orthography and pronunciation of standard English. For example, the word "colour/color" is in globish "kalar". Gogate says that his project is related to, but independent from, English.
