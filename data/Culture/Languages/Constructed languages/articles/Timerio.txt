Timerio is a constructed language based on numbers. It was presented to public in 1921 by the Berlin architect Tiemer as a pure literary language and should be used for automated translations.  The idea was, that every concept is assigned by a number. The language shows similarities to the Dewey Decimal Classification by Melvil Dewey. One of the only known sentences is the number-combination 1-80-17, which means I love you.  Here the 1 stands for I, 17 for You and 80 for Love. Alternatively, 2 can also be used as a description of you according to some forms. Thus, the number-combination would read 1-80-2. Given the basic concept that 1 equals I, and that the designation starts from that viewpoint onwards, it is a logical alternative to accept 2 as another term for you. The comparative is shown by *, the superlative by ***. "And" is represented by +. A prefix of > makes a root an adjective. The genitive takes the suffix II, the dative takes III. “1-3̅0̅-(3)-9802” means, “I’ll write three letters”. “6215-8_0-164->1673-9802” means, “The father loved the big coloured letters.” Tenses were shown with an underscore below the number (past) or a macron above (future). The plural took superscript 2. Numbers when expressed in a numerical form appeared inside brackets.
