The de Wahl's rule is a rule of word formation, developed by Baltic German naval officer and teacher Edgar de Wahl and applied in the constructed language Interlingue (also called "Occidental") which was also his creation. The rule served for the formation of certain changed grammatical forms, like adjectives and nouns, from verb infinitive. Verb infinitives in Interlingue end in -ar, -ir or -er. The root is obtained by the following way: These six exceptions are and the verbs formed out of them using prefixes. Because the rule is actually made of three parts, it also known as the "three rules of de Wahl". The nouns and adjectives are created by removing the ending and thus obtaining the root. After adding -r or -er, one obtains the infinitive in the majority of cases: decora/t/ion, decora/t-, decora/r. This rule is applied in the language Occidental. After a possible modification one can apply this rule to create new forms of a word especially in Romance languages or in languages which borrowed vocabulary from Romance languages.
