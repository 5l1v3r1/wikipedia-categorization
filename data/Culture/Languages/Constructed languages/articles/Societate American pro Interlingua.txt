The Societate American pro Interlingua (SAI) is an Interlingua-speaking organization that covers the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is currently undergoing reorganization to be considered a non-profit group under US law. The SAI's charter is a directive written to promote Interlingua in the three countries under its purview. To that end, it organizes meetings, publishes literature and publishes a journal (Confluentes), all in Interlingua. The SAI has six positions, which are filled by five people: Of the memberships, three come from the United States, two are Canadian, and there are presently no Mexican members on the board of the SAI.
