Bongo-Bongo in linguistics is used as a name for an imaginary language. It is most commonly invoked in etymological studies to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages.  It has also been used as a name for a constructed language invented by John Lyons as a teaching tool in linguistics.  Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term Bongo-Bongo approach or Bongo-Bongo effect.  For example, when comparing random surface forms in Basque and Hungarian (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as hegi (Basque for "ridge") and hegy (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.  The concept can also be found occasionally in anthropology where the Bongo-Bongo are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, Bongo Bongo Land).
