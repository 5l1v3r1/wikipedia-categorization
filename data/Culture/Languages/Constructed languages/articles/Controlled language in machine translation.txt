Using controlled language in machine translation poses several problems. In an automated translation, the first step in order to understand the controlled language is to know what it is and to distinguish between natural language and controlled language. The main problem in machine translation is a linguistic problem. Language is ambiguous and the system tries to model a language on lexical and grammatical way. In order to solve this problem there are a lot of alternatives, e.g. a glossary related with the textâ€™s topic can be used. Grammar rules are different for each language. Because of this, the rules for controlled languages are different from one language to another. And there are no rules that have optimal results for all languages. There are however rules which reduce ambiguities  in most texts in many languages. According to Uwe Muegge's article "Controlled Language Optimized for Uniform Translation" (2002) the following ten rules should be applied:  It is enabling to produce texts easier to read, more comprehensible and easier to retain, as well as with better vocabulary and style. Reasons for introducing a controlled language include: One of the biggest challenges facing organizations that wish to reduce the cost and time involved in their translations is the fact that even in environments that combine content management systems with translation memory technology, the percentage of un-translated segments per new document remains fairly high. While it is certainly possible to manage content on the sentence/segment level, the current best practice seems to be to chunk at the topic level. Which means that reuse occurs at a fairly high level of granularity.
