"O Julissi" also known as "O Julissi Na Jalini" is a song by the Belgian six-piece band Ishtar. The swing influenced song represented Belgium at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 first semi-final in Belgrade, but missed out on qualification to the grand final. "O Julissi" was released as a single on 14 March 2008, and the song entered the Belgian Ultratop at #7. In its second week, "O Julissi" topped the list. Ishtar's song was elected after they won the final of Eurosong 2008. Ishtar, until then an unknown band, defeated better known artists, like pop singers Sandrine and Brahim. The other contestants in the final were rock group Paranoiacs and Nelson, who had written a ballad. Ishtar performed their song during the semi-finals on 20 May 2008 but did not qualify to the final.
