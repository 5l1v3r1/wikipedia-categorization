This is a list of ISO 639 codes and IETF language tags (BCP 47) for individual constructed languages, complete as of  November 2009[update]. ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-5 also have the code art for other artificial languages. The BCP 47 subtag x can be used to create a suitable private use tag for any constructed language that has not been assigned an official language tag (e.g., art-x-solresol could be used for Solresol, or jbo-x-loglan for Loglan). The old SIL language identifiers (usually written in capitals) are officially obsolete and should no longer be used. They formed the basis of the ISO 639-3 language codes, but some SIL identifiers that had been retired before the establishment of ISO 639-3 were later assigned to different languages within ISO. The IANA Language Subtag Registry (for IETFâ€™s language tags defined in BCP 47) was updated on 29 July 2009 to include all ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-5 identifiers in use at that time.
