LoCos is a pictorial language developed by Yukio Ota of Japan in 1964. It was meant as communication for the deaf and mute as well as for the illiterate. It is a universal and simple language, and as Mr.Ota put it, "It should emphasize the importance of communication among all the people of all the countries of the world." There are 8 major symbols in LoCos. There is the Sun or day, represented by a circle. There is man, represented by a ring shape. There is a thing, represented by a square. There is thought, represented by a triangle with a slightly cut off top. There is feeling, represented by a heart. There is land or place, represented by a low straight line. There the question indicator, a question mark. There is, lastly, a point or existence, represented by a single point. Words are made by combining different symbols in different ways. For example if you put a dot inside a circle it will represent today, or if you put a fish in a ring shape it will be a fisherman. There an around 80 words that are official according to Yukio Ota. Words can be created as long as they follow the basic word syntax. Sentences are formed by a combination of certain words. There are three rows that you use when writing sentences. The middle row is used for the core words (nouns, verbs, and direct/indirect objects). The top row is used to modify verbs with adverbs. The bottom row is used to modify nouns using adjectives.
