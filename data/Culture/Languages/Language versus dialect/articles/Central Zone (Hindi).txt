  The Hindi Languages are the varieties of Hindi spoken in the Hindi Belt, a region which is located across northern and central India. As part of the Central Zone of the modern Indo-Aryan languages family, the Hindi Languages form a dialect continuum that descends from the Madhya Prakrits. The Western Hindi varieties also include Hindustani, of which the modern languages of Hindi and Urdu derive from. Hindi and Urdu are mutually intelligible standardizations of the Khariboli dialect, the prestige dialect of the Delhi region and the basis of the medieval Hindustani language. The coherence of the Hindi group depends on the classification being used and may be classified as either Western Hindi or Eastern Hindi, depending on the varieties spoken. If there can be considered a consensus within the dialectology of Hindi proper, it is that it can be split into two sets of dialect groups: Western and Eastern Hindi.  Western Hindi evolved from the Apabhramsa form of Shauraseni Prakrit and Eastern Hindi from Ardhamagadhi Prakrit.  This analysis excludes varieties sometimes claimed for Hindi for cultural reasons, such as Bihari, Rajasthani, and Pahari.  Bhojpuri is classified under the Bihari languages though it has long been considered a Hindi language. Romani, Domari, Lomavren, and Seb Seliyer (or at least their ancestors) appear to be Central Zone languages that migrated to the Middle East and Europe ca. 500–1000 CE in three distinct waves. Parya is a Central Zone language of Central Asia. To Western Hindi Ethnologue adds Sansi, Powari, Chamari (a spurious language), Bhaya, Gowli (not a separate language), and Ghera. The standard educated Delhi Hindustani pronunciations [ɛː, ɔː] commonly have diphthongal realizations, ranging from [əɪ] to [ɑɪ] and from [əu] to [ɑu], respectively, in Eastern Hindi varieties and many non-standard Western varieties.  There are also vowel clusters /əiː/ and /əuː/.
