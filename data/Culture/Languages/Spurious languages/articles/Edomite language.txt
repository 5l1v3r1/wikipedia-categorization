Edomite was a Canaanite language, very similar to Hebrew, spoken by the Edomites in southwestern Jordan and parts of Israel in the 1st millennium BC. It is known only from a very small corpus. In early times, it seems to have been written with a Phoenician alphabet. Like Moabite, it retained feminine -t. However, in the 6th century BC, it adopted the Aramaic alphabet. Meanwhile, Aramaic or Arabic features such as whb ("gave") and tgr ("merchant") entered the language, with whb becoming especially common in proper names. According to Glottolog, referencing Huehnergard & Rubin (2011), Edomite was not a distinct language from Hebrew but a Hebraic dialect.
