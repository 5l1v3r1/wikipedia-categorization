Michaelis is a brand of dictionaries of the portuguese language published in Brasil by Melhoramentos publishing company. There are also under this brand books about the grammar of a variety of foreign languages. The first Michaelis dictionary was created by the end of the 19th century by the German lexicographer Henriette Michaelis, in a partnership with her sister Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcelos.  The dictionary has versions in the following languages: In July 2015, an online petition was created on Change.org demanding the dictionary to review the definition of "marriage". The definition was, among others, a "legitimate union between man and woman". The petition requested that the word "people" were used instead of "man" and "woman". The petition got more than three thousand endorsements. The director of Melhoramentos abided by and made the requested changes.  Official website
