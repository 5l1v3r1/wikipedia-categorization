Apalachee was a Muskogean language of Florida. It was closely related to Koasati and Alabama.  The language is known primarily from one document, a letter written in 1688 to Charles II of Spain.  Geoffrey Kimball has produced a grammatical sketch (Kimball 1987) and a vocabulary of the language (Kimball 1988) based on the contents of the letter. Haas (1949) showed that Apalachee belonged to the same branch of the Muskogean family as Koasati, Alabama, and Hitchiti. Vowels may also be elongated.
