Português macarrônico (Portuguese pronunciation: [puʁtuˈgez mɐkɐˈʁõniku], "macaronic Portuguese", pronounced [portʊˈgeːz(e) makaˈrɔːniko] by its speakers) is an Italian-Portuguese macaronic language that was widely spoken by Italian immigrants in Brazil (especially in the Greater São Paulo area and elsewhere in the São Paulo state) well into the 1950s. It is not to be confused with the more strongly conserved Talian dialect, based primarily with Venetian lexicon and grammar, and contribution of other northern Italian languages, and spoken by more isolated communities primarily in southern Brazil and Espírito Santo, while macarrônico is a more characteristically urban code-switching that often fades away with time according to the speaker. In spite of its near-extinction, it significantly influenced the Portuguese spoken by people in the state of São Paulo, most importantly when it comes to the paulistano dialect.
