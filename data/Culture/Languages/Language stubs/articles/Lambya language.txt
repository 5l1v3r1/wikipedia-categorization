Lambya (Rambia) is a Bantu language of Tanzania and Malawi. In Northern Malawi it is spoken particularly in the Chitipa District.  Sukwa, once thought to be a dialect of Nyakyusa, is now considered to be a dialect of Lambya.  The University of Malawi Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi (2006), agreeing with this, found that the three languages Cilambya, Cindali, and Cisukwa form a single dialect group, although there are differences between them, especially between Cilambya and the other two. For example: The Language Mapping Survey gives further vocabulary and also a short text (the Tortoise and the Hare) in all three dialects.
