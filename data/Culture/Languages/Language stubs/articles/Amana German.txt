Amana German (German: Amana-Deutsch or Kolonie-Deutsch) is a dialect of West Central German that is still spoken by several hundred people in the Amana Colonies in Iowa. The Amana Colonies were founded in 1856 by Inspirationalists of German origin who came from West Seneca near Buffalo in New York. Amana is derived from the Hessian dialect, which is a West Central German dialect. There are seven villages in Amana with slightly different dialect features. Even though the use of the language is in decline, it is far from being moribund. There are several major studies about the language of Amana.
