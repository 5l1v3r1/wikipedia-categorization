Good ol' boy or good old boy is an American English slang term that can have both positive and negative meanings, depending on context and use.  The term is commonplace in the Southern United States. The same phrase with purely positive connotations is used in part of England. The term can be used for well socialized men who live in rural and generally Southern areas. If a man is humble and well thought of, he can be referred to as a good old boy, regardless of his age. It is also commonly applied to men from a family with multi-generational wealth or prestige, or to men who behave like a Southern gentleman. Pejoratively, the phrase can often suggest a man with an anti-intellectual bias or some other intolerant viewpoint.  The phrase also can refer negatively to someone who engages in cronyism among men who have known each other for a long period of time. Collectively, these people are referred to as a good ol' boy network, or an old boys' club. The term is also used in parts of England,  where it refers to a likeable man, typically of middle age or older. In certain countries in the Commonwealth, including the UK, an old boy network or club has a very different meaning involving alumni. The term can also refer to the mixed drink which is a combination of equal parts rum and root beer, typically in large quantities.
