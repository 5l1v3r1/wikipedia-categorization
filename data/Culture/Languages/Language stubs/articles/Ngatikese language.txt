Ngatikese, or Sapwuahfik, is a Micronesian language originating on Sapwuahfik atoll, Federated States of Micronesia.  Of the 700 Ngatikese speakers, only about 450 live on Sapwuahfik.  It was previously considered a dialect of Pohnpeian, but is not particularly intelligible with that language. It is currently considered vulnerable.
