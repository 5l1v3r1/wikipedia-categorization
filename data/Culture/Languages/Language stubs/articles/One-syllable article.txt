A one-syllable article (Chinese: 同音文章; pinyin: Tóngyīn wénzhāng) is a type of constrained writing found in Chinese literature. It takes advantage of the large number of homophones in the Chinese language, particularly when writing in Classical Chinese, due to historic sound changes. Although a one-syllable article's characters have many different meanings, they are all pronounced as the same syllable, although not with the same tone. Therefore, a one-syllable article is comprehensible in writing, but becomes an incomprehensible tongue twister when read aloud, especially in Mandarin Chinese pronunciation. In other regional pronunciations not all syllables may sound alike.
