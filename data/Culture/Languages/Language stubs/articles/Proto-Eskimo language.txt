Proto-Eskimo was the ancestor of the Eskimo languages. It was spoken by Proto-Eskimo groups, also known as the Proto-Yupik and Proto-Inuit. It is linguistically related to the Proto-Aleut language, and both were descended from the Proto-Eskimo-Aleut language.  Comparative studies of Eskimo and Aleut languages suggest that the Proto-Eskimo and Proto-Aleut languages diverged between 4000 and 2000 B.C.E.    Proto-Eskimo is a reconstructed language.   According to the International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, "Eskimo languages show variation primarily in their phonology and lexicon, rather than in syntax. Aleut phonology is quite unremarkable, compared to the interesting phenomena exhibited by most varieties of Eskimo. Proto-Eskimo had four vowels */i a u É™/, but few or none of the long vowels or diphthongs found in the modern languages."
