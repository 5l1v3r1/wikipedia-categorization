The language of the ancient kingdom of Baekje (18 BCE – 660 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, was a Koreanic language, related to Goguryeo language and Silla language.  Chinese records suggest that the Baekje language was same to the Goguryeo language (which is same to the Buyeo language) and mutually intelligible to the Silla language.  梁書 列傳 百濟 : 今言語服章略與高驪同, 行不張拱, 拜不申足則異  (Book of Liang : Baekje language is roughly same to Goguryeo.) 梁書 列傳 新羅 : 語言待百濟而後通焉  (Book of Liang : Silla language has to be translated by Baekje so that they can communicate with China.)
