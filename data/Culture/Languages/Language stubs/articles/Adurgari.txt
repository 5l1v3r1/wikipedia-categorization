Adurgari (ادرغارى) is a secret cant of the nomadic Shaikh Mohammadi tribe of peddlers of Afghanistan, used especially in the presence of outsiders.  It is taught to children around age seven; all adults speak it in addition to Persian and Pashto.  It is not a native language and contains a mixture of words, but resembles Kohistani of Pakistan.
