This is a list of euphemisms for death and dying in the English language. A euphemism is a common word or phrase intended to soften the harshness of a literal meaning. For example, an American-English speaker would understand the phrase "kick the bucket" to mean "to die," as well as to actually kick a bucket. Furthermore, they would understand when each meaning is being used in context. A euphemism is not to be confused with other figures of speech such as a metaphor, which invokes an image by use of implicit comparisons (e.g., "the man of steel" ); a simile, which invokes an image by use of explicit comparisons (e.g., "faster than a speeding bullet"); and hyperbole, which exaggerates an image beyond truthfulness (e.g., like "missed by a mile" ). Euphemisms are also not to be confused with proverbs, which are simple sayings that express a truth based on common sense or practical experience. [clarification needed]
