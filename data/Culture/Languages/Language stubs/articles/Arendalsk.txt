Arendalsk, Arendal dialect or Arendal Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk: Arendalsk, Arendalsdialekten; the Arendal dialect: Ændalsk) is a dialect of Norwegian used in Arendal. According to the linguist Gjert Kristoffersen, a recent change is that the postvocalic /ʀ/ is vocalized to [æ̯], rather than dropped. The phonetic diphthongs [ʉæ̯] and [uæ̯] may be monophthongized and lowered to, respectively, [œː] and [ɔː], so that the words for 'to do gymnastics' and 'thorn' (which phonemically are, respectively, /²tʉʀne/ and /²tuʀne/) vary in their phonetic realization between, respectively, [²tʉæ̯nə ~ ²tœːnə] and [²tuæ̯nə ~ ²tɔːnə]. This process may be extended to mid vowels.  Tonemes of the Arendal dialect are the same as those of the Oslo dialect; accent 1 is low-rising, whereas accent 2 is falling-rising.
