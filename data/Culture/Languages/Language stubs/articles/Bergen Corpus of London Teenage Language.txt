The Bergen Corpus of London Teenage Language (COLT) is a data set of samples of spoken English that was compiled in 1993 from tape recorded and transcribed conversations by teens between the ages of 13 and 17 in London schools.   This corpus, which has been tagged for part of speech using the CLAWS 6 tagset, is one of the linguistic research projects housed at the University of Bergen in Norway .  Linguistic analysis based on this corpus material has appeared in the book Trends in Teenage Talk  and later journal articles.
