Macro-Andean is a speculative proposal by Kaufman (2007) linking languages of the northern Andes.  Kaufman (1990) found lexical support for proposals linking the Jivaro–Cahuapanan families as suggested by Swadesh and others. By 2007 he had tentatively added Saparo–Yawan, which is itself provisional, and Bora–Witoto. Kaufman (2007) posits the following membership. The unclassified languages Urarina, Puelche, Sabela, Taushiro, Omurano are included in the Kawapanan and Yawan branches.
