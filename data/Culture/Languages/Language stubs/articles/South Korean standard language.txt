South Korean standard language or Pyojun-eo (Hangul: 표준어; Hanja: 標準語) is the South Korean standard version of the Korean language. It is based on the Seoul dialect. It uses the hangeul alphabet, created in December 1443 by Joseon-era king Sejong the Great. It also occasionally uses Hanja, too.  Differing from the North Korean standard language, the South Korean standard language includes many loan-words from Chinese, as well as some from English and from other European languages.
