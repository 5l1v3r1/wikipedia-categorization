Musical languages are constructed languages based on musical sounds, which tend to incorporate articulation.  Unlike tonal languages and whistled languages where pitches and length are both undefined and not as important as to how a tone is stressed or bent, musical languages distinguish pitches and how the pitches are accented or shifted.  Whistled languages are dependent on an underlying spoken languages and are used in various cultures as a means for communication over distance, or as secret codes.  The mystical concept of a language of the birds tries to connect the two categories, since some authors of musical a priori languages have speculated about a mystical or primeval origin of the whistled languages. There are only a few language families as of now such as the Solresol language family, Moss language family, and Nibuzigu language family.  The Solresol family is a family of a posteriori languages (usually English) where a sequence of 7 notes of the western C-Major scale or the 12 tone chromatic scale are used as phonemes. The Nibuzigu family Other These other types are not considered full languages.
