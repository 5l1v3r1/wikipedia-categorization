Bidau Creole Portuguese (Português de Bidau) was a Portuguese-based creole language that was spoken in Bidau, an eastern suburb of Dili, East Timor until the 1960s, when the speakers shifted to standard Portuguese. Bidau Creole Portuguese grew out of the Portuguese spoken by settlers and Mestiços from Flores Island, influenced by languages introduced to the area by military men from Lifau. It shares a number of features with nearby creoles such as Macanese.
