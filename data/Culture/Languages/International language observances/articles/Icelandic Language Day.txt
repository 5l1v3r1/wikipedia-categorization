Icelandic Language Day (Icelandic: dagur íslenskrar tungu or "day of the Icelandic tongue") is celebrated on 16 November each year in Iceland. This date was chosen to coincide with the birthday of the Icelandic poet Jónas Hallgrímsson.  The Minister of Education awards the Jónas Hallgrímsson Award to someone who has “in a unique way contributed to the Icelandic language”.
