⊣  Hindi Divas or Hindi day (हिन्दी दिवस) is an annual day celebrated on 14 September in India to celebrate the popularity of Hindi as an official language of India. Mostly this celebration is a government sponsored event in Central government, but many private organizations and voluntary groups also celebrate the day. Hindi Divas is celebrated on 14 September because on this day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India had adopted Hindi written in Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India. But this didn't come as easily as it sounds. To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favor of Hindi, most notable person  Beohar Rajendra Simha along with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Kaka Kalelkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt and Seth Govind Das who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following adoption of Hindi as the official language.  This decision was ratified by the Constitution of India that came into effect on 26 January 1950. Under the Article 343 of the Indian Constitution, Hindi written in Devanagari script was adopted as the official language. In all, there are 22 Scheduled languages of India, of which, two are officially used at Union government of India level: Hindi and English.  Hindi is spoken by 250 million people as the original language and it is the fourth language of the world. Apart from local-level events in schools and other institutions, a few of the notable events include Ministry of Home Affairs in its order dated 25 March 2015 has changed name of two awards given annually on Hindi Divas. 'Indira Gandhi Rajbhasha Puraskar' instituted in 1986 changed to 'Rajbhasha Kirti Puraskar'  and 'Rajiv Gandhi Rashtriya Gyan-Vigyan Maulik Pustak Lekhan Puraskar' changed to "Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar".
