A number of sources have compiled lists of languages by their number of speakers. However, all such lists should be used with caution. The following 28 languages are listed as having 50 million or more total speakers in the 2017 edition of Ethnologue, a language reference published by SIL International, which is based in the United States.   Ethnologue also lists other languages as having 50 million or more total speakers: for example, the Wikipedia page for the Tagalog language reports 70+ million speakers by as early as 2000 and 73+ million speakers by 2013: 28 million L1 (first language) speakers as of 2007 and 45 million L2 (second language) speakers as of 2013; these are largely based on Ethnologue reports and would, unless further updated, rank it as the language with the 26th most L1 speakers, the 13th most L2 speakers, and the 23rd most speakers in total.  Speaker totals are generally not reliable, as they add together estimates from different dates and (usually uncited) sources; language information is not collected on most national censuses.
