A number of languages of North America are too poorly attested to classify. These include Adai, Beothuk, Calusa, Cayuse, Cotoname, Karankawa, Solano.  There are other languages which are scarcely attested at all. Campbell et al. (2007) list the following extinct and nearly unattested language varieties of North America as unclassifiable due to lack of data.  * Ethnographic evidences suggests these varieties might have been Uto-Aztecan.   See Uto-Aztecan languages#Extinct languages for more.
