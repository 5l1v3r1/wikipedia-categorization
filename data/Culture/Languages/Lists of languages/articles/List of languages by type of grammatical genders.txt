This article lists languages depending on their approach to grammatical gender. Certain language families, such as the Austronesian, Turkic and Uralic language families have no grammatical genders (see genderless language). In these languages, animate nouns are predominantly of common gender, while inanimate nouns may be of either gender. In many such languages, what is commonly termed "animacy" may in fact be more accurately described as a distinction between human and non-human, rational and irrational, "socially active" and "socially passive" etc. Note: in Slavic languages marked with an asterisk (*), traditionally only masculine, feminine and neuter genders are recognized, with animacy as a separate category for the masculine and feminine (in East Slavic languages) or masculine only (elsewhere); the actual situation is similar to Czech.
