The Mayan languages are a family of languages spoken by the Maya people. The Maya form a group of approximately 7 million people descendant from an ancient Mesoamerican civilization and spread across the modern-day countries of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. They speak descendant languages from their original Proto-Mayan language, and some of their languages were recorded in the form of glyphs of a Mayan script. The languages are shown along with their population estimates, as available. .
