Lotegorisch or Lottegorisch (older own description: lochne kodesch, from the Hebrew: laschonâ€Ž = "tongue, language", and kodesch = "holy") is a trading language and Palatine variant of the secret language, Rotwelsch, spoken in the Leiningerland (especially in Carlsberg), where in the late 18th century a large number of vagrants, including many Jews, were settled and where many of them worked as itinerant craftsmen and peddlers.
