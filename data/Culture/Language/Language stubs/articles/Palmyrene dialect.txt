Palmyrene or Palmyrenean was a Western Aramaic dialect  spoken in the city of Palmyra, Syria, in the early centuries AD. The development of cursive versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the Palmyrene alphabet. Other West Aramaic dialects include Nabataean  and Judeo-Aramaic. West Aramaic dialects continue to be spoken in three villages in Syria: Maaloula, Bakh`a and Jubb`adin.
