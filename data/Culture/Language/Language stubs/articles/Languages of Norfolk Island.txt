There are two official languages of Norfolk Island, English and Norfuk.  English, due to the influence of Great Britain and Australia, the two colonial powers who administered Norfolk Island, is the dominant language of the pair.  Norfuk, a creole language based on English and Tahitian and brought to the island by the descendants of the Bounty mutineers from Pitcairn Island was spoken by 580 persons according to the 1989 census. It is closely related to Pitkern spoken on Pitcairn Island.
