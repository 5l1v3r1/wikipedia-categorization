Hakuchi (Xakuchi; Хьакӏуцубзэ [ħaːkʷʼət͡sʷəbza] Kh′ak′ucubză or Къарацхаибзэ Qaracxaibză in Hakuchi Adyghe) is a variety of the Shapsug sub-dialect of West Adyghe dialect of Adyghe language spoken in Turkey. The dialect is phonologically peculiar when compared to the other Adyghe sub-dialects. Its lexicon and consonantal system are substantially affected by the Ubykh language, the first language of many Hakuchi speakers before its death. Hakuchi Adyghe is one of the most divergent dialects from the literary dialect of Adyghe. The Hakuchi has an uvular ejective [qʼ] and a labialized uvular ejective [qʷʼ]  that correspond to West Adyghe and Kabardian Adyghe glottal stop [ʔ] and labialized glottal stop [ʔʷ].
