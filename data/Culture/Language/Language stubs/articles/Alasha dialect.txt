Alasha ([ɑɮʃɑ], in some Mongolian varieties [ɑɮɑ̆ɡʃɑ] ); Mongolian script ᠠᠯᠠᠱᠠ Alaša, Chinese: 阿拉善; pinyin: Ālāshàn), or Alaša-Eǰen-e, is a Mongolic variety with features of both Oirat and Mongolian  that historically used to belong to Oirat but has come under the influence of Mongolian proper. It has more than 40,000 speakers in Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, China and consists of two sub-dialects, Alasha proper and Eǰene.  /pɑɢ/ 'small' vs. /pɑɡ/ 'group', therefore /ɢ/. /øt͡səɡtər/, thus affricate depalatalization took place for /t͡ʃʰ/ and /t͡ʃ/ in any position except before *i.  /ɪr/ 'to thrust open' vs. /ir/ 'to come', thus /ɪ/.  The maximal syllable is CVCC, e.g. /tʰers.let/ converbal form of 'to counteract'.
