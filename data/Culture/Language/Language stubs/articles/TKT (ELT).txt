The Teaching Knowledge Test, or TKT, is a professional credential that focuses on core teaching concepts for teachers of English as a foreign language. It should not be compared to the CELTA because it does not have a practical teaching component and focuses more on the specialized language and abstracted concepts of ELT than on the actual application of ELT concepts in lesson preparation and delivery. TKT assessment takes the form of a multiple choice test, made up of three modules, which can be taken together, or separately in any order.
