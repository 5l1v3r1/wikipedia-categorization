The West Polesian microlanguage  (Native name: Заходышнополіська волода, Zakhodyshnopoliska voloda; Ukrainian: Західнополіська мікромова, Zakhidnopolis'ka mikromova; Belarusian: Заходнепалеская мікрамова, Zakhodniepalieskaya mikramova) or dialect is spoken in Southwestern Belarus, in Northwestern Ukraine and in the bordering regions of Poland. It is also considered a Slavic microlanguage, in effect a transitional language between Ukrainian and the Belarusian.  Its composition is said to be 40 percent Ukrainian, 5 percent Belarusian, 5 percent Polish, and 50 percent Polesian.  West Polesian dialects are mostly used in everyday speech, though attempts have been made in 1990s by efforts of Nikolai Shelyagovich to develop a standard written language for the dialect.
