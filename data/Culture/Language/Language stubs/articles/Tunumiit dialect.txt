Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic (Kalaallisut: tunumiusut, East Greenlandic: tunumiisut) is a variety of Greenlandic spoken in eastern Greenland by the Tunumiit. It is generally considered a divergent dialect of Greenlandic, but verges on being a distinct language.   The largest town where it is the primary language is Tasiilaq on Ammassalik Island, with the Island's name being derived from the West Greenlandic name of the town.
