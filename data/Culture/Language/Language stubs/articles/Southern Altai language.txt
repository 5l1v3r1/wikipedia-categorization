Southern Altai (also known as Oirot, Oyrot, Altai and Altai proper) is a Turkic language spoken in the Altai Republic - a mountainous region in Southern Siberia in Russia on the border with Mongolia and China. The language has some mutual intelligibility with the Northern Altai language. And the two were traditionally considered to be a single language, but according to modern classifications - at least since the middle of the XXth century - they are considered to be two separate languages.  The written Altai is based on Southern Altai. According to some reports, however, it is rejected by Northern Altai children. Dialects include Altai Proper and Talangit.
