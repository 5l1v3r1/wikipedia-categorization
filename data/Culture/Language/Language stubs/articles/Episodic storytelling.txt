Episodic storytelling is when a story is narrated through episodes, as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in literature to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is serial. Serials are also known as episodic fiction.  Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a series through a unifying story arc. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same story world.
