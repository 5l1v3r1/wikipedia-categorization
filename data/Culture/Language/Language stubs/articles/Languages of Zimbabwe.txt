Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, namely Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, Koisan, Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, sign language, Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda, and Xhosa.  Due to its history as both a British Colony and as the State of Rhodesia, English, Shona and Ndebele are the most widely spoken languages in the country.  Approximately 70% of the population is Shona speaking and speaks Shona as their first language.  Also it is said that around 20% are Ndebele and speak IsiNdebele as their first language. These statistics have not been officialised yet because Zimbabwe has never conducted a census that enumerated people according to languages.
