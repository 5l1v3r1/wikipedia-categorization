Pomor dialects are a group of Northern Russian dialects widespread among the Pomors of the former Arkhangelsk Governorate and northern parts of the Olonets and Vologda Governorates. The dialects are heavily influenced by the Old Novgorod dialect and there are a significant number of archaisms and borrowings from Uralic and Scandinavian languages. The study of the Pomor dialects was undertaken by I. S. Merkuryev (1924-2001), a professor of philology and author of several books including Живая речь кольских поморов ("The Living Speech of the Kola Peninsula Pomors"). The Pomor dialects are widely used in the works of the writers and folklorists Boris Shergin and Stepan Pisakhov.  Influences from them can be seen in the poetry of Nikolai Klyuev. Pomor dialects are spoken in the animated films of Leonid Nosyrev (Леонид Викторович Носырев), many which are adaptations of stories by Shergin and Pisakhov.  One example is Laughter and Grief by the White Sea (1987).
