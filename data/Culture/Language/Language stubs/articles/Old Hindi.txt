Old Hindi (Hindi: पुरानी हिंदी, translit. Purānī Hindī) was the earliest stage of the Khariboli dialect of the Hindi language, and so the ancestor of Modern Standard Hindi. It was spoken by the peoples of the Hindi belt, especially around Delhi, in roughly the 13th–15th centuries. It is attested in only a handful of literature, including some works by the poet Amir Khusrau and some verses by the Sufi saint Baba Farid in the Adi Granth. :54 The works of Kabir also may be included, as they use a Khariboli-like dialect. The language ultimately gave way to Hindustani.
