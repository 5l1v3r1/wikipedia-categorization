Kurbetcha (or Gurbetcha) is a creole language with what appears to be predominantly Romani vocabulary and Cypriot Turkish grammar, spoken by the Kurbet (Roma) of Cyprus. The Kurbet have traditionally also spoken Turkish. The majority settled in the north after 1974, but many of those have returned to the south (i.e. the areas under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus) in recent years. Kurbetcha has been very little studied. Children are not learning the language; it has been supplanted by Turkish in the north and Greek in the south.
