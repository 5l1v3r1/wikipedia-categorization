Legibility is the ease with which a reader can recognize individual characters in text. "The legibility of a typeface is related to the characteristics inherent in its design â€¦ which relate to the ability to distinguish one letter from the other."  Aspects of type design that affect legibility include "x-height, character shapes, stroke contrast, the size of its counters, serifs or lack thereof, and weight."  Legibility is different from readability. Readability is the ease with which a reader can recognize words, sentences, and paragraphs. Legibility is a component of readability. Other typographic factors that affect readability include font choice, point size, kerning, tracking, line length, leading, and justification.
