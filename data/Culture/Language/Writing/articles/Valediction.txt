A valediction (derivation from Latin vale dicere, "to say farewell"),  or complimentary close in American English,  is an expression used to say farewell, especially a word or phrase used to end a letter or message,   or the act of saying parting words whether brief or extensive. Its greeting counterpart is called a salutation. The term is also used to refer to the speech given by a valedictorian at a commencement and to refer to final prayers and remarks at the graveside before a burial. Valedictions normally immediately precede the signature in written correspondence. The word or words used express respect, esteem, or regard for the person to whom the correspondence is directed, and the exact form used depends on a number of factors.   In British English, valedictions have largely been replaced by the use of "Yours sincerely" or "Yours faithfully". "Yours sincerely" is typically employed in English when the recipient is addressed by name (e.g. "Dear John") and is known to the sender to some degree, whereas "Yours faithfully" is used when the recipient is not addressed by name (i.e. the recipient is addressed by a phrase such as "Dear Sir/Madam") or when the recipient is not known personally by the sender.  The following table contains complimentary closings as recommended for business hard-letter use by two American authorities: Barron's Educational Series  and American Management Association.  A diplomatic note verbale always ends with an elaborate valediction, most commonly "[Sender] avails itself of this opportunity to renew to [recipient] the assurances of its highest consideration".  Valedictions in formal e-mail are similar to valedictions in letters; on the whole, they are variations of "regards" and "yours".  However, a wide range of popular valedictions are used in casual e-mail but very rarely in letters.  Current regulations of the United States Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Navy call for two complimentary closings for letters: "Respectfully yours" and "Sincerely". "Respectfully yours" is reserved for the President, except the Army includes the President's spouse, and for the President-elect. "Sincerely" is used in all other cases.        For more informal (but still professional) correspondence among military service members, "Very respectfully" is used. This is often abbreviated as "V/R."  The Commander of the Navy's school in the military's "Mustang University"  stated his preference, in 2014, that the older "Very respectfully" be used in letters to someone senior in pay-grade or positional authority. However, the Commander acknowledged that current regulations call for "Sincerely" and told students they were free to follow that practice.  in written form, valediction is very important in Bengali. When writing official letters, general customs are: In oral form, various forms are used  Valedictions in Chinese are highly variable and reflect the relative social status of the sender and recipient.  Salutation (問候語) is traditionally placed after valediction (申悃語) and the closing of the main body of the letter, as opposed to its typical location in English.  Traditional valediction include: Standard French language valedictions tend to be much more complex than standard English ones, more akin to older English valedictions. They show a fair degree of variation, for example: Or: Or: In the latter case of a formula beginning with the first person, the valediction is often enhanced with a participial phrase concluding the sense of the letter (since traditionally it is not considered appropriate to begin a paragraph with the first person singular je in a letter): A number of rules concern the use of these formulae: Such formulae may be used even in more friendly letters, often with the adjective cher or chère for the recipient. Letters to dignitaries may use even more grandiose styles, such as: or more commonly: According to French typographic rules, the proper capitalization for the official title is "Premier ministre" although people who mimic English titles or fear that they might appear disrespectful often use more capitals than the rules commend. Another French typographic rule states that when addressing someone, styles like Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle, should never be abbreviated, even if followed by a title (hence, writing M. le Premier Ministre or Mme l'Ambassadeur would be considered clumsy). Much shorter styles may be used in brief notes (Sincères salutations), and informal letters (such as between intimates) may use expressions such as (with approximate English equivalents – not literal translations): Unlike in English, when the letter writer has a title that is unique in his or her organization, it is placed before, not after, the name: Valedictions in German, while a lot less complex than those in French, are similarly flexible. The highly formal form Hochachtungsvoll (lit. "highly respectfully") has been practically obsolete for many years and is very rarely used in modern German, except for highly formal correspondence from authorities or in letters with a highly negative connotation where "friendliness" would not be appropriate. The standard business valediction is Mit freundlichen Grüßen (lit. "with friendly regards") and is equivalent to Yours sincerely or Yours faithfully in English. A more seldom used variant of this is Mit freundlichem Gruß, which is as above but in the singular form. Other semi-formal alternatives include (roughly in descending order of formality) Mit besten Grüßen (lit. "with best regards"), Beste Grüße, Mit herzlichen Grüßen (lit. "with cordial regards"), Viele Grüße (lit. "many regards"), Schöne Grüße (lit. "nice regards"). German valedictions also offer the possibility of adding your location, e.g. Mit freundlichen Grüßen aus Berlin to added effect. While this is no less formal, it does have a more "relaxed" feel to it.  Other less formal location-centric variations are also possible, such as Viele Grüße aus dem sonnigen Barcelona (lit. "many regards from sunny Barcelona"). These valedictions are also often adapted to specific professions, states or political views. For example, it is common to use Mit solidarischen Grüßen ("with regards in solidarity") among socialist and communist groups, Mit gewerkschaftlichen Grüßen (lit. "with union regards") or Mit kollegialen Grüßen (lit. "with cooperative regards") among labour union members, Mit kameradschaftlichen Grüßen (lit. "with comradely regards") among military personnel, Mit sportlichen Grüßen ("with sporting regards") among sportspeople, and Mit gebärdenfreundlichen Grüßen ("with friendly regards in sign language") among persons hard of hearing. More familiar valedictions in German follow the same formula. Alles Liebe or (Viele) liebe Grüße are common in German for friends or family. Friends or close colleagues among each other may use simply Gruß. It is possible in informal and rapid e-mail communication to sometimes use abbreviations of the forms, unlike in English. In this way, Mit freundlichen Grüßen may be shortened to MfG and Liebe Grüße may be shortened to LG. A popular form in Germany in recent years, hdl (habe dich lieb, lit. "am fond of you") and hdgdl (habe dich ganz doll lieb, lit. "am very fond of you", for somewhere between "I like you" and "I love you") has found increased usage in SMS text messaging and e-mails in more intimate relationships. Judges have deemed that Section 86a of the German Criminal Code forbids the use of Mit deutschem Gruß (lit. "with German regards"), as it has National Socialist overtones.  Formal letters in Hebrew often end with "b'chavod (rav*)" (Hebrew: בכבוד *רב, lit: with (great*) honor) or somewhat less formal "bivracha" (Hebrew: בברכה, lit: with blessing). The informal ones may use "kol toov" (Hebrew: כל טוב, lit: all the best). For an intimate, you might end a letter or email with "mitga'ageah" (m) or "mitga'aga'at" (f) -- missing you.  Jews in the United States often use "B'shalom" or "shalom" (Hebrew: בשלום, lit: in peace) within Jewish circles, for example, from a Rabbi to his congregation.  This is an American Jewish usage, rarely heard from native speakers of Hebrew.  "B'shalom" is incorrect, as it is religiously tantamount to wishing death on someone.  Indeed, the Talmud says: "In bidding farewell to the living one should not say, 'Go with peace' [lech b'shalom], but 'Go to peace' [lech l'shalom], because [King] David said to [his son] Absalom, 'Go with peace', and he went and was hanged; whereas Jethro said to Moses, 'Go to peace', and he went and succeeded." [Talmud, Moed Katan 29a]  Hungarian valedictions are extendable, which makes a number of variations on the above expressions possible, such as "Őszinte tisztelettel" ("With sincere appreciation") or "Szívélyes üdvözlettel" ("With cordial regards"). Formal valedictions should end with a comma followed by a paragraph where the valedictor's name (and optionally his status) is identified. Depending on the occasion, different degrees of formality are adequate, ranging from highly formal (e.g. solemn occasions) to totally informal (e.g. a conversation among friends). Some formal valedictions can be used at different formality degrees, but almost never in informal situations.
