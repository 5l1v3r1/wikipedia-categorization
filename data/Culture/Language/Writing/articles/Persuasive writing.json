Many writings such as critics, reviews, reaction papers, editorials, proposals, advertisements, and brochures use different ways of persuasion to influence readers.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Three_common_techniques_in_persuasive_writing\">Three common techniques in persuasive writing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Persuasive_writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Three common techniques in persuasive writing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>1.</b> Presenting strong evidence, such as facts and statistics, statements of expert authorities, and research findings establishes credibility. Readers will more likely be convinced to side with the writer\u2019s position or agree with his or her opinion if it is backed up by verifiable evidence. \n</p><p><b>2.</b> Concrete, relevant, and reasonable examples can enhance the writer\u2019s idea or opinion. They can be based on observations or from the writer\u2019s personal experience. \n</p><p><b>3.</b> Accurate, current, and balanced information adds to the credibility of persuasive writing. The writer does not only present evidence that favor his or her ideas, but he or she also acknowledges some evidence that opposes his or her own. In the writing, though, his or her ideas would be sounder.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ethos.2C_logos.2C_and_pathos\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ethos,_logos,_and_pathos\">Ethos, logos, and pathos</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Persuasive_writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Ethos, logos, and pathos\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Ethos</b> is the appeal to ethics. It convinces the audience of the credibility of the writer. The writer\u2019s expertise on his or her subject matter lends to such credibility. The level of education and profession of the writer also come into play.\n</p><p><b>Logos</b> is the appeal to logic and reason. It is the most commonly accepted mode in persuasion because it aims to be scientific in its approach to argumentation. In writing, facts are presented in a logical manner, and faulty logic is avoided.\n</p><p><b>Pathos</b> is the appeal to emotion. This aims to convince the audience by appealing to human emotions. Emotions such as sympathy, anger, and sadness motivate humans; using pathos will then get the audience to be emotionally invested in the subject of the writing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Persuasive_writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1251\nCached time: 20180912131322\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.071 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 138/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4353/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 91/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.020/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 836 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   58.399      1 -total\n 85.86%   50.140      1 Template:Unreferenced\n 55.16%   32.211      1 Template:Ambox\n 13.95%    8.149      1 Template:Reflist\n  3.20%    1.866      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:7154403-0!canonical and timestamp 20180912131322 and revision id 847426690\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Persuasive Writing","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_June_2018"},{"sortkey":"Persuasive Writing","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Persuasive Writing","*":"Persuasion"},{"sortkey":"Persuasive Writing","*":"Writing"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from June 2018"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Three common techniques in persuasive writing","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Persuasive_writing","byteoffset":295,"anchor":"Three_common_techniques_in_persuasive_writing"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Ethos, logos, and pathos","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Persuasive_writing","byteoffset":1124,"anchor":"Ethos,_logos,_and_pathos"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Persuasive_writing","byteoffset":1920,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Persuasive writing","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Persuasive Writing"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7170782"}]}}
