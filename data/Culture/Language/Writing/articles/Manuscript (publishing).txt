"Manuscript" is a broad concept in publishing, that can refer to one or both of the following:  A manuscript is the work that an author submits to a publisher, editor, or producer for publication. Even with the advent of desktop publishing, making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally typeset, many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors,  style guides are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."  Manuscript formatting (also named standard manuscript format) depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over style guides.  An ordinary manuscript only becomes a "publisher's preprint" if it somehow gets distributed beyond the authors (or the occasional colleague whom they ask for advice), but the "publisher" here is a loose concept. Illustrating: In both contexts, a future "final print" is planned – with better layout, proofreading and some kind of prepress proofing – that will replace the "preprinted manuscript".
