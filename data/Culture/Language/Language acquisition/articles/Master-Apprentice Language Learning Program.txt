The Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program is a program to help younger community members learn their language of heritage with fluent elders in the community, typically in the form of a summer program.  The program was developed by Leanne Hinton, working with the Native California Network and its subsidiary committee, the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival. The program was developed in collaboration with the speakers of six indigenous California languages: Karuk, Hupa, Yurok, Wintu, Yowlumne, and Mojave.  The MALLP ran for the first time in the summer of 1993, and has grown each year since its inception.  By 1996, only three years after it began, the program funded 26 teams, covering the original six languages, as well as Patwin, Paiute, and Kiliwa.  Since its creation, the program has been adopted by several other endangered indigenous language groups, including Aboriginal groups in Australia   and British Columbia, Canada, where it is now referred to as the Mentor-Apprentice Program.   Onowa McIvor and Peter Jacobs from the University of Victoria, in particular, conducted a study of Mentor-Apprentice learners in BC and determined that this program is particularly effective for teaching adults.   The main goal of the MALLP is that the apprentice attains proficiency in their language over a few years, through the creation of mini-immersion settings within each team.  To create the mini-immersion settings, the teams are encouraged to go about their daily lives as normal, for a minimum number of hours per week, but to always communicate in the language that is being learned.  The program incorporates techniques from several language-learning programs, including Total Physical Response.   The MALLP is based on ten main points:
