Then, there must be a need for using the language as a form of communication, which will thus force and motivate the learner to consistently speak in that language. In addition, opportunities for language use should come in diverse forms, like spoken or written, and in various contexts, like in school, at home or during peer interaction, so that the child would learn how to adapt to and apply the language appropriately in different situations, using mediums, with different people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Kohnert,_K._2008_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Kohnert,_K._2008-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Parents are crucial here because they are essentially the key provider of a child\u2019s L2 learning opportunities.

Motive refers to the purpose of learning and communicating in that specific language. The motive is determined by the interaction between environmental needs and opportunities as well as personal preferences, which is dependent on social contexts. \n</p><p>For learning an L2, there are two forms of motive: Integrative Motivation and Instrumental Motivation.

Developing a certain level of proficiency in the language becomes necessary because the community which one wants to immerse oneself into uses the target language in its social interactions. Thus, in order to operate socially in the community and become one of its members, one has to be sufficiently proficient in that target language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In contrast, Instrumental motivation is the opposite. People who are instrumentally motivated to learn a language acquires that language because they want to benefit from that language, like gaining something practical or concrete.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> There is a practical purpose for acquiring an L2, such as meeting the requirements for school or university graduation, applying for a job, requesting higher pay based on language ability, or even achieving higher social status. Here, there is little or no desire for social integration of the learner into a community.\n</p><p>While both integrative and instrumental motivation are essential elements of successful language acquisition, research have determined integrative motivation as the main element in long-term success sustenance when learning a second language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For communication purposes, which language a bilingual chooses to speak, motive may interact with both the listener\u2019s identity and the environmental context\u2014one language may be preferred to communicate with a parent or child, another to complete a business transaction. The social status or prestige associated with a language could also motivate one to use that specific language. For example, United States being a political and economic powerhouse, the motivation to learn and acquire English is huge. Young immigrants in this country are spurred to learn English as fast as possible, mostly within a single generation,<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> and many third-generation immigrants speak only English, with little or no ability in the language of their grandparents.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Obstacles_faced_when_acquiring_second_language\">Obstacles faced when acquiring second language</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Obstacles faced when acquiring second language\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Familial_and_Cultural_factors\">Familial and Cultural factors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Familial and Cultural factors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Parental and family support are important because they are the key providers to the child\u2019s L2 learning and acquisition opportunities. They provide access to L2 learning and also to the use of the language, not only because they interact with the child the most often and therefore are the people whom the child can most often practice and use the L2 they learned, parents can also determine who the child interacts with and thus determine their opportunities for L2 use outside the family context.\n</p><p>However, as there is the risk that the child would lose competence in their native language, which is especially so if the L2 is considered to be of a higher prestige than the native language and is more useful and beneficial to the speaker in more contexts than the other, parents might disapprove L2 acquisition because they see their native language as a form of identity and their heritage and do not want their child to lose it. Furthermore, if the parent holds negative attitudes towards the L2, they might transfer these negative attitudes to the child, and thus reducing the child's motivation to learn the language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Also, low socioeconomic status is another obstacle because even if the family supports L2 learning, they might not have sufficient income to provide the adequate resources and help required for learning an L2. Parents are financially incapable of enrolling their children in language classes, neither are they able to afford textbooks, reading and practice materials for their children to learn and practice.\nAll these are possible factors acting as L2 acquisition barriers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Individual_Factors\">Individual Factors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Individual Factors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In addition to biological, psychological and physical deficits, like hearing loss, mental retardation, motor deficits, neurological or psychiatric disorders, impairment in auditory system, as well as inability to extract linguistic features and impairment in representational or symbolic reasoning, there are other individual factors that could act as barriers to L2 acquisition.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Affective_factors_and_Age\">Affective factors and Age</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Affective factors and Age\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The learner's emotional state or affect can interfere with acquiring a new language because acquiring a new language inevitably involves practicing it in public and conversing with others. All these encompassed the possibility of making mistakes, resulting in embarrassment, and such anxiety can block the ability to receive and process new information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Thus, high self-consciousness and a reluctance to reveal their weaknesses and faults, coupled with feelings of vulnerability could greatly impede second language learning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\nFear of embarrassment has been found to occur more in adults than children because adults are more self-conscious about speaking, making errors and are more easily demoralized by pronunciation difficulties.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> In addition, the <a href=\"/wiki/Critical_Period_Hypothesis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Critical Period Hypothesis\">Critical Period Hypothesis</a> states that younger learners have certain advantages over older learners in language learning that allows them to learn L2 easily and quickly in comparison to older children. When the critical period is over, it is nearly impossible to reach native-like proficiency in one\u2019s second language and even those who learn a language fluently are probably recognized as having an accent. Although they can achieve expertise in a written language, they face problems in spoken language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Hence, age can also be regarded as an influential factor determining the quality of second language learning.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Self-belief_and_Motivation_.28Low_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Self-belief_and_Motivation_(Low_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation)\">Self-belief and Motivation (Low intrinsic and extrinsic motivation)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Self-belief and Motivation (Low intrinsic and extrinsic motivation)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Motivation undoubtedly has a profound impact on second language learning as well. There are two kinds of motivation, namely Integrative (intrinsic) and (instrumental) extrinsic motivation, as have been mentioned above. Intrinsically motivated students engage in the learning process because they are truly interested and enjoy the learning process; whereas extrinsically motivated learners learn in order to gain a reward or to avoid punishment. It has been shown that intrinsically motivated goals are more likely to achieve long-term success. Furthermore, self-belief has been acknowledged as able to potentially influence effort and persistence invested in acquiring a desired level of second-language competence. Self-belief comprises two components: Self-efficacy beliefs and self-concept beliefs. The former refers to one\u2019s own belief as to whether he or she is capable of performing a given learning task and are consequently future-oriented; whereas the latter involves evaluations of one\u2019s general self-worth based on past experiences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> It is said that low self-efficacy beliefs would pose as an obstacle in language learning because it indicates a lack of self-confidence and thus reduces the motivation to learn.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"L1_Interference\">L1 Interference</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: L1 Interference\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Language_transfer\" title=\"Language transfer\">Language transfer</a></div>\n<p>L1 interference in bilingual language acquisition generally refers to the influence that the learner\u2019s L1 exerts over the acquisition of an L2.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Habits have been formed during L1 acquisition will influence the L2 learning process, either facilitate or hinder L2 learning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>  The more similar L1 is with L2, the greater ease learners have with learning the L2 structures.

Education help bilinguals develop higher level of language literacy and proficiency in terms of language structure, vocabulary, syntax, phonology, morphology, literacy and communicative purposes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Some key factors critical to a good <a href=\"/wiki/Bilingual_education\" title=\"Bilingual education\">Bilingual education</a> program includes:<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>1. The type of <a href=\"/wiki/Bilingual_education\" title=\"Bilingual education\">bilingual education</a> program. \nThe type of bilingual education program should match the proficiency and goals of the learner. For example, to foster bilingualism and bi-literacy in mixed language students, two-way/ dual language programs are more effective than immersion programs, which are catered more for students whose L1 is the major language and trying to learn a L2 minority language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>2. Duration of the program. \nThe longer the bilingual education programs, the more significantly effective they are because they allow for L2 learning delay that could negatively impact the acquisition of academic language proficiency in an L2.\n</p><p>3. The ratio of L1 to L2 use at different stages of the program. \nUsually, programs start off with maximum exposure of the curriculum in L2 while progressively increasing the proportion of L1 used, but there are programs which do it the opposite way, and the method used is based on the goals of the program and the learner. However, strict separation of languages of instruction should always be maintained so that the L2 is not subsumed by the L1. \n</p><p>4. Continuity of the program across levels within education systems. \n</p><p>5. Bridging support. \nThis support involves materials to help overcome the initial limitations of the students\u2019 L2 proficiency and also include extra tuition or smaller remedial classes to cater more specifically to difficulties faced by each individual. \n</p><p>6. Sufficient and adequate resources and educational material. \n</p><p>7. Availability of qualified and committed personnel. \nProvision of constant teacher training, and staff-development program for teachers is crucial as teachers are the people who interact with and impart the language skills to the students.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Teachers have to be committed as language acquisition requires a huge amount of time and effort. Additionally, it is important to ensure that teachers are familiar and proficient with the specific educational materials developed so that these material are complementing their teachings.\n</p><p>8. Attitude of the educators toward the culture of the target language. \nTeachers can transfer their attitudes to the students. Hence, if teachers had a negative attitude towards L2, then it might undermine the effort and restrict the success in L2 language acquisition.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Code-switching\">Code-switching</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Code-switching\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Code-switching\" title=\"Code-switching\">Code-switching</a></div>\n<p>Bilinguals tend to <a href=\"/wiki/Code-switching\" title=\"Code-switching\">code-switch</a> when talking to people who understand both their first and second language. Code-switching takes place when a bilingual uses two or more languages in a conversation and this is a natural effect of knowing more than one language. Codeswitching can take place due to a lack of sufficient vocabulary  in one of the languages to express an idea (not to be confused with a lack of sufficient vocabulary knowledge from the speaker) and so the speaker  expresses the idea using another language. However, codeswitching can also be done to convey special emphasis or establish cultural identity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Emotional_Intensity_of_Languages_in_Bilinguals\">Emotional Intensity of Languages in Bilinguals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sequential_bilingualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Emotional Intensity of Languages in Bilinguals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Various studies have found that for bilinguals, the emotional intensity of L1 is different from the emotional intensity of subsequent languages learned.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> These studies concluded that L1 has the highest emotional impact and is the language of personal involvement while L2 is the language that can create distance and detachment as it has lesser emotional impact as compared to L1. \n</p><p>Yet, paradoxically, many late bilinguals indicate that it is harder for them to swear in their L1 as compared to their L2.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> As such they would prefer to use their L2 to swear despite it having lesser emotional impact on the speakers themselves.
