A year later in April 2000, he officially launched the Speak Good English Movement with the tagline 'Speak Well, Be Understood'. He stressed the importance of speaking standard English and reducing the use of Singlish, as Singapore is a hub city and an open economy with a need to interact with English-speaking foreigners. Singaporeans often use Chinese syntax and literal translations of Chinese phrases while speaking English, which make utterances seem truncated and incomprehensible to foreigners. In his rally, the prime minister stressed that \"if we speak a corrupted form of English that is not understood by others, we will lose a key competitive advantage.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The movement was spearheaded by a committee of people in the private sector led by then Colonel (NS) David Wong, a senior adviser with the consulting company <a href=\"/wiki/Ernst_and_Young\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ernst and Young\">Ernst and Young</a>. Its target audience was Singaporeans under 40, which included young working adults, parents and students in schools, tertiary institutes, polytechnics and technical institutes. The launch kick-started a week-long festival packed with events such as plays and a speech marathon.\n</p><p>Later in the year, the public sector also organised year-long programmes as part of the movement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> One such event was the seminar held by the <a href=\"/wiki/Singapore_Teachers%27_Union\" title=\"Singapore Teachers&#39; Union\">Singapore Teachers' Union</a> (STU) at the Shangri-La Hotel, attended by about 500 participants who were mostly teachers.
