The Minister for Irish was a position in the Government of the Irish Republic, the self-declared state which was established in 1919 by Dáil Éireann, the parliamentary assembly made up of the majority of Irish MPs elected in the 1918 general election. The portfolio was created to promote the use of the Irish language throughout the country.  The post was abolished after little over a year in existence, after the conclusion of formal independence negotiations with the UK. In 1956 the position was revived to a certain extent with the creation of the new title of Minister for the Gaeltacht.
