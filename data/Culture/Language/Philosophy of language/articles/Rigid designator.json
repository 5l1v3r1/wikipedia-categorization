If they signify something absolutely, that is, after the manner of substance, they are <b>absolute</b>, for example rock, lion, man, whiteness, wisdom, tallness. If they signify something connotatively, that is, with reference to a subject of inherence, i.e., after the manner of accidents, they are <b>connotative</b>, for example, white, wise, tall.\n</p><p>Both connotative and absolute concepts can be used to signify accidents, but since connotative concepts signify with a reference to a subject of inherence, they can refer to object with different definitions and properties (i.e. with different <i>essences</i>). For example, large, as a connotative concept, can signify objects with many distinct essences: a man, a lion, a triangle can be large.\n</p><p>On the other hand, absolute concepts signify objects that have the same definitions and properties. For example, the concept of gold, as an absolute concept, can signify only objects with the same definitions and properties (i.e. with the same <i>essence</i>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Proper_names_and_definite_descriptions\">Proper names and definite descriptions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rigid_designator&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Proper names and definite descriptions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The notion of absolute concepts was then revived by <a href=\"/wiki/Saul_Kripke\" title=\"Saul Kripke\">Saul Kripke</a>, with the name \u201crigid designation\u201d, in the lectures that became <i><a href=\"/wiki/Naming_and_Necessity\" title=\"Naming and Necessity\">Naming and Necessity</a></i>, in the course of his argument against <a href=\"/wiki/Descriptivist_theory_of_names\" title=\"Descriptivist theory of names\">descriptivist</a> theories of reference, building on the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Ruth_Barcan_Marcus\" title=\"Ruth Barcan Marcus\">Ruth Barcan Marcus</a>. At the time of Kripke's lectures, the dominant theory of reference in <a href=\"/wiki/Analytic_philosophy\" title=\"Analytic philosophy\">analytic philosophy</a> (associated with the theories of <a href=\"/wiki/Gottlob_Frege\" title=\"Gottlob Frege\">Gottlob Frege</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\" title=\"Bertrand Russell\">Bertrand Russell</a>) was that the meaning of sentences involving proper names could be given by substituting a contextually appropriate description for the name. Russell,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> for example, famously held that someone who had never met <a href=\"/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck\" title=\"Otto von Bismarck\">Otto von Bismarck</a> might know of him as <i>the first <a href=\"/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany\" title=\"Chancellor of Germany\">Chancellor of the German Empire</a></i>, and if so, his statement that (say) \"Bismarck was a ruthless politician\" should be understood to mean \"The first Chancellor of the German Empire was a ruthless politician\" (which could in turn be analysed into a series of more basic statements according to the method Russell introduced in his theory of <a href=\"/wiki/Definite_descriptions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Definite descriptions\">definite descriptions</a>). Kripke argued\u2014against both the Russellian analysis and several attempted refinements of it\u2014that such descriptions could not possibly <i>mean the same thing</i> as the name \"Bismarck,\" on the grounds that proper names such as \"Bismarck\" always designate <i>rigidly</i>, whereas descriptions such as \"the first Chancellor of the German Empire\" do not. Thus, for example, it <i>might have been the case</i> that Bismarck died in infancy. If so, he would not have ever satisfied the description \"the first Chancellor of the German Empire,\" and (indeed) someone else probably would have. It does not follow that the first Chancellor of the German Empire may not have been the first Chancellor of the German Empire&#8212;that is (at least according to its surface-structure) a contradiction. Kripke argues that the way that proper names <i>work</i> is that when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of Bismarck, we are talking about what might or might not have been true of <i>that particular person</i> in various situations, whereas when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of, say, <i>the first Chancellor of the German Empire</i> we <i>could</i> be talking about what might or might not have been true of <i>whoever</i> would have happened to fill that office in those situations.\n</p><p>The \"could\" here is important to note: rigid designation is a property of the <i>way terms are used</i>, not a property of <i>the terms themselves</i>, and some philosophers, following <a href=\"/wiki/Keith_Donnellan\" title=\"Keith Donnellan\">Keith Donnellan</a>, have argued that a phrase such as \"the first Chancellor of the German Empire\" <i>could</i> be used rigidly, in sentences such as \"the first Chancellor of the German Empire could have decided never to go into politics.\" Kripke himself doubted that there was any need to recognize rigid uses of definite descriptions, and argued that <a href=\"/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\" title=\"Bertrand Russell\">Russell</a>'s notion of <a href=\"/wiki/Scope_(logic)\" title=\"Scope (logic)\">scope</a> offered all that was needed to account for such sentences. But in either case, Kripke argued, nothing important in his account depends on the question. Whether definite descriptions can be used rigidly or not, they can at least <i>sometimes</i> be used non-rigidly, but a proper name <i>can only be used rigidly</i>; the asymmetry, Kripke argues, demonstrates that no definite description could <i>give the meaning</i> of a proper name&#8212;although it might be used to explain <i>who</i> a name refers to (that is, to \"fix the referent\" of the name).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Essentialism\">Essentialism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rigid_designator&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Essentialism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Naming_and_Necessity\" title=\"Naming and Necessity\">Naming and Necessity</a></i>, Kripke argues that <a href=\"/wiki/Proper_name\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Proper name\">proper names</a> and certain <a href=\"/wiki/Natural_kind\" title=\"Natural kind\">natural kind</a> terms&#8212;including biological <a href=\"/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)\" title=\"Taxonomy (biology)\">taxa</a> and types of natural substances (most famously, \"water\" and \"H<sub>2</sub>O\") designate rigidly. He argues for a form of <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_essentialism\" title=\"Scientific essentialism\">scientific essentialism</a> not unlike Aristotelian essentialism. Essential properties are common to an object in all possible worlds, and so they pick out the same objects in all possible worlds - they rigidly designate.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Causal-historical_theory_of_reference\">Causal-historical theory of reference</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rigid_designator&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Causal-historical theory of reference\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Proper names rigidly designate for reasons that differ from natural kinds terms. The reason '<a href=\"/wiki/Johnny_Depp\" title=\"Johnny Depp\">Johnny Depp</a>' refers to one particular person in all possible worlds is because some person initially gave the name to him by saying something like \"Let's call our baby 'Johnny Depp'\". This is called the initial baptism. This usage of 'Johnny Depp' for referring to some particular baby got passed on from person-to-person in a giant <a href=\"/wiki/Causal_theory_of_reference\" title=\"Causal theory of reference\">causal and historical chain of events</a>. That is why everybody calls Johnny Depp 'Johnny Depp'. Johnny's mother passed it onto her friends who passed it onto their friends who passed it onto their friends, and so on.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Necessary_identities\">Necessary identities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rigid_designator&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Necessary identities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/wiki/Necessity_of_identity\" title=\"Necessity of identity\">Necessity of identity</a></div>\n<p>One puzzling consequence of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators are necessary. If <a href=\"/wiki/Water\" title=\"Water\">water</a> is H<sub>2</sub>O, then water is <i>necessarily</i> H<sub>2</sub>O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H<sub>2</sub>O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H<sub>2</sub>O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H<sub>2</sub>O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H<sub>2</sub>O, but <i>conditionally</i>, <i>if</i> water is H<sub>2</sub>O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H<sub>2</sub>O.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
