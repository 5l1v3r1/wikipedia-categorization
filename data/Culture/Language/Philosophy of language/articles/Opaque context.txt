An opaque context or referentially opaque context is a linguistic context in which it is not always possible to substitute "co-referential" expressions (expressions referring to the same object) without altering the truth of sentences.   The expressions involved are usually grammatically singular terms.  So, substitution of co-referential expressions into an opaque context does not always preserve truth. For example, "Lois believes x is a hero" is an opaque context because "Lois believes Superman is a hero" is true while "Lois believes Clark Kent is a hero" is false, even though 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' are co-referential expressions. The term is used in philosophical theories of reference, and is to be contrasted with "referentially transparent context".  In rough outline: Similar usage of the term applies for artificial languages such as programming languages and logics.  The Cicero-Tully example above can be easily adapted.  Use the notation                         [         t         ]                 {\displaystyle [t]}     as a quotation that mentions a term                         t                 {\displaystyle t}    .  Define a predicate                         L                 {\displaystyle L}     to the effect that the letters making up a term number six.  Then                         [         x         ]                 {\displaystyle [x]}     induces an opaque context, or is referentially opaque, because                         L         (         [         C         i         c         e         r         o         ]         )                 {\displaystyle L([Cicero])}     is true while                         L         (         [         T         u         l         l         y         ]         )                 {\displaystyle L([Tully])}     is false.  Programming languages often have richer semantics than logics' semantics of truth and falsity, and so an operator such as                         [         x         ]                 {\displaystyle [x]}     may fail to be referentially transparent for other reasons as well.
