{"parse":{"title":"Secondary reference","pageid":10418933,"revid":544752004,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Secondary reference</b> points to the <a href=\"/wiki/Understanding\" title=\"Understanding\">representation</a> as a necessary part in granting a <a href=\"/wiki/Meaning_(linguistics)\" title=\"Meaning (linguistics)\">meaning</a> to a (part of a) <a href=\"/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)\" title=\"Sentence (linguistics)\">sentence</a>. In this approach, <a href=\"/wiki/Word\" title=\"Word\">words</a> that don\u2019t contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and <a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_Bolzano\" title=\"Bernard Bolzano\">Bernard Bolzano</a>'s 'round <a href=\"/wiki/Quadrilateral\" title=\"Quadrilateral\">quadrangle</a>'. <a href=\"/wiki/Alexius_Meinong\" title=\"Alexius Meinong\">Alexius Meinong</a>'s Types of <a href=\"/wiki/Object_(philosophy)\" title=\"Object (philosophy)\">objects</a> can be mentioned here, too.\n</p><p>In the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don\u2019t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can\u2019t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.\n</p><p>Another example is presented by <a href=\"/wiki/George_Berkeley\" title=\"George Berkeley\">George Berkeley</a>. He says: \"[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither <a href=\"/wiki/Oblique_projection\" title=\"Oblique projection\">oblique</a> nor <a href=\"/wiki/Rectangle\" title=\"Rectangle\">rectangle</a>, neither <a href=\"/wiki/Equilateral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Equilateral\">equilateral</a>, equicrural, nor scalenon, but <i>all and none</i> of these at once?\" (<i>A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</i>, Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing <a href=\"/wiki/John_Locke\" title=\"John Locke\">John Locke</a>, demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual).\n</p><p>Whether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can\u2019t discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn\u2019t; the sentence then doesn\u2019t have a meaning for B.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Literature\">Literature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Secondary_reference&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Literature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>J.
