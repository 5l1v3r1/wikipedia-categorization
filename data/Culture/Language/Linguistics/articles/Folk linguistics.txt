Folk linguistics is the amateur study of linguistics. The term is often used as a pejorative. The linguist Ray Jackendoff points out that applying folk linguistics to education can be potentially damaging to the attainment of students who speak less standard dialects. Characterising different speech as good or bad can have a serious effect.[a] The term folk linguistics can also refer to ideological  ideas of language, such as nationalist  views of language. The scientific understanding of language by linguists often contradicts that of native speakers.   Jackendoff (2003)[a] cites the following statements as typical examples of folk-linguistic beliefs.
