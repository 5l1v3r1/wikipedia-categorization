Società Internazionale per lo Studio del Medioevo Latino (known as SISMEL) (Eng: Society for the Study of Medieval Latin Culture) is an Italian non-profit cultural institute, based in Florence. It promotes multi-disciplinary research into the history, art, literature and philology of the medieval Latin era. SISMEL was founded by Claudio Leonardi in 1978, formally recognized in 1984 and state approved as a Superior Graduate School by the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali in 1997. The Society is based in the former monastery of Certosa di Firenze, a Carthusian monastery located in the Florence suburb of Galluzzo. The Society runs the academic publishing house SISMEL-Edizioni del Galluzzo, specializing in editions of medieval literature and related subjects.  It also publishes seven research periodicals: SISMEL is a partner in the project to digitalize the manuscripts of the  Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence,  and in "MIRABILE", a knowledge management system for researching medieval culture.
