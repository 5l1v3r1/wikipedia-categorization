According to a hadith, there are at least 99 names of God in Islam, known as the ʾasmāʾu llāhi l-ḥusnā (Arabic: أسماء الله الحسنى‎ Beautiful Names of God). The names are also called 99 Attributes of Allah. According to Sahih Bukhari Hadith : Abu Hurairah reported that Allah has ninety-nine Names, i.e., one hundred minus one, and whoever believes in their meanings and acts accordingly, will enter Paradise; and Allah is witr (one) and loves 'the witr' (i.e., odd numbers). There's another Sahih Muslim Hadith :Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Allah has ninety-nine Names, one-hundred less one; and he who memorized them all by heart will enter Paradise." To count something means to know it by heart.The Qur'an refers to God's Most Beautiful Names (al-ʾasmāʾ al-ḥusná) in several Surahs.   Gerhard Böwering refers to Surah 17 (17:110) as the locus classicus to which explicit lists of 99 names used to be attached in tafsir. A cluster of more than a dozen Divine epithets which are included in such lists is found in Surah 59.  Mystic philosopher Ibn Arabi surmised that the 99 names are "outward signs of the universe's inner mysteries".  There is no universal agreement among Muslims as to what exactly counts as a name of God, and what does not. Additionally, while some names are only in the Quran, and others are only in the hadith, there are some names which appear in both. Different sources give different lists of the 99 names.  The following list is based on the one found in the Jamiʿ at-Tirmidhi (9th century).  Other hadith, such as those of al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi or Ibn ʿAsākir, have variant lists. All attribute the original compilation of the list of names to Abu Hurairah.  al-Tirmidhi comments on his list:  "This (version of the) hadith is gharib [unusual, scarce]; it has been narrated from various routes on the authority of Abu Hurairah, but we do not know of the mention of the Names in the numerous narrations, except this one." Various early Muslim exegetes, including Jaʿfar al-Sadiq, Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah, Ibn Hazm, al-Qurtubi, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, have given their own versions of lists of 99 names.  ٱ = The waṣla (hamzatu l-waṣli (هَمْزَةُ ٱلْوَصْلِ "hamza of connection")) denoting of ٱلْ is "ʾal/ ʾul/ ʾil" depending on the last vowel of the previous word/sentence structure: e.g. سُوْرَةُ ٱلْرَّحْمَـٰنُ Suratu r-Raḥmān [Surah ar-Rahman]. Please note the written Arabic spelling of the names written in Arabic in the table are in the vowelled Classical/ Quranic form (proper = in the Quran and Ahādith) with the square bracketed "[.]" variant of the written Arabic forms given in common or modern texts - usually in media, some long vowels and punctuations are omitted for the easier typing and reading.(Quranic/ classical written forms) (Variant with vowels/ without vowels) [IPA] [Various Spellings]  ٱلْرَّحْمَـانُ [* = classical written form] \ الرّحمان \* الرحمـٰن الرحمان [* = classical written form] [Ar-Rahmaan]  الرحيم ar-Raḥīm [Ar-Raheem]  ٱلْمَـالِكُ [* = classical written form] المالك [* = classical written form] al-Mālik [al-Maalik] القدوس  al-Quddūs [al-Quddous, al-Quddoos] ٱلْسَّلَامُ [* = classical written form] \ السّلام \* السلـٰم السلام [* = classical written form] as-Salām [As-Salaam] al-Muʿmin [al-Azeez] الجبار al-Jabbār [al-Jabbaar] المتكبر ٱلْخَالِقُ [* = classical written form] الخالق [* = classical written form] al-Khāliq [al-Khaaliq] al-Bāriʿ المصور [al-Mussawwir/ al-Muswawwir] ٱلْغَفَّارُ [* = classical written form] \ الغفّار \* الغفـٰر الغفار [* = classical written form] al-Ghaffār [al-Ghaffaar] ٱلْقَهَّارُ [* = classical written form] \ القهّار \* القهـٰر القهار [* = classical written form] al-Qahhār [al-Qahhaar] الوهاب al-Wahhāb [al-Wahhaab] الرزاق ar-Razzāq [Ar-Razzaaq] الفتاح al-Fattāḥ [al-Fattaah] al-alīm [al-Aleem] al-Qābiḍ [al-Qaabid/ al-Qaabidh] al-Bāsiṭ [al-Baasit/ al-Baasitt] al-Khāfiḍ [al-Khaafid/ al-Khaafidh] الرّافع ar-Rāfiʿ [Ar-Raafiʿ/ Ar-Raafee] المعز [al-Muʿeizz] المذل [al-Mudzhill] السميع [As-Sameeʿ] al-Baswir [al-Baseer/ al-Basseer/ al-Basweer] اللطيف al-Laṭīf al-Latwif [al-Lateef/ al-Latteef/ al-Latweef] al-Khabīr [al-Khabeer] al-Ḥalīm [al-Haleem] al-ʿAẓīm al-Ezzim, al-Ezwim [al-ʿAzzeem, al-ʿAzweem/ al-Ezzeem, al-Ezweem] al-Ghafūr [al-Ghafour, al-Ghafoor] الشكور ash-Shakūr [Ash-Shakour, Ash-Shakoor] [* = classical written form] \ العليّ \* العلى العلي [* = classical written form] al-aliyy [* = classical written form] al-Kabīr [al-Kabeer] al-Ḥafīẓ [al-Hafeez] al-Muqīt [al-Muqeet] al-Ḥasīb [al-Haseeb] al-Jalīl [al-Jaleel] al-Karīm [al-Kareem] الرقيب ar-Raqīb [Ar-Raqeeb] al-Mujīb [al-Mujiyb] ٱلْوَاسِعُ [* = classical written form] الواسع [* = classical written form] ’al-Wāsi‘ [al-Waasi‘/ al-Waasie] al-Ḥakīm [al-Hakeem] al-Wadūd [al-Wadoud/ al-Wadood] al-Majīd [al-Majeed] al-Bāʿith [al-Baaʿith/ al-Baaʿeith] الشهيد ash-Shahīd [Ash-Shaheed] الحق al-Wakīl [al-Wakeel] القوي [al-Qawee] al-Matīn [al-Mateen] الولي [al-Walee] al-Ḥamīd [al-Hameed] ٱلْمُحْصِيُ [* = classical written form] المحصي [* = classical written form] al-Muḥṣī [al-Muhsee] [’al-Mubdiy] [al-Mubdie] al-Muʿīd [al-Muʿeid/ al-Muʿeyd] \ ٱلْمُحْيِى ٱلْمُحْيِي [* = classical written form] \ المحيى المحيي [* = classical written form] al-Muḥ·yiy [* = classical written form] [al-Muhyee] al-Mumīt [al-Mumeet] الحى القيوم al-Qayyūm [al-Qayyoum/ al-Qayyoom] ٱلْوَاجِدُ [* = classical written form] الواجد al-Wājid [al-Waajid] al-Mājid [al-Maajid] ٱلْوَاحِدُ [* = classical written form] الواحد al-Wāḥid [al-Waahid] الاحد الصمد [As-Ssamad/ As-Swamad] ٱلْقَادِرُ [* = classical written form] القادر al-Qādir [al-Qaadir] المقدم المؤخر [al-Moʾakhkhir] الاول [* = classical written form] الاخر [* = classical written form] al-ʿĀkhir [variant] [* = classical written form] al-Aakhir [* = classical written form] [* = classical written form] الظاهر [* = classical written form] aẓ-Ẓāhir [Az-Zaahir/ Az-Zzaahir/ Az-Zwaahir] al-Bāṭin [al-Baatin/ al-Baattin/ al-Baatwin] ٱلْوَالِي [* = classical written form] الوالي [* = classical written form] al-Wālī [al-Waali] ٱلْمُتَعَالِي [* = classical written form] المتعالي [* = classical written form] al-Mutaʿālī [al-Muta'aali] البر التواب at-Tawwāb [At-Tawwaab] العفو al-ʿAfūw [al-ʿAfou] ٱلْرَّؤُفُ [* = classical written form] \ الرّؤف \* الرءوف الرؤف [* = classical written form] ar-Raʿūf [Ar-Raʿouf/ Ar-Rawʿouf] مَالِكُ ٱلْمُلْكُ [* = classical written form] \ مالك الملك \* مـٰلك الملك مالك الملك [* = classical written form] Māliku ʼl-Mulk [Maalik ul-Mulk] ذُو ٱلْجَلَالِ وَٱلْإِكْرَامُ [* = classical written form] ذو الجلال ولإكرام [* = classical written form] Ḏuʼl-Jalāli waʼl-ʼIkrām, Dhuʼl-Jalāli waʼl-ʼIkrām/ [al-Muqsitt] al-Jāmi [al-Jaamiʿ/ al-Jaamie] ٱلْغَنيُّ [* = classical written form] \ الغنيّ \* الغنى الغني [* = classical written form] al-Ghānī [al-Ghaani] ٱلْمُغْنِيُّ [* = classical written form] \ المغنيّ \* المغنى المغني [* = classical written form] al-Mugh·nī al-Mānīʿ [al-Maaniʿ/ al-Maanie] الضار aḍ-Ḍārr [Adh-Dhaarr] النافع an-Nāfīʿ [An-Naafiʿ/ al-Naafie] النور an-Nūr [An-Nour] ٱلْهَادِي [* = classical written form] الهادي [* = classical written form] al-Hādī [al-Haadi] al-Badīʿ ٱلْبَاقِي [* = classical written form] الباقي [* = classical written form] al-Bāqī [al-Baaqi] ٱلْوَارِثُ [* = classical written form] الوارث [* = classical written form] al-Wārith [al-Waarith] الرشيد ar-Rashīd [Ar-Rasheed] الصبور aṣ-Ṣabūr [As-Sabour/ As-Ssabour/ As-Swabour] P = from Plural noun; O = Other There is a tradition in Sufism to the effect the 99 names of God point to a mystical "Most Supreme and Superior Name" (ismu l-ʾAʿẓam (ٱلْإِسْمُ ٱلْأَعْظَم).  This "Greatest Name of God" is said to be  "the one which if He is called (prayed to) by it, He will answer."  According to a hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Masud, some of the names of God have also been hidden from mankind.  More than 1000 names of God are listed in the Jawshan Kabir (جَوْشَنُ ٱلْكَبِير - literally "the Great Cuirass") invocations. The Arabic names of God are used to form theophoric given names commonly used in Muslim cultures throughout the world, including non-Arabic speaking societies. While the names of God themselves are reserved to God and their use as a person's given name is considered religiously inappropriate, theophoric names can however be formed by either removing the definite article al (ال), or prefixing the term ˁabdu (عَبْدُ - "servant of") to the name. For example, a person may not be named Al-Karīm (ٱلْكَرِيمُ - "the Generous") or Al-Mālik (ٱلْمَـٰلِك - "the King"), but may be named simply Karīm (كَرِيمُ - "Generous") or Mālik (مَـٰلِك - "King"), as well as ˤAbd ul-Karīm (عَبْدُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ - "servant of the Generous") or ˤAbd ul-Mālik (عَبْدُ ٱلْمَـٰلِك - "servant of the King").  This distinction is established out of respect for the sanctity of Divine names, which denote attributes (of love, kindness, mercy, compassion, justice, power, etc.) that are believed to be possessed in a full and absolute sense only by God, while human beings, being limited creatures, are viewed by Muslims as being endowed with the Divine attributes only in a limited and relative capacity. The prefixing of the definite article would indicate that the bearer possesses the corresponding attribute in an exclusive sense, a trait reserved to God.  Quranic verse 3:26 is cited as evidence against the validity of using Divine names for persons, with the example of Mālik ul-Mulk (مَـٰلِكُ ٱلْمُلْكُ - "Lord of Power" or "Owner of all Sovereignty"): "Say: "O God! Lord of Power, You give power to whom You please, and You strip off power from whom You please. You endue with honour whom You please, and You bring low whom You please. In Your hand is all Good." Verily, over all things You have power." [Qur'an 3:26] The two parts of the name starting with ˁabdu may be written separately (as in the previous example) or combined as one in the transliterated form; in such a case, the vowel transcribed after ˁabdu is often written as u when the two words are transcribed as one: e.g., Abdur-Rahman, Abdul-Aziz, Abdul-Jabbar, or even Abdullah (عَبْدُ ٱللّٰه - "Servant of God"). (This has to do with Arabic case vowels, the final u vowel showing the normal "quote" nominative/vocative case form.) Examples of Muslim theophoric names include: Bahá'í sources state that the 100th name was revealed as "Bahá’" (Arabic: بهاء‎ "glory, splendor"), which appears in the words Bahá'u'lláh and Bahá'í. They also believe that it is the greatest name of God.   The Báb wrote a noted pentagram-shaped tablet with 360 morphological derivation of the word "Bahá'" used in it.  According to Bahá'í scholar ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávari, Bahāʾ al-dīn al-ʿĀmilī adopted the Persian poetic pen name "Bahāʾ" after being inspired by the words of the fifth Twelver Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, and the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who stated that the greatest name of God was included in either the Duʿāʾu l-Bahāʾ, a dawn prayer for Ramadan, or the ʾAʿmal ʿam Dawūd.  In the first verse of the duʿāʾu l-Bahāʾ, the name "Bahāʾ" appears four times.
