Theomatics is a numerological study of the Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek text of the Christian Bible, based upon gematria and isopsephia, by which its proponents claim to show the direct intervention of God in the writing of Christian scripture. The term "theomatics" was coined by Del Washburn in 1976 as a combination of "Θεός" ("God") and "mathematics". Washburn wrote three books about theomatics  and created a website  espousing the hypothesis. Theomatics is not the same thing as Bible code; it uses an entirely different technique. The Bible code (also called ELS for Equidistant Letter Sequences) uses a letter skipping technique. Theomatics, on the other hand, is based on gematria and isopsephia, systems which assign numerical values to letters in the ancient Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek alphabets. An analysis and criticism of theomatics has been published by Tim Hayes, previously under the pseudonym "A. B. Leever".    A German statistician, Kurt Fettelschoss, published an analysis  that claims that "The observed quantity of theomatic hits is significantly not random".  A response to the findings was posted by Tim Hayes.  An analysis by Russell Glasser, entitled "Theomatics Debunked",  shows the same phenomenon in a secular text. Washburn's website has a page entitled "Scientific Proof"  which discusses and responds to potential arguments against theomatics.
