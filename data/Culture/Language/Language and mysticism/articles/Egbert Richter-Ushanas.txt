Egbert Richter (also publishing under the pen name of Richter-Ushanas, after uśánas, a Vedic rishi) is a German freelance writer and lecturer, author of self-published (Egbert Richter Verlag, registered in Bremen) treatises on Yoga, Vedanta, Esotericism and mythology, translations of some Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali as well as original poetry. Richter has also published various pseudo-scholarly claims, including decipherment of the Rongorongo, Phaistos Disc and Indus scripts. In his 1992 decipherment claim of the Indus script, he argues that the script is "based very largely on intuition, and this quality is also required for reading it", likening the process of "decipherment" to meditation, concluding that the Rbhus, who Richter alleges were priests of the Harappan civilization, invented the Indus script under the influence of Sumerian cuneiform. Werner (1999) confesses himself "at a loss how to evaluate" Richter's work, admitting the author has thorough knowledge of the various sources he uses, but at the same time completely lacks academic method, discipline or experience.
