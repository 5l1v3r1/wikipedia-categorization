The concepts of <b>self-referential encoding</b> and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory.

A <a href=\"/wiki/Self-schema\" title=\"Self-schema\">self-schema</a> is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source14_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source14-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> For any given trait, an individual may or may not be \"schematic\"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered \"schematic\" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source15_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source15-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source16_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source16-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source14_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source14-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Self-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source13_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source13-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source12_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source12-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and <a href=\"/wiki/Recall_(memory)\" title=\"Recall (memory)\">recalled</a>.  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source5_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source5-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source16_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source16-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Self-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.\n</p><p>In order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ego_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ego-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were \"like me\" or \"not like me,\" they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.<sup id=\"cite_ref-behavior_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-behavior-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ego_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ego-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Expanding on this, Strube et al.

They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-behavior_13-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-behavior-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the \"like me\" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Self-awareness_and_personality\">Self-awareness and personality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Self-referential_encoding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Self-awareness and personality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Two of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hull_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hull-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention <sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hull_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hull-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hull_14-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hull-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hull_14-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hull-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hull_14-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hull-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.\n</p><p>In later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge.<sup id=\"cite_ref-review_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-review-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-review_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-review-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence \"The robber took the money from the bank\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.<sup id=\"cite_ref-review_16-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-review-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-review_16-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-review-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-review_16-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-review-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Similar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between <a href=\"/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory\" title=\"Type A and Type B personality theory\">Type A and Type B behavior patterns</a>, focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.<sup id=\"cite_ref-behavior_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-behavior-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Theoretical_background\">Theoretical background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Self-referential_encoding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Theoretical background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Influential psychologists <a href=\"/wiki/Fergus_Craik\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fergus Craik\">Craik</a> and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-source2_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source2-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and <a href=\"/wiki/Semantic_memory\" title=\"Semantic memory\">semantic</a> encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive <a href=\"/wiki/Adjectives\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Adjectives\">adjectives</a> on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an \"incidental recall task\". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and <a href=\"/wiki/Phonemic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Phonemic\">phonemic</a> tasks lead only to \"shallow\" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to \"deep\" encoding and resulted in better recall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source2_19-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source2-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Experts suggest that the call on <a href=\"/wiki/Association_(psychology)\" title=\"Association (psychology)\">associative</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Memory\" title=\"Memory\">memory</a> required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source1_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field <sup id=\"cite_ref-source5_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source5-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 \"revisited\" words out of the total original list.

This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source1_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Researchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self.

Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other.

Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior <sup id=\"cite_ref-source2_19-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source2-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dual_process\">Dual process</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Self-referential_encoding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Dual process\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Psychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source3_23-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source3-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.\n</p><p>Ultimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source3_23-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source3-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis.

On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures.

Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Previous research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members <sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> into the development of their self-concept.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Despite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Groups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ultimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source31_11-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source31-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect.

In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture <sup id=\"cite_ref-source10_34-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source10-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Noting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with <a href=\"/wiki/Self-awareness\" title=\"Self-awareness\">self-awareness</a>, it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source9_35-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source9-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source10_34-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source10-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: \"the self,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, \"similar close other,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, \"dissimilar non-close other,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source10_34-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source10-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Therefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source9_35-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source9-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source10_34-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source10-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Lombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source10_34-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source10-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.\n</p><p>Ultimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can <a href=\"/wiki/Mentalization\" title=\"Mentalization\">mentalize</a> with others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-source10_34-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-source10-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Depression\">Depression</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Self-referential_encoding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Depression\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  <a href=\"/wiki/Anxiety\" title=\"Anxiety\">anxiety</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Depression_(mood)\" title=\"Depression (mood)\">depression</a>.
