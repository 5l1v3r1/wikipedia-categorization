The language icon is a specific icon designed for people to select a specific language to use when they face multi-lingual, multi-national websites.  The Language icon was designed by Onur Mustak Cobanli and his team in 2008 when they planned to build a multi-lingual, multi-national website. After the first language icons were rejected, the design contest was organized by A’ Design Award & Competition.  Farhat Datta designed the winning entry, “Turnstile Language Icon.”   Its website says it is under an unnamed "Creative Commons" license, but its license is not one of the licenses released by the Creative Commons.  Its license is semi-noncommercial, so it is not a Free license and does not provide the all freedoms of the Creative Commons Share-Alike licenses (such as CC-BY-SA). Instead, the license for the license icon has the following conditions: The language icon was adopted into the widely-used "Font Awesome" icon package in Font Awesome version 4.  Font Awesome version 5 abandoned the language icon, replacing it with a completely different symbol for language selection.
