Community interpreting is a specific type of interpreting service which is found more in community-based than organisational situations.  It is a particularly vital service in communities with large numbers of ethnic minorities, enabling those minorities to access services where, due to the language barrier, they would otherwise find it difficult. Situations where such interpreters are necessary are typical include medical, educational, housing, social security and legal areas. Community interpreters need not only to be fluent in the language that they are interpreting, but also with the public services involved, to be aware of the cultural and racial implications of the interpreting work. Interpreters are also expected to follow the Interpreter's Code of Ethics.
