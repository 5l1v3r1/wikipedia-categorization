 Traduire is a 2011 French independent underground experimental documentary art film directed by Nurith Aviv. It was released on DVD by Éditions Montparnasse (fr), as part of a boxset, also including Misafa Lesafa (2004) and Langue sacrée, langue parlée (2008).  The film, the third in a trilogy, containing Misafa Lesafa (2004) and Langue sacrée, langue parlée (2008), contains conversations with translators of Hebrew works into different languages. Among the interviewees are Brest, France-based Sandrick Le Mague, who translates theological texts into French, Boston-based Prof. Dr. Angel Sáenz-Badillos, who translates medieval poetry into Spanish, Acre-based Israeli-Arab novelist, screenwriter, and, journalist, Ala Hlehel (fr; he; it; sv), who translates the plays of Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin into Arabic, Malakoff-based Prof. Dr. Yitskhok Niborski (he; ru), who compiles a Hebrew-Yiddish dictionary, Barcelona-based Prof. Dr. Manel Forcano i Aparicio (ca; de; es; he), who translates the contemporary Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai into Catalan, Tel Aviv-based Israeli poetess, Sivan Beskin (et; he), who translates the contemporary Israeli poetess Leah Goldberg into Russian and Lithuanian, and, Berkeley, California-based Prof. Dr. Chana Bloch, who translated into English the works of contemporary Israeli poets Yehuda Amichai and Dahlia Ravikovitch.   Critic Jacques Mandelbaum opined that "Aviv films these encounters carefully, taking time to listen to each translator in the half-light of their offices, bringing surprisingly passionate ideas to the surface" and that the film "finds room in its erudite enterprise to explore sensibilities."
