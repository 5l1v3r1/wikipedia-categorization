 Poétique du cerveau (English: Poetics of the Brain) is a 66-minute 2015 French-German-Israeli French-, Hebrew-, and Italian-language independent underground experimental documentary art film directed by Nurith Aviv. Childhood photos from Nurith Aviv’s family album evoke memories and reflections which lead her to encounters with researches in neuroscience. The film, released on DVD by Epicentre Films,  weaves associative links between Aviv’s personal biographical stories and interviews she conducts with neuroscientists about their work. These scientists, including Prof. Dr. Laurent Cohen, Prof. Dr. Yadin Dudai, and Prof. Dr. Vittorio Gallese, discuss topics partly related to Aviv’s previous films: memory, bilingualism, reading, mirror-neurons, smell, and traces of experience. The film, which includes music by Werner Hasler and was financed inter alia by Les Films d’ici, Angoa-Association of International Collective Management of Audiovisual Works, KTO, Conseil régional des Pays de la Loire, ZDF, Arte, National Center of Cinematography and the Moving Image, Procirep, Ministry of Culture and Sport’s Israel Film Council, and Yehoshua Rabinovich Foundation for the Arts, Tel Aviv, was screened at Les 3 Luxembourg in 2015 and 2016, at Centre Georges Pompidou in 2015, and at DocAviv, Tel Aviv Cinematheque, Arte, and Cinema South International Film Festival (he) in 2016.
