How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck (German: Beobachtungen zu einer neuen Sprache, literally "Observations of a New Language") is a 1976 documentary film by German director Werner Herzog, produced by Werner Herzog Filmproduktion.  It is a 44-minute film documenting the World Livestock Auctioneer Championship held in New Holland, Pennsylvania. The film also contains a section about the Amish and shows Amish speaking Pennsylvania German. Herzog has said that he believes auctioneering to be "the last poetry possible, the poetry of capitalism."  Herzog describes the auctioneering as an "extreme language ... frightening but quite beautiful at the same time."  Herzog used two of the featured auctioneers as actors in his later film Stroszek. Cinematographer Edward Lachman got his start working with Herzog on this film; he would work on La Soufri√®re (1977) shortly after.
