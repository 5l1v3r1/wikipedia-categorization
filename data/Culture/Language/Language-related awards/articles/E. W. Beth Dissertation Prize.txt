The Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI) each year awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize, named in honor of the Dutch mathematician Evert Willem Beth, to outstanding PhD theses in the fields of Logic, Language, and Information. Dissertations are evaluated on the basis of their technical depth, strength and originality. Each year the award can be assigned ex aequo to more than one thesis, or to no thesis at all. The prize for the year 2013 consists of a certificate, a donation of 2500 euros and an invitation to submit (a possibly revised version of) the thesis to the FoLLI Publications on Logic, Language and Information,  published by Springer Science+Business Media.
