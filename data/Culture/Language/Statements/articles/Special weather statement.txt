A Special Weather Statement (Codename SPS with FEMA and National Weather Service) is a form of weather advisory. Special Weather Statements are issued by the National Weather Service of the United States (the NWS) and the Meteorological Service of Canada (the MSC). There are no set criteria for special weather statements in either country. A Special Weather Statement may be issued by the NWS for hazards that have not yet reached warning or advisory status or that do not have a specific code of their own, such as widespread funnel clouds. They are also occasionally used to clear counties from severe weather watches.  A common form of special weather statement is a significant weather alert. Occasionally special weather statements appear as heat advisories. An EAS activation can and may be requested on very rare occasions. Special Weather Statements may also be issued for possible fire weather conditions, such as an enhanced risk. They even can be issued for rain/snow that may hit Advisory criteria such as snow being one inch that isn't going to likely pose a threat. Sometimes Special Weather Statements may be issued to update on current weather conditions, but that is sometimes issued by a Short Term Forecast. Special Weather Statements are issued by the MSC for weather events that are unusual or those that cause general inconvenience or public concern and cannot adequately be described in a weather forecast. These may include widespread events such as Arctic outflows, Alberta clippers, coastal fog banks, areas of possible thunderstorm development, and strong winds such as chinooks and les suetes winds. They are written in a free style and may also reflect warnings in effect near the United States border.
