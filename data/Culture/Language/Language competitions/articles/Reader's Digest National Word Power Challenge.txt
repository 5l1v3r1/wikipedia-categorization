The Reader's Digest National Word Power Challenge was an annual vocabulary competition in the United States for youth in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade.  It was sponsored by Reader's Digest magazine. Competition began at school level.  Typically, teachers gave students 25-question multiple-choice tests.  Classroom winners then competed with other classroom winners from the same grade to determine the school-wide grade-level champion.  The school champion then took a multiple-choice test which determined the top 100 students in the state. The top 100 students were invited to a state competition, where they were given 25 multiple-choice questions to determine the top ten.  The top ten then went through a few rounds of questions to determine the state champion.  The state champion advanced to national competition. Students from every state, Washington, D.C., and one student from a Department of Defense school got to compete at national level.  The students took a 25-question multiple-choice test, with the top ten scorers going on to compete in a nationally televised event.  The moderator was a celebrity; Al Roker was a regular. In 2007, the RDNWPC website stated that the competition would not be held for the 2007-2008 year.  The Reader's Digest website no longer mentions the RDNWPC.
