The Exis took their name from the <a href=\"/wiki/Existentialist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Existentialist\">existentialist</a> movement, and were influenced by its chief proponents, <a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre\" title=\"Jean-Paul Sartre\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Camus\" title=\"Albert Camus\">Albert Camus</a>. There are similar German nicknames for other movements, such as \"Sozis\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Socialism\" title=\"Socialism\">Socialists</a>) and the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nazi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nazi\">Nazis</a>\" (National Socialists).\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Parallels\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Parallels</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Post-War_ties_between_Britain_and_Hamburg\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Post-War ties between Britain and Hamburg</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#St_Pauli,_a_haven_for_those_who_are_different\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">St Pauli, a haven for those who are different</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Influences_on_fashions_and_image\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Influences on fashions and image</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parallels\">Parallels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Exi_(subculture)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Parallels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Quite a few of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hamburg\" title=\"Hamburg\">Hamburg</a> fans of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"The Beatles\">The Beatles</a>, in the period 1960\u201362, regarded themselves as \"Exis\". In some ways, the Exis were the spiritual successors of the <a href=\"/wiki/Swing_Kids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swing Kids\">Swing Kids</a> of the 1930s. Both movements were heavily influenced by the prevailing popular culture and music of the United States, whether 1930s <a href=\"/wiki/Jazz\" title=\"Jazz\">Jazz</a>, in the case of the Swing Kids or 1950s <a href=\"/wiki/Rock_and_Roll\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rock and Roll\">Rock and Roll</a>, in the case of the Exis.\n</p><p>Aside from the utterly transformed political and cultural atmosphere in Germany after the war, the biggest difference between the two movements was that, where the Swing Kids wholeheartedly embraced American culture (right down to <a href=\"/wiki/Zoot_suit\" title=\"Zoot suit\">zoot suits</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bobby_socks\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bobby socks\">bobby socks</a>), Exis generally wanted to show that they could think for themselves, as many young people do.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Post-War_ties_between_Britain_and_Hamburg\">Post-War ties between Britain and Hamburg</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Exi_(subculture)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Post-War ties between Britain and Hamburg\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>One of the factors, which had strengthened the link between British musical acts and the Hamburg clubs, was the presence of large numbers of British servicemen (see <a href=\"/wiki/British_Army_of_the_Rhine\" title=\"British Army of the Rhine\">British Army of the Rhine</a>), in the north-west of Germany. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second World War\">Second World War</a>, it became common practice for music promoters in north Western Germany, a number of whom were British themselves, to book British acts. However, some parts of Hamburg were off limits to soldiers and airmen and they never seem to have had the influence, which one might have expected, in the post-war development of St Pauli. This was partly because of the changing political and legal position. After 1955, they were \"guests\" on the territory of an ally and <a href=\"/wiki/NATO\" title=\"NATO\">NATO</a> member. Before the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany (i.e. West Germany) in 1949, the British forces had actually governed their sector.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"St_Pauli.2C_a_haven_for_those_who_are_different\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"St_Pauli,_a_haven_for_those_who_are_different\">St Pauli, a haven for those who are different</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Exi_(subculture)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: St Pauli, a haven for those who are different\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In any case, the <a href=\"/wiki/St_Pauli\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St Pauli\">St Pauli</a> district was a place for sailors to relax and artisans to experiment with new ideas, long before the Reeperbahn became internationally famous. In addition, \"Hamburgers\" have always had some sense of being different from other Germans and the area around the Grosse Freiheit, originally just outside the city boundary, was where people were allowed to \"do their own thing\", in various ways (but primarily when it came to religion), as far back as the Eighteenth Century.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influences_on_fashions_and_image\">Influences on fashions and image</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Exi_(subculture)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Influences on fashions and image\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While the fashion choices of some Exis had a slightly <a href=\"/wiki/Preppy\" title=\"Preppy\">preppy</a> or conservative quality (and, given the middle-class background of most of them, this was probably unavoidable), many sought to distance themselves from the blue-jeaned, check-shirted excesses of President <a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" title=\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>'s America, by projecting a somewhat darker and more introspective image. Sartre's black <a href=\"/wiki/Polo-neck\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polo-neck\">polo-neck</a> sweaters and <a href=\"/wiki/Gauloises\" title=\"Gauloises\">Gauloises</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Cigarettes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cigarettes\">cigarettes</a> were the most obvious symbols. In an interview with NPR, <a href=\"/wiki/Astrid_Kirchherr\" title=\"Astrid Kirchherr\">Astrid Kirchherr</a> described the Exy style in <a href=\"/wiki/Hamburg\" title=\"Hamburg\">Hamburg</a> as consisting of black clothes and very long scarves trailing to the floor. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18112532\">[1]</a>\n</p><p>However some American <a href=\"/wiki/Icon\" title=\"Icon\">icons</a> of the time, such as <a href=\"/wiki/James_Dean\" title=\"James Dean\">James Dean</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Marlon_Brando\" title=\"Marlon Brando\">Marlon Brando</a>, were, in the eyes of most middle-aged Americans of the 1950s, young rebels, rather than suitable <a href=\"/wiki/Role_model\" title=\"Role model\">role models</a> for the nation's youth. Thus, they were bound to be more attractive to those adolescents, who were trying to stand out from the rest of society, than the \"respectable\" performers, whom parents admired.\n</p><p>The dress of British and American <a href=\"/wiki/Rocker_(subculture)\" title=\"Rocker (subculture)\">rockers</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Motorcycling\" title=\"Motorcycling\">bikers</a>, the vast majority of whom had not been anywhere near Hamburg, was not vastly different from some of the Exis but to obsessive teenagers, an extra <a href=\"/wiki/Zipper\" title=\"Zipper\">zip</a>, here and there, can be everything and such comparisons may well have been dismissed by Exis (or Rockers), at the time. There are also similarities to jazz musicians and some of their fans but the Exis did not listen exclusively to Rock and Roll, that unruly mix of <a href=\"/wiki/Country_and_Western\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Country and Western\">Country and Western</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rhythm_and_Blues\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rhythm and Blues\">Rhythm and Blues</a>.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2172\nCached time: 20180918074533\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.056 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.092 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 188/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4786/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 146/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.021/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.01 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   72.126      1 -total\n 43.74%   31.548      1 Template:Unreferenced\n 40.36%   29.109      1 Template:Ambox\n 30.96%   22.327      1 Template:Other_uses\n 25.10%   18.100      1 Template:Use_British_English\n 17.68%   12.750      1 Template:DMCA\n 13.89%   10.016      1 Template:Dated_maintenance_category\n 10.31%    7.439      1 Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME\n  7.31%    5.273      1 Template:Ns_has_subpages\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1517397-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918074533 and revision id 833751630\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","hidden":"","*":"Use_British_English_from_November_2010"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_July_2007"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","*":"History_of_the_Beatles"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","*":"Culture_in_Hamburg"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","*":"Youth_culture"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","*":"Subcultures"},{"sortkey":"Exi (Subculture)","*":"Fashion"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Use British English from November 2010"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from July 2007"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Albert Camus"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Astrid Kirchherr"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bobby socks"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"British Army of the Rhine"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cigarettes"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Country and Western"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dwight D.
