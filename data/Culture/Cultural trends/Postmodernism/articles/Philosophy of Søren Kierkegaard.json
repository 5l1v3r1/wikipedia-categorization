While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hong_5-0\"

Kierkegaard's earlier writings from 1843 to 1846 were written pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Point_of_View_of_My_Work_as_an_Author\" title=\"The Point of View of My Work as an Author\">The Point of View of My Work as an Author</a></i>, he explained that the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is <i>Anti-Climacus</i>, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of <i>The Point of View</i>: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Journals_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Journals-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Because the pseudonymous authors write from perspectives which are not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned in this article may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, <i>Johannes Climacus</i> is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. <i>Anti-Climacus</i>, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Journals_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Journals-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Most of Kierkegaard's later philosophical and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works. Subsequently, these works are considered by most scholars to reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Watts_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Watts-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Where appropriate, this article will mention the respective author, pseudonymous or not.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Themes_in_his_philosophy\">Themes in his philosophy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Themes in his philosophy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alienation\">Alienation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Alienation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Social_alienation\" title=\"Social alienation\">Alienation</a> is a term philosophers apply to a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age\u2014one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any \"literal\" sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.\n</p><p>Humanity has lost meaning because the accepted criterion of reality and truth is ambiguous and subjective thought\u2014that which cannot be proven with <a href=\"/wiki/Logic\" title=\"Logic\">logic</a>, historical research, or <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_analysis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scientific analysis\">scientific analysis</a>. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point\u2014humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable\u2014nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship is a way of looking at one\u2019s life that evades objective scrutiny. \n</p><p>\nKierkegaard's analysis of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and <a href=\"/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation\" title=\"Marx&#39;s theory of alienation\">Marx's theory of alienation</a>. However Kierkegaard expressly means that human beings are alienated from God because they are living too much in the world. Individuals need to <a href=\"/wiki/Four_Upbuilding_Discourses,_1843#To_Gain_One\u2019s_Soul_In_Patience\" title=\"Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\">gain their souls</a> from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as <a href=\"/wiki/Karl_Marx\" title=\"Karl Marx\">Karl Marx</a> does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.</p><style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Let us speak further about the wish and thereby about sufferings. Discussion of sufferings can always be beneficial if it addresses not only the self-willfulness of the sorrow but, if possible, addresses the sorrowing person for his upbuilding. It is a legitimate and sympathetic act to dwell properly on the suffering, lest the suffering person become impatient over our superficial discussion in which he does not recognize his suffering, lest he for that reason impatiently thrust aside consolation and be strengthened in double-mindedness. It certainly is one thing to go out into life with the wish when what is wished becomes the deed and the task; it is something else to go out into life away from the wish.\n</p><p>Abraham had to leave his ancestral home an emigrate to an alien nation, where nothing reminded him of what he loved \u2013 indeed, sometimes it is no doubt a consolation that nothing calls to mind what one wishes to forget, but it is a bitter consolation for the person who is full of longing. Thus a person can also have a wish that for him contains everything, so that in the hour of the separation, when the pilgrimage begins, it is as if he were emigrating to a foreign country where nothing but the contrast reminds him, by the loss, of what he wished; it can seem to him as if he were emigrating to a foreign country even if he remains at home perhaps in the same locality \u2013 by losing the wish just as among strangers, so that to take leave of the wish seems to him harder and more crucial than to take leave of his senses.\n</p><p>Apart from this wish, even if he still does not move from the spot, his life\u2019s troublesome way is perhaps spent in useless sufferings, for we are speaking of those who suffer essentially, not of those who have the consolation that their sufferings are for the benefit of a good cause, for the benefit of others. It was bound to be thus \u2013 the journey to the foreign country was not long; in one moment he was there, there in that strange country where the suffering ones meet, but not those who have ceased to grieve, not those whose tears eternity cannot wipe away, for as an old devotional book so simply and movingly says, \u201cHow can God dry your tears in the next world if you have not wept?\u201d Perhaps someone else comes in a different way, but to the same place. \n</p>\n<ul><li>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, <i>Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits</i>, Hong 1993 pp. 102-103</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Camus\" title=\"Albert Camus\">Albert Camus</a> wrote about the idea of being a stranger in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A <a href=\"/wiki/The_Stranger_(Camus_novel)\" title=\"The Stranger (Camus novel)\">stranger</a> for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual does not want to be a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called \"the existential attitude philosophical suicide.\" This is how he put it in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus\" title=\"The Myth of Sisyphus\">The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Writings</a></i> </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Now, it is admitted that the absurd is the contrary of hope, it is seen that existential thought for <a href=\"/wiki/Lev_Shestov\" title=\"Lev Shestov\">Chestov</a> (Lev Shestov 1866-1938) presupposes the absurd but proves it only to dispel it. Such subtlety of thought is a conjuror's emotional trick. When Chestov elsewhere sets his absurd in opposition to current morality and reason, he calls it truth and redemption. Hence, there is basically in that definition of the absurd an approbation that Chestov grants it. What is perceptible in Leo Chestov will be perhaps even more so in Kierkegaard. To be sure, it is hard to outline clear propositions in so elusive a writer. But, despite apparently opposed writings, beyond the pseudonyms, the tricks, and the smiles, can be felt throughout that work, as it were, the presentiment (at the same time as the apprehension) of a truth which eventually bursts forth in the last works: Kierkegaard likewise takes the leap. Kierkegaard\u2019s view that despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin. For sin is what alienates from God. The absurd, which is the metaphysical state of the consciousness of man, does not lead to God. Perhaps this notion will become clearer if I risk this shocking statement: the absurd is sin without God. It is a matter of living in that state of the absurd. I am taking the liberty at this point of calling the existential attitude philosophical suicide. But this does not imply a judgment. It is a convenient way of indicating the movement by which a thought negates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation. For the existential negation is their God. To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason. (Let me assert again: it is not the affirmation of God that is questioned here, but rather the logic leading to that affirmation.)

When the heart is niggardly, when one gives with one eye and with seven eyes looks to see what one will get in return, then one easily discovers a multitude of sins. But when the heart is filled with love, then the eye is never deceived; for love when it gives, does not scrutinize the gift, but its eye is fixed on the Lord. When the heart is filled with envy, then the eye has power to call forth uncleanness even in the pure; but when love dwells in the heart, then the eye has the power to foster the good in the unclean; but this eye does not see the evil but the pure, which it loves and encourages it by loving it. Certainly there is a power in this world which by its words turns good into evil, put there is a power above which turns the evil into good; that power is the love which covers a multitude of sins.\n</p><p>When hate dwells in the heart, then sin lies at a man\u2019s door, and its manifold desires exist in him; but when love dwells in the heart, then sin flees far away, and he sees it no more. When disputes, malice, wrath, quarrels, dissensions, factions fill the heart, does one then need to go far in order to discover the multitudinousness of sin, or does a man need to love very long to produce these outside of himself! But when joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance dwell in the heart, what wonder, then, that a man, even if he were surrounded by a multitude of sins, remains an alien, a stranger, who understands only a very little about the customs of the country, even if these were explained to him? Would not this, then, be a covering of the multitude of sins?\n</p>\n<ul><li>Soren Kierkegaard <i>Three Edifying Discourses</i> 1843, Swenson translation 1943 p. 69.</li></ul>\n<p>Love does not seek its own. Love does not seek its own, for there are no mine and yours in love. But \"mine\" and \"yours\" are only relational specifications of \"one's own\"; thus, if there are no mine and yours, there is no \"one's own\" either. But if there is no \"one's own\" at all, then it is of course impossible to seek one's own. Justice is identified by its giving each his own, just as it also in turn claims its own. This means that justice pleads the cause of its own, divides and assigns, determines what each can lawfully call his own, judges and punishes if anyone refuses to make any distinction between mine and yours. The individual has the right to so as he pleases with this contentious and yet legally entitled mine; and if he seeks his own in no other way than that which justice allows, justice has nothing with which to reproach him and has no right to upbraid him for anything. As soon as someone is defrauded of his own, or as soon as someone defrauds another of his own, justice intervenes, because it safeguards the common security in which everyone has his own, which he rightfully has.-But sometimes a change intrudes, a revolution, a war, an earthquake, or some such terrible misfortune, and everything is confused. Justice tries in vain to secure for each person his own; it cannot maintain the distinction between mine and yours; in the confusion it cannot keep the balance and therefore throws away the scales-it despairs! Terrible spectacle! Yet does not love in a certain sense, even if in the most blissful way, produce the same confusion? But love, it too is an event, the greatest of all, yet also the happiest. Love is a change, the most remarkable of all, but the most desirable-in fact we say in a very good sense that someone who is gripped by love is changed or becomes changed. Love is a revolution, the most profound of all, but the most blessed! \n</p>\n<ul><li>Soren Kierkegaard, <i>Works of Love</i>, 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 264-265</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Abstraction\">Abstraction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Abstraction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>An element of Kierkegaard's critique of modernity in his socio-political work, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Two_Ages\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Two Ages\">Two Ages</a></i>, is the mention of <a href=\"/wiki/Money\" title=\"Money\">money</a> \u2014 which he calls an <a href=\"/wiki/Abstraction\" title=\"Abstraction\">abstraction</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an <a href=\"/wiki/Ersatz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ersatz\">ersatz</a> reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no <a href=\"/wiki/Concrete_(philosophy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concrete (philosophy)\">concrete</a> reality, neither now nor in the future.\n</p><p>\nHow is money an abstraction? Money gives the illusion that it has a direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a better place for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world \u2014to give it shape, form and meaning\u2014 with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that \"a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery. </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Do not forget to do good and to share \u2013 Hebrews 13.16 - But do not forget either that this incessant talk by worldliness about beneficence and benevolence and generosity and charitable donations and gift upon gift is almost merciless. Ah, let the newspaper writers and tax collectors and parish beadles talk about generosity and count and count; but let us never ignore that Christianity speaks essentially of mercifulness, that Christianity would least of all be guilty of mercilessness, as if poverty and misery not only needed money etc. but also were excluded from the highest, from being able to be generous, beneficent, benevolent. But people prattle and prate ecclesiastically-worldly and worldly-ecclesiastically about generosity, beneficence-but forget, even in the sermon, mercifulness. Preaching should indeed be solely and only about mercifulness. If you know how to speak effectually about this, then generosity will follow of itself and come by itself accordingly as the individual is capable of it. But bear in mind, that if a person raised money, money, money by speaking about generosity-bear this in mind, that by being silent about mercifulness he would be acting mercilessly toward the poor and miserable person for whom he procured relief by means of the money of wealthy generosity. Bear this I mind, that if poverty and misery disturb us with their pleas, we can of course manage to get help for them through generosity; but bear this in mind, that it would be much more appalling if we constrained poverty and misery \u201cto hinder our prayers,\u201d as Scripture says (1 Peter 3:7), by grumbling against us to God-because we were atrociously unfair to poverty and misery by not telling that they are able to practice mercifulness. We shall now adhere to this point in this discourse about mercifulness and guard ourselves against confusing mercifulness with what is linked to external conditions, that is, what love as such does not have in its power, whereas it truly has mercifulness in its power just as surely as it has a heart in its bosom. It does not follow that because a person has a heart in his bosom he has money in his pocket, but the first is still more important and certainly is decisive with regard to mercifulness.

He moves from the world historical, the general, to the single individual, the specific. The first from the esthete and the second from the ethicist in <i>Either/Or</i> and the third from the book that explained all his previous works; <i><a href=\"/wiki/Concluding_Unscientific_Postscript\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\">Concluding Unscientific Postscript</a></i>.</p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>As has already been noted above, all <a href=\"/wiki/Classic\" title=\"Classic\">classic</a> productions stand equally high, because each one stands infinitely high. If, despite this fact, one were to attempt to introduce an order of rank into the classic procession, one would evidently have to choose as a basis for such a distinction, something that was not essential; for if the basis were essential, the difference itself would become an essential difference; from that it would again follow that the word \"classic\" was wrongly predicated of the group as a whole. The more abstract the idea is, the smaller the probability of a numerous representation. But how does the idea become concrete? By being permeated with the <a href=\"/wiki/Historical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Historical\">historical</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Consciousness\" title=\"Consciousness\">consciousness</a>. The more concrete the idea, the greater the probability. The more abstract the medium, the smaller the probability; the more concrete, the greater. But what does it mean to say that the medium is concrete, other than to say it is language, or is seen in approximation to language; for language is the most concrete of all media. The idea, for example, which comes to expression in sculpture is wholly abstract, and bears no relation to the historical; the medium through which it is expressed is likewise abstract, consequently there is a great probability that the section of the classic works which includes sculpture will contain only a few. In this I have the testimony of time and experience on my side. If, on the other hand, I take a concrete idea and a concrete medium, then it seems otherwise. <a href=\"/wiki/Homer\" title=\"Homer\">Homer</a> is indeed a classic <a href=\"/wiki/Poet\" title=\"Poet\">poet</a>, but just because the epic idea is a concrete idea, and because the medium is language, it so happens that in the section of the classics which contains the epic, there are many epics conceivable, which are all equally classic, because history constantly furnishes us with new epic material. In this too, I have the testimony of history and the assent of experience. <i>Either/Or Part I</i>, Swenson p. 49, 53\n</p></blockquote>  <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The two positions touched on here could be regarded as attempts to actualize an ethical life-view. The reason that they do not succeed is that the individual has chosen himself in his isolation or has chosen himself abstractly. To say it in other words, the individual has not chosen himself <a href=\"/wiki/Ethics\" title=\"Ethics\">ethically</a>. He therefore has no connection with <a href=\"/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality_(Aristotle)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)\">actuality</a>, and when that is the case no ethical way of life can be put into practice. But the person who chooses himself ethically chooses himself concretely as this specific individual, and he achieves this concretion because this choice is identical with the <a href=\"/wiki/Repentance\" title=\"Repentance\">repentance</a>, which ratifies the <a href=\"/wiki/Choice\" title=\"Choice\">choice</a>. The individual with these capacities, these inclinations, these drives, these passions, influenced by this specific social milieu, as this specific product of a specific <a href=\"/wiki/Social_environment\" title=\"Social environment\">environment</a>. But as he becomes aware of all this, he takes upon himself <a href=\"/wiki/Moral_responsibility\" title=\"Moral responsibility\">responsibility</a> for all of it. He does not hesitate over whether he will take this particular thing or not, for he knows that if he does not do it something much more important will be lost. In the moment of choice, he is in complete isolation, for he withdraws from his social milieu, and yet at the same moment he is in absolute continuity, for he chooses himself as a product. And this choice is freedom\u2019s choice in such a way that in choosing himself as product he can just as well be said to produce himself. At the moment of choice, he is at the point of consummation, for his personality is consummating itself, and yet at the same moment he is at the very beginning, because he is choosing himself according to his freedom.

What is this? Yes, it is time. But time cannot be assigned a place within pure thinking. What, then, do annulment and transition and a new unity signify? What, if anything, does it mean to think in such a way that one always merely makes a show of it because everything that is said is absolutely revoked? And what does it mean not to admit that one thinks this way but then continually to proclaim from the housetops the positive truth of this pure thinking? Just as existence has joined thinking and existing, inasmuch as an existing person is a thinking person, so are there two media: the medium of abstraction and the medium of actuality. But pure thinking is yet a third medium, very recently invented. It begins, it is said, after the most exhaustive abstraction. Pure thinking is-what shall I say-piously or thoughtlessly unaware of the relation that abstraction still continually has to that from which it abstracts. Here in this pure thinking there is rest for every doubt; here is the eternal positive truth and whatever one cares to say. This means that pure thinking is a phantom. And if Hegelian philosophy is free from all postulates, it has attained this with one insane postulate: the beginning of pure thinking. For the existing person, existing is for him his highest interest, and his interestedness in existing in his actuality. What actuality is cannot be rendered in the language of abstraction. Actuality is an <i>inter-esse</i> [between being] between thinking and being in the hypothetical unity of abstraction. Abstraction deals with possibility and actuality, but its conception of actuality is a false rendition, since the medium is not actuality but possibility. Only by annulling actuality can abstraction grasp it, but to annul it is precisely to change it into possibility. Within abstraction everything that is said about actuality in the language of abstraction is said within possibility. That is, in the language of actuality all abstraction is related to actuality as a possibility, not to an actuality within abstraction and possibility. Actuality, existence, is the dialectical element in a trilogy, the beginning and end of which cannot be for an existing person, who <i>qua</i> existing is in the <a href=\"/wiki/Dialectic\" title=\"Dialectic\">dialectical</a> element. Abstraction merges the trilogy. Quite right. But how does it do it? Is abstraction a something that does it, or is it not the act of the abstractor? But the abstractor is, after all, an existing person, and as an existing person is consequently in the dialectical element, which he cannot mediate or merge, least of all absolutely, as long as he is existing. If he does do it, then this must be related as a possibility to actuality, to the existence which he himself is. He must explain how he goes about it-that is, how he as an existing person goes about it, or whether he ceases to be an existing person, and whether an existing person has a right to do that. As soon as we begin to ask such questions, we are asking ethically and are maintaining the claim of the ethical upon the existing person, which cannot be that he is supposed to abstract from existence, but that he is supposed to exist, which is also the existing person\u2019s highest interest. \n</p><ul><li>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>, Vol 1, pp. 314-315 Hong translation</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Death\">Death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Death\" title=\"Death\">Death</a> is inevitable and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact in order to live passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Concluding_Unscientific_Postscript\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\">Concluding Unscientific Postscript</a></i>, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, \"I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his <a href=\"/wiki/Three_Upbuilding_Discourses,_1844\" title=\"Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844\">Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844</a>. </p><blockquote><p>We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death?<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dread_or_anxiety\">Dread or anxiety</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Dread or anxiety\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3><p>\nFor Kierkegaard's author, <i>Vigilius Haufniensis</i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Anxiety\" title=\"Anxiety\">anxiety</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Existential_dread\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Existential dread\">dread</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Angst\" title=\"Angst\">angst</a> (depending on the translation and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our \"dizziness of freedom.\"</p><blockquote><p>Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning <a href=\"/wiki/Abyss_(religion)\" title=\"Abyss (religion)\">abyss</a> becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, <a href=\"/wiki/Anxiety\" title=\"Anxiety\">anxiety</a> is the dizziness of <a href=\"/wiki/Free_will\" title=\"Free will\">freedom</a>, which emerges when the spirit wants to <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/posit#Verb\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:Special:Search/posit\">posit</a> the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, <a href=\"/wiki/Psychology\" title=\"Psychology\">psychology</a> cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the <a href=\"/wiki/Leap_of_faith\" title=\"Leap of faith\">leap</a>, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as <a href=\"/wiki/Ambiguous\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ambiguous\">ambiguously</a> guilty as it is possible to become. Vigilius Haufniensis, <i>The Concept of Anxiety</i> p. 61.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Concept_of_Anxiety\" title=\"The Concept of Anxiety\">The Concept of Anxiety</a></i>, Haufniensis focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: <a href=\"/wiki/Adam_and_Eve\" title=\"Adam and Eve\">Adam</a>'s choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed <a href=\"/wiki/Original_sin\" title=\"Original sin\">original sin</a>, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.\n</p><p>However, Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (<a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre\" title=\"Jean-Paul Sartre\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. \u2026 Anxiety is freedom\u2019s possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness.

The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a state of tension. That tension between two aspects of the \"self\" that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person is in a state of <a href=\"/wiki/Existential_despair\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Existential despair\">despair</a>. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.\nIn <i><a href=\"/wiki/Either/Or\" title=\"Either/Or\">Either/Or</a></i>, <i>A</i> and <i>Judge William</i> each has one <a href=\"/wiki/Epistolary_novel\" title=\"Epistolary novel\">epistolary novel</a> in two volumes. The <i>A</i> is an aesthete well aware that he can use the power of interpretation to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend <i>Judge William,</i> argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.\nAnother perspective, one in which an individual can find some measure of freedom from despair, is available for the person with religious \"faith.\" This attunes the individual so that he or she can recognize what has always been there: a self to be realized within the circumstances it finds itself right now, i.e., this inner attunement brings about a sort of synthesis between the infinite and the finite.\nIn <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fear_and_Trembling\" title=\"Fear and Trembling\">Fear and Trembling</a></i>, <i>Johannes de Silentio</i> argues that the choice of <a href=\"/wiki/Abraham\" title=\"Abraham\">Abraham</a> to obey the private, unethical, commandment of God to sacrifice his son reveals what faith entails: he directs his consciousness absolutely toward \"the absolute\" rather than the merely ethical, i.e., he practices an inner spirituality that seeks to be \"before god\" rather than seeking to understand himself as an ethically upright person. His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning. It is only when he acts <i>with fear and trembling</i> that he demonstrates a full awareness that murdering a son is absolutely wrong, ethically speaking.\n</p><p>Despair has several specific levels that a person can find themselves, each one further in despair than the last as laid out in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Sickness_Unto_Death\" title=\"The Sickness Unto Death\">The Sickness Unto Death</a></i>.\n</p><p>The first level is \"The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self.\" Essentially this level is one which has the wrong conception of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures the success of his life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you know you are in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.\n</p><p>The next level of despair is \"The despair that is conscious of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self in which there is something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself.\" This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God or at the very least see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading \"Despair over the earthly.\"\n</p><p>The second level of conscious despair under the heading \"Despair over the eternal.\" Someone in this level views themself in light of their own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be comforted by the light of God.\n</p><p>The last and lowest form of despair is the desire \"In despair to will to be oneself.\" This last form of despair is also referred to by Kierkegaard as \"demonic despair\" (Note that the term demonic is used in the Classical Greek Sense, not the modern sense). In this form of despair, the individual finds him or herself in despair, understands they are in despair, seeks some way to alleviate it, and yet no help is forthcoming. As a result, the self becomes hardened against any form of help and \"Even if God in heaven and all the angels offered him aid, he would not want it.\" At this level of despair the individual revels in their own despair and sees their own pain as lifting them up above the base nature of other humans who do not find themselves in this state. This is the least common form of despair and Kierkegaard claims it is mostly found in true poets. This despair can also be called the despair of defiance, as it is the despair that strikes out against all that is eternal. One last note is that as one travels further down the forms of despair, the number of people in each group becomes fewer.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ethics\">Ethics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Ethics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Abraham.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Abraham.jpg/250px-Abraham.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Abraham.jpg/375px-Abraham.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Abraham.jpg/500px-Abraham.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Abraham.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>In <a href=\"/wiki/Fear_and_Trembling\" title=\"Fear and Trembling\">Fear and Trembling</a>, Johannes de Silentio analyzes <a href=\"/wiki/Abraham\" title=\"Abraham\">Abraham</a>'s action to sacrifice <a href=\"/wiki/Isaac\" title=\"Isaac\">Isaac</a>.  Silentio argues that Abraham is a knight of faith.</div></div></div>\n<p>Many philosophers who initially read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of <i>Johannes de Silentio</i>) <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fear_and_Trembling\" title=\"Fear and Trembling\">Fear and Trembling</a></i>, often come to the conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a <a href=\"/wiki/Divine_command_theory\" title=\"Divine command theory\">divine command</a> law of ethics. The divine command theory is a <a href=\"/wiki/Meta-ethics\" title=\"Meta-ethics\">metaethical</a> theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by <a href=\"/wiki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a>; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God <i>transcends</i> ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Teleology\" title=\"Teleology\">teleological</a> suspension of the ethical</i>. Abraham, the <a href=\"/wiki/Knight_of_faith\" title=\"Knight of faith\">knight of faith</a>, chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of <i>Father of Faith</i>. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.\n</p><p>But there is no valid logical argument one can make to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage).\n</p><p>\nIn <i><a href=\"/wiki/Either/Or\" title=\"Either/Or\">Either/Or</a></i>, Kierkegaard insists that the single individual has ethical <a href=\"/wiki/Moral_responsibility\" title=\"Moral responsibility\">responsibility</a> of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics gets in the way of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an \"eternal happiness\", or the <a href=\"/wiki/Salvation\" title=\"Salvation\">salvation</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Soul\" title=\"Soul\">soul</a> as the highest good.

Thus the both-and of mediation is not much better, even though less na\u00efve, than the previously described jovial chatter that includes everything. At the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice the individual is allowed to salute the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2-but then, then comes the mediation. So, too, a dog can be taught to walk on two legs for a moment but then, then comes the mediation, and the dog walks on four legs \u2013 mediation also does that. Spiritually understood, a human being\u2019s upright walk is his absolute respect for the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, otherwise he walks on all fours. When it is a matter of relative elements mediation has its significance (that they are all equal before mediation), but when it is a matter of the absolute end or goal, mediation means that the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is reduced to a <a href=\"/wiki/Relativism\" title=\"Relativism\">relative</a> \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. It is not true, either, that the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 becomes concrete in the relative ends, because resignation\u2019s absolute distinction will at every moment safeguard the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 against all fraternizing. It is true that the individual oriented toward the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, is in the relative ends, but he is not in them in such a way that the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is exhausted in them. It is true that before God and before the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 we are all equal, but it is not true that God or the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is equal with everything else for me or for a particular individual. It may be very commendable for a particular individual to be a councilor of justice, a good worker in the office, no.1 lover in the society, almost a virtuoso on the flute, captain of the popinjay shooting club, superintendent of the orphanage, a noble and respected father-in short, a devil of a fellow who can both-and has time for everything. But let the councilor take care that he does not become too much a devil of a fellow and proceed to do both all this and have time to direct his life toward the absolute \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. In other words, this <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Both-and&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Both-and (page does not exist)\">both-and</a> means that the absolute <a href=\"/wiki/Telos_(philosophy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Telos (philosophy)\">\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2</a> is on the same level with everything else.

If, then, at the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice, an individual has understood this, it surely cannot mean that he is supposed to have forgotten it the next moment.

Becoming aware of our true self is our true task and endeavor in life\u2014it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist at a level that is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our <a href=\"/wiki/Pleasure\" title=\"Pleasure\">pleasures</a>\u2014our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in <i>Either/Or</i>, </p><blockquote><p>Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because if there is to be meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little <a href=\"/wiki/Teleology\" title=\"Teleology\">teleology</a> as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and <a href=\"/wiki/Contemplate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Contemplate\">contemplate</a> life. Now you rest in despair. <a href=\"/wiki/Absurdism\" title=\"Absurdism\">Nothing concerns you</a>; you step aside for nothing; \u201cIf someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.\u201d You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you \u201cAlways count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.\u201d You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl\u2019s smile, and now you are \u201cinvolved,\u201d for just on certain occasions you are not \u201cinvolved,\u201d so at other times you are \u201cat your service\u201d in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. \u201cYou work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.\u201d But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world. <i>Either/Or Part II</i> p. 195-196, 272ff</p></blockquote>\n<p>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sickness_Unto_Death\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sickness Unto Death\">Sickness Unto Death</a></i> specifically Kierkegaard deals with the self as a product of relations. In this sense, a human results from a relation between the Infinite (Noumena, spirit, eternal) and Finite (Phenomena, body, temporal). This does not create a true self, as a human can live without a \"self\" as he defines it. Instead, the Self or ability for the self to be created from a relation to the Absolute or God (the Self can only be realized through a relation to God) arises as a relation between the relation of the Finite and Infinite relating back to the human. This would be a positive relation.\n</p><p>\nAn individual person, for Kierkegaard, is a particular that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in \"the public\" (or \"the crowd\" or \"the herd\") or subsuming a human being as simply a member of a species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In <a href=\"/wiki/Four_Upbuilding_Discourses,_1843\" title=\"Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\">Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843</a> Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. </p><blockquote><p>In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person\u2019s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, if for no other reason than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law. <i>Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses</i>, by Soren Kiekegaard Hong, p. 143</p></blockquote><p>\nKierkegaard's critique of the modern age, therefore, is about the loss of what it means to be an individual. Modern society contributes to this dissolution of what it means to be an individual. Through its production of the <a href=\"/wiki/False_idol\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"False idol\">false idol</a> of \"the public\", it diverts attention away from individuals to a mass public that loses itself in abstractions, communal dreams, and fantasies. It is helped in this task by the media and the mass production of products to keep it distracted. Even the fight for temporal equality is a distraction. In <a href=\"/wiki/Works_of_Love\" title=\"Works of Love\">Works of Love</a> he writes, </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p> To bring about similarity among people in the world, to apportion to people, if possible equally, the conditions of temporality, is indeed something that preoccupies worldliness to a high degree.

Well-intentioned worldliness remains piously, if you will, convinced that there must be one temporal condition, one earthly dissimilarity \u2013 found by means of calculations and surveys or in whatever other way \u2013 that is <a href=\"/wiki/Liberalism\" title=\"Liberalism\">equality</a>. <i>Works of Love</i>, by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 71-72 see pp. 61-90\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although Kierkegaard attacked \"the public\", he is supportive of communities:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>In community, the individual is, crucial as the prior condition for forming a community. \u2026 Every individual in the community guarantees the community; the public is a chimera, numerality is everything\u2026</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Journals<sup id=\"cite_ref-Journals_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Journals-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span id=\"Pathos_.28passion.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pathos_(passion)\">Pathos (passion)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Pathos (passion)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>For Kierkegaard, in order to apprehend the absolute, the mind must radically empty itself of objective content. What supports this radical emptying, however, is the desire for the absolute.

For the Stoics, Pathos (Passion) is a Perturbation which man has to overcome in a similar manner to Kierkegaard's concept of Objective Truth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\nAccording to Kierkegaard, the human self desires that which is beyond <a href=\"/wiki/Reason\" title=\"Reason\">reason</a>. Desire itself appears to be a desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Plato\" title=\"Plato\">Plato</a>, is a kind of desire for <a href=\"/wiki/Immortality\" title=\"Immortality\">immortality</a>\u2014that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. <a href=\"/wiki/Erotic_love\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Erotic love\">Erotic love</a> itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of <a href=\"/wiki/Time\" title=\"Time\">time</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Space\" title=\"Space\">space</a>. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life\u2014it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals in the name of a higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion. </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>If anyone is unwilling to learn from Christianity to love himself in the right way, he cannot love the neighbor either.

To love yourself in the right way and to love the neighbor correspond perfectly to one another, fundamentally they are one and the same thing.

Intellectual reason had been deified by Hegel in his theology and Kierkegaard felt this would lead to the <a href=\"/wiki/Objectification\" title=\"Objectification\">objectification</a> of religion.</p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>There is an old proverb: <i>oratio, tentatio, meditatio, faciunt theologum</i> [prayer, trial, meditation, make a theologian]. Similarly, for a subjective thinker, <a href=\"/wiki/Imagination\" title=\"Imagination\">imagination</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Feeling\" title=\"Feeling\">feeling</a> and dialectics in impassioned existence-inwardness are required. But first and last, passion, because for an existing person it is impossible to think about existence without becoming passionate, inasmuch as existing is a prodigious contradiction from which the subjective thinker is not to abstract, for then it is easy, but in which he is to remain. In a world-historical dialectic, individuals fade away into humankind; in a dialectic such as that it is impossible to discover you and me, an individual existing human being, even if new magnifying glasses for the concrete are invented. The subjective thinker is a <a href=\"/wiki/Dialectic\" title=\"Dialectic\">dialectician</a> oriented to the <a href=\"/wiki/Existential\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Existential\">existential</a>; he has the intellectual passion to hold firm the qualitative disjunction. But, on the other hand, if the qualitative disjunction is used flatly and simply, if it is applied altogether abstractly to the <a href=\"/wiki/Individual\" title=\"Individual\">individual</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">human</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Being\" title=\"Being\">being</a>, then one can run the ludicrous risk of saying something infinitely decisive, and of being right in what one says, and still not say the least thing. Therefore, in the psychological sense it is really remarkable to see the absolute disjunction deceitfully used simply for evasion. When the death penalty is placed on every crime, the result is that no crimes at all are punished. It is the same with the absolute disjunction when applied flatly and simply; it is just like a silent letter-it cannot be pronounced or, if it can be pronounced, it says nothing. The <a href=\"/wiki/Subjectivity\" title=\"Subjectivity\">subjective</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Intellectual\" title=\"Intellectual\">thinker</a>, therefore, has with intellectual <a href=\"/wiki/Passion_(emotion)\" title=\"Passion (emotion)\">passion</a> the absolute disjunction as belonging to existence, but he has it as the final decision that prevents everything from ending in a quantifying. Thus he has it readily available, but not in such a way that by abstractly recurring to it, he just frustrates <a href=\"/wiki/Existence\" title=\"Existence\">existence</a>. The subjective thinker, therefore, has also <a href=\"/wiki/Esthetic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Esthetic\">esthetic</a> passion and <a href=\"/wiki/Ethics\" title=\"Ethics\">ethical</a> passion, whereby concretion is gained. All existence-issues are passionate, because existence, if one becomes <a href=\"/wiki/Conscious\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conscious\">conscious</a> of it, involves passion. To think about them so as to leave out passion is not to think about them at all, is to forget the point that one indeed is oneself and existing person. Yet the subjective thinker is not a poet even if he is also a poet, not an ethicist even if he is also an ethicist, but is also a dialectician and is himself essentially existing, whereas the poet\u2019s existence is inessential in relation to the poem, and likewise the ethicist\u2019s in relation to the teaching, and the dialectician\u2019s in relation to the thought. The subjective thinker is not a scientist-scholar; he is an artist. To exist is an art. The subjective thinker is esthetic enough for his life to have esthetic content, ethical enough to <a href=\"/wiki/Regulation\" title=\"Regulation\">regulate</a> it, dialectical enough in thinking to master it.

To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important to look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual\u2014what makes the individual <i>who he is in distinction from others</i>. It is what is inside\u2014what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity\u2014that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the <i>unique</i> relationship between the subject and object.\n</p><p>\nJohann Fichte wrote similarly about subjectivity in his 1799 book <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Vocation_of_Man\" title=\"The Vocation of Man\">The Vocation of Man</a></i>. </p><blockquote><p>I must, however, remind my reader that the \"I\" who speaks in the book is not the author himself, but it is his earnest wish that the reader should himself assume this character, and that he should not rest contented with a mere historical apprehension of what is here said, but really and truly, during reading, hold converse with himself, deliberate, draw conclusions, and form resolutions, like his representative in the book, and, by his own labour and reflection, developed out of his own soul, and build up within himself, that mode of thought the mere picture of which is laid before him in the work. Preface</p></blockquote>\n<p>Scientists and historians, for example, study the objective world, hoping to elicit the truth of nature\u2014or perhaps the truth of <a href=\"/wiki/History\" title=\"History\">history</a>. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold\u2014in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events that in the past appeared to fall outside the control of humans.\n</p><p>\nIn most respects, Climacus did not have problems with <a href=\"/wiki/Science\" title=\"Science\">science</a> or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws\u2014and by doing so could ascertain what a human\u2019s true self is. That is, the assumption is that by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in, <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>: </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>It is the existing <a href=\"/wiki/Spirit\" title=\"Spirit\">spirit</a> who asks about <a href=\"/wiki/Truth\" title=\"Truth\">truth</a>, presumably because he wants to exist in it, but in any case the questioner is <a href=\"/wiki/Conscious\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conscious\">conscious</a> of being an existing individual human being. In this way I believe I am able to make myself understandable to every Greek and to every <a href=\"/wiki/Rationality\" title=\"Rationality\">rational</a> human being. If a German philosopher follows his inclination to put on an act and first transforms himself into a superrational something, just as alchemists and sorcerers bedizen themselves fantastically, in order to answer the question about truth in an extremely satisfying way, this is of no more concern to me than his satisfying answer, which no doubt is extremely satisfying-if one is fantastically dressed up. But whether a German philosopher is or is not doing this can easily be ascertained by anyone who with enthusiasm concentrates his soul on willing to allow himself to be guided by a sage of that kind, and uncritically just uses his guidance compliantly by willing to form his <a href=\"/wiki/Existence\" title=\"Existence\">existence</a> according to it. When a person as a <a href=\"/wiki/Learner\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Learner\">learner</a> enthusiastically relates in this way to such a German professor, he accomplishes the most superb epigram upon him, because a speculator of that sort is anything but served by a learner\u2019s honest and enthusiastic zeal for expressing and accomplishing, for existentially appropriating his <a href=\"/wiki/Wisdom\" title=\"Wisdom\">wisdom</a>, since this wisdom is something that the Herr Professor himself has <a href=\"/wiki/Imagination\" title=\"Imagination\">imagined</a> and has written books about but has never attempted himself. It has not even occurred to him that it should be done. Like the customers clerk who, in the belief that his business was merely to write, wrote what he himself could not read, so there are speculative thinkers who merely write, and write that which, if it is to be read with the aid of action, if I may put it that way, proves to be nonsense, unless it is perhaps intended only for fantastical beings. P. 191\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hegel wanted to philosophize about Christianity but had no intention to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to know who he is by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.\n</p><p>\nSubjectivity is that which the individual\u2014and no one else\u2014has. But what does it mean to have something like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a <a href=\"/wiki/Car\" title=\"Car\">car</a> or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone\u2014it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways\u2014these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual\u2014that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society's, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices\u2014the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is\u2014to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>We are truly reluctant to make a young person arrogant prematurely and teach him to get busy judging the world. God forbid that anything we say should be able to contribute to developing this malady in a person. Indeed, we think we ought to make his life so strenuously inwardly that from the very beginning he has something else to think about, because it no doubt is a morbid hatred of the world that, perhaps without having considered the enormous responsibility, wants to be persecuted. But on the other hand we are also truly reluctant to deceive a young person by suppressing the difficulty and by suppressing it at the very moment we endeavor to recommend Christianity, inasmuch as that is the very moment we speak. We put our confidence in boldly daring to praise Christianity, also with the addition that in the world its reward, to put it mildly, is ingratitude. We regard it as our duty continually to speak about it in advance, so that we do not sometimes praise Christianity with an omission of what is essentially difficult, and at other times, perhaps on the occasion of a particular text, hit upon a few grounds of comfort for the person tried and tested in life. No, just when Christianity is being praised most strongly, the difficulty must simultaneously be emphasized. (\u2026.) Christianly the world\u2019s opposition stands in an essential relationship to the inwardness of Christianity. Moreover, the person who chooses Christianity should at that very moment have an impression of its difficulty so that he can know what it is that he is choosing.

Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one who wants to be a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, <i>Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits</i> </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Everyone must make an accounting to God as an individual; the king must make an accounting to God as an individual, and the most wretched beggar must make an accounting to God as an individual \u2013 lest anyone be arrogant by being more than an individual, lest anyone despondently think that he is not an individual, perhaps because in the busyness of the world he does not even have a name but is designated only by a number.

It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose\u2014what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests\u2014the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.\n</p><p>Kierkegaard decided to step up to the <a href=\"/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil\" title=\"Tree of the knowledge of good and evil\">Tree of the knowledge of good and evil</a> for himself, replacing <a href=\"/wiki/Adam\" title=\"Adam\">Adam</a>, and make his <a href=\"/wiki/Choice\" title=\"Choice\">choice</a> in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator.

Though the stages represent only one way of interpreting Kierkegaard's thought, it has become a popular way of introducing his authorship.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2011)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> In continental European circles, stage theory never took hold in the same way. This typifies what Kierkegaard was talking about throughout his writing career. \"Early American scholars\" and \"European circles\" denote partitions of thought concerning the writings of his works. He was against \"reflecting oneself out of reality\" and partitioning the \"world of the spirit\" because the world of the spirit cannot be objectively divided. He wrote about Hegel's stages in his book, <i>Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i>: </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><blockquote><p>These stages may be compared to those of the ages of man. The child is still in the primal immediate unity of the will with nature, as representing both his own nature and the nature which surrounds him. The second stage, adolescence, when individuality is in process of becoming independent, is the living spirituality, the vitality of Spirit, which while setting no end before it as yet, moves forward, has aspirations, and takes an interest in everything which comes its way. The third is the age of manhood; this is the period of work for a particular end, to which the man makes himself subserviently, to which he devotes his energies. Finally, old age might be considered as a last stage, which having the Universal before it as an end, and recognizing this end, has turned back from the particular interests of life and work to the universal aim, the absolute final end, and has, as it were, gathered itself together out of the wide and manifold interests of actual outward existence and concentrated itself in the infinite depths of its inner life. Such are the determinations which follow in a logical manner from the nature of the Notion. At the close it will become apparent that even the original immediacy does not exist as immediacy, but is something posited. The child itself is something begotten.  George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,  <i>Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion vol 1</i> translated by Rev.

A traveler like that changes places, not himself; and thus it is alright for him to mention and to recount the change in a direct, unchanged form. But in the world of the spirit to change place is to be changed oneself, and there all direct assurance of having arrived here and there is an attempt a la <a href=\"/wiki/Baron_Munchausen\" title=\"Baron Munchausen\">Munchausen</a>.

I ask for nothing better than to be known in our <i>objective</i> times as the only person who was not capable of being objective. That subjectivity, inwardness, is truth, that existing is the decisive factor, that this was the way to take to Christianity, which is precisely inwardness, but please note, not every inwardness, which was why the preliminary stages definitely had to be insisted upon-that was my idea, I thought that I had found a similar endeavor in the pseudonymous writings, and I have tried to make clear my interpretation of them and their relation to my <i><a href=\"/wiki/Philosophical_Fragments\" title=\"Philosophical Fragments\">Fragments</a></i>.

The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This makes it easier to degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see.

He did not say, \"Peter must first change and become another person before I can love him again.\" No, he said exactly the opposite, \"Peter is Peter, and I love him. My love, if anything will help him to become another person.\" Therefore he did not break off the friendship in order perhaps to renew it if Peter would have become another person; no, he preserved the friendship unchanged and in that way helped Peter to become another person. Do you think that Peter would have been won again without Christ's faithful friendship? But it is so easy to be a friend when this means nothing else than to request something in particular from the friend and, if the friend does not respond to the request, then to let the friendship cease, until it perhaps begins again if he responds to the request. Is this a relationship of friendship? Who is closer to helping an erring one than the person who calls himself his friend, even if the offense is committed against the friend! But the friend withdraws and says (indeed, it is as if a third person were speaking): When he has become another person, then perhaps he can become my friend again. We are not far from regarding such behavior as magnanimous. But truly we are far from being able to say of such a friend that in loving he loves the person he sees. Christ\u2019s love was boundless, as it must be if this is to be fulfilled: in loving to love the person one sees. This is very easy to perceive. However much and in whatever way a person is changed, he still is not changed in such a way that he becomes invisible. If this-the impossible-is not the case, then of course we do see him, and the duty is to love the person one sees. Ordinarily we think that if a person has essentially changed for the worse, he is then so changed that we are exempt from loving him. But Christianity asks: Can you because of this change no longer see him? The answer to that must be: Certainly I can see him; I see that he is no longer worth loving. But if you see this, then you do not really see him (which you certainly cannot deny you are doing in another sense), you see only the unworthiness and the imperfection and thereby admit that when you loved him you did not see <i>him</i> in another sense but merely saw his excellence and perfections, which you loved. \n</p><ul><li>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, <i>Works of Love</i> (1847) Hong 1995 p. 172-173</li></ul>\n<p>When a person to whom the possible pertains relates himself equally to the duality of the possible, we say: He expects. To expect contains within itself the same duality that the possible has, and to expect is to relate oneself to the possible purely and simply as such. Then the relationship divides according to the way the expecting person chooses. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which for that very reason cannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope. To relate oneself expectancy to the possibility of evil is to fear. But both the one who hopes and the one who fears are expecting. As soon, however, as the choice is made, the possible is changed, because the possibility of the good is the eternal. It is only in the moment of contact that the duality of the possible is equal; therefore, by the decision to choose hope, one decided infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision.\n</p><p>People think that they are speaking with ample experience in dividing a person\u2019s life into certain periods and ages and then call the first period the age of hope or of possibility. What nonsense! Thus, in talk about hope they completely leave out the eternal and yet speak about hope. But how is this possible, since hope pertains to the possibility of the good, and thereby to the eternal! On the other hand, how is it possible to speak about hope in such a way that it is assigned to a certain age! Surely the eternal extends over the whole of life and there is and should be hope to the end; then there is no period that is the age of hope, but a person\u2019s whole life should be the time of hope!

But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were \"on stage.\" There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair.

This is where an individual begins to take on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for <a href=\"/wiki/Goodness_and_value_theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Goodness and value theory\">good</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Evil\" title=\"Evil\">evil</a> and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls <a href=\"/wiki/Repentance\" title=\"Repentance\">repentance</a>. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with <a href=\"/wiki/Dharma\" title=\"Dharma\">Dharma</a> - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as \"dharma\", though dharma is also a <a href=\"/wiki/Law\" title=\"Law\">law</a>). </p><blockquote><p>\"He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely.\" ....  \u201cI repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me and at the same time expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product.\" .... \"It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam.\"  ... \"The <a href=\"/wiki/Either/Or\" title=\"Either/Or\">Either/Or</a> I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose <i>eo ipso</i> the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice.\" S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"Judge Wilhelm,\" a pseudonymous author of <i>Either/Or</i> and the voice who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the commitment to take responsibility for one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of those choices already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way. \n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><blockquote><p>The Christian God is spirit and Christianity is spirit, and there is discord between the flesh and the spirit but the flesh is not the sensuous-it is the selfish. In this sense, even the spiritual can become sensuous-for example, if a person took his spiritual gifts in vain, he would then be carnal. And of course I know that it is not necessary for the Christian that Christ must have been physically beautiful; and it would be grievous-for a reason different from the one you give-because if beauty were some essential, how the believer would long to see him; but from all this it by no means follows that the sensuous is annihilated in Christianity. The first love has the element of beauty in itself, and the joy and fullness that are in the sensuous in its innocence can very well be caught up in Christianity. But let us guard against one thing, a wrong turn that is more dangerous than the one you wish to avoid; let us not become too spiritual. Either/Or Part II p. 50</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The question, namely, is this: Can this love be actualized? After having conceded everything up to this point, you perhaps will say: Well, it is just as difficult to actualize marriage as to actualize first love. To that I must respond: No, for in marriage there is a law of motion. First love remains an unreal <a href=\"/wiki/Noumenon#Positive_and_negative_noumena\" title=\"Noumenon\">in itself</a> that never acquires inner substance because it moves only in the external medium. In the ethical and religious intention, marital love has the possibility of an inner history and is as different from first love as the historical is from the unhistorical. This love is strong, stronger than the whole world, but the moment it doubts it is annihilated; it is like a sleepwalker who is able to walk the most dangerous places with the complete security but plunges down when someone calls his name. Marital love is armed, for in the intention not only is attentiveness directed to the surrounding world but the will is directed toward itself, toward the inner world. Either/Or II p. 94</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The choice itself is crucial for the content of the personality: through the choice the personality submerges itself in that which is being chosen, and when it does not choose, it withers away in atrophy. ... Imagine a captain of a ship the moment a shift of direction must be made; then he may be able to say: I can do either this or that. But if he is not a mediocre captain he will also be aware that during all this the ship is ploughing ahead with its ordinary velocity, and thus there is but a single moment when it is inconsequential whether he does this or does that. So also with a person-if he forgets to take into account the velocity-there eventually comes a moment where it is no longer a matter of an Either/Or, not because he has chosen, but because he has refrained from it, which also can be expressed by saying: Because others have chosen for him-or because he has lost himself.

Whereas living in the ethical sphere involves a commitment to some <a href=\"/wiki/Moral_absolutism\" title=\"Moral absolutism\">moral absolute</a>, living in the religious sphere involves a commitment and relation to the Christian God. Kierkegaard explained this in <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i> like this: </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Johannes the <a href=\"/wiki/Seducer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seducer\">Seducer</a> ends with the <a href=\"/wiki/Thesis\" title=\"Thesis\">thesis</a> that woman is only the moment.

On the whole the conception of <a href=\"/wiki/Time\" title=\"Time\">time</a> is the decisive element in every standpoint up to the paradox, which paradoxically accentuates time.

In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called <i>Religiousness A</i> and <i>Religiousness B</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> One type is symbolized by the <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_philosophy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Greek philosophy\">Greek philosopher</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Socrates\" title=\"Socrates\">Socrates</a>, whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by the realization that the individual is <a href=\"/wiki/Sin\" title=\"Sin\">sinful</a> and is the source of untruth.  In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the <a href=\"/wiki/Paradox\" title=\"Paradox\">paradox</a> that is <a href=\"/wiki/Jesus\" title=\"Jesus\">Jesus</a>, the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox\u2014<a href=\"/wiki/Attributes_of_God_in_Christianity#Transcendence\" title=\"Attributes of God in Christianity\">God, the transcendent</a>, coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason\u2014indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the <a href=\"/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity)\" title=\"Incarnation (Christianity)\">Incarnation</a> nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. </p><blockquote><p>The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man\u2019s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity came up with the idea that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification \u2018before God\u2019, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism. <i>The Sickness Unto Death</i>, Hannay, 1989 p. 115</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Admittance is only through the consciousness of sin; to want to enter by any other road is high treason against Christianity. \u2026 The simple soul who humbly acknowledges himself to be a sinner, himself personally (the single individual), has no need at all to learn about all the difficulties that come when one is neither simple or humble. \u2026 To the extent Christianity, terrifying, will rise up against him and transform itself into madness or horror until he either learns to give up Christianity or-by means of what is anything but scholarly propaedeutics, apologetics, etc., by means of the anguish of a contrite conscience, all in proportion to his need-learns to enter into Christianity by the narrow way, through the consciousness of sin. <i>Practice in Christianity</i>, Hong, 1991, p. 67-68</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span id=\"Kierkegaard.27s_thoughts_on_other_philosophers\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kierkegaard's_thoughts_on_other_philosophers\">Kierkegaard's thoughts on other philosophers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Kierkegaard&#039;s thoughts on other philosophers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kierkegaard_and_Fichte\">Kierkegaard and Fichte</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Kierkegaard and Fichte\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg/150px-Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"176\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg/225px-Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"286\" data-file-height=\"336\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Fichte</div></div></div><p> Kierkegaard wrote much about <a href=\"/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte\" title=\"Johann Gottlieb Fichte\">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a> in his thesis <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Concept_of_Irony\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Concept of Irony\">The Concept of Irony</a></i><sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> as well as in his first book <i><a href=\"/wiki/De_omnibus_dubitandum_est\" title=\"De omnibus dubitandum est\">De omnibus dubitandum est</a></i>, written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, and his Journals.

Both Kierkegaard and Fichte were interested in this idea of beginning with doubt as well as subjectivity. Kierkegaard wrote: \"In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative.

This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by \u2014 to use the words of another author \u2014 Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and <a href=\"/wiki/Robespierre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robespierre\">Robespierre</a>'s attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment \u2014 whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong \u2014 both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.

Has not the logical trinity been advanced in the most ludicrous way? And therefore it did not astound me that my shoemaker had found that it could also be applied to the development of boots, since, as he observes, the dialectic, which is always the first stage in life, finds expression even here, however insignificant this may seem, in the squeaking, which surely has not escaped the attention of some more profound research psychologist. Unity, however, appears only later, in which respect his shoes far surpass all others, which usually disintegrate in the dialectic, a unity which reached the highest level in that pair of boots Carl XII wore on his famous ride, and since he as an orthodox shoemaker proceeded from the thesis that the immediate (feet without shoes \u2014 shoes without feet) is a pure <a href=\"/wiki/Abstraction\" title=\"Abstraction\">abstraction</a> and took it [the dialectical] as the first stage in the development.

And now Christianity \u2014 how has it been treated? I share entirely your disapproval of the way every Christian concept has become so volatilized, so completely dissolved in a mass of fog, that it is beyond all recognition. To the concepts of faith, incarnation, tradition, inspiration, which in the Christian sphere are to lead to a particular historical fact, the philosophers choose to give an entirely different, ordinary meaning, whereby faith has become the immediate consciousness, which essentially is nothing other than the vitale Fluidum of mental life, its atmosphere, and tradition has become the content of a certain experience of the world, while inspiration has become nothing more than God's breathing of the life-spirit into man, and incarnation no more than the presence of one or another idea in one or more individuals. \u2014 Journals IA 328 1836 or 1837\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a journal entry made in 1844, Kierkegaard wrote:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>If Hegel had written the whole of his logic and then said, in the preface or some other place, that it was merely an experiment in thought in which he had even begged the question in many places, then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived.

Hegel claimed that the doctrines and history of Christianity could be explained as a part of the rational unfolding and development of our understanding of the natural world and our place within it. Kierkegaard considered Hegel's explanation of Christianity as a necessary part of world history to be a distortion of the Christian message and a misunderstanding of the limits of human reason. He attempted to refute this aspect of Hegel's thought by suggesting that many doctrines of Christianity - including the <a href=\"/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity)\" title=\"Incarnation (Christianity)\">doctrine of Incarnation</a>, a God who is also human - cannot be explained rationally but remain a logical paradox. However, he was in favor of youthful striving after truth. </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Let a doubting youth, but an existing doubter with youth\u2019s lovable, boundless confidence in a hero of scientific scholarship, venture to find in Hegelian positivity the truth, the truth of existence-he will write a dreadful epigram on Hegel. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean that every youth is capable of overcoming Hegel, far from it. If a young person is conceited and foolish enough to try that, his attack is inane. No, the youth must never think of wanting to attack him; he must rather be willing to submit unconditionally to Hegel with feminine devotedness, but nevertheless with sufficient strength also to stick to his question-then he is a satirist without suspecting it. The youth is an existing doubter; continually suspended in <a href=\"/wiki/Doubt\" title=\"Doubt\">doubt</a>, he grasps for the truth-so that he can exist in it. Consequently, he is negative, and Hegel\u2019s philosophy is, of course, positive-no wonder he puts his trust in it. But for an existing person pure thinking is a <a href=\"/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)\" title=\"Chimera (mythology)\">chimera</a> when the truth is supposed to be the truth in which to exist. Having to exist with the help of the guidance of pure thinking is like having to travel in Denmark with a small map of Europe on which Denmark is no larger than a steel pen-point, indeed, even more impossible. The youth\u2019s admiration, his enthusiasm, and his limitless confidence in Hegel are precisely the satire on Hegel. This would have been discerned long ago if pure thinking had not maintained itself with the aid of a reputation that impresses people, so that they dare not say anything except that it is superb, that they have understood it-although in a certain sense that it is indeed impossible, since no one can be led by this philosophy to understand himself, which is certainly an absolute condition for all other understanding. Socrates has rather ironically said that he did not know for sure whether he was a human being or something else, but in the confessional a Hegelian can say with all solemnity: I do not know whether I am a human being-but I have understood the system. I prefer to say: I know that I am a human being, and I know that I have not understood the system. And when I have said that very directly, I shall add that if any of our Hegelians want to take me into hand and assist me to an understanding of the system, nothing will stand in the way from my side.

Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader. \u2026 Kierkegaard's tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce an elaborate parody of Hegel's entire system. The pseudonymous authorship, from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Either/Or\" title=\"Either/Or\">Either/Or</a></i> to <i><a href=\"/wiki/Concluding_Unscientific_Postscript\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\">Concluding Unscientific Postscript</a></i>, presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is designed to lead readers away from knowledge rather than towards it.</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/#Rhet\">William McDonald</a></cite></div>\n</blockquote><p>\nBy doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard of using the dialectic to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic <i>would lead to a harmonious reconciliation of everything</i>, which Hegel called the <a href=\"/wiki/Absolute_(philosophy)\" title=\"Absolute (philosophy)\">Absolute</a>. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Concept_of_Anxiety\" title=\"The Concept of Anxiety\">The Concept of Anxiety</a></i>, </p><blockquote><p><a href=\"/wiki/Theology\" title=\"Theology\">Dogmatics</a> must not explain <a href=\"/wiki/Original_Sin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Original Sin\">hereditary sin</a> but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving something that no science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand <a href=\"/wiki/Friedrich_Schleiermacher\" title=\"Friedrich Schleiermacher\">Schleiermacher</a>\u2019s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance that he was in the German sense a <a href=\"/wiki/Professor\" title=\"Professor\">professor</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Philosophy\" title=\"Philosophy\">philosophy</a> on a large scale, because he <i>a tout prix</i> [at any price] must explain all things. <i>The Concept of Anxiety</i>, by Reidar Thomte Princeton University Press 1980 P. 20</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kierkegaardian scholars have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One of the more popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section <i>Spheres of existence</i> for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be part of a community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. <a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre\" title=\"Jean-Paul Sartre\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into <a href=\"/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)\" title=\"Bad faith (existentialism)\">bad faith</a>.\n</p><p>This process of reconciliation leads to a \"both/and\" view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work <i><a href=\"/wiki/Either/Or\" title=\"Either/Or\">Either/Or</a></i> is a response to this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy.

In paganism it is quite in order for theology to be treated there. It is related to the same lack of an infinite penetration reflection that endowed the theater in paganism with reality as a kind of divine worship.

Schelling called attention to this Aristotelian term in support of his own distinction between negative and positive philosophy. By negative philosophy he meant \u201clogic\u201d; that was clear enough. On the other hand, it was less clear to me what he really meant by positive philosophy, except insofar as it became evident that it was the philosophy that he himself wished to provide.

As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>After reading through Schopenhauer's Ethic one learns - naturally he is to that extent honest - that he himself is not an ascetic.

In this too it is suspicious, for it is always suspicious to propound an ethic which does not exert so much power over the teacher that he himself expresses. Schopenhauer makes ethics into genius, but that is of course an unethical conception of ethics. He makes ethics into genius and although he prides himself quite enough on being a genius, it has not pleased him, or nature has not allowed him, to become a genius where asceticism and mortification are concerned.</p><div class=\"templatequotecite\">\u2014&#8201;<cite>S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, (Journals, 1854)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Journals_6-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Journals-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Little else is known about Kierkegaard's attitude to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. \"Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany.

There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in <i>Purity of Heart</i> where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is \"to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God\" (cf. Kierkegaard, \"Purity of Heart\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the \"crowd\" mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, \"On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' \")<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, which is our <a href=\"/wiki/Telos_(philosophy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Telos (philosophy)\">telos</a> (cf. Kierkegaard, \"Fear and Trembling\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Harald_Hoffding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Harald Hoffding\">Harald Hoffding</a> (1843-1931) helped introduce Kierkegaard to Western Europe in the early years of the 20th century. He compared Kierkegaard to Eastern philosophy in his 1914 book <i>The Philosophy Of Religion</i> in this way: </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><blockquote><p>A characteristic and very frequent type of religious faith is determined by the need of rest. The main cause of fatigue and exhaustion in life is chiefly unrest and distraction of mind. We are influenced on so many sides that it is difficult for us to collect our thoughts; we are drawn in so many directions that we find it difficult to focus our will on any one aim; so many different and changing feelings are aroused that the inner harmony of the mind is exposed to the danger of dissolution. Owing to this feeling of misfit with our ideal we experience an inner need, while our outer needs are borne in upon us in the guise of pain, frailty, and dependence on the elementary wants of life. In the <a href=\"/wiki/Upanishads\" title=\"Upanishads\">Upanishads</a> we find: \"The Self (Atma), the sinless one, who redeems from old age, death, suffering, hunger, and thirst, whose wishes are the right ones and whose decree is the right one I am that self which men must inquire after and seek to know. He who has found and known this Self has attained all worlds and all wishes.\" And in another place: \u201cSave me, for I feel in this world\u2019s life like a frog in a sealed fountain.\" Jesus of Nazareth says: \" Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Learn of me, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\" \u201cUnquiet is our heart,\" says Augustine to his God, \u201cuntil it find rest in Thee.\" This need for rest rises to a passion in natures such as <a href=\"/wiki/St._Theresa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St. Theresa\">St. Theresa</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Blaise_Pascal\" title=\"Blaise Pascal\">Pascal</a>, and Soren Kierkegaard. There is no doubt an element of deep pathos in <a href=\"/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo\" title=\"Augustine of Hippo\">Augustine</a> also, but in his case we have the Platonist and the prince of the church combined with the earnest seeker, and it is the combination of all these elements which renders him such a unique figure in the history of the religious life. St. Theresa felt the need of union with God so powerfully that death alone could satisfy it: \"I knew not where else to seek this life but in death. The fish, drawn out of the water, sees at any rate the end of its torment; but what death can compare with the life in which I languish?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>With Kierkegaard, too, his great desire was to be released from the struggle of life. The lines which he desired should be inscribed on his gravestone express this longing: \u201cA little while the search is o\u2019er. The din of battle sounds no more.\" In this life the believer finds himself in an alien element; between the inner and the outer, between life and its conditions there is a want of harmony. In Kierkegaard s case, too, we get the metaphor of the fish out of water; it is characteristic of this type that the same figure should be employed by the ancient Indians in the Upanishads, by the Spanish nun of the sixteenth century, and by the northern thinker of the nineteenth century. This trait sheds a light on the psychology of religion. The aim of man is infinite, but he is condemned to spend his life in the world of finitude, and hence it follows that his existence acquires a sort of spasmodic character. In Kierkegaard, and even in Pascal, this opposition is more sharply brought out than in St. Theresa. In the latter it evokes longing and inner aspiration, but her will is occupied entirely by the highest object, and only her memory and her imagination are free to analyse her experiences. But both Pascal and Kierkegaard have constantly to summon the will to their aid; in their case they have a desperate struggle to keep themselves upright in face of the harsh discord between the true life and the conditions of actual life; to hold fast to the thought of the object of faith and to resist the onslaughts of doubt. <i>The Philosophy Of Religion</i>, Dr. Harald Hoffding p. 116-118, Translated from the German Edition, By B.

Meyer 1914</p></blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Attributes_of_God_in_Christianity\" title=\"Attributes of God in Christianity\">Attributes of God in Christianity</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">McGrath, Alister E.  <i>The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought</i>.
