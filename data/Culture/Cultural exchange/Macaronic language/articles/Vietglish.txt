Vietlish, Vietnaminglish, Vietglish or Vietnamese English, is an informal term for a mixture of elements from Vietnamese and English.  This usage is said to be found in immigrant communities in majority-English-speaking countries.  Borrowed English words are also commonly used in everyday Vietnamese both inside and outside Vietnam in informal contexts.
