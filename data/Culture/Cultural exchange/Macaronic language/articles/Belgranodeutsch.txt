Belgranodeutsch or Belgrano-Deutsch is a macaronic mixture of German and Spanish spoken in Buenos Aires, specifically in the neighborhood of Belgrano.  It was spoken by the German community living in both Belgrano "R" (residential) and Belgrano "C" (commercial). There were two main schools in the neighborhood, the Goethe Schule and the Pestalozzi Schule.  Around the Second World War there was a certain division of political and religious origin between the two schools. Belgranodeutsch still survives today and can be compared to "Spanglish," a blend of Mexican Spanish and American English spoken in the United States.
