Africanization or Africanisation (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as indigenization.  Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.  In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were Anglicized or Francized. Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and secessions, territories gaining sovereignty, and regime changes. Other name changes take place when an African person converts to or from Islam or another religion. (See Islamic name.)  Examples: In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to racial policies, affirmative action intended to increase the number of Africans in civil service (which had historically been dominated by whites  or Asians. ) The term Africanization, abbreviated as the numeronym "A12n," has been applied to discussion of internationalization and localization of software and content in African languages.
