Transracial people are individuals who assert a racial identity for themselves which differs from their birth ethnicity.    A prominent example of a person who identifies as transracial is Rachel Dolezal, who is of white descent but identifies as black.   Martina Big, who was featured on Maury in September 2017, is another white woman who identifies as black.   Big has had tanning injections administered by a physician to darken her skin and hair.   In April 2017, the feminist philosophy journal Hypatia published an academic paper in support of recognizing transracialism and drawing parallels between "transracial" and transgender individuals.  Publication of this paper resulted in considerable controversy. The subject was also explored in Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities, a 2016 book by UCLA sociology professor Rogers Brubaker, who argues that the phenomenon, though offensive to many, is psychologically real to many people, and has many examples throughout history.   The use of the term "transracial" to describe changing racial identity has been criticized by the transracial adoption community. The term "transracial" has historically been used in the adoption community to describe parents who adopt a child of a different race.    Members of the transracial adoption community assert that the term "transracial" has a specific historical meaning related to such adoptions, and argue that the term is being "appropriated and co-opted" in a manner that harms the transracial adoption community.  In June 2015, about two dozen transracial adoptees, transracial parents and academics published an open letter that condemned the use of the term "transracial" to describe white women assuming cultural markers to identify as black, calling such use "erroneous, ahistorical, and dangerous."
