Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Americanization\" title=\"Americanization\">Americanization</a> policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society.  After the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Wars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indian Wars\">Indian Wars</a>, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies.  It established <a href=\"/wiki/Native_American_boarding_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Native American boarding schools\">Native American boarding schools</a> which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Dawes_Act\" title=\"Dawes Act\">Dawes Act of 1887</a>, which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans.  Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions.  It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of 93&#160;million acres (380,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) from Native American control.  Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals.

They came from areas where smallpox was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people.  Tribes such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Wyandot_people\" title=\"Wyandot people\">Huron</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Wyandot_people\" title=\"Wyandot people\">Wendat</a> and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Warrick_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Warrick-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas.  The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles.  In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries.  To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence.  In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and <a href=\"/wiki/Gun\" title=\"Gun\">gun</a> trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc.  Many Native American tribes took part in <a href=\"/wiki/King_William%27s_War\" title=\"King William&#39;s War\">King William's War</a> (1689\u20131697), <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_War\" title=\"Queen Anne&#39;s War\">Queen Anne's War</a> (1702\u20131713) (<a href=\"/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession\" title=\"War of the Spanish Succession\">War of the Spanish Succession</a>), <a href=\"/wiki/Dummer%27s_War\" title=\"Dummer&#39;s War\">Dummer's War</a> (c. 1721\u20131725), and the <a href=\"/wiki/French_and_Indian_War\" title=\"French and Indian War\">French and Indian War</a> (1754\u20131763) (<a href=\"/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\" title=\"Seven Years&#39; War\">Seven Years' War</a>).\n</p><p>As the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763\" title=\"Royal Proclamation of 1763\">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a>, to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the <a href=\"/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\" title=\"Appalachian Mountains\">Appalachian Mountains</a>. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community.  In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward.  The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.  Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans.

While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored.\n</p><p>On September 27, 1830, the <a href=\"/wiki/Choctaws\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Choctaws\">Choctaws</a> signed <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Dancing_Rabbit_Creek\" title=\"Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek\">Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek</a> and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory.\n</p><p>While the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials.  The best-known example is the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_New_Echota\" title=\"Treaty of New Echota\">Treaty of New Echota</a>.  It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of <a href=\"/wiki/Cherokee\" title=\"Cherokee\">Cherokee</a> tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Trail_of_Tears\" title=\"Trail of Tears\">Trail of Tears</a>.\n</p><p>In the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans.

The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869\u20131885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Many other denominations volunteered to help.

Montoya &amp; Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by \"Victorio's Band\"  which was a group of these American Indians.  It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another.  One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"US_v._Winans_.281905.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"US_v._Winans_(1905)\"><i>US v.

Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2007, 9,500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated. However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily \"white\" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The following quote from the May 1957 issue of <i>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</i>, shows this:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The place of Indians in American society may be seen as one aspect of the question of the integration of minority groups into the social system.<sup id=\"cite_ref-58\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-58\">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy.  Similarly the <a href=\"/wiki/Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act\" title=\"Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act\">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a> of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it.\n</p><p>As of 2013, \"Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-59\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-59\">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> The \"Indian Education for All\" curriculum, created by the <a href=\"/wiki/Montana_Office_of_Public_Instruction\" title=\"Montana Office of Public Instruction\">Montana Office of Public Instruction</a>, is distributed online for primary and secondary schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-60\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-60\">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modern_cultural_and_linguistic_preservation\">Modern cultural and linguistic preservation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: Modern cultural and linguistic preservation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/wiki/Language_shift\" title=\"Language shift\">Language shift</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Language_revitalization\" title=\"Language revitalization\">Language revitalization</a></div>\n<p>To evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction.
