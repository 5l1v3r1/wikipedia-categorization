Amikeca Reto (English: Friendship Network) was a directory of Esperanto-speakers around the world who wished to work together and exchange ideas. The network emphasized the cultural and educational value of travel, with hosts willing to discuss issues and to generally introduce visitors to their everyday life. However, unlike the Pasporta Servo, it was not a hospitality service; members did not necessarily offer to host visitors in their homes. Until it was discontinued in 2002, the directory was published bi-annually and included over 400 members. Amikeca Reto was created in 1987 during the annual congress of Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT) in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. The final edition of the directory was published in 2002.  The website was shutdown in 2007.
