Ameson Year in China (AYC) (Chinese Simplified: 美国青年教学使者; Pinyin: měiguó qīngnián jiàoxué shǐzhě) is a program offering opportunities for college graduates to become Educational Ambassadors by spending a year teaching, learning, and making a difference at public schools across China. As the 21st century unfolded, Ameson Education and Cultural Exchange Foundation saw the U.S.-China relations continuing to become more important. Under their idea that lasting stability can be achieved through dialogue and exchange, the organization began seeking for future leaders to fulfill that mission through the Ameson Year in China (AYC) program.  Ameson Year in China is a program for college graduates to provide future career awareness by spending one academic year by teaching and studying in an assigned site across China.  Each week, AYC participants spend twenty hours teaching, ten hours in the office or in support of students' activities, and ten hours in collaborative or self-directed pursuits, such as language learning, exploration, and community engagement.
