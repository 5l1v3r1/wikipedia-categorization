World Culture Open (WCO) is a non-profit organization that promotes cultural diversity and unprejudiced cultural exchange around the globe.  WCO has its regional offices in New York City, Seoul, and Beijing. World Culture Open believes in using culture to promote peace, because "countries and cultures often divided by politics can easily and frequently unite over the arts, humanitarianism and health."  Based on this belief, WCO works to promote cultural diversity around the world and create an open platform for intercultural exchange and collaboration.  WCO "…dreams of a global community where cultural diversity is truly fostered and appreciated by all everywhere."  In early 2000, few like-minded people conceived a notion of having a "cultural olympic." They thought of using cultural competition as a way to bring different people-groups together to promote peace, just like how the original Olympic games use sport competition to promote peace.  On 2003, professionals and leaders of various fields from 40 different countries around the world gathered in Washington D.C. for an international convention. Participants of the convention agreed on the necessity of an organization that can lead the concerted efforts for transcending borders and people-groups by using culture. This led to the launch of World Culture Open.  WCO’s activities are primarily focused around the following three areas.
