Intervac International is a hospitality service used to arrange home exchanges. It has over 30,000 members in 52 countries worldwide, but is most popular in Europe, particularly Spain.     Intervac offers a free 20-day trial membership and charges an annual membership fee of US$100.   Members create a profile with information and photos of themselves and  the residence they have to swap including amenities such as automobile use, the size of their family, the dates and length desired, and the destination desired. Members can then search for houses that fit their desires or wait until they are contacted by others.  Like most homestays, terms of the stay are negotiated in advance.  Intervac was the first home exchange network, founded in 1953 in Switzerland by several teachers that wanted to travel internationally with a limited budget during their summer vacations.
