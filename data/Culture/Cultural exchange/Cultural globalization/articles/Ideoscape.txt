Ideoscape is a term used to describe one of Arjun Appadurai’s five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, financescapes, and ideoscapes. The suffix -scape denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "nation-states, multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".  This can either be religious, political, or economic. Because cultural exchange and transactions have typically been restricted in the past due to geographical and economical aspects, Appadurai’s five dimensions give the opportunity for cultural transactions to occur. Ideoscapes is the movement of ideologies. It is often political and usually has to do with the ideologies of states and the counterideologies of movements explicitly oriented to capturing state power or a piece of it.  Ideoscapes are usually composed of ideas, terms, and images including “freedom, welfare, rights, sovereignty, representation, and democracy”.
