Technoscape is a term coined by Arjun Appadurai in order to describe one of the five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, financescapes, and ideoscapes. The suffix -scape denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "nation-states, multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".  This can either be religious, political, or economic. In a more specific scope, Technoscape is the movement of technology (mechanical and informational) and the ability to move such technology at rapid speeds.  This is due to the physical boundaries technology is able to maneuver around.
