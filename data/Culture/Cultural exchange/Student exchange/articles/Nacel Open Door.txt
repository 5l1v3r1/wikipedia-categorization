Nacel Open Door was formed in April 1997 by the merger of Nacel Cultural Exchanges and Open Door Student Exchange. Nacel Cultural Exchanges was founded in France by language teachers in 1957, and homestay exchanges with the U.S. began in 1969. Open Door Student Exchange was founded in 1964 to provide intercultural learning opportunities to high school students and their families. The Nacel Open Door National Office is located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Roughly 25 Regional Coordinators, assisted by more than 200 Local Representatives, organize the programs on the state and local levels. NOD also employs both full-time and part-time employees to administer programs worldwide. NOD is a member of Nacel International, a group of partner organizations that promote Nacel programs worldwide.

These students typically come to the U.S. for more than one year (though not always to the same host family), and most hope to go on to attend an American college or university. PSP students and host families are also supported by Local Representatives, who in turn are supported by Regional Program Directors and the National Office.
