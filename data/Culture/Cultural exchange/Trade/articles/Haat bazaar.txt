 A haat bazaar, most often called only haat or hat, is an open-air market   that serves as a trading venue for local people in rural areas and some towns of Nepal, India and Bangladesh.   Haat bazaars are conducted on a regular basis, i.e. once, twice, or three times a week and in some places every two weeks. At times, haat bazaars are organized in a different manner, to support or promote trading by and with rural people.   In addition to providing trading opportunities, haat bazaars gradually concentrate rural settlements and convert villages into small towns. In Eastern Nepal, most of the towns are named after the weekly haat. Aaitabare, Sombare, Mangalbare, Budhabare, Bihibare, Sukrabare, Sanischare are some common Nepali town names that are named for the day of the weekly haat. Panchami, Nawamidanda, Saptami are towns named after the fortnightly haats, according to the Hindu lunar calendar. Dilli Haat is a famous market place in Delhi. Rampurhat is a municipality in India. India's Largest Haat Bazaar is Gohpur Haat Bazaar from Gohpur,Assam,India. Two districts Lalmonirhat and Jaipurhat of Bangladesh have the suffix, "haat" in their name, undoubtedly reflecting the presence of haat bazaars in those locations.
