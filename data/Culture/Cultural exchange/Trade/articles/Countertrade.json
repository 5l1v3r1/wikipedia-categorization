The principal exports are paid for with goods or services supplied from the importing market. A single contract covers both flows, in its simplest form involves no cash. In practice, supply of the principal exports is often held up until sufficient revenues have been earned from the sale of bartered goods. One of the largest barter deals to date involved <a href=\"/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum_Corporation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Occidental Petroleum Corporation\">Occidental Petroleum Corporation</a>'s agreement to ship <a href=\"/wiki/Sulphuric_acid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sulphuric acid\">sulphuric acid</a> to the former Soviet Union for ammonia urea and potash under a 2 year deal which was worth 18 billion euros. Furthermore, during negotiation stage of a barter deal, the seller must know the market price for items offered in trade. Bartered goods can range from hams to iron pellets, mineral water, furniture or olive-oil all somewhat more difficult to price and market when potential customers must be sought.</i></dd></dl>\n<ul><li>Switch trading: Practice in which one company sells to another its obligation to make a purchase in a given country.</li>\n<li>Counter purchase: Sale of goods and services to one company in other country by a company that promises to make a future purchase of a specific product from the same company in that country.</li>\n<li>Buyback: occurs when a firm builds a plant in a country - or supplies technology, equipment, training, or other services to the country and agrees to take a certain percentage of the plant's output as partial payment for the contract.</li>\n<li>Offset: Agreement that a company will offset a hard - currency purchase of an unspecified product from that nation in the future.

In 2001, India agreed to swap 1.5 million tonnes of Iraqi crude under the oil-for-food program.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/UN_Security_Council\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UN Security Council\">Security Council</a> noted: \"... although locally produced food items have become increasingly available throughout the country, most Iraqis do not have the necessary purchasing power to buy them. Unfortunately, the monthly food rations represent the largest proportion of their household income. They are obliged to either barter or sell items from the food basket in order to meet their other essential needs. This is one of the factors which partly explains why the nutritional situation has not improved in line with the enhanced food basket. Moreover, the absence of normal economic activity has given rise to the spread of deep-seated poverty.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Role_of_countertrade_in_the_world_market\">Role of countertrade in the world market</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Countertrade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Role of countertrade in the world market\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Countertrade transactions have been basically conducted among the former Soviet Union and its allies in the Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. The reason that these countries have allocated a big portion of their commerce to the countertrade attributed to insufficient hard currency. \nA significant proportion of international commerce, possibly as much as 25%, involves the barter of products for other products rather than for hard currency. Countertrade may range from a simple barter between two countries to a complex web of exchanges meeting the needs of all countries involved.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Noted US economist <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Samuelson\" title=\"Paul Samuelson\">Paul Samuelson</a> was skeptical about the viability of countertrade as a marketing tool, claiming that \"Unless a hungry tailor happens to find an undraped farmer, who has both food and a desire for a pair of pants, neither can make a trade\". (This is called \"<a href=\"/wiki/Double_coincidence_of_wants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Double coincidence of wants\">double coincidence of wants</a>\".) But this is arguably too simplistic an interpretation of how markets operate in the real world. In any real economy, bartering occurs all the time, even if it is not the main means to acquire goods and services.\n</p><p>The volume of countertrade is growing. In 1972, it was estimated that countertrade was used by business and governments in 15 countries; in 1979, 27 countries; by the start of the 1990s, around 100 countries (Verzariu, 1992). A large part of countertrade has involved sales of military equipment (weaponry, vehicles and installations).\n</p><p>More than 80 countries nowadays regularly use or require countertrade exchanges. Officials of the <a href=\"/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade\" title=\"General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> (GATT) organization claimed that countertrade accounts for around 5% of the world trade. The British Department of Trade and Industry has suggested 15%, while some scholars believe it to be closer to 30%, with east-west trade having been as high as 50% in some trading sectors of Eastern European and Third World Countries for some years. A consensus of expert opinions (Okaroafo, 1989) has put the percentage of the value of world trade volumes linked to countertrade transactions at between 20% to 25%.\n</p><p>According to an official US statement, \"The <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._Government\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U.S. Government\">U.S. Government</a> generally views countertrade, including barter, as contrary to an open, free trading system and, in the long run, not in the interest of the U.S. business community. However, as a matter of policy the U.S. Government will not oppose U.S. companies' participation in countertrade arrangements unless such action could have a negative impact on national security\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span
