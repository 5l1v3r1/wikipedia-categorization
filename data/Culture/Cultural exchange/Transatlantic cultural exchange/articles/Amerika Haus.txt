The America House (Amerika Haus, plural: Amerika Häuser) is an institution developed following the end of the Second World War to provide an opportunity for German and Austrian citizens to learn more about American culture and politics, and engage in discussion and debate on the transatlantic relationship. Run by the American government until 2006, Amerika Häuser were located in Frankfurt, Berlin, Heidelberg, Munich, Vienna and other cities. During the Vietnam War, German student protests in Berlin often took place in front of the America Haus.
