Aindrias Mac Cruitín (c. 1650 – c.1738) was a Gaelic-Irish poet. A member of the Mac Cruitín bardic family, Aindrias was born at Moyglass, Milltown Malbay, County Clare, where he was educated and spent much of his life. He worked as a teacher and scribe, some dozen manuscripts in his hand surviving. He worked for a Dr. Brian Ó Lochlainn in 1727, and wrote a number of poems for the family. In his old age, he wrote his best-known poem, on the subject of the passing of the old Gaelic order, and with it, his patrons and his livelihood. He died in 1749, and was buried in his family burying-place in the churchyard of Kilforboy, near Milltown Malbay in Clare.
