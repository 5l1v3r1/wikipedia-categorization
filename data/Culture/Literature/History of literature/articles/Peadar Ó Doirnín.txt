Peadar Ó Doirnín (c. 1700 - 1769) was an Ulster Irish schoolteacher and Irish language poet and songwriter.  Ó Doirnín is a celebrated eighteenth century Ulster poet. Along with Art Mac Cumhaigh, Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna and Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta, he was part of the Airgíalla tradition of poetry and song. His work is still alive in the tradition of north Leinster and south Ulster, although his authorship of nationally and internationally celebrated songs like Mná na hÉireann is little known.   Other songs such as Úrchnoc Chéin mhic Cáinte make classic Gaelic appeals for a return to nature reminiscent of its contemporary Lon Doire an Chairn (a poem which attained new renown in the twentieth century under the title Blackbird of Derrycairn by Austin Clarke). Due to the sexual inferences of Úrchnoc Chéin mhic Cáinte, Ó Doirnín, the master of a hedgeschool, was reportedly dismissed from his teaching job.  When Ó Doirnín died at Forkill in 1769, his elegy was composed by Art Mac Cumhaigh.  The poet, who is buried in Urney graveyard in north County Louth,   is commemorated in the name of the Forkhill Peadar Ó Doirnín GAA club.
