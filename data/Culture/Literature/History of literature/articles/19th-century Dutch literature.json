He was no sooner dead, however, than his posthumous poems, and in particular a cycle of sonnets called \"Mathilde\", were published (1882) and awakened extraordinary emotion. Perk had rejected all the formulas of rhetorical poetry, and had broken up the conventional rhythms. There had been heard no music like his in Holland for two hundred years.\n</p><p>A group of young men collected around his name. They were joined by a poet-novelist-dramatist somewhat older than themselves, <a href=\"/wiki/Marcellus_Emants\" title=\"Marcellus Emants\">Marcellus Emants</a> (1848\u20131923). Emants had written a symbolical poem called \"Lilith\" in 1879 that had been stigmatised as audacious and meaningless; encouraged by the admiration of his juniors, Emants published in 1881 a treatise in the form of a novel in which the first open attack was made on the old school.\n</p><p>The next appearance was that of <a href=\"/wiki/Willem_Kloos\" title=\"Willem Kloos\">Willem Kloos</a> (1857\u20131938), who had been the editor and intimate friend of Perk, and who now undertook to lead the army of rebellion.

For some time the new poets and critics found a great difficulty in being heard as all the channels of <a href=\"/wiki/Periodical_literature\" title=\"Periodical literature\">periodical literature</a> were closed to them, but in 1884 the young school founded a review, <i>De Nieuwe Gids</i> (\"The New Guide\"), which was able to offer a direct challenge to <i>De Gids</i> (\"The Guide\"), the old guard's periodical. The new movement was called <i>Tachtigers</i> or \"Movement of (Eighteen-)Eighty\", after the decade in which it arose. The <i>Tachtigers</i> insisted that style must match content, and that intimate and visceral emotions can only be expressed using an intimate and visceral writing style.\n</p><p>In the same year 1884 a new element was introduced.

This was the great flowering moment of the new school.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:213px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Couperus.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Couperus.jpg\" width=\"211\" height=\"250\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"211\" data-file-height=\"250\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Couperus.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Louis Couperus.</div></div></div>\n<p>One of the most important Dutch novelists, <b><a href=\"/wiki/Louis_Couperus\" title=\"Louis Couperus\">Louis Couperus</a></b> (1863\u20131923), had his roots in the <i>Tachtigers</i> movement. His boyhood years were spent in <a href=\"/wiki/Java_(island)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Java (island)\">Java</a>, and he had preserved in all his nature a certain <a href=\"/wiki/Tropics\" title=\"Tropics\">tropical</a> magnificence. His first literary efforts were lyrics in the <i>Tachtigers</i> style, but Couperus proved far more important and durable as a novelist and his earliest story, <i>Eline Vere</i> (1889) already took him out of the ranks of his contemporaries. In 1891 he published <i>Noodlot</i>, which was translated into <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a> as \"Footsteps of Fate\" It was greatly admired by <a href=\"/wiki/Oscar_Wilde\" title=\"Oscar Wilde\">Oscar Wilde</a>, whose <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray\" title=\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></i> is said to have been influenced by it. Couperus continued to pour out one important novel after another until his death in 1923. He separated himself, as he developed, from the more fanatical members of the <i>Tachtigers</i> group, and addressed himself to the wider public. Another talent for prose was revealed by <a href=\"/wiki/Frederik_van_Eeden\" title=\"Frederik van Eeden\">Frederik van Eeden</a> (1860\u20131932) in <i>De kleine Johannes</i> (\"Little Johnny\", 1887) and in <i>Van de koele meren des doods</i> (\"From the Cold Pools of Death\", 1901), a melancholy novel.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"19th_century\">19th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=19th-century_Dutch_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: 19th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After 1887 the condition of modern Dutch literature remained comparatively stationary, and within the last decade of the 19th century was definitely declining. In 1889 a new poet, <a href=\"/wiki/Herman_Gorter\" title=\"Herman Gorter\">Herman Gorter</a> (1864\u20131927) made his appearance with an <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_poem\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Epic poem\">epic poem</a> called <i>Mei</i> (\"May\"), eccentric both in prosody and in treatment. He held his own without any marked advance towards lucidity or variety. Since the recognition of Gorter, however, no really remarkable talent has made itself prominent in Dutch poetry except <a href=\"/wiki/P.C._Boutens\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"P.C. Boutens\">P.C. Boutens</a> (1870\u20131943), whose <i>Verzen</i> (\"Verses\") in 1898 were received with great respect.\n</p><p>Willem Kloos, still the acute and somewhat turbulent leader of the school, collected his poems in 1894 and his critical essays in 1896. The others, with the exception of Couperus, showed symptoms of sinking into silence. The entire school, now that the struggle for recognition was over, and its members were accepted as the mainstream, rested on its triumphs and soon limited itself to a repetition of its old experiments.\n</p><p>The leading <a href=\"/wiki/Drama\" title=\"Drama\">dramatist</a> at the close of the century was <a href=\"/wiki/Herman_Heijermans\" title=\"Herman Heijermans\">Herman Heijermans</a> (1864\u20131924), a writer of strong <a href=\"/wiki/Realism_(art)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Realism (art)\">realistic</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Socialism\" title=\"Socialism\">socialistic</a> tendencies who single-handedly brought Dutch theatre into the modern time.  His <i>Ghetto</i> (1898) and <i>Ora et labora</i> (1901) particularly display his peculiar talent, while his <a href=\"/wiki/Fisherman\" title=\"Fisherman\">fishermen's</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Tragedy\" title=\"Tragedy\">tragedy</a> <i>Op hoop van zegen</i> (\"Trusting Our Fate in the Hands of God\"), which is still staged and has been <a href=\"/wiki/Film\" title=\"Film\">filmed</a> more than once <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/find?q=op+hoop+van+zegen;s=tt\">[1]</a>, remains his most popular play.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
