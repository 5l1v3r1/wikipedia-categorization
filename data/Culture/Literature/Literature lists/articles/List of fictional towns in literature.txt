This is a list of fictional towns in literature. The nightmare corpse-city of R'lyehâ€¦was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults. H. P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu (1928)
