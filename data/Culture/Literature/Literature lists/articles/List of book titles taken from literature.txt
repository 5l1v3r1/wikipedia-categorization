Many authors will use quotations from literature as the title for their works.  This may be done as a conscious allusion to the themes of the older work or simply because the phrase seems memorable.  The following is a partial list of book titles taken from literature.  It does not include phrases altered for parody. (Titles taken from works by William Shakespeare do not appear here: see List of titles of works based on Shakespearean phrases.)
