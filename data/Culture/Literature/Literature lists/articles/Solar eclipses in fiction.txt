This is a list of fictional stories in which solar eclipses feature as an important plot element.  Mere passing mentions are not listed. There is a body of films featuring solar eclipses. Compared to other astronomical events featured in films, such as full moons and asteroid strikes, solar eclipses are less commonly seen. When they have featured in films, they often drive the plot and have a portentous presence.  NPR's Glen Weldon said that films use eclipses "to signal to audiences that the normal rules have temporarily lifted, and things are about to get weird." The first film to feature a solar eclipse was the 1907 silent film The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon, which featured a solar eclipse as a fantastical consummation between the sun and the moon.  Eclipses have been seen as bad omens throughout history and filmmakers leverage that belief "as visual cues or key plot points", according to The Oregonian's Amy Wang.  The most accurate depiction of a solar eclipse in film is seen in the 1961 religious epic film Barabbas, which included film of an actual solar eclipse during a crucifixion scene.  While director Peter Weir was filming Witness (1985) in the Amish region of Pennsylvania, a genuine solar eclipse occurred on May 30, 1984. Weir filmed several of his actors in costume, responding to the eclipse, with a vague intention of revising the film's plot to include a solar eclipse.  Ultimately, however, the eclipse footage was not included in the final edit.
