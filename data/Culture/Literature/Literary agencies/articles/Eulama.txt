Eulama Literary Agency (Eulama) is a literary agency which represents a vast array of authors, script writers, as well as a variety of companies and their products. Eulama is the second oldest literary agency in Italy. It was founded in 1962 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Harald Kahnemann-Oppenheimer and Karin von Prellwitz, who had emigrated to Argentina from their homes in Germany two decades earlier. The name Eulama is short for European Latin American Agency. The Agency is  now  Europe  based, but  it  still  keeps  a  close  working relationship with the  most authoritative  Latin  American publishers. Since 1964 the head office of the Agency  has  moved  from Montevideo  to  Rome,  from where Eulama operates worldwide, negotiating and licensing literary rights,serializations, permissions, audio, film and co-production rights on behalf of clients all over the  world. Furthermore, Eulama also operates in areas such as monitoring   production-related  activities  of licensees, collecting due payments and researching financial solvency and business history of  potential licensees.
