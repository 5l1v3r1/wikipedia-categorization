British National Bibliography (BNB) was established to publish a list of the books, journals and serials that are published  in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.  It also includes information on forthcoming titles. New books and serials have been recorded in the British National Bibliography (BNB) since 1950.  The British National Bibliography was first established at the British Museum.  This is the single most comprehensive listing of UK titles. UK and Irish publishers are obliged by legal deposit to send a copy of all new publications, including serial titles to BNB for listing. The BNB publish the list weekly in electronic form: the last printed weekly list appeared in December 2011 .
