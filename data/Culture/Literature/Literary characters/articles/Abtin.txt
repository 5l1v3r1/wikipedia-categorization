Abtin or Aubtin or Abteen or Atbin or Aubteen  (Persian: آبتين‎) is a character in Shahnama (national epic of Persia), who is the father of Fereydun. His name translated in English means, "The one with good thoughts, good words and good deeds". These three traits are very important characteristics in Zoroastrianism. Unlike how it is spelt, the pronunciation of the name is not "Abtin" but it is rather "Aub-teen". Abtin is also synonymous with Sphinx.
