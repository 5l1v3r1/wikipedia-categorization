English Translation - In the southern regions, there was a kingdom called Sindhu. Its ruler was a king named Birabahu. He had two queens. The older queen was called Premasila, the younger Kanakamanjari. The younger queen was very beautiful, and the king doted on her. He did not care for the older queen at all. It happened that after a while, the older queen gave birth to a son. Learning of this, the younger queen thought to herself, "She has borne a son who will rule someday. The first chance the king gets he will probably banish me from the kingdom. What am I going to do now?"
