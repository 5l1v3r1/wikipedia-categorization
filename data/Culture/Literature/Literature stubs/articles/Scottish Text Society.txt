  The Scottish Text Society (STS) is a text publication society founded in 1882 to promote the study of Scottish literature. The Society publishes scholarly editions of important texts from the country's literary history, and has played a significant role in the revival of interest in the literature and languages of Scotland. To date, the Society has published approximately 150 volumes, from the 14th to the 19th centuries, but with a focus on Middle Scots works of the 16th to 18th centuries. These editions include poetry, drama and prose works.
