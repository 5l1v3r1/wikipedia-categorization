The Protestant Monastery: or, a Complaint against the Brutality of the Present Age is a 1726 pamphlet by Daniel Defoe.  It focuses on contemporary disrespect towards elders.  Similarly to Every-body's Business, Is No-body's Business (1725), Parochial Tyranny (1727), Augusta Triumphans (1728) and Second Thoughts are Best (1729), it was published under the pseudonym of Andrew Moreton.  Defoe did not sign his name to the majority of his works.  He preferred them to be published anonymously or under one of his pen names.  This choice was “sometimes” made “to conceal his authorship or to stimulate sales, but more characteristically to establish a point of view”.
