In literature, the term Gothic double refers to a duality within a character, mostly the protagonist or a major character, based on the presumption that this duality centers on the polarity of good and evil.  An example of this could be Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde or Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights).
