The National Museum of Taiwan Literature (NMTL; Chinese: 國立臺灣文學館; pinyin: Guólì Táiwān Wénxuéguǎn) is a museum located in Tainan, Taiwan. The museum researches, catalogs, preserves, and exhibits literary artifacts. As part of its multilingual, multi-ethnic focus, it holds a large collection of local works in Taiwanese, Japanese, Mandarin and Classical Chinese. It was planned as a national-level organization to fill in a long-perceived gap in how the Republic of China's institutions had handled Taiwanese literature as a field of academic inquiry and popular discourse. The Council for Cultural Affairs under the Executive Yuan set up the initial planning office. Tainan was chosen for its historical significance as a cultural center. The museum is housed in the Tainan Prefecture government building (zh), itself a national historical monument. The building was constructed in 1916 during the Japanese rule of Taiwan.  The museum was opened in 2003.  The museum is accessible within walking distance South West from Tainan Station of the Taiwan Railway Administration.
