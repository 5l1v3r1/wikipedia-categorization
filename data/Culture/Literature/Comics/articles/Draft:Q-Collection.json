Universities:  Universities are located in non-vacation locations.  This means that the average person my not take their vacation to universities located in Wisconsin, or Michigan, or Boston and the like.  Plus, most universities restrict access to their collection to those affiliated with the university or those who have been given special access permission. \n</p><p>2.  The Comic Art Museum in China:  This was a poor choice for a donation location.  Few outside of China would ever get to see the Q-Collection.  Donations ultimately become the property of the Chinese government. \n</p><p>3.  The Smithsonian Institute suggested that the Library of Congress would be a more appropriate destination for the Q-Collection.\n</p><p>4.  The Library of Congress began collecting comic books in 1950.  Half of the Q-Collection were printed after that date, which means that the LoC already owns half the comic books in the collection.  There is no reason to provide them with duplicates.\n</p><p>5.  The Victoria and Albert Museum purchased a private collection of 17,000 comic books in 1990.  When the Q-Collection offered to give the V&amp;A museum these 275 key American comic books to them back in 2011 the museum director declined it stating that the museum did not have sufficient space for those comic books.

Any auction amount received would be only a small portion of the investment made during those 17 years.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Supporting_Statements_From_Members_of_the_Q-Collection_Advisory_Committee\">Supporting Statements From Members of the Q-Collection Advisory Committee</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Draft:Q-Collection&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Supporting Statements From Members of the Q-Collection Advisory Committee\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>We have received an almost endless number of supporting statements from around the world for the Q-Collection project.  Here are a few of those:\n</p>\n<pre>   Harlan Ellison:    (USA)   \"The Q-Collection Project is of enormous importance. The participants have found a wonderful method of preserving this part of our cultural heritage. Until this project was begun time was affecting these fragile comics. The special comic book binders are now time capsules to the future. High praise should be given to those involved in this preservation project.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Professor William Foster:    (USA)   \"Saving these incredible relics of the past is such important work. It is ironic that just as comic books are finally being recognized by society at large as remarkable markers of popular culture and American history, it's almost too late. I am proud to be a part of this effort.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Doctor Michael Hill:    (Australia)   \"In a world in which comic books have been treated for far too long as consumables and ephemera the Q-Collection Comic Book Preservation Project represents a significant plan to preserve key items of these as popular culture artifacts. This project also provides physical protection against the transitory status of comic books by means of coating, wrapping and encasement in protective materials that will ensure defense against their decay. The selection and acquisition of these rare comic books that have become classics of popular culture, their preservation treatment, deposit and safekeeping and subsequent availability for reading and research by future generations has my support and deserves backing by business benefactors, patrons of popular culture and by an appropriate public collection institution.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Usman Ali Khan:    (India)   \"Comics are just not books for having fun only in fact it can be a key for Learning, it represent the culture of some Country. Around my environment in last 3rd decade there was a huge community and group of people who loved Comics, but in recent years when technology grown up very rapidly craze of comics world goes down. and people usually spends their time on Internet and Television So a huge step was required to overcome from this problem and Q-Collection Project is a way to preserve Comic World and helps in making back interest of people in Comics.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Chris Launder - Project Advisor since 2002:    (Canada)   \"I joined the Q-Project in it's 2nd year back in 2002. At that point a lot of the project was mostly ideas about wanting to preserve the comics. I immediately recognized the need for such a project and wanted to come on board. Why the need? Comics have been an important medium in many aspects throughout their history. In the early 1900's the characters were used to advertise everything from shoes to gum to gas. As time went on they influenced other mediums such as other literature, radio, TV and now film. Such an important part of our culture needs to be saved in its\u2019 original format for future generations to learn from.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Professor John A Lent:    (USA)   \"You are assembling a fine crew with Trina, Michael, and Igor on board. I will send you one or two Asian and African individuals soon for your consideration. Keep up the great work. John.\" \n</pre>\n<pre>   Antonius \"Toni\" Masdiono:    (Indonesia)   \"Comics have come a long way, maybe from the beginning of our modern culture. It has also evolved over many, many centuries to find its contemporary styles, and is still evolving today. This project is a stepping stone in comic evolution.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   PROFESSOR FUSAMI OGI:    (Japan)   \"In the last decade, in a global sense, comics scholarship has developed incredibly. Comics studies no longer holds a minor position and Comics is no longer trash culture. Comics which have been created are a crucial part of our culture and should be preserved forever. It is a great pleasure for me to advise in Q-Collection Comic Book Preservation Project from outside the US.\" \n</pre>\n<pre>   Igor Prassel:    (Slovenia)   \"It was about time that a serious historical preservation project in the field of comic art - I see it as a Cinematheque for comic books - got started. Even if the main objective of the project is to preserve comic books from the 1930's to 1960's for the Smithsonian Institute reading collection, I hope it will not deal only with American comic books, but with time will spread into an international collection.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Scott Preston:    (USA)   \"All my life I've collected comics and marveled at the comic book characters &amp; their heroic exploits. When I read what John planned to do with the Q-Collection I immediately supported his preservation efforts. I have always felt that certain comic issues must be saved for posterity. Although the generations since the 1930s have had endless comics to collect and enjoy, future generations may never get to see the original comics that began this worldwide phenomenon. John has given his all in this endeavor to save these treasures. The Q-Collection Comic Book Preservation Project is one of the noblest causes I've ever known - not just within the field of comic books but for posterity in itself.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Trina Robbins:    (USA)   \"The preservation of comic books of major historical importance is an excellent and necessary project, and I'm happy to be of any help. Trina Robbins\" \n</pre>\n<pre>   Dez Skinn:    (UK)   \"It is a frightening fact that the ever-dwindling number of key moments in the uniquely US creation of comic books are being hoarded away as future investments or permanently \"slabbed\" in sealed sleeves of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer. No other medium which had such an impact on the entire entertainment media and had such a profound inspiration on several generations of filmmakers, writers and artists would be treated in this cavalier fashion. At a time when no others seem to care, thanks to the efforts of Q-Collectables alone, researchers and historians will be able to read these key issues and appreciate the roots of a phenomenon for many, many years to come. This is a worthy goal which should embraced by all.\".\n</pre>\n<pre>   Richard Williams:    (UK)   \"I believe that the Q-Project is of the utmost importance in preserving key comic books for individuals to read for generations to come. Imagine being given the opportunity to hold and read rare comics from American history that usually reside in the clutches of wealthy collectors and investors? It is wonderful to finally be able to read and enjoy these historic key comic books without the need for white gloves or a pair of tweezers.\"\n</pre>\n<pre>   Hugo Yonzon:    (Philippines)   \"These boxed comics are like windows to the culture of a nation. The storytelling, the balloons, the actions, the design of characters, and all those elements speak much not just about comics only but about the world immediately outside of it. That is why the Q-Project is a milestone endeavor. Consider its rich collection as evidences of a civilization like those found in the diggings of ancient temples. People of tomorrow can learn much from the treasures of the Q-Project.\" \n</pre>\n<pre>   Steve Younis:    (Australia)   \"Far from the 'funny pages' they were once considered, comic books are a viable and important medium for both art and storytelling. They can be an important tool for reading in early childhood, and the efforts of the Q-Collection is a must for future generations to understand the history and value held within their pages.\"\n</pre>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Draft:Q-Collection&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation journal\">Harlan Ellison (1993). \"noble American born art form\". <i>Diamond Comics Dialogue Magazine</i>.
