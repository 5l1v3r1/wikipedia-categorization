Magnetic Poetry is a toy and creative writing aid consisting of individual words—often related to a particular theme or topic—printed on small magnets which can be creatively arranged into poetry on a refrigerator or other metal surface.   The informality and spontaneity Magnetic Poetry has endeared it to educators in creative writing.  Magnetic Poetry was invented by Dave Kapell, who has since published a number of books describing the use of the kit and anthologizing poems produced with it.
