How light, compar'd, all other sorrows prove! POLWHELE, whose genius, in the colours clearOf poesy and philosophic art,Traces the sweetest impulse of the heart,Scorn, for thy Muse, the envy-sharpen'd spear,In darkness thrown, when shielded by desertShe seeks the lyric fane. To virtue dearThy verse esteeming, feeling minds impartTheir vital smile, their consecrating tear.Fancy and judgment view with gracious eyesIts kindred tints, that paint the silent powerOf local objects, deeds of high emprizeTo prompt; while their delightful spells restoreThe precious vanish'd days of former joys,By Love, or Fame, enwreath'd with many a flower.
