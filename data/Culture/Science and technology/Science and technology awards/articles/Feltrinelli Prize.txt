The Feltrinelli Prize (from the Italian "Premio Feltrinelli", also known as "International Feltrinelli Prize" or "Antonio Feltrinelli Prize") is an award for achievement in the arts, music, literature, history, philosophy, medicine, and physical and mathematical sciences. Administered by the Antonio Feltrinelli Fund, the award comes with a monetary grant ranging between €50,000 and €250,000, a certificate, and a gold medal.  The prize is awarded, both nationally and internationally, once every five years in each field by Italy's Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.  A further prize is awarded periodically for an exceptional enterprise in moral and humanitarian value. Considered to be Italy's most distinguished scientific society, the organization was founded in 1603 and included Galileo Galilei among its first members.
