The Borlaug CAST Communication Award, formerly the Charles A. Black Award, is presented annually by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) for outstanding achievement by a scientist, engineer, technologist, or other professional working in the agricultural, environmental, or food sectors for contributing to the advancement of science in the public policy arena. Primary consideration will be given to candidates who are actively engaged in promoting agriculture through research, teaching, extension, or mass communication; who have made significant contributions to their discipline or field; and who demonstrate a passionate interest in communicating the importance of agriculture to policymakers, the news media, and the public. Nominees must have demonstrated their ability to communicate by written material; public presentations; and/or the use of television, radio, or other social media. They should be recognized by their peers as scientists who have made significant contributions in their professional fields. The Award is dedicated to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, "The Man Who Fed the World" and author of CAST publication #1; and to Dr. Charles A. Black, first CAST President, first Executive Vice President, and member of the founding committee of CAST.
