The Presidential Young Investigator Award (PYI) was awarded by the National Science Foundation of the United States Federal Government. The program operated from 1984 to 1991, and was replaced by the NSF Young Investigator (NYI) Awards and Presidential Faculty Fellows Program (PFF).  The award gave minimum of $25,000 a year for five years from NSF, with the possibility of up to $100,000 annually if the PYI obtained matching funds from industry.  The program was criticized in 1990 as not being the best use of NSF funds in an era of tight budgets.   PYI award recipients include: The NSF Presidential Faculty Fellowship (PFF) program was launched by President George H.W. Bush to honor 30 young engineering and science professors. The awards were up to $100,000 per year for 5 years.
