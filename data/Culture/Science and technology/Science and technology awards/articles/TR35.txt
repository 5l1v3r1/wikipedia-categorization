The TR35 is an annual list published by MIT Technology Review magazine, naming the world's top 35 innovators under the age of 35.   The subcategories for the awards change from year to year, but generally focus on biomedicine, computing, communications, business, energy, materials, and the web. Nominations are sent from around the world and evaluated by a panel of expert judges. In some years, an Innovator of the Year or a Humanitarian of the Year is also named from among the winners. The purpose of the award is to honor "accomplishments that are poised to have a dramatic impact on the world as we know it."  The award was started in 1999 as the TR100, with 100 winners,  but was changed to 35 winners starting in 2005.  The awards are presented to the winners at the annual Emtech conference on emerging technologies, held in the fall at MIT, where there is an awards ceremony and reception.  There are several regional TR35 lists produced by Technology Review also, such as the list of the top 35 innovators under 35 in India, Spain,  Italy,  France,  Mexico,  Latin America   and Turkey.  The regional winners are then considered as candidates for the global list.
