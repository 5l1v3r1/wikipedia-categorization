The Intel ISEF Finalist Medal is given to about 1800 students from 75 countries each year, which are participating at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, which is owned and administered by the Society for Science and the Public, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Washington, DC. Each year about 7 million students participate in different regional, district and state ISEF affiliated fairs. Some of the winners of these affiliated fairs, which exist in over 75 countries, get the chance to take part at the Intel ISEF as a finalist, and each of them is awarded the Intel ISEF Finalist Medal. In 2013 there were 1611 finalists at the Intel ISEF in Phoenix, Arizona. The medal has a diameter of 48Â mm and is golden galvanized. The obverse shows the official logo of the Intel ISEF, the reverse shows the year of participating and the location of that year's Intel ISEF. The ribbon bar is blue with a width of 40mm and has a golden romanic 1 in the middle.
