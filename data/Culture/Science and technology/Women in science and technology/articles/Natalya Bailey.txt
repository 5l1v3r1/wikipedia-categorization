Natalya Bailey is an aerospace engineer and co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the space start-up Accion Systems Inc. Bailey received her Bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering in 2008 from San Diego State University. She then completed her Master's degree in mechanical engineering at Duke University in 2011 before attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she received her Ph.D. in aeronautics and astronautics in 2015.  At MIT, she conducted her doctoral research in the Space Propulsion Laboratory, directed by Paulo Lozano.  Bailey's graduate research became the foundation for Accion Systems, which she co-founded in 2014 with fellow MIT graduate Louis Perna.  During her doctoral work, she helped invent a working prototype for a small engine for small satellites using liquid ion propulsion—or electrospray propulsion—technology.   The prototype, which is about the same size as a deck of cards, was the first of its kind and will allow small satellites to remain on orbit for longer periods of time.  Small satellites are better suited to avoiding collisions with debris and can reach further orbits to more distant planets and asteroids, enabling further space exploration.  The technology can also be scaled up to provide propulsion for larger spacecrafts. Accion is currently working to commercialize the technology, which has the benefit of being more cost effective to manufacture and has significant safety advantages over more traditional engine systems because the engine doesn't require toxic propellants or pressurized tanks to work.   Since its founding, Accion Systems has been awarded a $3 million Rapid Innovation Fund contract through the United States Department of Defense and has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding led by Shasta Ventures.
