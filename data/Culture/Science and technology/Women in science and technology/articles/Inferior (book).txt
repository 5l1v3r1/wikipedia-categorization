Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That’s Rewriting the Story is a book by Angela Saini. In Inferior, journalist Angela Saini "paints a disturbing picture of just how deeply sexist notions have been woven into the fabric of scientific research".  Saini "discovers that many of society’s traditional beliefs about women are built on shaky ground".   She also relaunches the critique that the studies from Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues carry on Darwin's "idea that man and woman...evolved to meet their roles of hunter and gatherer, respectively."    The book was published by Beacon Press in the United States and Fourth Estate Books in the United Kingdom.  Inferior was launched in June 2017 at the Royal Academy of Engineering.  A month after its release, Inferior was recommended by Scientific American.  It was a finalist in the Goodreads Choice Awards for "Best Science and Technology" in 2017.  Inferior was Physics World "Book of the Year" for 2017.  In the review by Chemistry World, Jennifer Newton wrote "I cannot recommend it highly enough".  After the release of Inferior, Angela Saini was invited to speak at universities and schools around the country, in what became a "scientific feminist book tour".
