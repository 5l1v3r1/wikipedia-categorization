ISO 24517-1:2008 is an ISO Standard published in 2008. This standard defines a format (PDF/E) for the creation of documents used in geospatial, construction and manufacturing workflows  and is based on the PDF Reference version 1.6 from Adobe Systems. The specification also supports interactive media, including animation and 3D. PDF/E is a subset of PDF, designed to be an open and neutral exchange format for engineering and technical documentation.  The PDF/E Standard specifies how the Portable Document Format (PDF) should be used for the creation of documents in engineering workflows. Key benefits of PDF/E include: The Standard does not define a method for the creation or conversion from paper or electronic documents to the PDF/E format. The Committee managing ISO 24517 (PDF/E) needs subject-matter experts to assist in the development of Part 2 of the Standard. ISO 24517 (PDF/E) was created to meet the needs of organizations who need to reliably create, exchange and review engineering documentation, however, the first part of the standard does not address 3D, video or other dynamic content, nor does it address integrated source data.
