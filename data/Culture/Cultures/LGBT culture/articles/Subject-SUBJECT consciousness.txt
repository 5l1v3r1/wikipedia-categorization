Subject–SUBJECT consciousness, a concept proposed by Harry Hay believed by Hay to be gay people's unique perspective on the world.  Hay saw heterosexual society existing in a subject–object dynamic; where men, who had the culturally acceptable power, saw only themselves as subject and therefore higher than women, who were treated as objects and property.  Hay extrapolated this interpersonal-sexual dynamic (male-power:female-subordinate) into a broader social context, believing that the subject-object relationship was the driving force behind most all of societies ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual (subject) from another individual by dehumanizing them, making them object. When Hay looked at same-sex relationships, however, he saw a different dynamic at work.  He believed that homosexual relationships were based on mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who was as equally valuable as the self.  Hay termed this interpersonal—sexual dynamic "subject—SUBJECT"  (which Hay capitalized for emphasis in all of his writings).  He believed that this subject–SUBJECT way of viewing the world was gay people's most valuable contribution to the greater society.  By empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society would change drastically and social injustices would be eradicated.
