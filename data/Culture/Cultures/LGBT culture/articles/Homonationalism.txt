Homonationalism is the favorable association between a nationalist ideology and LGBT people or their rights.    The term was originally proposed by the researcher in gender studies Jasbir K. Puar in 2007 to refer  to the processes by which some powers line up with the claims of the LGBTI community in order to justify heterophobia, racist and xenophobic positions, especially against Islam, basing them on prejudices that migrant people are supposedly homophobic and that western society is entirely egalitarian.         Thus, sexual diversity and LGBT rights are used to sustain political stances against immigration, being increasingly common among far-right parties.    The main critiques of this phenomenon focus on the partial and sectarian use of the LGBT movement to further ends based in intolerance, ignoring the homophobia and lack of real equality in Western society as a whole.   This idea of equality is usually symbolically represented by the access to equal marriage, heteronormalizing the relations between the people of the LGBTI community and favouring chauvinistic positions towards the Western country and suspicions towards people coming from those countries that have not legalized any kind of recognition of same-gender couples or that still criminalize homosexuality, often associating those stances with Muslims.       Since developing the concept, Puar has more recently argued that the concept should not be used as an accusation or an identity, but is instead a transnational process that represents a historical shift.   Bruno Perreau has criticized the premises of Puar's argument. While agreeing with her critique of nationalist claims among some LGBT groups, he shows that Puar idealizes those she calls the "sexually nonnormative racialized subject."  Perreau explains that "deconstruction of norms cannot be dissociated from their reproduction."  Jason Ritchie has also critiqued some of the ways homonationalism has been used, especially as a totalizing theory.    Category:LGBT culture
