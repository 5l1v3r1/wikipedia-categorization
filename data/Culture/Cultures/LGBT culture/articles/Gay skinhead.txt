A gay skinhead, also known as a gayskin or queerskin, is a gay person who identifies with the skinhead subculture, sometimes (though not necessarily) out of sexual interest. Some gay skinheads have a sexual fetish for skinhead clothing styles. Some are attracted to skinheads' outward displays of masculinity. Gay skinheads figure in the work of gay artists such as Canadian painter Attila Richard Lukacs and filmmaker Bruce LaBruce. Gay skinheads have been featured on the catwalks of fashion designers Alexander McQueen and Jean-Paul Gaultier since the early 1990s.  Most skinheads who are gay do not fetishize the skinhead image. These individuals may prefer not to be referred to as gayskins because of the sexual connotations â€” and they may not associate with self-identified gayskins for the same reason, but to traditional skinhead culture.
