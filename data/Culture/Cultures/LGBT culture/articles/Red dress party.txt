In LGBT culture, red dress parties are events in which people wear red dresses, regardless of gender. The parties are attended predominantly by gay men in drag. Cities with annual events include Portland, Oregon,  and San Diego.   The Portland charity event began as a basement party in 2001,  and benefits organizations supporting LGBT youth and people living with HIV/AIDS.  Parties are now attended by 2,000 people and raise as much as $30,000 annually.  Chelsea Clinton attended the 2008 event.
