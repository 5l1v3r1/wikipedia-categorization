Urban Pop Culture is the pop culture of cities and towns.  It is both driven by and drives the popular culture of mainstream media.  Urban pop  culture tends to be more cosmopolitan and liberal than mainstream culture, but is not without its own complex mores, reflecting, for example, the parent societies' ambivalence to sexuality.  The impact on traditional popular media is more evident today than it has ever been. Since 1995, the number of nationally aired television commercials and popular sitcoms that use props, references, or slang from Inner cities continues to grow. Big screen movies are also other examples of how urban pop culture is impacting traditional pop culture. The hit movie Tropic Thunder is filled with references, images, and jokes that are common amongst the youth in Brooklyn, New York and Los Angeles California. Urban pop culture has also infiltrated the mainstream world of fashion, music, and even politics. During an interview former president George W. Bush was asked how he felt about a comment rapper Kanye West made about his administration's response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, and the former president included in his response that he was "not a hater"; a term that originated in New York City, and that is used mostly by rappers and youth.
