G0y, g√òy, g-zero-y (pronounced 'goy' or 'gziroy', the second character in the word "g0y" is the digit zero, not letter o) is a subculture that appeared in 2000s in the United States and is especially widespread in Brazil. The g0y self-identify as men who have sex with men but not as homosexuals or bisexuals.  In such relationships, men consider hugging, kissing on lips, caressing, frotting, French kissing, mutual masturbation and fellatio as acceptable. Anal sex is forbidden as it's seen as gay  or even violent and dangerous.  The term g0y comes from the Hebrew goy, with the o replaced by a 0 to represent "departure from stereotype".
