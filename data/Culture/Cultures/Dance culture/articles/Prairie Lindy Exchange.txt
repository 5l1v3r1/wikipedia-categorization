PLEX, or Prairie Lindy Exchange, is an acronym used in various lindy exchanges in central North America.  Historically, PLEXes are smaller than most lindy exchanges.  Unlike most lindy exchanges, the hosting city may be different each successive PLEX. PLEXes usually take place over a weekend.  Lindy bombing, live band dances, and a few workshops are typical events scheduled during an exchange.  Rates are typically very inexpensive.
