In Argentina and other South American countries, a matinée (also spelled matiné) is the schedule established by a discothèque open to the public teens (usually between 14 and 18) before midnight. It was introduced in the 1990s, because young people cannot go to many bars and clubs as the latter had trouble with the law by allowing entry to minors.  Throughout the 20th century up to the 80s matinée was used in Argentina for the first cinema function of the day (usually at around 2 p.m. and often aimed at children). A matinée would usually feature a double bill of two movies, with an interval where a "live number" would perform (usually a singer, or a comic sketch) in the early decades of the century. A loan to Spanish from French matinée (in turnfrom matin: 'morning') it was used in France (although not reflecting the literal meaning) in contrast with soirée (from soir: 'evening') also diferentiated from nuit: 'night') .  The ages range between 13 (usually 14) and 18. The official schedule established by the Government of Argentina is from 8pm to midnight or, in some provinces, until 11:30. In the matinees, no alcohol or smoking is allowed. However, tobacco use is widespread. Young people often, despite the matinees' no-alocohol policy, drink alcohol at a friend's house or in a nearby park before heading to the Matinee.  Young people in Argentina call this the pre-boliche ("before the club").
