Tawuran (or tubir) is a form of customary mass street fighting between gangs of particular school related students in urban Indonesia,especially in capital city Jakarta. It is practised largely by males in their junior or senior year of high school, and Indonesian sociologist Wirumoto has suggested that it serves as a stress release mechanism, occurring as it often does following examinations,holiday seasons or graduation.   W. D. Mansur has suggested that it results not from personal factors such as religion or personality, but from group dynamics such as solidarity and prejudice.  Tawuran can result in serious injuries or even death; in 1999 there were 67 deaths and the death toll keep rising from year 2000's till late 2005's with result 297 deaths, in 2011 82 deaths. A 2013 Al Jazeera report noted the increasing use of acid attacks in tawuran, resulting in severe injury and disfigurement.  According to one report, between 2012 and 2017, 130 students were killed.
