In an environment of professional gamers Lyoscha becomes one of the best, followed by victories in multiple competitions.

After returning home, Lyoscha gets rid of his gaming devices, and for the first time during the entire film, a smile appears on his face.

Its boxoffice in Ukraine at the time was minimal, but the film is still accumulating revenue via its online distribution by Rotterdam Unleashed  where it can be watched all over the world.
