It was a youth group whose aim was to \"cleanse\" Soviet society of the influences of various Western <a href=\"/wiki/Subcultures\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Subcultures\">subcultures</a> which they view as decadent, and often attacked other youth, mainly in major cities such as Moscow. However, they always held to certain principles such as fair fight and to never attack women and couples. The \"Lyubers\" were against outwardly informal dress groups such as <a href=\"/wiki/Hippies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hippies\">hippies</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Punk_subculture\" title=\"Punk subculture\">punks</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Heavy_metal_subculture\" title=\"Heavy metal subculture\">metalheads</a> but also held strong anti-fascist views and had conflicts with the emerging <a href=\"/wiki/Neo-nazi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neo-nazi\">Neo-nazi</a> groups. The name \"Lyubers\" (\"\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044b\") comes the Moscow industrial suburb of Lyubertsy. As the Perestroika program opened up the market economy, some of the Lyubers turned to racketeering and organized crime syndicates, this however was swallowed up by a larger group in the 1990s.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lyubery&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Jim Riordan, <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Studies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soviet Studies\">Soviet Studies</a>, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct. 1988)  pp 556\u2013572</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1256\nCached time: 20180908181431\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 15/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:7776876-0!canonical and timestamp 20180908181431 and revision id 845241735\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"bg","url":"https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8","langname":"Bulgarian","autonym":"\u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438","*":"\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438"},{"lang":"ru","url":"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8B","langname":"Russian","autonym":"\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439","*":"\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044b"},{"lang":"uk","url":"https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8","langname":"Ukrainian","autonym":"\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430","*":"\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"History_of_the_Soviet_Union_and_Soviet_Russia"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Youth_culture"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Glasnost"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Heavy metal subculture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hippies"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lyubertsy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Moscow"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Neo-nazi"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Punk subculture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soviet Studies"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soviet Union"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Subcultures"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Lyubery","byteoffset":313,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Lyubery","byteoffset":1260,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Lyubery","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4271453"}]}}
