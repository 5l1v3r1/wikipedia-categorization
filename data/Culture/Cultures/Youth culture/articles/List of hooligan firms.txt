  This is a list of notable hooligan firms or football firms, which are groups that have been verified as participating in football hooliganism or other sports-related hooliganism. In countries such as England and Poland, firms are clearly defined, but in Latin America the situation is less clear cut. For groups in Latin America, see barra brava and torcida organizada.
