Recens Paper is an English-language, bi-annual youth culture magazine published in Norway. It covers the topics of fashion, photography, music, art, design and politics. It was founded in 2013 as a DIY-project in reaction to commercials, beauty standards and gender stereotypes by Elise By Olsen. Recens Paper is staffed almost entirely by contributors in their teens and early 20s.  Recens Paper was founded in 2013 by Elise By Olsen. It was originally created as an outcome of the blog network for young Scandinavians called Archetype.  Recens Paper is stocked at newsstands, fashion- and bookstores and art museums including Tate Modern (London), Do You Read Me?! (Berlin), Tsutsaya Bookstore (Tokyo), McNally Bookstores (New York), Wood Wood (Copenhagen), Pusher Street (Christiania) Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art (Oslo), and every coffee shop in Amsterdam's Green Light District. The second issue won a diploma in Scandinavian design award Visuelt in 2015. The magazine is designed by graphic designer and art director Morteza Vaseghi.  Stack Magazines called Recens Paper “an alternative to the mainstream.”  The shoots are bold, showcasing desaturated shoots in the vein of Juergen Teller, packaged like i-D or Vice. Q&As float over pages printed with gender symbols, font changes in size and colour throughout and the content ranges from features on up-and-coming French label Jacquemus to interviews with 18-year-old DJs,” The Guardian described.  I-D Magazine called the magazine "not just a magazine; it is a movement and a way of tackling the decline of today's society."  British design platform It's Nice That wrote that "Recens Paper urges young people to explore and challenge, which is reflected in the design. This can be seen in the rotated cover, the glossy paper and extreme colour choices. The colours and layout in general reflect the generation’s playfulness and riot against “serious” minimalism."
