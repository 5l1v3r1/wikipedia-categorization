The "Cool S", also known as Superman S, Stüssy S, Super S, Pointy S  and Graffiti S , as well as many other names, is a graffiti signature of popular culture that is typically doodled on children's notebooks or graffitied on walls. The Cool S consists of 14 line segments, forming a stylized, pointed S-shape. The tails of the S appear to link underneath so that it loops around on itself in the same way as the infinity symbol does.  The Cool S has no reflection symmetry, but has 2-fold rotational symmetry and tessellates with squares. As illustrated, a common way to draw the shape begins with two sets of three parallel, vertical lines, one above the other. The origin of the Cool S is unclear.  The name 'Superman S' comes from a belief that it was a symbol for Superman, whose costume features a stylised S in a diamond shape, but that shape is quite different. Similarly, the name 'Stussy S' is from a theory that it might be a symbol of the American surfwear company Stüssy.
