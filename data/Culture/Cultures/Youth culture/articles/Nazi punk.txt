A Nazi punk is a neo-Nazi who is part of the punk subculture. The term also describes the related music genre,  which is sometimes also referred to as hatecore. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of punk rock, but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some ethnic minorities, Jews, homosexuals, anarchists, and other perceived enemies.  It is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the anti-authoritarian ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. While early punks including Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux incorporated Nazi imagery such as Swastikas, this has commonly been interpreted as an attempt to shock, rather than as a genuine belief in principles of Nazism.  In the long-standing band The Exploited, Wattie Buchan has been regularly questioned about his swastika tattoo and he has constantly denied being a racist.  In 1978 in Britain, the white nationalist National Front had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.  Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several English punks, as well as forming a number of white power punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.   In the early 1980s, the white power skinhead band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band.  They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.  The Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the United States by the early 1980s in the hardcore punk scene.
