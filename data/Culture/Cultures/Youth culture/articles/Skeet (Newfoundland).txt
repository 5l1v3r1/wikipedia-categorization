Skeet is a stereotype and pejorative epithet in Newfoundland English, describing a lower class youth, "ignorant, aggressive and unruly," and use non-standard English language, drug and alcohol use, and petty crime.  The term is similar to the English chav or American white trash   or wigger.  Sandra Clarke suggests the term may be related to the Prince Edward Island word skite (a young scoundrel).
