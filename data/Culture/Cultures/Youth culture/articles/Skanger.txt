Skanger is a derogatory term used to describe a person, mainly in Ireland, roughly equivalent to the British chav.  Both words refer to a socioeconomic grouping typical of low income urban working class youths. There are many stereotypes of each group, and popular culture often openly ridicule many aspects of the lifestyle. Typically skangers are associated with aggressive attitudes, lack of respect for police force, anti social behaviour, street drinking and drug abuse.
