The Implicit Web is a concept coined in 2007 to denote web sites which specialize in the synthesis of personal information gleaned from the Internet into a single, coherent picture of user behavior.  Implicit data may include clickstream information, media consumption habits, location tracking or any data generated without "explicit" input from a user. Presumed advantages of implicit data include accuracy, ease of input and comprehensiveness.  Examples of companies that have utilized technology models that incorporate Implicit Web concepts include local search firm Grayboxx   and blog search provider Lijit  . The term Implicit Web was popularized by the technology investors Josh Kopelman, Fred Wilson, and Brad Feld.
