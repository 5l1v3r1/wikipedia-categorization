The Old School Emulation Center (TOSEC) is a retrocomputing initiative dedicated to the cataloging and preservation of software, firmware and resources for arcade machines, microcomputers, minicomputers and video game consoles. The goal of the TOSEC project is to maintain a database which describes all software and firmware images for all arcade machines, microcomputers, minicomputers and video game consoles. In addition to this, the project also catalogs other computing and gaming resources such as software and hardware manuals, magazine scans, computing catalogs, comics and videos. The catalogs provide an overview and cryptographic identification of media including applications, firmware, magazine cover disks, device drivers, games, operating systems, magazines, comic books, product box art, and videos of advertisements, training, and TV series.  As of release 2016-11-11, TOSEC catalogs over 280 unique computing platforms and continues to grow. As of this time the project had identified and cataloged 810,864 different software images and sets, describing a source set of 5.02TB of software and resources. Bibliography
