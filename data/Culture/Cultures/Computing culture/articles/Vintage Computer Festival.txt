The Vintage Computer Festival (VCF) is an international event celebrating the history of computing.  It is held annually in various locations around the United States and various countries internationally.  It was founded by Sellam Ismail  in 1997. As of February 2015, most rights to the Vintage Computer Festival franchise are owned by the Vintage Computer Federation Inc.,  a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit organization. The Vintage Computer Festival promotes the preservation of "obsolete" computers by offering the public a chance to experience the technologies, people and stories that embody the remarkable tale of the computer revolution. VCF events include hands-on exhibit halls, VIP keynote speeches, consignment, technical classes, and other attractions depending on venue. It is consequently one of the premiere physical markets for antique computer hardware.
