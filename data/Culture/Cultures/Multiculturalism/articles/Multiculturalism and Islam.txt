The relationship between multiculturalism and Islam is an important aspect in the overall debate on the soundness of the modern doctrine of multiculturalism. In an article in the Hudson Review, Bruce Bawer writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Germany. The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society.  Incompatibility with secular society has been influenced by a stance against multiculturalism advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of New Philosophers.   Fiery polemic on the subject by proponents like Pascal Bruckner  and Paul Cliteur has kindled international debate.  In Canada, the possible introduction of sharia family courts became a contentious issue, and received much media attention.   London, UK is far more segregated on religious grounds than by race. 25% of London's seven million residents live in religiously segregated neighbourhoods.   A survey showed that 18% in Britain think that "a large proportion of British Muslims feel no sense of loyalty to this country and are prepared to condone or even carry out acts of terrorism".  A TNS/Global poll showed that 31% in Britain would feel comfortable living next to a Muslim, this figure dropped to 21 percent after the 7/7 bombings in London.  There have also been notable tensions in Britain between established Muslim communities and newly arrived Eastern European immigrants.
