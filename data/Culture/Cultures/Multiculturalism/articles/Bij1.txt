Bij1 is a political party in the Netherlands formerly known as Artikel 1. The party was founded in 2016 by Sylvana Simons, a television personality who was formerly connected to Denk.    Artikel 1 is named after the opening clauses of the Dutch constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which outlaw discrimination based on race, religion, gender or any other reason.  Simons's party focuses on fighting racism and discrimination in the Netherlands.  The party and its leader have occasionally caused controversy.    Since the municipal elections of 2018, Bij1 has one seat in the city council of Amsterdam.  In its election manifesto the party advocates the establishment of a national health insurance fund, government quotas for women and ethnic minorities, a higher minimum wage, the reintroduction of the basic grant for undergraduate students, a humane refugee policy, and the closure of coal plants.
