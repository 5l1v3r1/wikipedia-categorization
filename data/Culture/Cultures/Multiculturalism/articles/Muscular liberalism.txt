Muscular liberalism is a form of liberalism advocated by former British Prime Minister David Cameron that describes his policy towards state multiculturalism. . He believed that people should support anti terrorism behaviour and be more cohesive with one another to enable a party.  Cameron coined the term in a speech in Munich on 5 February 2011.  According to David Cameron, "Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream.  We've failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong."  The theory is that multiculturalism has shifted from tolerating multiple cultures to tolerating multiple value systems, which can be hostile to liberalism.  Cameron delivered these principles during a speech on Radicalization and the causes of terrorism at European Union international conference on Security Policy in Munich to tackle growing terrorism so as to be less passive towards religious hate and whip against growing extremist activists through muscular liberalism. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has said that he agrees with Cameron.  Peter Hoskin has expressed the opinion that "muscular liberalism" will be the new "ism" which Britain will follow to tackle growing religious terrorism and extremism, subsequently adapted by all European countries including Commonwealth Nations.
