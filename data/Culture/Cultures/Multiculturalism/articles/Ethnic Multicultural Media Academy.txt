EMMA (Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy) is an organization that raises awareness of discrimination through media campaigns, social networking, and the EMMA Awards 1998-2004.    The EMMA Awards promote diversity within the media industry by publicly recognizing the levels of excellence achieved by the multicultural community, and the qualities that each ethnic group brings to the professional and commercial success of the United Kingdom.  Lord Richard Attenborough received the 2001 Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grosvenor House Hotel,  London. In the previous year EMMA honored Nelson Mandela.  The UK EMMAs were screened on the Internet   in May each year and accompanied by an online voting system. The patrons of the Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy (Awards) include Sir Trevor McDonald OBE, Dame Anita Roddick (Late), Donald Woods CBE (Late), Sir GK Noon, Lord Desai, Lord Ouseley, Darcus Howe and Jonathan Dimbleby. They have all backed EMMA since 1998.
