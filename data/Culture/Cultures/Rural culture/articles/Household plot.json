This is a small plot of land (typically less than 0.5 hectares) attached to a rural residence. The household plot is primarily cultivated for subsistence and its traditional purpose since the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet</a> times has been to provide the family with food. Surplus products from the household plot are sold to neighbors, relatives, and often also in farmer markets in nearby towns. The household plot was the only form of private or <a href=\"/wiki/Family_farm\" title=\"Family farm\">family farming</a> allowed during the Soviet era, when household plots of rural people coexisted in a symbiotic relationship with large <a href=\"/wiki/Kolkhoz\" title=\"Kolkhoz\">collective and state farms</a>.

Here the peasants traditionally grew vegetables, hemp (a source of oil and livestock feed) and a little fruit.  Gardens varied in size; they could be as much as a hectare, but most were smaller.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  The plot was normally in the hereditary tenure of the household, and not subject to <a href=\"/wiki/Repartition\" title=\"Repartition\">repartition</a> (unlike the peasants' holdings in the <a href=\"/wiki/Open_field_system\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Open field system\">open fields</a>).\n</p><p>In the later 19th century the growth of towns and cities in central Russia encouraged the development of market gardening and truck farming in this region.  By the eve of the Revolution the garden economy was developing quickly.  A further stimulus was provided in the first years of the Revolution by the Bolshevik policy of requisitioning peasant produce.  Fruit and vegetables were exempt from this policy, and this resulted in a strong swing from grain farming to kitchen and market gardening.  In the grain-producing regions (Black-Earth belt and North Caucasia) the garden economy increased its share of peasant commodity production from 3.3% in 1913 to 12.2% in 1920, while the field economy declined from 62.6% to 39.3% in the same period.  Market gardening continued to develop during the 1920s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union\" title=\"Collectivization in the Soviet Union\">mass collectivization</a> decree of January 1930 made no mention of garden plots, and in many areas the local Communist authorities abolished them.  But in March 1930, after the chaos and peasant resistance engendered by the all-out drive, the right of the peasant to have a personal plot was recognised.  No maximum size was agreed at this stage, however, and the garden plot remained in a legislative limbo until the kolkhoz model charter of February 1935.\n</p><p>This charter specified that plots could vary from one-quarter to one-half hectare, and up to 1 hectare in special districts.  The legislation regarded individual peasants as the holders but in practice plots were still in household tenure.  The private plots were responsible for a significant fraction of agricultural production, and provided the peasants with a large part of their food and income.  In 1938 they accounted for 21.5% of agricultural produce.  The average peasant household earned about twice as much from marketings from the private plot as from its work on collective land.\n</p><p>By the late 1930s market gardening, with the private plot as its base, was perhaps becoming the dominant part of agriculture in the Black-Sea hinterland and the truck-gardening areas around big cities like Moscow and Leningrad.  The government, alarmed by this `resurgence of private capitalism', passed legislation to contain it in 1939, but it continued to play an important role in agriculture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Household_plot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Stefan Hoch, <i>Serfdom and Social Control in Russia: Petrovskoe, a Village in Tambov</i> (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986), pp.48-9.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Christine D Worobec, <i>Peasant Russia: Family and Community in the Post-Emancipation Period</i> (Princeton University Press, 1991), p.34; Orlando Figes, <i>Peasant Russia, Civil War: The Volga Countryside in Revolution (1917 - 1921)</i>(Oxford, Clarendon Press, corrected paperback edn. 1991)<i>, p.283 note; V P Danilov, </i>Rural Russia Under the New Regime<i> (Hutchinson, 1988) (translation of </i>Sovetskaya dokolkhoznaya derevnya: naselenie, zemlepol'zovanie, khozyaistvo <i>[Moscow, 1977]), p.286.</i></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Alec Nove, <i>An Economic History of the USSR</i> (Penguin, 1969), pp.*; Sheila Fitzpatrick, <i>Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization</i> (New York, Oxford University Press, 1994), pp.130, 131; <i>Agricultural Workers in the USSR</i> (Bodley Head, 1968), Soviet Studies series, ed.
