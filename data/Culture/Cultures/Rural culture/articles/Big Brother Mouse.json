He met with government officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), teachers, and students. During that period, Alyson also worked with two Lao college students: Khamla Panyasouk and Siphone Vouthisakdee. Together they developed five easy and entertaining books for children, often using popular books from the west for inspiration about how to make books appealing. These first five books were:<sup id=\"cite_ref-bbmwebsite_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-bbmwebsite-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Frog, Alligator, Buffalo</i> by Khamla Panyasouk. This was an <a href=\"/wiki/Alphabet_book\" title=\"Alphabet book\">alphabet book</a>, with a short humorous rhyme for each consonant in the Lao alphabet. (In the Lao alphabet, vowels are not considered part of the regular alphabet.)</li>\n<li><i>The Cat that Meditated</i> by Siphone Vouthisakdee. Siphone wrote four traditional folktales he had learned from his parents and grandparents. The title story tells about a cat that vows to stop eating meat, so the mice begin to bring it vegetables. But one by one, the mice disappear.</li>\n<li><i>Bangkok Bob</i> by Sasha Alyson. Inspired by the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Curious_George\" title=\"Curious George\">Curious George</a></i> books, this tells about a young monkey who visits Bangkok and is overwhelmed by the skyscrapers and big trucks, which he thinks are tall trees and galloping elephants.</li>\n<li><i>Baby Frog, Baby Monkey</i> by Siphone Vouthisakdee. Taking inspiration from <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Foot_Book\" title=\"The Foot Book\">The Foot Book</a></i>, by <a href=\"/wiki/Dr._Seuss\" title=\"Dr. Seuss\">Dr. Seuss</a>, the author used rhymes, repetition, and the pairing of opposite words, to create a book for very young readers.</li>\n<li><i>The Polar Bear Visits Laos</i> by Sasha Alyson. Inspired by another Dr. Seuss book, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hop_on_Pop\" title=\"Hop on Pop\">Hop on Pop</a></i>, this matches short sentences that include an internal rhyme with cartoon images.</li></ul>\n<p>Three of the books were illustrated by Ounla Santi, a <a href=\"/wiki/Vientiane\" title=\"Vientiane\">Vientiane</a> art student who has continued to illustrate many books for the project. Two others were illustrated by Tha Tao and Taeng Thaotueheu, high school students who placed first and second in an art contest that Alyson sponsored in an effort to find promising young illustrators.\n</p><p>Publishers in Laos are required to have a special publishing license, and each book must be registered with and approved by the government. At the end of 2005, Alyson entered into an agreement with Dokked, a Vientiane-based publisher, to act as publisher for these first five books.  They came off the press in March 2006,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> under the Dokked imprint, but also carrying the Big Brother Mouse logo. The next month a sixth book, <i>The Big Chicken</i>, was published in a similar cooperative arrangement with Action with Lao Children, a Vientiane-based NGO.\n</p><p>Soon after that, Sasha agreed with Khamla Panyasouk, author of one of the first books, that they would form a new entity to act as publisher for future books, with Khamla as the owner, and Alyson as the volunteer adviser. In June 2006, Khamla graduated from college, obtained his business license, and then received a publishing license. It was, according to officials, the first publishing license they had ever awarded in <a href=\"/wiki/Luang_Prabang_Province\" title=\"Luang Prabang Province\">Luang Prabang Province</a>, and required extra research for them to learn to how to do it. (It is Lao custom to identify people only by first names, even in formal situations. This article uses that first-name convention for people living in Laos, and last names for people living where that usage is customary.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"First_book_parties\">First book parties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Big_Brother_Mouse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: First book parties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg/220px-Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg/330px-Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg/440px-Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1200\" data-file-height=\"800\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lao_students_reading_their_first_books.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lao students reading their first books at a school book party</div></div></div><p>Although many organizations had expressed interest in purchasing children\u2019s books if they were available, few actually did so. Big Brother Mouse began exploring other ways to get books into distribution. On 29 December 2006, they went to a school in Ban Nunsawat, a rural village on the outskirts of <a href=\"/wiki/Luang_Prabang\" title=\"Luang Prabang\">Luang Prabang</a>. Khamla discussed the importance of books, Siphone talked about writing books, and Tha Tao gave an art lesson. This developed into the rural school book parties that later became the primary distribution mechanism for Big Brother Mouse books.\n</p><p>In its first year, Big Brother Mouse published 30 books, and has continued at approximately that rate. It continues to run book parties in rural schools, and that program has expanded considerably, with 31 of these events in 2007, 196 in 2008, increasing to 510 in 2010.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Village_reading_rooms\">Village reading rooms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Big_Brother_Mouse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Village reading rooms\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2008, Big Brother Mouse began experimenting with another way to create book access in rural villages, by setting up small reading rooms in the home of a volunteer. This is still conducted on a smaller scale than the school book parties. At the end of 2010, there were 146 of these reading rooms, largely in the Ngoi district of Luang Prabang province, sponsored by <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.planetwheeler.org/\">Planet Wheeler Foundation</a> (founded by Lonely Planet publishers Tony and <a href=\"/wiki/Maureen_Wheeler\" title=\"Maureen Wheeler\">Maureen Wheeler</a>) and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.globaldevelopment.org.au/\">Global Development Group</a> of Australia.\n</p><p>The project aims to continue making books available, through village reading rooms such as these in other regions of Laos.

He recalls his surprise, in Luang Prabang, when he saw tourists reading books. He was only aware of books as the dull, obsolete textbooks he sometimes had seen in his school, and couldn\u2019t imagine why anyone would read them while on vacation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ellis_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ellis-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Siphone Vouthisakdee (b. 1984) Siphone was born in a remote village, where only five children have graduated from primary school.
