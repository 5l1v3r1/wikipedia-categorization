Woop Woop is an Australian and New Zealand term meaning far away from anything  "he lives out woop woop". Equivalent terms include "beyond the black stump" and "dingo woop woop" (also Australia), “Boondock” (S. United States) and “out in the sticks” (E. UK). The term is said to have been derived from the nickname given to men who carried fleeces in shearing sheds, after the sound they made as they ran around. It was also the name of a sawmill near the town of Wilga in South West of Western Australia that was abandoned in 1984.   The term was being used in the early 1900s to describe a mythical outback town.
