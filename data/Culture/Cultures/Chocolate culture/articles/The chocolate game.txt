The Chocolate Game is a game often played at children's parties. Sometimes the game is referred to as "Dog's Dinner" or "Chocolate Boggle". The bar of chocolate is kept in its original foil and paper wrapper and/or it is wrapped with several layers of wrapping paper. The participants sit or stand in a circle around the wrapped chocolate bar.  The chocolate bar can be placed on a plate for hygiene and also to make the game harder, funnier and therefore last longer.  Each participant rolls the die in turn. As the die continues around the circle, a player who rolls a six shouts "SIX!".  They then have to dress up by putting on the items of clothing before attempting to eat the chocolate bar using the knife and fork.  The die throws continue around the circle while everyone is entertained by watching the fun in the center.  When another player gets a six, they shout "SIX!".  The one in the center has to stop and it is the turn of the new player to try and eat the chocolate. The object of the game is to eat the whole chocolate bar according to one of these variants
