Thandiwe Nelly Mpambani grew up in Sophiatown, the daughter of a shoemaker and a domestic worker.  When she was a teenager, she was attacked with petrol and matches and her face was permanently scarred.  Her career as a singer and dancer began in the mid-1950s.  In 1961, she moved to London to work in the musical King Kong.  She performed with Dolly Rathebe, Miriam Makeba, Dorothy Masuka, and others.
