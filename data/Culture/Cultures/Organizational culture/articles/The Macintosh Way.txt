The Macintosh Way was the first book written by former Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki. Subtitled "the art of guerilla management", the book focused on technology marketing and management and includes many anecdotes culled from Kawasaki's experience during the early development of the Macintosh. The author wrote of the book on his website: "This book was my first child. I wrote it because I was bursting with idealistic and pure notions about how a company can change the world, and I wanted to spread the gospel." He re-acquired rights to it after it had gone out of print and released it online as a free download. The book features a foreword by Jean-Louis Gass√©e.
