Today the expression power dressing is no more commonly used, but the style is still popular. Power dressing arose in the United States in the second half of the 1970s. Power dressing could be analyzed through <a href=\"/wiki/Visual_sociology\" title=\"Visual sociology\">visual sociology</a> which studies how fashion operates in the relationship between social system and the negotiation of power.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The concept of power dressing was brought to popularity by John T. Molloy\u2019s manuals <i>Dress for success</i> (1975) and <i>Women: dress for success</i> (1980), which suggest a gender specific professional <a href=\"/wiki/Dress_code\" title=\"Dress code\">dress code</a>. Molloy\u2019s manuals addressed a new kind of female workers entering in a typical masculine environment recommending them a \"uniform\" that would have helped them to acquire authority, respect and power at work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Features\">Features</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Features\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Initially power dressing consisted in a conservative style recalling directly the male wardrobe including tailored suits, jackets with padded shoulders, roll-neck sweaters and knee length skirts. With the power dressing uniform, the female body was divided in two parts: The upper part covered by a jacket to de-emphasize breasts, the bottom covered with a skirt that was a reminder of femininity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\nThese outfits were usually matched with feminine accessories, discreet pieces of jewelry like pearls, diamonds, gold necklaces, earrings, scarves and ruffs. Elaborate patterns such as floral prints were usually substituted by polka, pinstripes and hound-tooth ones. As far as colors were concerned, more sober ones such as blue, black, navy and grey were commonly preferred to feminine ones like salmon pink and red.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins\">Origins</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Origins\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The origins of power dressing can be found in the <a href=\"/wiki/Chanel\" title=\"Chanel\">Chanel</a> suit of the 1920s. The Chanel suit was composed by a tight skirt and by a wool, collarless button-up jacket, usually with braid trim, metallic buttons and fitted sleeves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This suit represented a turning point in the way women dressed. In fact, it was the very first professional suit specifically thought for women, which enabled them to look modern and feminine while feeling comfortable. It included traditionally masculine elements which gave women a very authoritative appearance, but at the same time it left space for a refined and sophisticated look.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\nThe most important innovation of the Chanel suit was that it was deliberately designed to adapt to the changing lifestyle of women that, during and after the World War I, were slowly entering previously all-men environments. This suit encouraged women to try to reach their professional goals giving them comfort and mobility to fit with their independent and active lifestyles.\nAccording to the costume historian <a href=\"/wiki/Harold_Koda\" title=\"Harold Koda\">Harold Koda</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> the Chanel suit allowed women of the time to de-sex their feminine look and to have a more masculine appearance in order to be accepted as equals in the professional sphere.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Evolution\">Evolution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Evolution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It was only when enough women were clearly established as authoritative in the work environment, that it was possible to renovate the women suit: no more feminized imitations of men\u2019s professional garments but suit different in fabric, cut, color and ornament, helping women to show both their authority and their femininity. Wearing a suit did not represent an effort to camouflage with men but an effort to stand out and define a clear visual presence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\nIn fact, it was only in the second half of the 1980s that more feminine garments were introduced in the \"power uniform\". For instance blouse, usually seen as romantic, were now worn with intricate stock or cravat effect neck wrappings, made up in silk or polyester satin foulard. Jersey knit bodies, buttoned under the crotch, were used to have an elegant silhouette.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_meaning\">Social meaning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Social meaning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Power dressing discourse was significant in building a new type of  working woman appearing in the society at the time. The notion of career woman stepped into contemporary society as women reached high powered job positions, which previously were intended to men. With the help of an empowering self-presentation such as power suits, women were trying to break through the so-called <a href=\"/wiki/Glass_ceiling\" title=\"Glass ceiling\">glass ceiling</a>. The development of power dressing was pivotal in bringing to public visibility women in executive or business position. It served as a way to construct their image and to make them recognizable at public society\u2019s eyes. \nWomen saw this new clothing style as way to detach from the classical feminine meaning of fashion, mainly associated with aesthetics and frivolity.\n</p><p>Power dressing locates power at body level giving a message about women and their profession, enclosing at the same time something about self-esteem and confidence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sexuality\">Sexuality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Sexuality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>One of the main purposes of power dressing was to reduce the female body's sexuality in order to gain authority in the workplace. According to Entwistle<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>, in western culture female dress is considered to be more sexual than male dress. The feminine body has historically been associated with nature, nurturing, and reproduction, something that can be problematic in most workplaces, where manifesting such sexuality is considered inappropriate.\n</p><p>According to some sociologists and psychologists, the primary function by which most women choose clothes and accessories is to look sexually appealing so that they may attract a partner. Feminists and even <a href=\"/wiki/Freud\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Freud\">Freud</a> have spoken out against this theory, since it has been well observed that both men and women take pleasure in being looked at by others, as well as take pleasure in looking at others, in a sexual context; however, it is only the female body which remains overly sexualized culturally. <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Power dressing thus attempts to counterbalance a woman\u2019s natural femininity and inherent sexuality, with the goal of preventing the sexual misinterpretation through her clothes that might otherwise allow.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_media\">In the media</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: In the media\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Icons\">Icons</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Icons\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Margaret_Thatcher.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Margaret_Thatcher.png/220px-Margaret_Thatcher.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"306\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Margaret_Thatcher.png/330px-Margaret_Thatcher.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Margaret_Thatcher.png/440px-Margaret_Thatcher.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"790\" data-file-height=\"1099\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Margaret_Thatcher.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Margaret Thatcher wearing a typical power dressing outfit</div></div></div>\n<p>Power dressing, as a new fashion phenomenon, has its symbols in public figures such as <a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher\" title=\"Margaret Thatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales\" title=\"Diana, Princess of Wales\">Princess Diana</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hillary_Clinton\" title=\"Hillary Clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Michelle_Obama\" title=\"Michelle Obama\">Michelle Obama</a> and many more<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher\" title=\"Margaret Thatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a> above all was one of the first to incorporate the spirit of power suits.

This TV show contributed to the return of strong colors, like fuchsia pinks, sea greens, purples, royal blue and red in women\u2019s wardrobe. Also women's fashion and business shoes were revisited during that period, changing the pointed toes and spiked heels, popular in the 1950s and early 1960s, with some fashion shoes covered with white satin or canvas and dyed to the customer's favorite color.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Films\">Films</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Power_dressing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Films\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i><a href=\"/wiki/Working_Girl\" title=\"Working Girl\">Working Girl</a></i>: In this movie power dressing is embodied in the figures of Katherine, the superboss, and Tess, the secretary.\nKatherine symbolizes a model of business elegance in mid-grey collarless silk jacket with padded shoulders. Her style shows important features of power dressing, but she also wears vivid red dresses, symbol of power and respect.\nTess is stylistically the opposite. She adapts power dressing to her personal style making it more feminine. For instance during a business cocktail meeting, Tess wears a long black sparkly dress and a dark brown fur coat, attracting people\u2019s attention. Tess is <i>\"the first woman [\u2026] that dresses like a woman, not like a woman would think a man would dress if he was a woman\"</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> On the contrary, the other secretaries in the movie have a different style.
