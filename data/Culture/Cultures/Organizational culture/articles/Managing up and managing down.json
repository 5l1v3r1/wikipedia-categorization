Turk suggests several different guidelines for managing up including being loyal and committed, understanding your boss\u2019s perspective and agenda, understanding your boss\u2019s preferences, providing solutions not problems, and understanding your own management style.  Each of the different guidelines Turk provides serves an important benefit for both sides.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Careers Group recommends \u201cUnderstand where your work fits in with your manager\u2019s goals and the wider goals of the organization\u201d. Which comes into play when your managers have their own projects to work on in addition to managing subordinates. Considering the challenges that managers face with their projects and working to either assist or stay out of the way when those projects require more attention is a smart tactic. Putting yourself in the position to be recognized as someone who can handle the work they were assigned and assist the manager in their work can be particularly beneficial when advocating for your own projects. Figuring out where the work that you want to accomplish fits into the overall goals for the company is crucial to getting approval on those projects as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>According to Badowski, good managing up requires going above and beyond the tasks assigned to you so that you can enhance your manager's work. Doing what you can to make your manager's job easier will not only help them do their job, but you will be considered a valuable asset to your manager and to your organization. You want to be described as indispensable.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A very important point to remember is \u201cBe very clear about what job you were hired to do -and do it.\u201d this is just one of three highlighted in the article Managing Up Without Sucking Up. The importance of this is, once you have established what it is that you were hired to do within the company and you do it you have fulfilled your duties anything additional that you work on is a bonus to your managers. With this achieved you can now begin to speak with your managers about the other things that you would like to do. With the right tactics, the problems and projects that you would like to take on become available to you.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Johnson_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Johnson-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Communication\">Communication</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managing_up_and_managing_down&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Communication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Understand how your manager likes to communicate. Price suggests appealing to your managers' communication styles \u201cIf he or she likes to communicate face-to-face rather than through email updates, then set up short meetings\u201d. When you communicate with your manager in a way that they are receptive to they feel as though time spent with you is well utilized and they will associate you and your work with productivity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influencing_up\">Influencing up</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managing_up_and_managing_down&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Influencing up\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bradford introduces the idea of <i>influencing up</i> where it may be possible for a subordinate without authority to influence those with authority.He delves into topics such as: creating a partnership between you and your boss and bridging the power gap. <sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Managing_down\">Managing down</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managing_up_and_managing_down&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Managing down\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tendencies_that_negatively_affect_employees\">Tendencies that negatively affect employees</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managing_up_and_managing_down&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Tendencies that negatively affect employees\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>Always giving and never receiving feedback</b>- Receiving, analyzing, and applying feedback from a managers perspective is just as important as giving it.
