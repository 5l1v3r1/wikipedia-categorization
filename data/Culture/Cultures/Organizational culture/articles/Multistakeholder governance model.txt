 The multistakeholder governance model, sometimes known as a multistakeholder initiative (MSI),   is a governance structure that seeks to bring stakeholders together to participate in the dialogue, decision making, and implementation of solutions to common problems or goals. The principle behind such a structure is that if enough input is provided by all actors involved in a question, the eventual consensual decision gains more legitimacy, and therefore better reflects a set of perspectives rather than a single source of validation. A stakeholder refers to an individual, group, or organization that has a direct or indirect interest or stake in a particular organization, these may be businesses, civil society, governments, research institutions, and non-government organizations. The multistakeholder model is used in Internet governance by entities such as the ICANN and IETF   It has been the foundation of local governance entities such as New York City's Community Boards. Norbert Bollow, co-coordinator on the Civil Society Internet Governance Forum  distinguishes between  "representative" multistakeholderism, using as examples the United Nation's MAG and ECWG, in which a limited number of seats are distributed to representatives through some selection process, and "open" multistakeholderism, as represented by the IETF and RIRs, which relies on participants self-selecting to balance perspectives.
