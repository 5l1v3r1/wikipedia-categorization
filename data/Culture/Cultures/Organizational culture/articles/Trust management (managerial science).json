First, as a process by which individual A becomes trustworthy for other individuals. This trust is significant criterion of success and survival because it makes individuals to collaborate with individual A. It is not rare when part of the people try to build fake image of their own reliability because of e.g. personal benefits. Second, as a process of assessing the reliability of other individuals, which is as much important as process of building A\u2019s own reliability. Taking together these two aspects we can formulate the following definition of trust management (Grudzewski, Hejduk, Sankowska, Wa\u0144tuchowicz, 2008):\n</p><p>\u201cthe activities of creating systems and methods that allow relying parties to:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>1. Make assessments and decisions regarding the dependability of potential transactions involving risk</dd>\n<dd>2. Allow players and system owners to increase and correctly represent the reliability of themselves and their systems.\u201d</dd></dl>\n<p>Trust is a container concept used in a broad variety of disciplines. Much work has been done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, <a href=\"/wiki/Political_science\" title=\"Political science\">political sciences</a>, philosophy, anthropology and <a href=\"/wiki/Management_science\" title=\"Management science\">management sciences</a>. Simply defining \"trust\" is a milestone in management sciences. One can barely speak of coherent research in the field of trust and trust management.\n</p><p>For trust management defined above, there are some crucial assumptions as follows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>1. Some suspicion is often well-founded in competitive organizations; because in the course of unforeseeable political circumstances, the cost of misplaced trust can have a disastrous effect,</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>2. In potentially uncertain, dangerous and risky environment we need to know very well who we can and who we cannot trust and in which circumstances we can do what. Moreover, it is essential to see the necessity of being aware of potential dangers.</dd></dl>\n<p>The essence of trust management is not only to trust, but to decide to what extent we can trust-- and how to create and develop  trusting relationships.\n</p><p>When we are in the situation of <a href=\"/wiki/Cybercrime\" title=\"Cybercrime\">trust deficit</a> a climate of resignation ensues.  It brings on consternation and makes it hard to concentrate on agreed targets. We tend naturally to limit mentioned these effects. Then we create \"trust substitutes to counteract the climate of uncertainty generated by these effects.(Sztompka, 1998, 2007). These equivalents of trust are as follows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>1. <a href=\"/wiki/Providentialism\" title=\"Providentialism\">Providentialism</a> \u2013 meaning supernatural forces, fortune, God or metaphysical forces.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>2. Corruption \u2013 predicting and having control under the other\u2019s people actions using bribes, favors, <a href=\"/wiki/Elitism\" title=\"Elitism\">favoritism</a> and so on.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>3. Pressure \u2013 it allows directly and unconditionally to control the other\u2019s people actions.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>4. Isolation (ghettoization) \u2013 separating certain ethnical, religion or professional group in unfavorable and threatening it environment, with strong internal loyalty strengthened by <a href=\"/wiki/Xenophobia\" title=\"Xenophobia\">Xenophobia</a> and lack of tolerance for the others.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>5. <a href=\"/wiki/Paternalism\" title=\"Paternalism\">Paternalism</a> \u2013 considered as going in search of strong authority, leader \u2013 \u201equasi father\u201d \u2013 who assures missing order, hierarchical harmony and predictability of the group\u2019s life.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>6. Externalization \u2013 it means transferring trust on other external groups or communities together with tendency to idealize procedure of operations, organisational solutions or total quality of institution of targeted group.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>7. Excessive assistance of legal institutions\u2014when businessmen do not trust each other, they need formal means to secure the transaction (for instance, detailed contracts, bank guarantees, employing certifying notary, and tendency to sue).</dd></dl>\n<p>Trust management needs to be put in practice. The strategy that leads to this is trust building. The rules of trust creation refer to rules and guidelines which have a far- reaching influence on the formation and development of trust. Trust building is the kind of the management strategy because it is strongly focused not only on the present, but first of all on the future cooperation. The 18 rules of trust building are as follows:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>1.\tSelf-trust is a critical factor in trust creating.</dd>\n<dd>2.\tWaiting till other people will prove their own trustworthiness is inadequate (not enough).</dd>\n<dd>3.\tTrust creating and building is very long process and can be destroyed in one moment.</dd>\n<dd>4.\tYou will not build trust if you treat it as mean to the target.</dd>\n<dd>5.\tWe cannot build trust without taking into consideration the values.</dd>\n<dd>6.\tTrust is often invisible.</dd>\n<dd>7.\tTrust demands engagements.</dd>\n<dd>8.\tTrust relies usually on reciprocal relations.</dd>\n<dd>9.\tTrust opens possibilities which in other cases are not possible.</dd>\n<dd>10.\tTrust changes in time.</dd>\n<dd>11.\tWe ought to avoid substitutes of trust.</dd>\n<dd>12.\tWe ought to avoid the games of the authority.</dd>\n<dd>13.\tWe ought to build the culture of high trust in the organization.</dd>\n<dd>14.\tWe ought to avoid the continuous choke of conflicts.</dd>\n<dd>15.\tWe ought to care for the concordance, avoid the strategy of the fraud (falsifying, concealing), <a href=\"/wiki/Double_entendre\" title=\"Double entendre\">double meanings</a>) in the communication processes.</dd>\n<dd>16.\tWe ought to reduce the uncertainty.</dd>\n<dd>17.\tWe ought to remember that observable behaviors determine \u201eonly the tip of the iceberg\u201d.</dd>\n<dd>18.\tWe ought to treat other people honestly and justly.</dd></dl>\n<p>The level of trust determines not only our individual development, but above everything else it fosters the social and economic evolution of the whole communities. Therefore, trust management is the best solution to develop. However, it is possible only when we act in the atmosphere of trust where trust culture in commonly acceptable and required by every member of the society.\n</p><p>Trust culture stands for disseminated in society rules which oblige every citizen to treat trust and trustworthiness as common shared values. In this culture well-rooted norm is to redeem the obligations, be honest, open to collaborate with others. Trust culture negates the existence of corruption.\n</p><p><b>Culture of trust</b> is helpful in insecure and unorganized situations (Bjerke, 1999). Trust can be recognized as the strategy of dealing with uncertainty. Distrust culture is based on <a href=\"/wiki/Cynicism_(contemporary)\" title=\"Cynicism (contemporary)\">cynicism</a>, disorder, corruption, exploiting others, deceiving, great care. In order to function in distrust culture there are implemented various formal legal remedies.\n</p><p>Trust has focal meaning for the success of every transaction. It stimulates the human activities. In countries with trust culture there is higher social <a href=\"/wiki/Quality_of_life\" title=\"Quality of life\">well-being</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_growth\" title=\"Economic growth\">economic growth</a> (Fukuyama 1995). In distrust culture those who trust in others are believed to be naive and simple-minded and they are the victims of unfair transactions. Cynicism limits the collaboration, the freedom of activity, destroys communication and divides people. Trust is depreciated.\n</p><p><b>Building trust</b> has special meaning for <a href=\"/wiki/Social_capital\" title=\"Social capital\">social capital</a>. According to Putnam trust is one of elements constituting social capital, together with norms and networks. Without this capital there is impossible the economical and social growth and building <a href=\"/wiki/Capitalism\" title=\"Capitalism\">capitalism</a> and democracy. Citizens need to have the feeling that they influence state affairs and live in the country characterized by culture of trust. Fukuyama, American politician, economist and <a href=\"/wiki/Political_philosophy\" title=\"Political philosophy\">political philosopher</a> brought forward the issue of trust and social capital in his famous book entitled Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity. New York: Free Press, 1995.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Trust_management_(managerial_science)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n<dl><dt>Notes</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Bjerke, B., <i>Business leadership and culture.
