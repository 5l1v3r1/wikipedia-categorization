Yellow Ukraine (Zholty Klyn) is a historical territory with widespread Ukrainian settlement. The settlement of Zholty Klyn (the Yellow Wedge) was founded soon after the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1659 as the eastern border of the second Zasechnaya Cherta. Named after the yellow steppes on the middle and lower Volga, the colony co-existed with the Volga Cossacks; colonists primarily settled around the city of Saratov. In addition to Ukrainians, Volga Germans and Mordovians migrated to Zholty Klyn in numbers. As of  2014[update] most of the population is mixed in the region, though a few "pure" Ukrainian villages remain.
