Other areas composing the Anglophone Caribbean include territories of the former British West Indies, Belize, Bermuda, and Guyana. Two notable territories with substantial non-Anglophone majorities are nonetheless often included in Anglo-America for linguistical reasons. In Canada, the francophone province of Quebec, Acadia in New Brunswick and a part of Cochrane District  are sometimes considered part of Anglo-America for cultural, economic, geographical, historical, and political reasons. Similarly, Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico is considered part of Anglo-America because of its status as an unincorporated territory of the United States.  Conversely, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba are not typically included in Anglo-America, despite their English-speaking majorities, because they are constituent countries or public bodies that form part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. People from other parts of the world have immigrated to Anglo-America to have a better quality of life, find better employment, and escape famine, poverty, violence and conflict. People from many different ethnic origins in Latin America and more remote places all over the world including the less English-dominant parts of Oceania, continental Europe, Asia and Africa all live in Anglo-America contemporarily.
