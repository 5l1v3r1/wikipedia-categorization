The Eastern Orthodoxy in Europe constitutes the second largest Christian denomination. European Eastern Orthodox Christians are predominantly present in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and they are also significantly represented in diaspora throughout the Continent. The term Eastern Orthodox Europe is informally used to describe the predominantly Eastern Orthodox countries of Eastern Europe as well as Greece and Cyprus and one Caucasus state - Georgia. These include Belarus, Bulgaria, the Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. Almost all of Eastern Orthodox Europe became part of communist states after World War II.
