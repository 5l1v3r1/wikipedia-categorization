The Museum of Spirits (Swedish: Spritmuseum) is situated on the island of Djurgården in Stockholm, Sweden. The museum has permanent and temporary exhibitions related to the drinking culture of Sweden. The museum also functions as an art gallery, as it houses and displays the Absolut Art Collection. The museum houses three exhibition venues, including the permanent, interactive exhibition Sweden: Spirits of a Nation (Spritlandet Sverige). The Museum of Spirits was opened as the Wine & Spirit Historical Museum in the Grönstedtska palace, in Vasastaden, Stockholm, in 1967, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state-owned company AB Vin & Sprit. In 2014, Petter Nisson, who had previously operated La Gazzetta (described by the New York Times as "one of the most celebrated creative neo-bistros in Paris"), opened a restaurant at the museum.  The Absolut Art Collection consists of work created between 1985 and 2004. It contains nearly 900 artworks - paintings, graphic art, photography, furniture, fashion and handicrafts - by 600 artists and designers, all in some way portraying the Absolut Vodka bottle. The first piece commissioned was Andy Warhol’s Absolut Warhol, in 1986. Other commissions went to, for example, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, Steven Salzman, Damien Hirst, Tom Ford, Louise Bourgeois, Ola Billgren, Dan Wolgers and Linn Fernström.
