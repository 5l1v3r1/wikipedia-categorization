  'Mad Monday' is a term commonly used in Australia to refer to the traditional end-of-season celebrations for professional players of various codes of football.    Football matches are typically played on weekends so as the season nears its end with teams being eliminated, by Sunday night all results have been determined and teams will then know if they are to continue in the finals or if their season is over. With the season finished, Mad Monday celebrations ensue, often involving heavy drinking.  Over the years, Mad Monday celebrations have been the catalyst for image-damaging incidents for professional footballers.  This has led to calls for the tradition to be banned.
