Blackout Wednesday (or "Black Wednesday," "Drinksgiving," or "Thanksgiving Eve," or "Wacky Wednesday") is a pejorative term for the night before the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, which is always a Thursday. It is associated with binge drinking since very few people work on Thanksgiving, and most university students are home to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with their families.  The name refers to "blacking out", memory loss due to excessive alcohol intoxication. In the south Chicago suburbs in particular, Blackout Wednesday is sometimes a more popular partying night than even New Year's Eve or Saint Patrick's Day.  In some cities, it is the top drunk driving night of the year.  Police departments increase patrols checking for drunk driving in many jurisdictions including in Indiana  and Minnesota.  MADD reports that the Thanksgiving holiday produces more people killed in drunk driving crashes than the Christmas holiday.  The term has a search history on Google beginning in 2014.
