Power Hour or 21 for 21 is a drinking event where player(s) drink a specified number of alcohol shots within one hour. Variants include one shot of beer every minute for an hour or 60 shots within one hour. In the USA, a power hour event is often associated with a person's 21st birthday when they reach the legal drinking age.   Players may have difficulty completing the specified number of drinks as the rate of consumption can raise their blood alcohol content to high levels.  The rate of alcohol consumption makes the players intoxicated within a short period of time.  The power hour is originally 60 minutes in length, but a Centurion is 100 minutes long. The game is usually played using a minute long song playlist. Therefore, one shot should be taken per song. Another way to play is with a minute-timer. The game could be composed of liquor by taking a shot every 10 minutes.  There is another version of a power hour called a Blitzkrieg Power Hour, where the round length successively decreases by one second each round. In 2010, Power Hour LLC, who markets a DVD game named "Power Hour", registered a trademark of the same name and soon after began sending cease-and-desist orders to Ali Spagnola, a musician who had released an album also titled Power Hour.    Spagnola announced her intentions to fight the claims, and an intellectual-property professor from the University of Pittsburgh stated that "if 'Power Hour' is a generic description of 'a drinking game that involves drinking a shot of alcohol each minute for an hour,' then Power Hour LLC can't have any trademark rights at all."  In January 2013, courts ruled in Spagnola's favor.
