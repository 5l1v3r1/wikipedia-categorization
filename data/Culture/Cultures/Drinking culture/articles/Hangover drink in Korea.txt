Hangover drinks (Hangul: 숙취해소음료) are drinks sold in South Korea that are consumed to ease the hangover after heavy drinking. Hangover drinks are consumed before a heavy drinking session and an ingredient in them is said to break down a toxin produced in our liver when drinking and also reduce the effect of alcohol on our brain's neurotransmitters. Get-together among co-workers or students are very common in Korea. A lot of people in Korea consume the hangover drinks before they attend the get-together so they can get out of the hangover quickly on the next day.  Ampelopsin
