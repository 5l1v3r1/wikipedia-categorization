This training is sometimes regulated and mandated by state and local laws predominantly in <a href=\"/wiki/North_America\" title=\"North America\">North America</a>, and increasingly in other <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a>-speaking countries such as Australia.\n</p><p>Establishments that train their employees benefit by reducing risk and creating a safer, more responsible work environment.  The training can be used to mitigate <a href=\"/wiki/Legal_liability\" title=\"Legal liability\">liability</a> during a <a href=\"/wiki/Lawsuit\" title=\"Lawsuit\">lawsuit</a> involving intoxication by providing evidence of intent on the part of the establishment that serves and sells alcoholic beverages - a \"reasonable efforts defense.\"  In addition, this training is intended to lower <a href=\"/wiki/Liquor\" title=\"Liquor\">liquor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Liability_insurance\" title=\"Liability insurance\">liability insurance</a> premiums, offer compliance with local laws and regulations, reduce penalties for alcohol violations, and is thought to prevent alcohol-related crimes such as property damage and assault. \n</p><p>Effective training will enhance the fundamental people skills of servers, sellers, and consumers of alcohol.  At the same time, the training should help individuals understand the difference between people enjoying themselves and those who are getting into trouble with alcohol.  Employees and managers who participate in this training are able to spot underage drinkers and prevent sales to minors, recognize signs of intoxication, effectively intervene to prevent problem situations, and handle refusal situations with greater confidence.  \n</p><p>This training can be delivered in the classroom by certified trainers or via a web-based eLearning program.  Most providers or states are able to offer either option. The training can be anywhere from 2 to 6 hours depending on the course content and provider.  The majority of programs will have a certification attached to it where the participant is required to complete an assessment at the end of the training.  In addition, many providers will offer unique programs for the variety of venues where alcohol is served, sold, or consumed.  For example, an Off Premises location (grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores) may require unique training compared to an On Premises location (restaurants, bars, hotels, night clubs).  The same is true for stadiums, arenas, amphitheatres, and casinos.         \n</p><p>In some places, such as most of Australia's states and territories, gaining such qualifications is required by law, before one can work to sell alcohol.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#United_States\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">United States</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Australia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Australia</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Canada\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Canada</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Alcohol_server_training&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, this training is taught by a wide range of educational providers.  The cost, quality and content of training varies widely from program to program, state to state, and even jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  The term \"alcohol server training\", as a consequence, is often an umbrella attached to the overall intent of the training, if nothing else.  This training usually carries some testing and certification, related to local state regulations, but other than the aforementioned few programs are provided nationally.  \n</p><p>Currently, there are 30 states and hundreds of local jurisdictions that regulate alcohol server training.  Each state and jurisdiction regulate the training in different ways.  Some will mandate training, meaning they approve and require specific training by law.  Others will have voluntary training, which means they don't require the training by law but there is specific perks for completing an approved training course.  The remainder are considered non-regulated, which means they do not regulate alcohol server training at all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Alcohol_server_training&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a>, this training is called Responsible Service of Alcohol or RSA training. It is mandatory throughout the country for all people serving alcohol including bar staff, <a href=\"/wiki/Sommeliers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sommeliers\">sommeliers</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Waiting_staff\" title=\"Waiting staff\">waiting staff</a> (in licensed premises), airline staff, people serving at catered events and so on.\n</p><p>Its primary purpose is harm minimization as set out in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.alcohol.gov.au/internet/alcohol/publishing.nsf/content/nas-06-09\">National alcohol strategy</a> by the Federal Government. Under this strategy, each state government is responsible for putting legislation and strategies in place to minimize the harm alcohol causes to various vulnerable groups in society including minors. One of the ways state governments are enabling this national strategy is through mandatory staff training.\n</p><p>This training is based on a national unit of competency called Provide responsible service of alcohol (SITHFAB002) and forms part of a broader hospitality training package recognised under the <a href=\"/wiki/Australian_Qualifications_Framework\" title=\"Australian Qualifications Framework\">Australian Qualifications Framework</a> or AQF.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Only a <a href=\"/wiki/Registered_Training_Organisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Registered Training Organisation\">Registered Training Organisation</a> is allowed to deliver this training. While this national training standard exists, each state also has their own liquor licensing body and in some cases, they have specific training requirements, such as in Victoria and New South Wales. Until 1 July 2013 Queensland had specific training requirements but now recognises the national training standard.\n</p><p>The type of training delivery allowed also varies between states, with states such as <a href=\"/wiki/Queensland\" title=\"Queensland\">Queensland</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Australia\" title=\"Western Australia\">Western Australia</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/South_Australia\" title=\"South Australia\">South Australia</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Territory\" title=\"Northern Territory\">Northern Territory</a>, accepting online delivery of the National RSA training, while <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)\" title=\"Victoria (Australia)\">Victoria</a> does not currently recognise online as a valid delivery channel for this type of training. In July 2012 the <a href=\"/wiki/New_South_Wales\" title=\"New South Wales\">New South Wales</a> government introduced a trial of the NSW course online which was <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.rsacoursesonline.com/rsa-online-nsw-suspended/\">subsequently suspended</a> in February 2014 until changes made to the \"integrity of online certification\". Debate continues as to the benefits of online training versus classroom training, with advocates claiming it delivers benefits such as more consistent and provides better access to rural learners to deliver the training online, while opponents argue that classroom training delivers better learning outcomes. NSW Update: OLGR NSW have approved a limited number of RTOs to deliver the RSA by email <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.rsaonlinensw.com\">NSW RSA course by \"Distance Learning\"</a>.\n</p><p>Regardless of the delivery channel, RSA training is generally founded on the concept of <a href=\"/wiki/Duty_of_care\" title=\"Duty of care\">Duty of care</a> and requires managers and staff to take all reasonable precautions to protect patrons and staff by preventing patrons from becoming disorderly and/or suffering <a href=\"/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication\" title=\"Alcohol intoxication\">alcohol intoxication</a>.
