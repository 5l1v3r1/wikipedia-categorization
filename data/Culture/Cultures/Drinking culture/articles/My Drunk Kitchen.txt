My Drunk Kitchen is a cooking show and comedy series of short videos created and posted on YouTube by Hannah "Harto" Hart.   The series features Hart, a San Franciscan proofreader living in Los Angeles, typically attempting to cook or bake various dishes, or otherwise engaging in some food-related activity, all while imbibing large quantities of alcoholic beverages.  Most episodes have their own recipe, and occasionally a corresponding beverage. The series has been praised for its drunk humor, catchphrases, and the use of jump cut editing.    This season marked the beginning of the series being shot in HD. While the second season continued featuring her drunk antics, Hannah accompanied "My Drunk Kitchen" with a series of videos titled "Coming Out". Towards the end of the second season, Hannah used Indiegogo to raise $25,000 within a month in order to kick-start her roadshow, "Hello, Harto!". She successfully raised $36,000 in four hours and made plans to continue filming "My Drunk Kitchen" on the road. While the roadshow featured Hannah's comedy skits, the show was also used to attract viewers to help volunteer in local food operations.  After Hannah announced her roadshow, videos were no longer formally organized into seasons. In addition to My Drunk Kitchen, Hart has also posted a series of videos, "Advice from the Hart", answering viewer questions or requests for advice.
