A keg stand is a drinking activity where the participant does a handstand on a keg of beer and attempts to drink as much as possible at once or to drink for as long as possible. Other people will help hold up the drinker's legs, and will hold the keg tap in the stander's mouth, as they will have both hands occupied with the handstand.      The keg stand is particularly popular as part of student drinking culture in the United States.
