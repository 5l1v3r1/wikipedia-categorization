In golf, the nineteenth hole is a slang term for a pub, bar, or restaurant on or near the golf course, very often the clubhouse itself.  A standard round of golf has only eighteen holes of play.  An alternate term for a bar is a "watering hole;" thus, by extension, continuing the day after 18 holes of golf at a watering hole makes the bar a "nineteenth hole." The concept is similar to Apr√®s-ski in skiing.  The 19th hole on miniature golf courses is often a hole in which if a hole-in-one is scored, one receives a free game.
