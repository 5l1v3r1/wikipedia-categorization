A nightcap is a drink taken shortly before bedtime. For example, a small alcoholic drink or glass of warm milk can supposedly promote a good night's sleep.   Traditional nightcaps include brandy, bourbon, and cream-based liqueurs such as Irish cream. Wine and beer can also function as nightcaps.  In folk medicine, consuming a nightcap is for the purpose of inducing sleep. Alcohol is not recommended by many doctors as a sleep aid because it may interfere with sleep quality.   But, in low doses, alcohol has sleep-promoting benefits,  and some popular sleep medicines include 10% alcohol,  although the effects of alcohol upon sleep can wear off somewhat after several nights of consecutive use.  Originally, a "nightcap" was understood to be alcoholic, the idea being that it warms the drinker up and helps him or her sleep, just like the garment of the same name.   That changed in 1930, when the non-alcoholic drink Ovaltine was advertised as "the world's best 'night-cap' to ensure sound, natural sleep".   An ingredient of Ovaltine is magnesium which helps to induce relaxation.  Likewise, warm milk is often recommended as a nightcap for inducing sleep, because it contains both tryptophan and calcium.   The flavor of the warm milk can be improved by adding a small amount of liqueur which may promote sleep as well; alternatively, honey and/or vanilla can improve the flavor.   The effectiveness of warm milk for inducing sleep is disputed.  Other drinks touted for inducing sleep are hops tea, cherry juice (contains melatonin), coconut water (contains magnesium), banana smoothie, lemon balm tea, decaffeinated green tea (contains theanine), valerian tea, and chamomile tea.
