Some long-distance races involve alcohol during or after the event. Some such events could be likened to a pub crawl over an extended distance while others have the alcoholic drinks as a reward at the end of the race. The Marathon du Médoc, held in Bordeaux every September, is a marathon through the vineyards of Médoc during which competitors sample 23 different wines as they go. It has been described as "the world's longest, booziest, race"  as well as "world's most idiotic marathon".  The Harpoon 5-Miler is an annual charity event organised by the Harpoon Brewery in aid of The Angel Fund and ALS research. The event features 5,000 runners who attend a party at the brewery at the end of the race.
