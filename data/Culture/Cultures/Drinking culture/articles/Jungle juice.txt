Jungle juice is the name given to an improvised mix of liquor that is usually served for group consumption.  There are countless recipes and even websites devoted solely to jungle juice.   The term has also been used for similar less-than-reputable alcoholic concoctions.  There are several popular explanations regarding the origin of the name. Generally, it is believed that the name originated in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, where American soldiers improvised such a concoction using any commonly available materials in the surrounding jungles for fermentation, distillation and flavoring.   The characteristics of this concoction leading to its legendary status are its relative inexpensiveness and potency. The term had also been applied to a specific treatment for war neurosis being practiced during the Second World War. Dr. William Sargant began to treat afflicted soldiers with large doses of a sedative called sodium amytal. The sedative would induce a deep sleep lasting up to three weeks. Patients would only be woken for an hour each day to be fed and to be bathed. The idea behind this sleep narcosis treatment was to break the cycle of exhaustion and anxiety caused by combat stress reaction. Additionally, insulin was given to patients to help restore lost weight due to inactivity. The insulin, however, could induce a coma by lowering the blood sugar. If the blood sugar level dropped too low, it could result in irreversible brain damage or even death. Soldiers began to refer to the sedative treatment as being given "Jungle Juice."
