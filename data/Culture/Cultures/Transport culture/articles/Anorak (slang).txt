"Anorak" /ˈænəræk/ is a British slang which refers to a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects. This interest may be unacknowledged or not understood by the general public. The term is sometimes used synonymously with "geek" or "nerd", the Spanish term "friki", or the Japanese term "otaku", albeit referring to different niches. In 1984 the Observer newspaper used the term as a metonym for the prototype group interested in detailed trivia, the trainspotters,   as members of this group often wore unfashionable but warm Parka called Anorak when standing for hours on station platforms or along railway tracks, noting down details of passing trains. The first use of the phrase to describe an obsessive fan has also been credited to the radio presenter Andy Archer, who used the term in the early 1970s for fans of offshore radio, who would charter boats to come out to sea to visit the radio ships.  In 1983, the first edition of the Anoraks UK Weekly Report was published, featuring news of pirate radio broadcasts.   Michaela Simon saw a close connection between geeks ("anoraks") and high-functioning autism. Simon's article exhibits one of the rare uses of "anorak" as a synonym of nerd or spotter in the German language.  Tony Attwood went as far as to write a book called Confessions of an Autism Anorak, stating his own obsession with the topic. He explains further connections between autism as such and the anorak status in general,  based on the extreme male brain theory of Simon Baron-Cohen.
