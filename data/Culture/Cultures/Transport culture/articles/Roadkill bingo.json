Small <a href=\"/wiki/Poker\" title=\"Poker\">poker</a> like chips may be used to designate spotted dead animals, however the jarring due to bumps in the road make this a less viable option. The Roadkill Bingo Company of Loveland, CO sells a version of the game that uses reusable static cling squares to cover the animals, old tires and smells on the game board. Roadkill Bingo is a registered trade name owned by the Roadkill Bingo Company.\n</p><p>As in regular bingo, the object of the game is to spot a sequence of five dead animals which are in the same row or column on the bingo card. At the instant that five in a row is achieved, that player is obligated to yell \"bingo\", loudly and clearly, and the player is said to have \"got a bingo.\"  Prizes for bingos are typically decided upon before the commencement of play. Spotting five dead animals in a row whose pictures are along a diagonal of a card also counts as a bingo.  Four corners may also count as a bingo. The center square is often free, meaning that no dead animal need be spotted to mark it. Controversy may arise when a dead animal is spotted which may not technically be classified as roadkill, and when two players simultaneously spot the roadkill. Players in the front seat have a clear advantage, however, the driver must have someone else mark his or her card. \n</p><p>To promote brevity of games, regional variations include animals more likely to be found dead in the particular locale. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Roadkill_bingo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Gene Sloan, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-06-02-road-trip-products_x.htm\">Kids in the car?
