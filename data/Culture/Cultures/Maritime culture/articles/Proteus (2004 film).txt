Proteus is an animated documentary film written and directed by David Lebrun in 2004.  It depicts a 19th-century understanding of the sea with particular emphasis on the life and work of German biologist and researcher Ernst Haeckel. One-celled microorganisms known as radiolarians feature prominently in Haeckel's fascination with the observable natural world and the underlying guiding principles assumed to be implicit in its very existence.
