The United States Maritime Literature Awards were created to promote maritime cultures, history, heritages and personalities. First Lady Laura Bush officially recognized the Awards in 2002. The international maritime literature awards were founded by Rockport-Fulton, Texas resident, Richard Lamb and Alexandria, Virginia resident, Stephen J. Deatherage. The Awards are presented to winning nonfiction maritime writers and publishing companies annually.  Books may be nominated in the juvenile readers, national or international division.
