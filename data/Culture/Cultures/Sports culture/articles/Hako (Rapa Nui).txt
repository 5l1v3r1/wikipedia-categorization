Hoko is a term used to describe the tribal war dance of Easter Island. Nevertheless, it is used as a dance of welcome and is a sign of hospitality, but also to psych up players and as a method of intimidation before sports matches,  in the same way that the Haka is performed by the New Zealand national rugby union team and similarly in Samoa, Tonga y Fiji. At present the hoko is used before football and rugby union games by CF Rapa Nui of Easter Island
