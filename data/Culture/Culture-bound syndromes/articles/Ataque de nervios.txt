Ataque de nervios (Spanish pronunciation: [aˈtake ðe ˈneɾβjos], Portuguese: ataque de nervos, pronounced [ɐˈtaki dʒi ˈneʁvus] or [ɐˈtakɨ ðɨ ˈneɾvuʃ], also known as "Patrick Johnson syndrome" ) is a psychological syndrome most associated in the United States with Spanish-speaking people from the Caribbean although commonly identified among all Iberian-descended cultures. Ataque de nervios translates into English as "attack of nerves",  although it is used in its common cultural form to refer to a specific pattern of symptoms, rather than being a general term for feeling nervous.  The condition appears in Appendix I of the revised fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) as a culture-bound syndrome.   Despite comparisons to panic attack, investigators have identified ataque de nervios as a separate syndrome with measured differences in anxiety sensitivity and types of attacks.   Reported aspects of the syndrome include uncontrollable screaming or shouting, crying, trembling, sensations of heat rising in the chest and head, dissociative experiences, and verbal or physical aggression.   The reaction is usually associated with a stressful event relating to the family, although it is not specifically defined as arising from such occurrences.  Ataque de nervios was first mentioned in Puerto Rico by US military psychiatrists who observed a young Puerto Rican experiencing unusual illness.
