Ufufunyane is a culture-bound syndrome.  It is seen in Zulu- and Xhosa-speaking communities in southern Africa. In Kenya, it is referred to as saka.  It is an anxiety state attributed to the effects of magical potions (given to them by rejected lovers) or spirit possession. There is characteristic sobbing, repeated neologisms, paralysis, trance-like states, or loss of consciousness in young, unmarried women. They may also experiences nightmares with sexual themes, and rarely episodes of temporary blindness.
