Falling-out is a culture-bound syndrome primarily reported in the southern United States and the Caribbean. It is described as a constricted consciousness as a psychological response to anxiety and specific stressors. Sudden collapse characterizes episodes of falling-out, whether without warning or preceded by dizziness and a spinning sensation. The individual suffering from symptoms of falling out can usually hear and understand what is going on around them.  Falling-out is not treated as an illness unless it becomes disabling. It is often seen as a normal response to stressful situations, funerals, or when a person receives shocking information.
