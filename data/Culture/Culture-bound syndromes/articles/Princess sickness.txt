Princess sickness, alternatively known as princess syndrome or princess disease (Chinese: 公主病; pinyin: gōng zhǔ bìng; Cantonese Yale: gūng jyú behng; Korean: 공주병; Revised Romanization: gong ju byeong}), is a neologistic term used colloquially in East Asia to describe a condition of narcissism, egocentrism and materialism in women, or "princess" behaviour.   Conversely but less commonly, men with a similar outlook may be described as having "prince" sickness.  It is speculated that the term originated with the rise of the Four Asian Tigers across Asia, in which rapid economic growth may have contributed to a corresponding rise in consumerist or materialistic attitudes and upper classes investing heavily in their children, who might subsequently become accustomed to material wealth and domestic help.   In Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, low birth rates  have meant that families often have only children that are the sole focus of their parents' energies. In Mainland China, the resultant phenomenon, often attributed to the former one-child policy, is known as the 'Little Emperor Syndrome'. A combination of helicopter parenting and presence of Domestic workers, allowing middle-class parents to work, can contribute to their children being spoilt.  A widening income gap in Hong Kong, along with concerns over democracy and social inequality, also reflects the perceived attitudes of the 'elite' classes.   Furthermore, social mobility in East Asia is primarily based on personal and academic achievement.  For that reason, parents may place a great deal of academic pressure on both children and their teachers, micro-managing their child's academic career to achieve higher grades.   Some suggest that this results in dependence or a lack of responsibility.
