Wannarexia, or anorexic yearning,  is a label applied to someone who claims to have anorexia nervosa, or wishes they did, but does not.  These individuals are also called wannarexic,  “wanna-be ana”  or "anorexic wannabe".  The neologism wannarexia is a portmanteau of the latter two terms. It may be used as a pejorative term.  Wannarexia is a cultural phenomenon and has no diagnostic criteria,  although some wannarexics may be instead diagnosed with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS).  Wannarexia is more commonly, but not always, found in teenage girls who want to be trendy,  and is likely caused by a combination of cultural and media influences.  Dr. Richard Kreipe states that the distinction between anorexia and wannarexia is that anorexics aren't satisfied by their weight loss, while wannarexics are more likely to derive pleasure from weight loss.   Many people who actually suffer from the eating disorder anorexia are angry, offended, or frustrated about wannarexia.  Wannarexics may be inspired or motivated by the pro-anorexia, or pro-ana, community that promotes or supports anorexia as a lifestyle choice rather than an eating disorder.  Some participants in pro-ana web forums only want to associate with "real anorexics" and will shun wannarexics who only diet occasionally, and are not dedicated to the "lifestyle" full-time.  Community websites for anorexics and bulimics have posted advice to wannarexics saying that they don't want their "warped perspectives and dangerous behaviour to affect others."  Kelsey Osgood uses the label in her book "How To Disappear Completely: On Modern Anorexia" where she describes wannarexia as “a gateway drug for teenagers”.
