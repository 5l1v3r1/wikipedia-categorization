Gaming  gaming disorder is a a very serious disorder by the uncontrollable and persistent playing of video and computer games, which is harmful to an individual's well-being. Many mental health professionals believe these games can cause a distinct type of addiction by triggering reward-motivated behavior, which releases dopamine and triggers the reward centers of the brain. Such disorders can be diagnosed when an individual engages in gaming activities at the cost of fulfilling daily responsibilities or pursuing other interests, and without regard for the negative consequences.  Not all medical and psychology experts agree on whether addictive gaming behaviors should be classified as a disorder. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013, "Internet Gaming Disorder" is defined as a "condition warranting more clinical research and experience before it might be considered in the main book as a formal disorder."   However, in 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) included gaming disorder alongside gambling disorder under "Disorders Due to Addictive Behaviors" in its diagnostic International Classification of Diseases.  For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behavior pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months.  Research shows gaming disorders can be associated with anxiety, depression, obesity, sleeping disorders, and stress.    The WHO's action has been criticized by some researchers who claim the evidence remains weak and "there is a genuine risk of abuse of diagnoses."  https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a21595645/video-games-new-mental-health-disorder/
