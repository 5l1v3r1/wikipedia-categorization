Television addiction is a proposed addiction model associated with maladaptive or compulsive behavior associated with watching television programming. The most recent medical review on this model concluded that pathological television watching behavior may constitute a true behavioral addiction, but indicated that much more research on this topic is needed to demonstrate this.  The compulsion can be extremely difficult to control in many cases. The television addiction model has parallels to other forms of behavioral addiction, such as addiction to drugs or gambling, which are also forms of compulsive behavior. Television addiction is not a diagnosable condition of DSM-IV.
