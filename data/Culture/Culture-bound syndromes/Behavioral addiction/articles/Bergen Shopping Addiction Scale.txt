The Bergen Shopping Addiction Scale (BSAS) is a brief screening tool for assessing the severity of shopping addiction.  The Bergen Scale is named after the city of Bergen, Norway, the location of the University of Bergen where lead author Cecilie Andreassen is a professor of Clinical Psychology.  The Bergen Shopping Addiction Scale (BSAS) consists of 28 statements. The participant is asked to rate how strongly each of the statements relates to their thoughts and behavior in the last 12 months. Each item is rated on a 5 point continuum of agreement: completely disagree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree, agree, completely agree. Groups of 4 items are targeted toward each of 7 addiction criteria (salience, mood modification, conflict, tolerance, withdrawal, relapse, and problems).  The BSAS offers several improvements over prior compulsive shopping assessments.
