However, it became well known after its 1970 publication (under its current name) in the Russian journal <i>Questions of Literature</i> [\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b].  It was re-published in a 1975 collection of Bakhtin's writings, <i>Questions of Literature and Aesthetics</i> [\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u044d\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438].\n</p><p>In vol. 3 of Bakhtin's Collected Writings [\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439], published in 2012, this article appears under Bakhtin's original title (\"The Novel as a Literary Genre\"), and with the opening paragraph, edited out from earlier publications, restored. Also published are Bakhtin's notes for the lecture, on which the article is based, and a partial transcript of the discussion that followed the lecture. As the newly published material reveals, Bakhtin framed this article as a study in the philosophy of genres.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Epic_and_Novel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Summary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In this essay, Bakhtin attempts to outline a theory of the <a href=\"/wiki/Novel\" title=\"Novel\">novel</a> and its unique properties by comparing it to other literary forms, in particular the <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_poetry\" title=\"Epic poetry\">epic</a>.  Bakhtin sees the novel as capable of achieving much of what other forms cannot, including an ability to engage with contemporary reality, and an ability to re-conceptualize the <a href=\"/wiki/Individual\" title=\"Individual\">individual</a> in a complex way that interrogates his subjectivity and offers the possibility of redefining his own image.  He also stresses the novel\u2019s flexibility: he argues it is a genre with the unique ability to constantly adapt and change, partly because there is no generic canon of the novel as there is for epic or <a href=\"/wiki/Lyric_poetry\" title=\"Lyric poetry\">lyric poetry</a>.\n</p><p>The epic, on the other hand, is a \u2018high-distance genre\u2019, i.e. its form and structure situate it in a distant past time that assumes a finished quality, meaning it cannot be re-evaluated, re-thought or changed by us.  (Bakhtin compares the novel to <a href=\"/wiki/Clay\" title=\"Clay\">clay</a>, a material which can be remodeled, and the epic to <a href=\"/wiki/Marble\" title=\"Marble\">marble</a>, which cannot).  The epic past is one that is irretrievable and idealized, and it is valorized in a way that makes it appear hierarchically superior to the present; the epic form is a \u2018walled\u2019 one, i.e. it builds boundaries which block it off from the present.   The individual in the epic is a fully finished and completed lofty hero, who is entirely \u2018externalized\u2019: i.e. his appearance, actions and internal world are external characteristics which are literally expressed in the written word.\n</p><p>While Bakhtin does make reference to proto-novels in <a href=\"/wiki/Ancient_history\" title=\"Ancient history\">antiquity</a>, he dates the rise of the modern novel with the <a href=\"/wiki/Renaissance\" title=\"Renaissance\">Renaissance</a> and suggests that it developed then precisely because of a new temporal perspective: man had become conscious of the present not only as a continuation of the past, but also as a \u2018heroic and new beginning\u2019.  This allowed the novel, a genre that was concerned with the possibilities of the present, to flourish.  The novel, therefore, \u2018the only genre born of this new world and in total affinity with it\u2019 (Bakhtin 1981:7), i.e. the most apt form for literary expression in the modern world.\n</p><p>One interesting observation in the essay is the ability of the novel to influence and \u2018novelize\u2019 other genres.  Bakhtin argues that the prominence of the novel caused other genres to adapt themselves and try to treat time in the same way as the novel.  He gives the specific example of <a href=\"/wiki/Byron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Byron\">Lord Byron\u2019s</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Childe_Harold\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Childe Harold\">Childe Harold</a></i> as a poem that adopted certain novelistic features.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influence\">Influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Epic_and_Novel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bakhtin\u2019s essay continues to fascinate scholars and has been reprinted in multiple literary anthologies.  It is debatable whether Bakhtin\u2019s central claim about the novel\u2019s suitability for the modern world and its adaptability and continues to apply in a world where \u2018the death of the novel\u2019 has been proclaimed by many theorists and new theories and technologies have challenged the book.\n</p><p>There is still much interest in Bakhtin today: the most prominent scholars in the United States are Professor <a href=\"/wiki/Gary_Saul_Morson\" title=\"Gary Saul Morson\">Gary Saul Morson</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Northwestern_University\" title=\"Northwestern University\">Northwestern University</a> and Professor <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Caryl_Emerson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Caryl Emerson (page does not exist)\">Caryl Emerson</a> of Princeton University.  The <a href=\"/wiki/Culture_wars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Culture wars\">culture wars</a> have led to some lively debate on Bakhtin, with the \u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 wings both attempting to claim them as their own.  Typical of the more radical wing is Michael Gardiner\u2019s study (1992) attempts to situate Bakhtin within \u2018the Western Marxist tradition\u2019, arguing that Bakhtin is a relativistic and radical thinker whose idea of the <a href=\"/wiki/Carnivalesque\" title=\"Carnivalesque\">carnivalesque</a> is akin to political subversion and resistance to dominant ideologies.  Caryl Emerson, in an article responding to Gardiner\u2019s book, argues that Bakhtin is better seen as an \u2018individuating\u2019, \u2018humanist\u2019 and \u2018humanizing\u2019 thinker, and discusses how Bakthin has been appropriated by both left and right in the academy more generally.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Epic_and_Novel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Bakhtin, M.M. 1981.
