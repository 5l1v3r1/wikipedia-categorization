On bad days I just feel alone,\u201d Sergio Troncoso writes in this collection of personal essays in which he seeks to connect the humanity of his Mexican family to people he meets on the East Coast, including his wife\u2019s Jewish kin. Raised in a home steps from the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas, Troncoso crossed what seemed an even more imposing border when he left home to attend Harvard College.\n</p><p>Initially, \u201coutsider status\u201d was thrust upon him; later, he adopted it willingly, writing about the Southwest and Chicanos in an effort to communicate who he was and where he came from to those unfamiliar with his childhood world. He wrote to maintain his ties to his parents and his abuelita, and to fight against the elitism he experienced at an Ivy League school. \u201cI was torn,\u201d he writes, \u201cbetween the people I loved at home and the ideas I devoured away from home.\u201d\n</p><p>Troncoso writes to preserve his connections to the past, but he puts pen to paper just as much for the future. In his three-part essay entitled \u201cLetter to My Young Sons,\u201d he documents the terror of his wife\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis and the ups and downs of her surgery and treatment. Other essays convey the joys and frustrations of fatherhood, his uneasy relationship with his elderly father, and the impact his wife\u2019s Jewish heritage and religion have on his Mexican-American identity.\n</p><p><i>Crossing Borders: Personal Essays</i> reveals a writer, father and husband who has crossed linguistic, cultural and intellectual borders to provoke debate about contemporary Mexican-American identity.  Challenging assumptions about literature, the role of writers in America, fatherhood and family, these essays bridge the chasm between the poverty of the border region and the highest echelons of success in America. Troncoso writes with the deepest faith in humanity about sacrifice, commitment and honesty.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Content\">Content</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Crossing_Borders:_Personal_Essays&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Content\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>\"Crossing Borders\"</dt>\n<dd>Troncoso explores the relationship between Latinos and Jews, and interfaith marriage.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>\"Literature and Migration\"</dt>\n<dd>The author adopts an outsider status to write from a new perspective in fiction and writes simply to combat abstractions and also to communicate complex ideas to a broader community.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>\"Fresh Challah\"</dt>\n<dd>Dolores Rivero, Troncoso's abuelita, taught him to fight for what is right, as well as to be self-critical, which helped him to appreciate Judaism.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>\"Letter to my Young Sons-Part One\"</dt>\n<dd>The author's wife is diagnosed with breast cancer, and with two young children the couple struggles with their emotions and scrambles to understand the diagnosis.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>\"Letter to my Young Sons-Part Two\"</dt>\n<dd>Laura's day for surgery arrives, and she endures seven hours of procedures.

Troncoso writes about crossing personal, religious, and cultural borders, as well as literal borders, and brings the reader into experiences they are not likely to have on their own. <i>Crossing Borders</i> is a book the reader will get invested in, if only to learn more about the family being talked about in the essays. Most heart-wrenching are the three pieces entitled \u201cLetter to My Young Sons,\u201d which details their mother\u2019s battle with cancer and shows a father\u2019s love for his children. If a reader only reads one essay, though, it should be \u201cWhy Should Latinos Write Their Own Stories,\u201d a piece that shows the importance of preserving heritage and teaching the world things that they may not know about Latinos. In all, Troncoso\u2019s book is a piece of artwork and a piece of heritage that everyone, not just Latinos, should take the time to read.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<hr /><p>A reviewer from the <i><a href=\"/wiki/El_Paso_Times\" title=\"El Paso Times\">El Paso Times</a></i> wrote: \"Sergio Troncoso's <i>Crossing Borders: Personal Essays</i> is an engrossing and revealing peek behind the curtain of one writer's creative process, development and struggles.\n</p><p>The reader is treated to crisp and evocative prose that wades into the murky waters of ethnic, religious and familial identities\u2026.\n</p><p>In three heartbreaking interconnected essays, \"Letter to my Young Sons (Parts One, Two and Three),\" he begins: \"Two weeks ago, Aaron and Isaac, I learned your mother Laura has breast cancer.\" We are plunged into the world of surgical options, chemotherapy and physical therapy. Troncoso skillfully and in exquisite detail allows us the privilege of entering into his world as the disease affects not only his wife but also all who love her.\n</p><p>The fact that Troncoso's beloved wife is Jewish imbues many of these essays with a sense of wonder and appreciation of a religion and culture vastly different from the Mexican Catholicism of his youth. In \"Fresh Challah,\" we learn of his newfound love for the traditional Jewish bread, which he can find in his favorite New York bakeries: \"The loaves of Challah glistened under the bright white light, and seemed soft and steamy from the other side of the cash register.\" Troncoso brilliantly uses challah as a springboard for an exploration of his El Paso roots as embodied by his late grandmother, Do\u00f1a Dolores Rivero\u2026.\n</p><p>Troncoso has already made his mark in the literary world. But if <i>Crossing Borders</i> is any guide, he will continue to spin stories and explain the writer's life for many years to come.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a
