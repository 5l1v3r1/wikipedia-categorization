Critical and Miscellaneous Essays (1838-1839) is the title of a collection of reprinted reviews and other magazine pieces by the Scottish philosopher and historian Thomas Carlyle.  Along with Sartor Resartus and The French Revolution it was one of the books that made his name.  Its subject matter ranges from literary criticism (especially of German literature) to biography, history and social commentary.  These essays have been described as "Intriguing in their own right as specimens of graphic and original nonfiction proseâ€¦indispensable for understanding the development of Carlyle's mind and literary career",  and the scholar Angus Ross has noted that the review-form displays in the highest degree Carlyle's "discursiveness, allusiveness, argumentativeness, and his sense of playing the prophet's part."  Carlyle earned his living during the late 1820s and early 1830s as a reviewer and essayist, contributing to the Edinburgh Review, the Foreign Review, Fraser's Magazine, and other journals.  As early as 1830 he thought about collecting these pieces in book form, but it was not until 1837 that he seriously prepared for such an edition,  when with the help of his friends Ralph Waldo Emerson, Harriet Martineau and others, he entered into negotiations with the Boston publisher James Munroe.  The Critical and Miscellaneous Essays were duly published by him in four volumes, the first two being issued on 14 July 1838, with a preface by Emerson, and the last two on 1 July 1839.  250 copies of the Munroe edition were sent to the London publisher James Fraser, who first sold them under his own imprint and then, in 1840, produced a second edition.    A third edition followed in 1847, and a fourth in 1857, each published by the firm of Chapman & Hall, and each incorporating additions from Carlyle's continuing journalistic output.  The following is a list of the contents of the 1888 Chapman and Hall edition (4 vols. in 2).  All articles were first collected in the 1838-1839 edition of Critical and Miscellaneous Essays unless otherwise stated.
