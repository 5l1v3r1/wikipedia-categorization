They have no understanding of our economy and the time it takes society to go. Confess and shut up! Capitalism good or ill is the river in which we sink or swim. Inspiration has always been born of recombination.\"</li>\n<li>\"In a capitalistic society such as the one in which we live, <a href=\"/wiki/Aesthetics\" title=\"Aesthetics\">aesthetics</a> as an endeavor flows thorough a body which is built of free enterprise and various illnesses. In boom times art may be supported by wildcat speculation or by excess funds in form of grants from the state or patronship as a tax write-off. Currently we are suffering from a lean economy. By necessity we must infiltrate popular mediums. We are building a business-based art movement. This is not new. Admitting it is.\"</li>\n<li>\"Waiting for art <a href=\"/wiki/Talent_scout\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Talent scout\">talent scouts</a>? There are no art talent scouts. Face it, no one will seek you out.\"</li>\n<li>\"Law: If you want better media, go make it.\"</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_on_Culture\">Effects on Culture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rozz_Tox_Manifesto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Effects on Culture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The essay influenced Panter's friend <a href=\"/wiki/Matt_Groening\" title=\"Matt Groening\">Matt Groening</a>, who later went on to become the creator of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Simpsons\" title=\"The Simpsons\">The Simpsons</a></i>.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Matt_Howarth\" title=\"Matt Howarth\">Matt Howarth</a>'s comic <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Stalking_Ralph&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Stalking Ralph (page does not exist)\">Stalking Ralph</a></i>, the musical group <a href=\"/wiki/The_Residents\" title=\"The Residents\">The Residents</a> are portrayed as being created by a \"Rozz Tox Virus\", whose ultimate goal is to constantly mutate to avoid becoming part of <a href=\"/wiki/Mainstream\" title=\"Mainstream\">mainstream</a> culture.  While the text of the manifesto does not appear in the comic, an alien creature declares, \"The <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Underground_(culture)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Underground (culture) (page does not exist)\">underground</a> becomes the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Establishment\" title=\"The Establishment\">establishment</a>\", and that the reason The Residents change their band identity so often is to remain underground and to avoid becoming establishment. Howarth's interpretation of Rozz Tox is different from Groening's.  While Groening has worked within a capitalist system to create and to perpetuate successful <a href=\"/wiki/Merchandising\" title=\"Merchandising\">merchandising</a>, Howarth's characters are specifically avoiding \"selling out\" and avoiding popular acceptance.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rozz_Tox_Manifesto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.altx.com/manifestos/rozztox.html\">Rozz Tox Manifesto</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.residents.com/\">The Residents' official website</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.matthowarth.com\">Matt Howarth's web page</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.jaybabcock.com/groening.html\">Jay Babcock's interview with Matt Groening</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1249\nCached time: 20180910032830\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 25/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:5492257-0!canonical and timestamp 20180910032830 and revision id 834346737\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"American_essays"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1980_essays"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Essays_about_culture"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Aesthetics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Artist"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bohemian"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Capitalism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Essay"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gary Panter"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mainstream"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Matt Groening"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Matt Howarth"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Merchandising"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Talent scout"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"The Establishment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"The Residents"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"The Simpsons"},{"ns":0,"*":"Stalking Ralph"},{"ns":0,"*":"Underground (culture)"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.altx.com/manifestos/rozztox.html","http://www.residents.com/","http://www.matthowarth.com","http://www.jaybabcock.com/groening.html"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Selected Quotes","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Rozz_Tox_Manifesto","byteoffset":242,"anchor":"Selected_Quotes"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Effects on Culture","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Rozz_Tox_Manifesto","byteoffset":1294,"anchor":"Effects_on_Culture"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Rozz_Tox_Manifesto","byteoffset":2265,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Rozz Tox Manifesto","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7375458"}]}}
