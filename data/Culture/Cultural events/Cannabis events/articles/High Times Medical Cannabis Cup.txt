The High Times Medical Cannabis Cup is an annual event celebrating medical marijuana. The first Medical Cannabis Cup took place in San Francisco, California June 19–20, 2010.  Like the High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, many marijuana strains are judged and Cups (trophies) are awarded in a number of categories at the Medical Cup. However, unlike the Cannabis Cup, the Medical Cannabis Cup focuses on the emerging medical marijuana movement in America. As a result, official judging of the strains and edibles is left to a panel of experts. Attendees receive a list of participating medical marijuana dispensaries and state approved medical cannabis patients can visit those marijuana dispensaries and sample the entered strains prior to the event.  In addition to awarding the best and most medicinal marijuana, hash and edibles from legal medical marijuana dispensaries, the event also includes medical cultivation seminars, a product expo and information on creating a legal “cann-business.” SATIVA Indica Hybrid Concentrates Non Solvent Hash CBD AWARD Edibles Cup Best Booth Best Product Sativa Indica Best Hybrid Best Concentrates Best Edibles Best Product Best Glass Best Exhibitor Booth Sativa  Indica  Concentrates Edibles  Expo Booth  Glass  Product
