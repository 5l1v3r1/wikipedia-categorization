The Kenneth Hudson Award is a museum award in Europe for the most unusual and daring achievement that challenges common perceptions of the role of museums in society. The award is presented each year since 2010 by the European Museum Forum (EMF) under the auspices of the Council of Europe. The award is a tribute to British journalist, anti-museologist, broadcaster and book author Kenneth Hudson.
