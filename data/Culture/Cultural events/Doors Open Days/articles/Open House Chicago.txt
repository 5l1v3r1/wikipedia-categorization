Open House Chicago (OHC) is a free weekend festival held annually  in Chicago that allows participants to visit dozens of buildings that are not typically open to the public. It is currently being held October 13-14, 2018. OHC is organized by the Chicago Architecture Foundation over a two-day period each year in mid-October. The event promotes appreciation of architecture by the general public. OHC began in 2011 and it is part of a worldwide network of Open House events that started with Open House London in 1992.  Its organizers state that event objectives include enabling participants to “venture into new neighborhoods, learn the stories of Chicago’s architecture and experience the diversity and culture of each community.”  OHC is an important event for tourism in Chicago.  Funding for the event comes from the Chicago Architecture Center and from corporate sponsors, government agencies, foundations, and individual donors. The event relies on approximately 2,600 volunteers to staff participating buildings.
