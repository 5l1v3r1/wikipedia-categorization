INTERMAT is an international exhibition of equipment, machinery and techniques for the construction and materials industries, which is held every three years in Paris. INTERMAT is a major international event  showing the equipment and techniques used in the international building and civil engineering sectors. It's the world's third largest exhibition in this sector. First called EXPOMAT, the exhibition was initially held at the Paris – Le Bourget Airport. The show only became INTERMAT in 1988 when it took place at Parc des Expositions de Villepinte for the very first time. This trade exhibition is organised by CISMA and Seimat, French professional trade unions for the equipment industry, together with Comexposium, a French trade show organiser.
