Built around a preserved Umm al Nar era tomb,  the Centre details the excavations and discoveries made over the past 40 years at Mileiha and surrounding areas (including Al Thuqeibah, Jebel Faya, Al Madam and Jebel Buhais), particularly the important Faya North East find, which provides evidence that 'anatomically modern humans' were in the Mleiha area between 130,000 and 120,000 years ago.  These finds point to the spread of humanity from Africa across the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf region, and onward to populate the world through Iran, India, Europe and Asia. Tours are offered from the centre to nearby attractions, including the popular 'Fossil Rock', or Jebel Mleiha.  The Centre was opened on 24 January 2016 by the Ruler of Sharjah, Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi.  One of a number of innovations being deployed to maintain the eco-tourism aspect of the Centre is 'spray on roads'.  The multi-phase eco-tourism development is intended in future to comprise accommodation, a campsite and an astronomical observatory, with a total investment of some UAE Dhs 250 million. It will also include the development of a 450 km desert park.  The widespread archaeological evidence unearthed throughout the Mleiha area dates back as far as the Palaeolithic period, some 130,000 years ago.  This would place the habitation of the area firmly within the period when it is thought anatomically modern human communities first left Africa and started to expand globally. Later, as the last Ice Age gave way warmer climates, graveyards and adjacent settlements have been found which point to Neolithic communities who lived there from 11,000 years ago. Civilization evolved during the succeeding Bronze Age from 3000 BCE onwards, with elaborate communal tombs. The centuries that followed witnessed the introduction of the underground falaj irrigation system and the cultivation of dates and other cereal crops. An extensive fortified compound, 'Mleiha Fort', nearby the site of the present Centre, was discovered in the late 1990s and is thought to have been possibly the seat of an ancient South Arabian kingdom dating back to 300 BCE.
