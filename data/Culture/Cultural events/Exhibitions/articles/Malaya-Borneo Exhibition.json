{"parse":{"title":"Malaya-Borneo Exhibition","pageid":1862143,"revid":722163515,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>Malaya-Borneo Exhibition</b> was an exhibition of the trade and economic possibilities of <a href=\"/wiki/British_Malaya\" title=\"British Malaya\">British Malaya</a> and British <a href=\"/wiki/Borneo\" title=\"Borneo\">Borneo</a> which was arranged to synchronise with His Royal Highness the <a href=\"/wiki/Prince_of_Wales\" title=\"Prince of Wales\">Prince of Wales</a>'s visit to <a href=\"/wiki/Singapore\" title=\"Singapore\">Singapore</a> in March 1922. Governor Sir Lawrence Guillemard conceived the idea of bringing people together from the Malaya peninsula and Borneo for the purpose of enhancing trade and other mutual benefits.\n</p><p>\"It was also felt that the opportunity was a fitting one for the exhibition, by the commercial and foreign communities, of imported goods in illustration of the varied trade activities of this country in general, and of the great exchange port of Singapore in particular.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Straits Budget described the details of the Planning and Layout of the site situated on reclaimed land adjacent to the <a href=\"/wiki/Telok_Ayer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Telok Ayer\">Telok Ayer</a> Basin in Singapore.\n</p><p>\"The large scale on which the Malaya-Borneo Exhibition, which is to be held in April has been arranged, as regards the variety of the exhibits, and the collecting together of arts and crafts, industries with trades of all nationalities, is of necessity occasioning a great deal of work on the part of those engaged in the planning and lay-out of the site in <a href=\"/wiki/Robinson_Road,_Singapore\" title=\"Robinson Road, Singapore\">Robinson Road</a>.\n</p><p>The area of the site is 65 acres. It extends from <a href=\"/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Market\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Telok Ayer Market\">Telok Ayer Market</a> to <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mount_Palmer_(Singapore)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Mount Palmer (Singapore) (page does not exist)\">Mount Palmer</a>, a distance of 900 yards. The width, to be covered by the exhibition between <a href=\"/wiki/Anson_Road\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anson Road\">Anson Road</a> and the sea is 530 yards and between the main entrance opposite <a href=\"/wiki/McCallum_Street\" title=\"McCallum Street\">McCallum Street</a> and the sea is 270 yards. These dimensions are on an equality with the dimensions of international exhibitions. Although much of the Ground appeared open and easy for free planning, in actuality there were many deciding and limiting factors. For example, the massive concrete flooring which had been used for the <a href=\"/wiki/Goliath_crane_(disambiguation)\" class=\"mw-redirect mw-disambig\" title=\"Goliath crane (disambiguation)\">Goliath cranes</a> and the making of <a href=\"/wiki/Caisson_(engineering)\" title=\"Caisson (engineering)\">caissons</a> for the reclamation work, is an immovable fixture, altogether 900 feet in length and 65 feet in width. This has been utilised for large exhibition plots, the buildings on which will form one side of the main avenue. Then again, a groan of concrete cylinders have been turned to advantage for they have been surrounded with granite stones and filled up with earth and are now in process of being converted into a picturesque <a href=\"/wiki/Rock_garden\" title=\"Rock garden\">rock garden</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Stadium\">The Stadium</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Malaya-Borneo_Exhibition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: The Stadium\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The many details of the planning might lend one at first to imagine that it is a garden city that is in course of construction rather than a trade exhibition, for numerous picturesque features are being arranged. A number of pleasant trees not far from Telok Ayer have been \u201cplanted\u201d so as to form an attractive oval filled with foliage, and in the centre of which will he erected a grandstand. This is in the centre of the Borneo and <a href=\"/wiki/Dayak_people\" title=\"Dayak people\">Dayak</a> groups. It was essential also to have a large padang or stadium and the choice of site was limited to some area in the centre of the exhibition, to be non-interfering with the general flow of traffic to be drainable and fairly level, and also, so placed as to be a striking feature of the general plan. The stadium as planned, and now in course of preparation, will he a grass ellipse in width, surrounded by a 60 feet circular road. There will thus be provision for a full-sized football ground on which football matches will be played. On one side will be erected a grandstand, about 140 feet long, facing east towards the main entrance so as to avoid spectators being troubled by the afternoon sun; while on the opposite side of the stadium will be an enclosure for the band. A movable platform is being provided for the centre of the stadium, so that, without discomfort, some five thousand will be able to witness the Dayak and other native dances which will be given there. The tea gardens are to be an attractive feature of this part of the exhibition.\n</p><p>With regard to the trade exhibition itself, every endeavour is being made to allocate to each nationality and group of exhibitors equally effective sites. What might he called the national group, each having its own focussed grouping of buildings are as follows Malay, Chinese, Arabian, Indian, Japanese, European shops, Dayaks, Bornean shops.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_Effect\">General Effect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Malaya-Borneo_Exhibition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: General Effect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The main entrance will be in Robinson Road, the approach place from the road being over 100 yards wide. On entering the Exhibition one will look down a long avenue terminating in a <a href=\"/wiki/Triumphal_arch\" title=\"Triumphal arch\">triumphal arch</a> through which the distant sea will be visible. To the left the main avenue bordered by exhibits will lead to the Telok Ayer market and on the right to the stadium, <a href=\"/wiki/Teagarden\" title=\"Teagarden\">teagardens</a>, Chinese and Arabian sections and the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayang\" title=\"Wayang\">wayang</a> and theatre grouped around Mount Palmer. Here there will be numerous native sideshows, a circus and merry-go-rounds, so that part of the Exhibition will no doubt be a very lively one. The other attractions will include two <a href=\"/wiki/Movie_theater\" title=\"Movie theater\">cinemas</a>, the one to be devoted to comedy productions, and the other to official pictures.\n</p><p>Road making has been a great problem but <a href=\"/wiki/Rickshaw_(disambiguation)\" class=\"mw-disambig\" title=\"Rickshaw (disambiguation)\">rickshaws</a> will be able to traverse the two miles of roads which will have been constructed. The Exhibition will be brilliantly illuminated and lit electrically from the Harbour Board's power station, and on the highest point an illuminated fountain will play every evening. There will also be <a href=\"/wiki/Firework\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Firework\">firework</a> displays every evening in the stadium. The ground is being supplied with hydrants for use in the case of fire, and there will be stationed in the Exhibition a Fire Brigade and Ambulance and Police Stations.\n</p><p>Special arrangements are being for the sea sports to be held along the South Pier and Quay. A special <a href=\"/wiki/Pagoda\" title=\"Pagoda\">pagoda</a> or stand will be provided there for accommodation of His Royal Highness. The land sports in addition to the usual flat races will include <a href=\"/wiki/Fencing\" title=\"Fencing\">fencing</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Wrestling\" title=\"Wrestling\">wrestling</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Boxing\" title=\"Boxing\">boxing</a>.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After the Exhibition one feature was retained. The Stadium was re-aligned, rebuilt and enclosed with a twelve foot high bank. It became the venue for significant league and cup football matches.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Malaya-Borneo_Exhibition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Malaya Borneo Exhibition Singapore: Official Guide (Singapore: 1922)</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Straits Budget, 6 January 1922</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<ul><li>Straits Budget, 6 January 1922</li>\n<li>Official Guide: Malaya Borneo Exhibition, Singapore 1922</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1248\nCached time: 20180905215720\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.031 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 117/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 356/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 88/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 605/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   17.180      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   17.180      1 -total\n 11.29%    1.939      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1862143-0!canonical and timestamp 20180905215720 and revision id 722163515\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"British_Malaya"},{"sortkey":"","*":"British_Borneo"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1922_in_British_Malaya"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1922_in_Singapore"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1922_in_Sarawak"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Exhibitions"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Anson Road"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Borneo"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Boxing"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"British Malaya"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Caisson (engineering)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dayak people"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Fencing"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Firework"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Goliath crane (disambiguation)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"McCallum Street"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Movie theater"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pagoda"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Prince of Wales"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rickshaw (disambiguation)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Robinson Road, Singapore"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rock garden"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Singapore"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Teagarden"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Telok Ayer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Telok Ayer Market"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Triumphal arch"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Wayang"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Wrestling"},{"ns":0,"*":"Mount Palmer (Singapore)"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The Stadium","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Malaya-Borneo_Exhibition","byteoffset":2507,"anchor":"The_Stadium"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"General Effect","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Malaya-Borneo_Exhibition","byteoffset":4387,"anchor":"General_Effect"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Malaya-Borneo_Exhibition","byteoffset":6284,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Malaya-Borneo Exhibition","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6741551"}]}}
