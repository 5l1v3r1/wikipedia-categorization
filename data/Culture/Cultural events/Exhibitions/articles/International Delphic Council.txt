The International Delphic Council (IDC) is a charitable, non-governmental organization (NGO), headquartered in Berlin, Germany. It claims to be the highest authority for all matters regarding the Delphic Games of the modern era,  although there is a similar but separate organization, International Delphic Committee, headquartered in Russia. The Delphic Games of the modern era were inspired by the ancient Greece traditional Pythian Games of Delphi as a symbol for peace. The original Games were between artists and ethnic cultural groups. They took place each year preceding to the Olympic Games. The historic Pythian Games in Delphi can be traced as far back as 2,600 years ago. The spiritual leaders formed the Pan-Hellenic to perform wonders, theatre, music, and poetry to praise the god Apollo of wonderful light, the symbol of the Oracle of Delphi. The Pythian Games were one of the four Panhellenic Games, a forerunner of the modern Olympic Games, held every four years at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi.  After the revival of the Olympic Games, art competitions were held from 1912 to 1948 at the initiative of Pierre de Coubertin. Competitions in various forms of art were thematically related exclusively to the sport. Also in the first half of the 20th century, there was a move to revive the Pythian Games at Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos. In 1927, the Delphic Festival was held for the first time, but the revival was then abandoned due to the cost of organizing it. Delphic Festivals are held in the summer in Delphi, focused largely on tourists.  The International Delphic Council (IDC) was founded in 1994. The founder J. Christian B. Kirsch invited people from eighteen nations to Berlin to the founding congress in Schönhausen Palace, aiming to revive the Delphic Games and to provide a forum for worldwide arts and culture. Representative were from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland, United States.     The symbols of the International Delphic Movement imitate the symbols of the Olympics. The flag with the Delphic rings that are connected in a circle like a flower, was designed by Christian Kirsch   and symbolizes the connection of the six Delphic art categories. The first president of the IDC was Ebun A. Oyagbola of Nigeria, the general secretary and founder is J. Christian B. Kirsch of Germany, and the current president is Divina Bautista of Philippines, in office since 2009.     The IDC executive board is elected for two years by the general assembly of the IDC. On the ninth session of the IDC in Jeju, Korea, the current executive board was elected.  The International Delphic Council has "Delphic Ambassadors", including celebrities such as Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Lothar de Maizière (Germany).  The International Delphic Council (IDC) is the co-ordinator and chief executive body of the worldwide Delphic Network. The member countries will establish  national Delphic organisations (council, committee, association, union, etc.) which will coordinate with the IDC to promote and organize the Delphic Games. They receive from the IDC, the confirmation of admission after the official registration in the country.   After 1994, national chapters in Belarus, Germany, Georgia, Greece, China, Japan, Nigeria, Philippines, Russia and the United State were particularly active.  The first regional Youth Delphic Games were held in Georgia, Albania and Russia.  The National Delphic organizations design their own logo, which includes some of the IDC symbols.  In preparation of the national qualifications specially designed logos of these national games, which are endorsed by IDC.   NDC Korea won the bid to host the third Delphic Games 2009 in Jeju. The decision on the venue of the next Delphic Games will be taken by vote of the members of the IDC Board at an extraordinary meeting. The national Delphic organization of the host country together with IDC prepare for holding Delphic Games. This initiative has received greetings from Yehudi Menuhin   and Elena Obraztsova,  among others. The National Delphic organizations of host countries produce after meeting with the IDC thematic posters, brochures, stamps and other products that are dedicated to the Delphic Games and the IDC Congress. IDC and NDC Russia The National Delphic Council of Russia (NDC Russia) held its founding in December 1998, at conference in Kursk, where secretary general of the IDC Christian Kirsch participated. 19 March 1999 was NDC Russia at the Ministry of Justice registered, and soon afterwards officially recorded in the International Delphic Council recorded, according to IDC-status. 26 June 2000, the head of NDC Russia V. Ponyavin turned to the secretary general of the IDC C. Kirsch, with the request, the first Delphic Games for adults in Moscow from 1 to 10 December 2000 let to hold.  This request was granted. Later, however, the Russian NDC split off from the International Delphic Council. Today, various Russian websites and Pressa claim, the Delphic idea was originated by the Russians in 2000.
