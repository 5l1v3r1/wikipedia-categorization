Men's Fashion Week is an event usually held twice a year in major cities around the globe, typically in January (Autumn/Winter) and June (Spring/Summer).  The fashion industry event is held for fashion professionals and fashion occult. It is an event for designers and brands to showcase upcoming collections to press, media, stylists, buyers, fashion trailblazers and, in some cases, the public. In January 2012, London  announced that it would dedicate an entire weekend to menswear fashion designers.  Singapore dedicated a few days to men's shows.  Los Angeles followed suit launching Men's Fashion Week LA in 2012.  Additionally, both Vancouver and Toronto hold a Men's Fashion Week - respectively.
