"For vår jord" ("For our earth") was the Norwegian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988, performed in Norwegian by Karoline Krüger. The song is an environmentally-themed ballad, with Krüger describing a woman who is "standing guard for our earth". The character is described as being something of an outcast due to her beliefs, however the lyrics suggest that the woman's realisation of the need to protect the earth is something which should be shared more broadly. The song was performed fifteenth on the night, following Greece's Afroditi Frida with "Clown" and preceding Belgium's Reynaert with "Laissez briller le soleil". Among the backing singers supporting her was Tor Endresen, who would later represent Norway nine years later. At the close of voting, it had received 88 points, placing 5th in a field of 21. It was succeeded as Norwegian representative at the 1989 contest by Britt Synnøve with "Venners nærhet".
