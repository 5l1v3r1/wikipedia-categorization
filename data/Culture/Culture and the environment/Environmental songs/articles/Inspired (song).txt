"Inspired" is a country ballad that lasts three minutes and 21 seconds.    It is composed in the key of G major using common time and an tempo of 104 beats per minute.  Maeve McDermott of USA Today wrote that it is given "the full string-quartet treatment".  Cyrus' vocal range is between the low note of G3 to the high note of C5.  Zachariah Porter of Billboard described her voice as "raspy".  John Norris, writing for Billboard, described the final version of "Inspired" as having a "fuller, more layered arrangement" than the  "spare" demo he heard when visiting Cyrus in April 2017.  Music critics called "Inspired" Cyrus' return to her country music roots,    after recording hip hop music.  Some commentators felt she adopted a flower child persona for the track.   Entertainment Weekly's Eric King viewed the song as a "backroad, fiddle-prone ballad",  while Norris wrote that it has a similar sentimentality to "Malibu".  Cyrus based "Inspired" on Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential campaign.  Inspired by her experience being caught in the traffic of a funeral procession,  she wrote it a week prior to campaigning for Clinton.  John Norris felt that the lyrics ("We are meant for more/ With a handle on the door/ That opens up for change") were intended to celebrate Clinton winning the 2016 United States presidential election.  Cyrus also dedicated "Inspired" to her father Billy Ray Cyrus,  singing about growing up in Tennessee.  She said she wrote the track for her father and Clinton, explaining: "I wrote this song for you, and the reason I thought you would like it is because I always imagined you with your dad, when I wrote about me and my dad playing in the creek."  "Inspired" begins with Cyrus' concerns for the environment.   She also sings about love, death, and making a difference in the world.  The opening lyrics are: "I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see, starting with the bees, or else they're gonna die."  She talks about the past and future: "Death is life, it's not a curse / Reminds us of time and what it's worth."  For the chorus, Cyrus encourages the listener to be open to change.  The song ends with the line: "Is anyone watching us down here?"  "Inspired" received positive critical responses for its composition.    Comparing the song to music by Loretta Lynn and Emmylou Harris, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound highlighted its instrumental and Cyrus' vocals.  NME's Leonie Cooper praised it as "delicate [and] fiddle-laced".  The song's inspirational message was positively received by critics.    Bustle's Dana Getz referred to "Inspired" as "simple but potent" and appropriate for the divisive political climate in the United States.  Referring to it as a gay anthem, Zachariah Porter commended Cyrus for releasing a song about LGBT equality and self-confidence.  Cillea Houghton of Taste Of Country described "Inspired" as a cute dedication to her father.  Some critics questioned whether "Inspired" is sincere.    Even though he praised her voice, Tom Breihan of Stereogum panned the song as a "total wet noodle". He found the singer's career change to be "absolutely forced and cynical".  Despite highlighting Cyrus' "soaring harmonies", Maeve McDermott felt the lyrics were a vague word salad.  Anna Gaca of Spin wrote that the song veers dangerously close to being "a sappy daddy-daughter duet". She panned it as sounding like a filler track for a Christian pop album, and classified Halsey's duet with Lauren Jauregui for the 2017 single "Strangers" as the superior LGBT anthem.  Commercially, "Inspired" reached number 152 on the French SNEP singles chart for one week.  It debuted and peaked at number 97 on the Australian ARIA chart.  The single reached number 450 on the Russian Tophit chart.  Cyrus promoted the track with several live performances. She first performed "Inspired" on May 26, 2017, during an episode of Today.
