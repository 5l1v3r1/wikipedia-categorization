 "Aux arbres citoyens" is a 2007 song recorded by French singer Yannick Noah. It was his second single from his successful album Charango, on which it features as third track, and his 12th single overall. Released on February 2007, the song became a hit in France, where it was Noah's first number-one hit, and in Belgium (Wallonia). The song was written and the music composed by Christophe Battaglia and Cyril Tarquiny. The title refers to the line Aux armes, citoyens! in the chorus of La Marseillaise but the words 'aux armes' ('to arms') are replaced by 'aux arbres' ('to the trees'), because the song deals with an ecological theme, explaining in the lyrics the need to mobilize to find solutions. The music video was produced as an animated feature and illustrates the lyrics. The song was included on many French compilations, such as Hit Connection - Best of 2007, NRJ Summer Hits Only 2007, Été 2007 and M6 Hits. On  French TV show La Chanson de l'année, hosted by Flavie Flament on TF1 on June 1, 2007, "Aux arbres citoyens" was awarded "Song of the Year" thanks to an exclusive poll directed by the IFOP,  among about 50 songs released in 2007.  In France, the single went straight to number-one on February 17, 2007, and stayed there for three weeks. It totaled 12 weeks in the top ten and 20 weeks in the top 50. It fell off the chart (top 100) after 26 weeks  and is currently Noah's fourth biggest hit in France, behind "La Voix des Sages (No More Fighting)", "Saga Africa (ambiance secousse)" and "Simon Papa Tara".  The single entered the Belgian chart at #28 on February 17, 2007, climbed regularly and finally peaked at #2 in its eighth and ninth week. It stayed for 12 weeks in the top ten and 26 weeks on the chart, becoming Noah's second longest chart trajectory for one of his singles in Belgium (Wallonia).
