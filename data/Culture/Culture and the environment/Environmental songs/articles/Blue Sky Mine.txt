 "Blue Sky Mine" is a song by Australian rock band Midnight Oil released in 1990 as the first single from their album Blue Sky Mining. It peaked at No. 7 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart, No. 8 on the Australian Singles Chart and Norwegian Singles Chart, No. 25 on the French Singles Chart, No. 66 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 47 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 on both the Billboard Album Rock and Modern Rock charts. It charted the highest in New Zealand, where it reached No. 2 for two weeks behind "Don't Make Me Over" by Sybil. The song was inspired by the experiences of workers at the Wittenoom asbestos mines who contracted various asbestos-related diseases.    The "blue" refers to blue asbestos, and the "sugar refining company" refers to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd (CSR), the owner of the mines.
