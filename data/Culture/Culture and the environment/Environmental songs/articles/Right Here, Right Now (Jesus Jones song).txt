 "Right Here, Right Now" is a song by British alternative dance band Jesus Jones from the album, Doubt. It was released as the album's second single in September 1990 (approximately four months before the release of Doubt). Despite spending only nine nonconsecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at number 31, it became a top ten hit in the United States; it topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1991, only behind "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" by Bryan Adams.   The single sold over 1 million copies, won a BMI award, and was the song most performed on college radio in 1991.  The song was inspired by events in Europe of the late 1980s, particularly Perestroika in Russia;   Mike Edwards has since noted some of the lyrics were influenced by the band's experiences playing in Romania in February 1990 right after the overthrow of Ceau≈üescu.  The official video for the song shows the band performing on stage mixed with various images from contemporary political events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, and brief snippets of news footage of the collapse of the Soviet Union and speeches by American and Russian leaders.
