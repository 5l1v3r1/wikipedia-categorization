 "Supernature" is the title track of Cerrone's 1977 album, Supernature (Cerrone III). Along with the tracks "Give Me Love" and "Love is Here", the song reached number one on the US disco/dance charts early in 1978.  The single crossed over to both the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 70, and the soul charts, where it peaked at number 72.  In August 1978, it peaked at number 8 in the UK Singles Chart after heavy use in the first series of The Kenny Everett Video Show. The lyrics were written by a young Lene Lovich, though she was not credited.  The song has an environmental theme, imagining a future in which the use of artificial chemicals in agriculture has caused "creatures down below" to emerge and "take their sweet revenge" against mankind. It was covered by Erasure in 1989, released with their single "You Surround Me". It was also covered by The Time Frequency in 1994 for their debut album, Dominator. The band Goldfrapp named their third studio album after the song.    1 J. Garraud & D. Tenaglia Mixes
