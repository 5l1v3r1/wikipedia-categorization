The novel is told from the point of view of Sarat Chestnut and her nephew Benjamin Chestnut.\n</p><p>Sarat, six years old when the war breaks out, lives with her family on the climate change-ravaged coast of <a href=\"/wiki/Louisiana\" title=\"Louisiana\">Louisiana</a>. Her family consists of her parents Benjamin and Martina, her older brother Simon, and her fraternal twin Dana Chestnut. After Sarat's father is killed during a <a href=\"/wiki/Suicide_bombing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Suicide bombing\">\"homicide bombing\"</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Baton_Rouge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Baton Rouge\">Baton Rouge</a> in 2075, Sarat and her family relocate to a refugee camp called \"Camp Patience\" on the Mississippi&#8211;<a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee\" title=\"Tennessee\">Tennessee</a> border.\n</p><p>Sarat and her family spend the next six years eking out a squalid existence at Camp Patience. At the age of twelve in 2081, Sarat is befriended by the charismatic Albert Gaines, who is a recruiter for the Southern rebels. Gaines introduces her to an agent of the emerging Bouazizi Empire named Joe, who is channelling aid to the Free Southern States in order to keep the United States weak and divided. Later, a Northern militia unit attacks Camp Patience and massacres many of the refugees, killing her mother and wounding her brother. Overcome by grief and rage, Sarat kills a Northern militia man.\n</p><p>Following the Camp Patience massacre, Sarat and her siblings are resettled by the Free Southern government in Lincolnton, Georgia on the border with South Carolina. The two sisters are joined by their older brother Simon, who is suffering from a bullet still lodged in his brain. Five years later, in 2086, the Chestnut siblings have settled down to their new lives. While Sarat has become a member of Gaines' rebel group, the broken Simon is tended by a <a href=\"/wiki/Bangladeshi_Americans\" title=\"Bangladeshi Americans\">Bangladeshi American</a> woman named Karina. As time passes, Simon and Karina develop romantic feelings for each other.\n</p><p>During a guerrilla operation near a United States base along the Georgia-Tennessee border, Sarat assassinates General Joseph Weiland, a prominent US commander. While Sarat is hailed as a hero by the Free Southern States, Weiland's assassination only hardens the US resolve to end the Southern insurgency; leading to a crackdown against the Southern guerrillas. Sarat eventually grows disillusioned with the corrupt and self-serving Southern leadership. Later, Dana is killed when a rogue <a href=\"/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle\" title=\"Unmanned aerial vehicle\">drone</a> bombs a bus that she was traveling in.\n</p><p>Sarat is later captured by US forces who imprison her at the <a href=\"/wiki/Sugarloaf_Mountain_(Florida)\" title=\"Sugarloaf Mountain (Florida)\">Sugarloaf Detention Facility</a> in the Florida Sea. Sarat learns that her mentor Gaines betrayed her to the US. For the next seven years, Sarat is repeatedly tortured including being subjected to <a href=\"/wiki/Water_boarding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Water boarding\">water boarding</a>. To end the torment, Sarat confesses to several trumped-up charges. Sarat is later released after the United States government deems Gaines an unreliable source.\n</p><p>Years later, Simon has married Karina, who has produced a son named Benjamin.  In 2095, the six-year-old Benjamin meets his aunt Sarat, who settles down on Benjamin's homestead. Sarat is later visited by one of her former rebel comrades, who informs her that his group has captured Bud Baker, one of her former Sugarloaf captors who drowned her. Sarat kills Bud but decides to spare his family after discovering that he has two teenage twin sons.\n</p><p>Back at Benjamin's household, tensions between Sarat and her brother's wife Karina rise after Benjamin sustains a broken arm and Sarat binds it with a crude prosthetic. Benjamin realizes that his aunt is still haunted by her childhood at Camp Patience. As his arm recovers, Benjamin becomes friendly with his aunt.\n</p><p>Sarat is later visited by the Bouazizi agent Joe who recruits her into carrying a deadly virus into the Reunification Ceremony in <a href=\"/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio\" title=\"Columbus, Ohio\">Columbus, Ohio</a>. Joe reveals that his real name is Yousef Bin Rashid and that the Bouazizi Empire wants to prevent the re-emergence of the United States as a <a href=\"/wiki/Superpower\" title=\"Superpower\">superpower</a>. Seeking revenge against the US government, Sarat accepts the offer and convinces her former rebel comrades to secure her passage to the Reunification Ceremony. Before leaving, Sarat visits the crippled Gaines, but leaves without killing him. She also arranges for her associates to smuggle her nephew Benjamin to safety in New <a href=\"/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska\" title=\"Anchorage, Alaska\">Anchorage</a>. Meanwhile, Sarat infiltrates the Reunification Ceremony. The resulting \"Reunification Plague\" kills 110 million people, devastating the already war-torn country.\n</p><p>The orphaned Benjamin settles to his new life in New Anchorage and becomes a respected historian. Decades later, Benjamin discovers his aunt's diaries and learns of her experiences during the Second American Civil War and her role in the Reunification Plague. To spite his aunt, Benjamin burns her diaries but keeps one page as a memento.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Setting\">Setting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=American_War_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Setting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Much of the novel is set in the \"Free Southern States\" which is originally made up of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. The United States is split between the Southern State and the remaining northern and western states; near the outset of the war, <a href=\"/wiki/Mexican_Cession\" title=\"Mexican Cession\">Mexico annexed or occupied</a> large portions of California, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada and Texas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Other secessionist movements are mentioned: Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and parts of Canada are in talks to form <a href=\"/wiki/Cascadia_(independence_movement)\" title=\"Cascadia (independence movement)\">Cascadia</a>. The novel is interspersed with several \"in-universe\" historical documents, interviews, and media reports.\n</p><p>The \"Second American Civil War\" lasts between 2074 and 2095. The conflict was precipitated by the assassination of President Ki during a suicide bombing attack in 2073 and the shooting of Southern protesters outside <a href=\"/wiki/Fort_Jackson_(South_Carolina)\" title=\"Fort Jackson (South Carolina)\">Fort Jackson</a> in South Carolina in 2074. After five years of conventional warfare around the borders of the Free Southern States, rebel \"insurrectionists\" wage a guerrilla warfare against US forces. Following a protracted negotiation process, the war is settled in the United States' favor. However, a \"secessionist terrorist\" (later revealed to be the protagonist Sarat) releases a biological agent known as the \"Reunification Plague\" during the Reunification Day Ceremony, which kills 110 million in a nationwide epidemic. Refugees flee to New Anchorage as the country begins the long process of \"reconstruction.\" The Reunification Plague is also revealed to be the result of a failed attempt by the virologist Gerry Tusk to find a cure to \"the Slow.\"\n</p><p>The rest of the world has also seen geopolitical change. After multiple failed revolutions the states of Northern Africa and portions of the Arab world and Central Asia have united as the Bouazizi Empire, with their capital in <a href=\"/wiki/Cairo\" title=\"Cairo\">Cairo</a>. China and the Bouazizi nations have emerged as the world's dominant economies and the <a href=\"/wiki/European_migrant_crisis\" title=\"European migrant crisis\">European migrant crisis</a> has reversed, with refugees from the collapsed <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a> states fleeing across the Mediterranean to North Africa. In a reversal of great power politics, China and the Bouazizi Empire send aid to the war-torn United States. The Bouazizi Empire also channels funding to the Free Southern States in an attempt to destabilize the US, which it regards as a rival to its imperial ambitions. Russia is said to have undertaken a period of aggressive expansion and has been renamed the Russian Union.\n</p><p>Climate change has also had a significant impact on the world. <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a> has been inundated by <a href=\"/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" title=\"Sea level rise\">rising sea levels</a>, only existing as a small archipelago.

The Arabian Peninsula is too hot to support life, instead being devoted to solar power production.
