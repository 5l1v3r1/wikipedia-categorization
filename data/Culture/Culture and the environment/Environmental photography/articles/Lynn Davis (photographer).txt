Lynn Davis is an American photographer known for her large-scale black-and-white photographs which are widely collected publicly and privately and are internationally exhibited. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1944, Davis studied at University of Colorado between 1962–1964, and at the University of Minnesota from 1964–1966.  She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1970, and in 1974 she began her career as an apprentice to Berenice Abbott.  Davis' first exhibition hung at the International Center of Photography (New York City) in 1979,  alongside her close friend Robert Mapplethorpe.  After her first trip to Greenland, in 1986, she gave up photographing the human form, shifting her lens toward the monumental landscapes and cultural/architectural icons for which she is renowned. Davis is represented by Edwynn Houk Gallery in New York, and the Galerie Karsten Greve in Europe. She lives in Hudson, New York with her husband, writer Rudy Wurlitzer.  Her prints appear in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, among others.  In 1999, the J. Paul Getty Museum held an exhibition of Davis' prints, and a solo show, Africa, was held at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson in 1999.
