As Aristotle says about stable governing system that, \u201ca state aims at being, as far as it can be, a society composed of equal &amp; peers\u201d. For the stability of democratic regimes, there must be social homogeneity and political consensus among the deep social divisions, and, there must be termination of political differences. There are these criteria, because, the factors that help in producing instability and breakdown of democracies.\nArend Lijphart, therefore, used a particular form of democracy, \u201cConsociational Democracy\u201d, which is, according to him, may be difficult but it is not at all impossible to achieve and maintain stable democratic government in plural societies.\n</p><p>Consociational democracy can be characterized by the cooperative attitude and behavior of the leaders of the different segments of the population. In other meanings, there will be elite cooperation. This model of Consociational democracy is both, normative and an empirical. In Austria, Belgium, Netherland and Switzerland, there are sharp political divisions, but due to Consoiciational democracy, there is existence of political stability. In Austria, political stability can be observed in the forms of Catholic-Socialist elite cooperation and grand coalition.\n</p><p>In non-Western countries, as Arend Lijphart highlights twin problems, and there are, sharp cleavages of various kind and political stability. For the successful democratic regimes in the third world, due to plural societies, Consociational democracy is based, also on normative model. A Plural society is a society, divided by segmental cleavages, and, political stability is characterized by system maintenance, legitimacy, civil order and effectiveness. Without these four elements, which are also interdependent, political stability cannot exist. According to Gabriel Almond, there are four types of political systems;\n</p><p>1)\tAnglo-American Political System\n2)\tContinental European Political System\n3)\tPre-Industrial Political System\n4)\tTotalitarian Political System.\n</p><p>He says that Anglo-American and Continental European Political systems show democratic regimes. The Anglo-American political system is a homogenous and secular political system, while the Continental European political system is characterized by a fragmentation of political culture due to plural societies within European countries.\n</p><p>According to Gabriel Almond, Separation of power doctrine is also concerned with political stability. He extends the idea of \u201cseparation of power\u201d from three formal branches of government, executives and legislature, to informal political subcultures like parties, interest groups and the media of communication. He much more emphasizes on input structures than the output structures.\n</p><p>Duverger and Neumann argue that there is a close relationship between the number of parties and democratic stability, but a two party system not only seems to correspond to the nature of things because it can moderate better than multiparty systems. In other words, a two party system is the best aggregation. In Switzerland, there is a multiparty system, while in Austria, there is a two party system.\n</p><p>Arend Lijphart says that there are deep divisions between different segments of the population and absence of a unifying consensus in most of the Asian, African and South American countries like Guyana, Surinam and Trinidad. According to Cliffard Geertz, Communal attachment is called \u201cprimordial loyalties\u201d, which may be based on language, religion, custom, region, race or assumed blood ties. Each communal group hold its assumed ties, therefore there is political instability and breakdown of democracy up until now.\n</p><p>He argues that due to political development, western countries have created homogeneity among their plural societies, as like idealize British society. But Gabriel Almond says that, in Continental European political system, there is no secularism and political homogeneity, but there is cultural homogeneity. He argues that, non-western countries would become more comprehensive and less remote they use this continental type, which is based on a multi-racial (multi-national) society and lacking in strong consensus.\n</p><p>Furnivall says that democracy is achieved by the European countries with the help of Consociationalism, and, there is fulfillment of the requirements and demands of the divided societies through appropriate processes. On the other hand, in non-western countries, there is lack of strength in social will and social unity due to divided society, and, it is dangerous for both, the democracy and a considerable degree of political unity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Consociational_Democracy_and_the_Segments_of_Plural_Society\">Consociational Democracy and the Segments of Plural Society</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plural_society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Consociational Democracy and the Segments of Plural Society\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As Arend Lijhpart argues that there is constitutionalization for the segments of plural societies, and its better solution is consociational or semi-consociational democratic system. This system provides the facility of Mutual Veto regarding the decision making process on the specific issues within the country, to all the segments of society with equality. but Arend Lijhpart highlights Malaysia and Lebanon for its perfect example. In Lebanon, there are Shia's and Sunni's in the Muslim Segment while Christians are in the minority. Similarly in Malaysia, there are Chinese with local Communities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plural_society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Ethnic_group\" title=\"Ethnic group\">Ethnic group</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Multiculturalism\" title=\"Multiculturalism\">Multiculturalism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Polyethnicity\" title=\"Polyethnicity\">Polyethnicity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Pluralism_(disambiguation)\" class=\"mw-redirect mw-disambig\" title=\"Pluralism (disambiguation)\">Pluralism (disambiguation)</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plural_society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Rabushka, A. and K.
