After WWII, through <a href=\"/wiki/Westernization\" title=\"Westernization\">westernization</a> and the influence of <a href=\"/wiki/Missionary\" title=\"Missionary\">missionaries</a> traditional practices including <i>Pwo</i> started to be abandoned.  <a href=\"/wiki/Mau_Piailug\" title=\"Mau Piailug\">Mau Piailug</a>, famous for helping <a href=\"/wiki/Native_Hawaiians\" title=\"Native Hawaiians\">Hawaiians</a> regain their traditional navigation skills, was the last person to go through <i>Pwo</i>, in 1951.  For thirty-nine years, the ceremony lay dormant.  Then, in May 1990, <i>Pwo</i> again took place.  This time Urupiy, a master navigator, with help of an American documentary <a href=\"/wiki/Anthropology\" title=\"Anthropology\">anthropologist</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Eric_Metzgar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Eric Metzgar (page does not exist)\">Eric Metzgar</a>, conducted the <i>Pwo</i> for his son and four other students on the island of <a href=\"/wiki/Lamotrek\" title=\"Lamotrek\">Lamotrek</a>.  This event was subsequently made into the film <i>Spirits of the Voyage</i>.\n</p><p>On March 18, 2007, Piailug presided over the first Pwo ceremony for navigators on the island of <a href=\"/wiki/Satawal\" title=\"Satawal\">Satawal</a> in 56 years. At the event five native Hawaiians and eleven others were inducted into Pwo as master navigators.
