One early textual record is the c. 499 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Zhen%27gao\" title=\"Zhen&#39;gao\">Zhen'gao</a></i> saying that Xu Mi (\u8a31\u8c27, 303-376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57). \n</p><p>These communal <i>chu</i> Kitchen banquets have a pre-Daoist antecedent in popular <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion\" title=\"Chinese folk religion\">Chinese folk religion</a>: the term <i>chu</i> was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tudigong#Names\" title=\"Tudigong\">she</a></i> (\u793e, God of the Soil). Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these <i>chuhui</i> (\u5eda\u6703, \"cuisine congregations\") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279). <i>Chu</i> kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the <i>zh\u0101i</i> (\u9f4b, \"fast; purification; retreat\"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions. The 7th-century Daoist <i>Zhaijielu</i> (\u9f4b\u6212\u9304, Records of Fasting) suggested that <i>zhai</i> were anciently called <i>shehui</i> (\u793e\u6703, \"festival gatherings of the soil god\"\u2014now the modern Chinese word for \"society\"), which was later changed into <i>zhaihui</i> (\u9f4b\u6703) (Stein 1979: 75).\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Way_of_the_Celestial_Masters\" title=\"Way of the Celestial Masters\">Way of the Celestial Masters</a> religion, founded by <a href=\"/wiki/Zhang_Daoling\" title=\"Zhang Daoling\">Zhang Daoling</a> in 142 CE, celebrated <i>chu</i> kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual <i>sanhui</i> (\u4e09\u6703, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated. Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a <i>chu</i> feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means. Accounts of these banquets \"emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community\" (Kleeman 2008: 839-840).\n</p><p>The <i>chu</i> sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating. For the birth of a boy, the <i>shangchu</i> (\u4e0a\u5eda, Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of <a href=\"/wiki/Ink_brushes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ink brushes\">ink brushes</a>, an <a href=\"/wiki/Inkstick\" title=\"Inkstick\">inkstick</a>, and an ink scraper. For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive <i>zhongchu</i> (\u4e2d\u5eda, Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom. For the death of a family member, the <i>xiachu</i> (\u4e0b\u5eda, Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called <i>jiechu</i> (\u89e3\u5eda, Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a \"great orgy\" (Maspero 1981: 290). \n</p><p>The anti-Daoist <i>Erjiaolun</i> (\u4e8c\u6559\u8ad6, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk <a href=\"/wiki/Dao%27an\" title=\"Dao&#39;an\">Dao'an</a> (312\u2013385) said <i>chu</i> kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about <i>ji\u011bch\u00fa</i> (\u89e3\u9664, \"liberation and elimination\") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71). The parallel passage in the 6th-century <i>Bianhuolun</i> (\u8faf\u60d1\u8ad6, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous <a href=\"/wiki/Variant_Chinese_character\" title=\"Variant Chinese character\">graphic variant</a> of <i>ji\u011bch\u00fa</i> (\u89e3\u5eda, \"liberation kitchen\"), thus connecting both <i>ch\u00fa</i> \"kitchen\" and <i>ch\u00fa</i> \"liberation\" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74).\n</p><p>Daoist sources record that the people invited to a <i>chu</i> Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex. Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days. Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279). For the Superior Kitchens five <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_units_of_measurement#Volume\" title=\"Chinese units of measurement\">sheng</a></i> of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four <i>sheng</i>, and for the Inferior Kitchen three. The participants \"must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk.\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual. \n</p><p>Besides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, <i>chu</i> Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution. They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279). Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual <i>jiao</i> (\u91ae, \"offerings\") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received. An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34-35).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Hong\" title=\"Ge Hong\">Ge Hong</a>'s c. 318 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baopuzi\" title=\"Baopuzi\">Baopuzi</a></i> (see below) mentions profligately expensive <i>chu</i> Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox <i>yaodao</i> (\u5996\u9053, \"demonic cults\"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the undefined term <i>Lijia dao</i> (\u674e\u5bb6\u9053, \"religion of the adepts of Li\") (Stein 1979: 56). The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (\u674e\u5bec) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance. \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [\u8af8\u5996\u9053\u767e\u9918\u7a2e] all call for slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk. Only the doctrine of the Lis [\u674e\u5bb6\u9053] is slightly different. Yet, though it does no butchering, whenever its \"good-luck food\" is served [\u6bcf\u4f9b\u798f\u98df], it includes varieties of mixtures without limit. In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, and the rarest things must be purchased. Several dozen may work in the kitchen [\u6216\u6578\u5341\u4eba\u5eda], and costs for food can run high indeed. In tum, these are not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with things to be forbidden. (tr.

Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a <i>xingchu</i> banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46-47).\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Jin_Dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)\">Jin Dynasty</a> Daoist scholar <a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Hong\" title=\"Ge Hong\">Ge Hong</a> compiled the two primary sources of information about <i>xingchu</i> Mobile Kitchens, the <i>Baopuzi</i> and <i>Shenxian zhuan</i>.

Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous <a href=\"/wiki/Toxic_heavy_metal\" title=\"Toxic heavy metal\">toxic heavy metal</a> ingredients. The <i>Baopuzi</i> uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: <i>zh\u00ec</i> (\u81f3, \"arrive at; reach; come\") and <i>zh\u00ec</i> (\u81f4, \"cause to arrive at; get to; come to\"). The other two <i>xingchu</i> usages are in proper names of a Daoist <a href=\"/wiki/Fulu\" title=\"Fulu\">amulet</a> and book, the <i>Xingchu fu</i> (\u884c\u5eda\u7b26, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the <i>Xingchu jing</i> (\u884c\u5eda\u7d93, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen). The <i>Baopuzi</i> also lists another book titled <i>Riyue chushi jing</i> (\u65e5\u6708\u5eda\u98df\u7d93, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381).\n</p><p>Three of the seven <i>Baopuzi</i> elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant <i>xian</i> transcendence, including the ability to summon <i>xingchu</i>, and short-term consumption provides a panacea\u2014specifically for eliminating the <a href=\"/wiki/Three_Corpses\" title=\"Three Corpses\">Three Corpses</a> or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Three_Corpses#Baopuzi\" title=\"Three Corpses\">Nine Worms</a> or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites. First, the <i>Xian Menzi dan</i> (\u7fa1\u9580\u5b50\u4e39, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar. \"After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [\u53ef\u5f79\u4f7f\u81f4\u884c\u5eda].\" (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290). Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, \"In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated. After a thousand days, fairies [translating <i>yunu</i> \u7389\u5973 Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [\u4ee5\u81f4\u884c\u5eda].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 188). Third, consuming pure, unadulterated <a href=\"/wiki/Lacquer#Urushiol-based_lacquers\" title=\"Lacquer\">lacquer</a> will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life. When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, \"The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds. After a year, the six-<i>chia</i> gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [\u4e00\u5e74\u516d\u7532\u884c\u5eda\u81f3\u4e5f].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 190). This <i>liujia</i> (\u516d\u7532, Six <i><a href=\"/wiki/Celestial_stem#Table\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Celestial stem\">Jia</a></i> Gods) and the <i>liuyin</i> (\u516d\u9670, Six Yin) below refer to <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_astrology\" title=\"Chinese astrology\">astrological</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Qimen_Dunjia\" title=\"Qimen Dunjia\">Dunjia</a> divination. An alternate translation is \"the six <i>jia</i> and the traveling canteen will arrive\" (Campany 2002: 75),\n</p><p>The remaining four <i>Baopuzi</i> formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs. Fourth, the <i>Jiuguang dan</i> (\u4e5d\u5149\u4e39, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the <i>wushi</i> (\u4e94\u77f3, Five Minerals, see <a href=\"/wiki/Cold-Food_Powder\" title=\"Cold-Food Powder\">Cold-Food Powder</a>), i.e., <a href=\"/wiki/Cinnabar\" title=\"Cinnabar\">cinnabar</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Realgar\" title=\"Realgar\">realgar</a>, purified <a href=\"/wiki/Potassium_alum\" title=\"Potassium alum\">potassium alum</a>, laminar <a href=\"/wiki/Malachite\" title=\"Malachite\">malachite</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetite\" title=\"Magnetite\">magnetite</a> (Needham et al. 1976: 86). Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person. \"If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [\u6b32\u81f4\u884c\u5eda], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort. You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world.\" (tr. Ware 1966: 82-83, noting \"fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade\"). Fifth, the <i>Baopuzi</i> quotes from <i>Shennong sijing</i> (\u795e\u8fb2\u56db\u7d93, <a href=\"/wiki/Shennong\" title=\"Shennong\">Shennong</a>'s Four Classics), \"Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service. Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [\u884c\u5eda\u7acb\u81f3].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 177). Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (\u52d9\u6210\u5b50) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills. Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, \"the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them.\" And, \"If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [\u884c\u5eda\u7389\u5973\u7acb\u81f3], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals.\" (16, tr. Ware 1966: 276). Seventh, Liu Gen (\u5289\u6839, or Liu Jun'an \u5289\u541b\u5b89), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author <a href=\"/wiki/Liu_An\" title=\"Liu An\">Liu An</a> (\u5289\u5b89, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the <a href=\"/wiki/Mohist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mohist\">Mohist</a> founder <a href=\"/wiki/Mozi\" title=\"Mozi\">Mozi</a>, the <i>Mozi wuxing ji</i> (\u58a8\u5b50\u4e94\u884c\u8a18, Master Mo's Records of the <a href=\"/wiki/Wu_Xing\" title=\"Wu Xing\">Five Phases</a>), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, \"By grasping a pole he becomes a tree. He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit. He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill. He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [\u5750\u81f4\u884c\u5eda].\" (19, tr.

Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical <i>shijie</i> liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days. \"Suddenly he had vanished.

The passage about Liu Jing says,\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Later he served Ji Zixun [\u858a\u5b50\u8a13, i.e., Ji Liao \u858a\u907c] as his teacher. Zixun transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the <a href=\"/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors\" title=\"Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors\">Five Thearchs</a>, Numinous Flight (<i>lingfei</i>, \u9748\u98db), the six <i>jia</i> spirits, the Twelve Matters (<i>shier shi</i> \u5341\u4e8c\u4e8b), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang \u795e\u4ed9\u5341\u6d32\u771f\u5f62). Liu Jing practiced them all according to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious. He could summon ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the traveling canteen to arrive [\u540d\u81f4\u884c\u5eda], and appear and disappear at will. He also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs and of particular days. (tr.

Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted.\" So he studied arts of the Dao. He understood particularly well [how to summon] the six <i>jia</i> spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit down and call for the traveling canteen [\u5750\u81f4\u884c\u5eda]. (tr.

He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge. Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [\u751f\u81f4\u884c\u5eda], setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people.

After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent. The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said,\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply appreciate your intention. But please come empty-handed; you need not make any expenditure. I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all.\" On the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held. Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were spread out beneath them. Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up and arrayed. Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be heard from several <i>li</i> away. Of the more than one thousand guests present that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr.

In Chinese cosmological <a href=\"/wiki/Wu_Xing\" title=\"Wu Xing\">wuxing</a> Five Phases correspondence theory, the <i>wuchu</i> Five Kitchens or <i>wuzang</i> (\u4e94\u81df, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41-42). The 735 <i>Wuchu jing</i> (\u4e94\u5eda\u7d93, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating <i><a href=\"/wiki/Qi\" title=\"Qi\">qi</a></i> energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric <i>S\u0101nch\u00fa j\u012bng</i> (\u4e09\u5eda\u7d93, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051).\n</p><p>There are two extant editions of <i>Wuchu jing</i> (translated by Kohn 2010: 198-206). First, the 763 Tang <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daozang\" title=\"Daozang\">Daozang</a></i> (Daoist Canon) edition titled <i>Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu</i> (\u8001\u5b50\u8aaa\u4e94\u5eda\u7d93, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by <a href=\"/wiki/Laozi\" title=\"Laozi\">Laozi</a>) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (\u5c39\u6114, d. 741). The <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_people_with_reduplicated_names\" title=\"List of people with reduplicated names\">reduplicatedly named</a> Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang\" title=\"Emperor Xuanzong of Tang\">Emperor Xuanzong of Tang</a> (r. 712-756), and abbot of the Suming guan (\u8085\u660e\u89c0, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital <a href=\"/wiki/Chang%27an\" title=\"Chang&#39;an\">Chang'an</a>. The late Tang <a href=\"/wiki/Way_of_the_Celestial_Masters\" title=\"Way of the Celestial Masters\">Celestial Master</a> Zhao Xianfu (\u8d99\u4ed9\u752b, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351). Second, the 1019 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Yunji_Qiqian\" title=\"Yunji Qiqian\">Yunji Qiqian</a></i> (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled <i>Wuchu jing qifa</i> (\u4e94\u5eda\u7d93\u6c23\u6cd5, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351). The <i>qi</i> \"energetic\" methods of the text are recommended by <a href=\"/wiki/Zuowanglun#Author\" title=\"Zuowanglun\">Sima Chengzhen</a> (\u53f8\u99ac\u627f\u798e, 647\u2013735) in his <i>Fuqi jingyi lun</i> (\u670d\u6c23\u7cbe\u7fa9\u8ad6, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051). Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the <i>Wuchu jing</i>, the origins of this text may be much earlier. <a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Hong\" title=\"Ge Hong\">Ge Hong</a>'s c. 318 <i>Baopuzi</i> mentions a <i>Xingchu jing</i> (\u884c\u5eda\u7d93, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a <i>Riyue chushi jing</i> (\u65e5\u6708\u5eda\u98df\u7d93, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051). \n</p><p>The c. 905 <i>Daojiao lingyan ji</i> (\u9053\u6559\u9748\u9a57\u8a18, Record of Daoist Miracles, written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official <a href=\"/wiki/Du_Guangting\" title=\"Du Guangting\">Du Guangting</a>, says a <a href=\"/wiki/Bhikkhu\" title=\"Bhikkhu\">Buddhist monk</a> fraudulently transformed the <i>Wuchu jing</i> Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the <i>Sanchu jing</i> (\u4e09\u5eda\u7d93, Sutra of the Three Kitchens). Du records that the <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_Buddhist_canon\" title=\"Chinese Buddhist canon\">Chinese Buddhist canon</a> of the Tang period contained a text titled <i>Fo shuo san tingchu jing</i> (\u4f5b\u8aaa\u4e09\u505c\u5eda\u7d93, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248-249). According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (\u884c\u7aef), who had \"a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition\", saw that the widely-circulated Daoist <i>Wuchu jing</i> consisted of five stanzas (<i>j\u00ec</i> \u5048, \"<i><a href=\"/wiki/Gatha\" title=\"Gatha\">gatha</a></i>; poetic verse; versified utterance\") of incantations (<i>zh\u00f2u</i> \u5492, \"<i><a href=\"/wiki/Mantra\" title=\"Mantra\">mantra</a></i>; religious incantation; mystical invocation\"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into <i>Fo shuo san tingchu jing</i> (\u4f5b\u8aaa\u4e09\u505c\u5eda\u7d93). \"The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by <a href=\"/wiki/Tathagata\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tathagata\">Tathagata</a>,' and at the end he added a hymn. The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page.\" Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its \"Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use\", originated as a late <a href=\"/wiki/Six_Dynasties\" title=\"Six Dynasties\">Six Dynasties</a> (220-589) Tantric <i>zhoujing</i> (\u5492\u7d93, \"incantations scripture\", cf. the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Divine_Incantations_Scripture\" title=\"Divine Incantations Scripture\">Divine Incantations Scripture</a></i>). (1992: 250-51).\n</p><p>Du Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery. One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a \"divine being eight or nine feet tall\" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk. As Xingduan \"wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off\", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes. Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks. Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies. Then the divine being reappears and announces: \"Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save you\u2014you do not deserve to escape death\", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251). \n</p><p>In the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved. Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese <a href=\"/wiki/Dunhuang_manuscripts\" title=\"Dunhuang manuscripts\">Dunhuang manuscripts</a>, two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese <a href=\"/wiki/Koyasan_Reih%C5%8Dkan\" title=\"Koyasan Reih\u014dkan\">Mount K\u014dya</a> manuscripts. In addition, the modern Japanese <a href=\"/wiki/Taish%C5%8D_Tripi%E1%B9%ADaka\" title=\"Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka\">Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka</a> canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26-28).\n</p><p>The highly abstract <i>Wuchu jing</i> mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each. The <i>Yunqi qiqian</i> edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1-4), south (lines 5-8), north (lines 9-12), west (lines 13-16), and center (lines 17-20) (Verellen 2004: 351). For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200-201):\n</p>\n<table role=\"presentation\" style=\"margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em;\">\n\n<tbody><tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<td><div style=\"font-style:roman;text-align:right\" lang=\"zh\" class=\"poem\">\n<p>\u4e00\u6c23\u548c\u6cf0\u548c<br />\n\u5f97\u4e00\u9053\u7686\u6cf0<br />\n\u548c\u4e43\u7121\u4e00\u548c<br />\n\u7384\u7406\u540c\u7384\u969b\n</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"><div class=\"poem\">\n<p>The <i>qi</i> of universal oneness merges with the harmony of cosmic peace. <br />\nAttaining universal oneness, Dao rests in cosmic peace.<br />\nCosmic harmony really is neither universal oneness nor harmony.<br />\nMysterious cosmic order joins the mysterious moment of eternity.\n</p>\n</div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"display: none;\">\n<td>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 2em;\">\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The content of the <i>Wuchu jing</i> guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity. The Five Kitchens refer to <i>neidan</i> Internal Alchemy \"<i>qi</i>-processing on a subtle-body level\", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71). Yin Yin's introduction says,\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>As long as you dwell in the <i>qi</i> of universal oneness [\u4e00\u6c23] and in the harmony of cosmic peace [\u6cf0\u548c], the five organs [\u4e94\u81df] are abundant and full and the five spirits [\u4e94\u795e] are still and upright. \"When the five organs are abundant, all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all cravings and desires are eliminated. This scripture expounds on how the five organs taking in <i>qi</i> is like someone looking for food in a kitchen. Thus, its title: \"Scripture of the Five Kitchens.\" (tr. Kohn 2010: 200) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Commenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating. (Verellen 2004: 352)\n</p><p>Techniques in the <i>Wuchu jing</i> (\u4e94\u5eda\u7d93, Scripture of the Five Kitchens) mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations. These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279-280). Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that \"accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment\" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless. However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that \"you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life.\" More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five <i>qi</i> allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62-63). Many present-day Daoists consider the <i>Wuchu jing</i> as a talismanic text to be chanted for protection (Kohn 2010: 71).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chu_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Bishop, Tom (2016), <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wenlin_Software_for_learning_Chinese\" title=\"Wenlin Software for learning Chinese\">Wenlin Software for learning Chinese</a></i>, version 4.3.2.</li>\n<li>Campany, Robert Ford (2001), \"Ingesting the Marvelous: The Practitioner's Relationship to Nature According to Ge Hong,\" in N.J.
