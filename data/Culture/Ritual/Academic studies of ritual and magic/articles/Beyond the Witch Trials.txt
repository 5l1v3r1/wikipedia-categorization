Beyond the Witch Trials: Witchcraft and Magic in Enlightenment Europe is an academic anthology edited by the historians Owen Davies and Willem de Blécourt. It was first published by Manchester University Press in 2004. Containing ten separate papers by different academics active in the field, the book dealt with the continued practice of magic and the belief in witchcraft in Europe following the end of the Witch trials in the Early Modern period. The same year, Manchester University Press would bring out a companion anthology, also edited by Davies and Blécourt. Entitled Witchcraft Continued: Popular Magic in Modern Europe, it dealt with the period following the Enlightenment. Brian Hoggard, an independent researcher from Worcester, England, authored a paper looking at the subject of Enlightenment-era popular magic from an archaeological perspective. Noting that the only published book dealing with the archaeology of British folk magic was Ralph Merrifield's The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic (1987), he argues that archaeology can provide scholars with evidence of popular magical traditions that were not recorded in the literate sources of the period.
