The Norfolk four-course system is a method of agriculture that involves crop rotation. Unlike other methods such as the three-field system, the Norfolk system is marked by an absence of a fallow year. Instead, four different crops are grown in each year of a four-year cycle: wheat, turnips, barley, and clover or undergrass. It was developed in Norfolk County, England in the 17th century.
