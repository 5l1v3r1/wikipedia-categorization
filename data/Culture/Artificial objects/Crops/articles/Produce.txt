Produce is a generalized term for a group of farm-produced crops and goods, including fruits and vegetables – meats, grains, oats, etc. are also sometimes considered produce. More specifically, the term "produce" often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where they were harvested. In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section where fruit and vegetables are kept. Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers and farmers' markets. The term "produce" is commonly used in the U.S. but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries. In parts of the world including the U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes. These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control in produce markets. Vegetables are optimally stored between 0° and 4.4° Celsius (32° and 40 °F) to reduce respiration. Generally, vegetables should be stored at a high humidity (80 and 95 percent relative humidity), but cucubits (squash family) and onions prefer dry and can mold when moisture is high.  Raw sprouts are among the produce most at risk of bacterial infection.  Rinsing is an effective way to reduce the bacteria count on produce, reducing it to about 10 percent of its previous level.  Wastewater can be a source of contamination, due to contamination of water with fecal matter with salmonella or other bacteria.  After Denmark eliminated salmonella in its chickens, attention has turned to vegetables as a source of illness.   The dictionary definition of produce at Wiktionary
