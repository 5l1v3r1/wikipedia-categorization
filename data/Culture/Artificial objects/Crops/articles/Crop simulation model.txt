A Crop Simulation Model (CSM) is a simulation model that describes processes of crop growth and development as a function of weather conditions, soil conditions, and crop management.      Typically, such models estimate times that specific growth stages are attained, biomass of crop components (e.g., leaves, stems, roots and harvestable products) as they change over time, and similarly, changes in soil moisture and nutrient status. Crop simulation models have been classified into three broad categories:
