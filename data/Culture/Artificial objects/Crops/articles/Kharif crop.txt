Kharif crops or summer crops are domesticated plants that are cultivated and harvested in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh during the summer season, which lasts from June to October depending on the area.  Both Kharif and Rabi words have their origin in Arabic. These came to be used in India with the ascent of the Mughal empire in the Indian subcontinent and have been widely used ever-since. Though Kharif literally means "autumn" in Arabic, since this period coincides with the beginning of autumn in the Indian sub-continent, the monsoonal sowing season is called "Kharif period".  Kharif crops are usually sown with the beginning of the first rains in January, during the south-east monsoon season in parts of India and in Bangladesh. In other parts like Maharashtra, the west coast of India and in Pakistan that see rains in June, kharif crops are sown in May, June and July.   In India, the kharif season varies by crop and state, with kharif starting at the earliest in May and ending at the latest in January, but is popularly considered to start in June and to end in October.
