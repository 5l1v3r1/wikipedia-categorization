Perennial crops are crops developed to reduce inputs necessary to produce food.   By greatly reducing the need to replant crops from year-to-year, perennial cropping can reduce topsoil losses due to erosion,  increase biological carbon sequestration within the soil, and greatly reduce waterway pollution through agricultural runoff.
