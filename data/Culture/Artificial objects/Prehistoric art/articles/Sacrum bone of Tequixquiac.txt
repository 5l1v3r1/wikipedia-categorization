The Sacrum bone of Tequixquiac is an ancient paleo-Indian sculpture carved in a pleistocene-era bone of a prehistoric camel. It was found by Mexican naturalist Mariano BÃ¡rcena in 1870.  It is considered among the earliest pieces of art from the American continent.  A sacrum bone found in Tequixquiac is considered a work of prehistoric art.  These people were nomadic, hunting large animals such as mammoths and gathering fruits as evidenced by archaeological evidence found at the site. One of the most salient discoveries of primitive art in America was found here, called the Sacrum bone of Tequixquiac, which had no purpose but which reflected the ideological sense of the artist who carved the piece of bone from a camelid. This artifact is located in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
