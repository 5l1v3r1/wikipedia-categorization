His attention had been drawn to this record by journalist Dircksey Cowan, daughter of <a href=\"/wiki/Edith_Cowan\" title=\"Edith Cowan\">Edith Cowan</a>. She had been interviewing Burt in regard to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.thsoa.org/pdf/tihr_200809.pdf\">Deadwater Wreck</a>, north of Busselton, which he had also seen in 1876 in company with Captain Archdeacon, while still engaged in the Admiralty survey. The <a href=\"/wiki/Vergulde_Draeck\" title=\"Vergulde Draeck\">Vergulde Draeck</a> had been carrying 78,600 guilders, which went down with the ship, not being recovered until after the wreck was located in 1963. Burt, however, believed the Circle of Stones may have marked the location of a \u2018Treasure Trove\u2019, the specie from the <a href=\"/wiki/Vergulde_Draeck\" title=\"Vergulde Draeck\">Vergulde Draeck</a>, and it would seem that this was his reason for informing the Commissioner of Police.\n</p><p>The Commissioner of Police took no immediate action. However, the discovery by two boys, Fred and Alister Edwards, of 40 coins dating from 1618 to 1655, including Spanish reales, in sandhills north of <a href=\"/wiki/Seabird\" title=\"Seabird\">Seabird</a> early in 1931,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Anon1_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Anon1-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> triggered a frenzy of speculation, mostly relating to the wreck of the <a href=\"/wiki/Vergulde_Draeck\" title=\"Vergulde Draeck\">Vergulde Draeck</a>, and its treasure. Consequently, in May 1931 the police instigated a search for the Ring of Stones. The expedition was led by Constable Sam Loxton from <a href=\"/wiki/Dongara\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dongara\">Dongara</a> and included Burt, local landowner Mr A. R. Downes, and another local, a Mr Parker. Between 8 and 11 May the members of the expedition endeavoured to re-locate the Ring of Stones in the area identified by Burt. However, this part of the coast is dominated by dense scrub, mostly wattle, rocky limestone-strewn ground and steep sand ridges.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Burt1_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Burt1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Burt commented that in places the scrub was so impenetrable that \u201ceven a bullock could not penetrate it.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-Burt1_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Burt1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The expedition failed.

And so in late February 1932 another search was undertaken.\n</p><p>The 1932 expedition was again led by Constable Loxton and included Downes, but not Burt. It had been arranged for local Aboriginal people, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=173\">Yuat</a>, to fire the country prior to the commencement of the expedition. Some of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=173\">Yuat</a> were also recruited to guide the expedition and to burn off parts of the country missed by the earlier fires.

E. Hammond, a friend of Alfred Burt\u2019s, decided that he would endeavour to find the Ring of Stones. It appears that some time in 1937 Hammond spent a fortnight searching, burning \u201cseveral hundred acres of scrub\u201d in the process, without success, before concluding that the Ring had been covered by drifting sand.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Uren_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Uren-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Speculation about the treasure from the <a href=\"/wiki/Vergulde_Draeck\" title=\"Vergulde Draeck\">Vergulde Draeck</a> then re-intensified in March 1938 when it was reported that more old coins had been found by children from the Baramba Assisted School, in the same locality as the Edwards find.<sup id=\"cite_ref-wa1_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wa1-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> However, this appears to have been a rehash of the Edwards find in 1931. Then, in December 1938, Jack Hayes and Gabriel Penney located a Ring of Stones, which they took to be Burt\u2019s Ring of Stones. Their find was reported in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_West_Australian\" title=\"The West Australian\">The West Australian</a></i> on 10 February 1939.<sup id=\"cite_ref-wa2_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wa2-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It appears Penney, a brumby hunter, had come across a stone arrangement around 1931 but had not investigated further at the time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Uren_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Uren-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-wa2_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wa2-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> But then in December 1938 he told Hayes, licensee of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dongaramotel.com.au/\">Dongara Hotel</a>, about it and the two men set out to relocate the site. They drove in a utility to within \u2018about nine miles\u2019 [14.4&#160;km] of the Ring and then made their way on foot. They were \u201cconsiderably hampered by the thorny bush,\u201d but Penney led Hayes to the exact spot. As Hayes described it:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>There were three groups of stones in a cleared area ...

Relying primarily on reports published in newspaper and information in <a href=\"/wiki/Malcolm_Uren\" title=\"Malcolm Uren\">Malcolm Uren</a>\u2019s book, <i>Sailormen\u2019s Ghosts</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Gerritsen, Sheppard and others undertook an initial expedition to relocate the Ring of Stone in April 2004. The area targeted was based on a map published in <i>The Mirror</i> in 1933, the path Burt took in 1875 and the limited positional information provided by Hayes and Penney.\n</p><p>Because the search area was relatively inaccessible, being coastal scrub and heath covering steep relic dunes, two 4-wheel drive vehicles were used. However, owing to the scrubby nature of the terrain, much of which had been burnt in a bushfire in the preceding year or two, staking of the vehicles\u2019 tyres considerably hampered progress. Before the day was out the expedition was forced to retire to the small coastal town of Leeman with every tyre, including spares, staked and in a varying degree of deflation.\n</p><p>Based on this experience Gerritsen concluded that the only viable way to search was on foot. He was about to embark on another expedition in October 2008 when Sheppard was able to source Burt\u2019s original letter, mud-map and relevant reports from police files  archived in the State Records Office of Western Australia. It was evident from these documents that the form, location and size of Burt\u2019s Ring of Stones was distinctly different from the Ring of Stones found by Hayes and Penney. It was realised that two different \u2018Ring of Stones\u2019 had, in fact, been reported.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ros_3.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ros_3.jpg/220px-Ros_3.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"120\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ros_3.jpg/330px-Ros_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ros_3.jpg/440px-Ros_3.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1269\" data-file-height=\"693\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ros_3.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Gerritsen\u2019s finding, 28 October 2008</div></div></div>\n<p>Armed with the documents from police archives, including Burt\u2019s mud-map, Gerritsen then based his search on the distance from the coast given by Burt, and the Ring of Stones\u2019 relative position as indicated on the mud-map. As a result he was able to locate what appeared to be the site of Burt\u2019s Ring of Stone within a day, on 28 October 2008. This location appeared to be confirmed the next day by following the latter part of the route Burt had taken from Woodada Well, as indicated on his mud-map. However, while the location matched Burt\u2019s designation and description, in the centre of the clearing was a pile of stones, 2.1 m long, 1.0 m wide and 20&#160;cm high, resembling a grave. Gerritsen took photographs and GPS readings and conducted a metal detection search. Upon his return to Perth he informed Sheppard, who visited the site a few days later and confirmed that the location seemed to be correct and that the pile of stones did appear to resemble a grave.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_Crime_Squad_investigation\">Major Crime Squad investigation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ring_of_Stones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Major Crime Squad investigation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ros_4.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Ros_4.jpg/220px-Ros_4.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"141\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Ros_4.jpg/330px-Ros_4.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Ros_4.jpg/440px-Ros_4.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1269\" data-file-height=\"814\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ros_4.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Gerritsen's discovery in June 2009.</div></div></div>\n<p>The Maritime Archaeology Department of the Western Australian Museum was then informed.

Whereas Burt\u2019s Ring of Stones had been \u2018half a mile\u2019 from the coast, was \u20184 ft.\u2019 in diameter and a simple circle; the Hayes-Penney Ring of Stones was \u2018about\u2019 or \u2018at least two mile from the coast\u2019, was \u2018eight feet\u2019 across,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Uren_5-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Uren-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> and had a line of stones leading off it, so that is looked \u2018like a pointer\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-wa2_7-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wa2-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Apart from the distance from the coast there was, however, little specific locational information provided in Hayes and Penney\u2019s account. It would appear that they drove south from Dongara to the end of a dirt track to within \u2018about nine miles\u2019 of their Ring of Stones, and then proceeded on foot for \u2018seven or eight miles\u2019 [11.2 - 12.8&#160;km].<sup id=\"cite_ref-Uren_5-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Uren-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Based on the limited, imprecise and inconsistent information provided by Hayes, and utilising maps contemporaneous with the time of Hayes and Penney\u2019s discovery of their Ring of Stones, an attempt was made to reconstruct their journey. This placed the Hayes-Penney\u2019s Ring of Stones approximately 25&#160;km south southeast of Dongara and about 30&#160;km north of Burt\u2019s Ring of Stones.\n</p><p>In order to eliminate other possibilities Gerritsen also began to investigate Aboriginal stone arrangements on this part of the coast, as listed on the Western Australian Department of Indigenous Affairs Aboriginal Heritage Inquiry System, specifically the sites designated as Eneabba Stone Arrangement (Site No. 4760) and Eneabba West (Site No. 15297). The Eneabba Stone Arrangement, however, could not be found in the designated location, despite a thorough search.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerritsen2_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerritsen2-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> When examined by Gerritsen it was quite apparent the Eneabba West site did not resemble the Ring of Stones in the slightest.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gerritsen2_10-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gerritsen2-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> However, the remains of what appeared to be a man-made stone wall, overlooking a shallow valley, was located in proximity to the Eneabba West site by Gerritsen on 17 June 2009.\n</p><p>The structure is situated in a relatively inaccessible and inhospitable location and has the appearance of being a lookout or a defensive structure. Despite close examination, test pitting and metal detection of the surrounds on two occasions in 2009, no sign of any human occupation or presence could be found<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\"><span title=\"The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (March 2018)\">clarification needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>. Possible explanations for this structure that are under consideration are: that is an Aboriginal stone arrangement, or that it was constructed by survivors from the <a href=\"/wiki/Vergulde_Draeck\" title=\"Vergulde Draeck\">Vergulde Draeck</a>, runaway convicts, drovers or recreational campers, or by those engaged in military exercises in the area.\n</p><p>The search for the Hayes-Penney Ring of Stone commenced in June 2009. A 6.4&#160;km<sup>2</sup> search area was delineated, the parameters of which were based on a reconstruction of the journey Hayes and Penney undertook, the locational details contained their account, and the uncertainties inherent in this. The search was also guided by the published photographs, which provide visual clues as to the nature of the country where they encountered the Ring of Stones.\n</p><p>By July 2010 the search of the designated search area had been completed, without result.\nAn approach was then made by Gerritsen in July 2010 to the archives section of <a href=\"/wiki/West_Australian_Newspapers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"West Australian Newspapers\">West Australian Newspapers</a> to ascertain if they had retained the letter Hayes wrote to Uren in February 1939, as well as the \u201crough sketch of the locality\u201d and at least one additional photo, which Uren had indicated had accompanied the original letter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Uren_5-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Uren-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This was not successful.\n</p><p>The search for the Hayes-Penney Ring of Stones is therefore still continuing. Since the beginning of July 2010 other search strategies have been employed based on alternative hypotheses on the location of the Ring of Stones and reconstructions of the journey by Hayes and Penney.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ring_of_Stones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Burt1-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Burt1_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Burt1_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Burt1_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Burt1_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Letter and accompanying mud-map from Alfred Burt to Commissioner of Police for Western Australia - 3 November 1930 (WA State Records Office: Police).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Mirror1-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Mirror1_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Mirror1_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Hidden treasure on Western Australian coast!
