The Venus of Eliseevichi is a Venus figurine from the Epigravettian.  The figurine was discovered in 1930, near the Sudost River in the province of Briansk in Russia. It is 15 cm high and was carved from mammoth ivory. Remarkably, the figurine depicts a young woman, just like the Venus impudique.  Henri Delporte: L’image de la femme dans l’art préhistorique, Ed.
