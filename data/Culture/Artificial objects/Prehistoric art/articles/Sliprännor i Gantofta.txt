The Sliprännor i Gantofta (Swedish: Grooves of the Giant) in the Helsingborg region in Scania in Sweden are located on the escarpment of a river valley in a sandstone outcrop. Traditionally, they were held to be grooves produced by people sharpening knives and axes, like the countless straight grooves in Gotland. However, modern surveys of the concave horizontal grooves indicate that they were created by means of a pendulum motion or a rotating wheel, like the monument Sliprännor i Foteviken. Today it is believed that the concave grooves in particular (and possibly also the straight ones) are the remains of ritual with religious or magical significance. Grooves are particularly common in the northwest of Scania, especially on the Kullen peninsula, Gotland and Östergötland. Traces of the stone age Pitted Ware culture (c. 3200-2600 BC) are also common in these areas. However, there is as yet no certain evidence that the grooves were made in the stone age.
