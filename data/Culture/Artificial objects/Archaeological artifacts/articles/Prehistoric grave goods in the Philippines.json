This has been a practice since the neolithic times.\n</p><p>Grave goods are symbol of social activities, and in a way reflects the urge of the people who buried the dead to show his or her social status. Grave goods provide substantial background on the technology, degree of complexity of the society, level of integration with other communities, social or group identities, individual identities, and concepts of wealth and power of the existing community.\n</p><p>The types and prestige values of the grave goods differ among groups, because of cultural differences. In studying grave goods, it is important to know the period of existence and to substantiate its prestige value.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Grave_goods_through_time\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Grave goods through time</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Early_Neolithic_Age\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early Neolithic Age</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Late_Neolithic_Age\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Late Neolithic Age</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Chalcolithic_(Metal_Age)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chalcolithic (Metal Age)</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Prestige_value\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prestige value</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Raw_material\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Raw material</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Time_and_energy_in_acquisition_and_manufacture\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Time and energy in acquisition and manufacture</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Cultural_function\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Cultural function</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Sites\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sites</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Duyong_cave,_Palawan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Duyong cave, Palawan</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Manunggul_cave,_Palawan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Manunggul cave, Palawan</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Tigkiw_na_saday,_Sorsogon\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tigkiw na saday, Sorsogon</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Maitum_jar_burials,_South_Cotabato\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Maitum jar burials, South Cotabato</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Panhutongan,_Surigao_del_Norte\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Panhutongan, Surigao del Norte</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Balingsagay,_Bolinao\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Balingsagay, Bolinao</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Puling_bakaw,_Calatagan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Puling bakaw, Calatagan</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grave_goods_through_time\">Grave goods through time</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Grave goods through time\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_Neolithic_Age\">Early <a href=\"/wiki/Neolithic\" title=\"Neolithic\">Neolithic Age</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Early Neolithic Age\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This period was centered on the population's needs. Thus, utilitarian objects, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Adze\" title=\"Adze\">adzes</a>, were most common among grave goods. Ornamental objects were shell pendants, ear ornaments among others. During this period, death was conceived as the transformation of physical form into something inanimate. Goods buried along with the body were mostly composed of their personal belongings.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Late_Neolithic_Age\">Late Neolithic Age</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Late Neolithic Age\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Local trade can already be observed in this period. This created a diversity of material possessions of individuals, leading to a diversity of grave goods. Among these were jade and agate, and <a href=\"/wiki/Earthenware\" title=\"Earthenware\">earthenware</a> pottery. Other materials were shell and some foreign trade objects.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chalcolithic_.28Metal_Age.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chalcolithic_(Metal_Age)\"><a href=\"/wiki/Chalcolithic\" title=\"Chalcolithic\">Chalcolithic</a> (Metal Age)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Chalcolithic (Metal Age)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During this period, inter-island trade was already prominent. Grave goods were jars, metal implements, alkali glass beads, imported porcelain and local imitations, tradeware, coins, metal accessories, gold, and shell. Sex differentiation was also evident during this period wherein it is one of the basic determinants of social stratification. This was a time when social roles started to have variations therefore allowed an individual to be identified in the society based on the goods included in its grave. Iron implements were most of the finds together with male bodies while glass beads were among women.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prestige_value\">Prestige value</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Prestige value\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The prestige value of grave goods are dependent on four factors:\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The acquisition of the material is a factor on its prestige value.

Traded items take more time to acquire, especially if these have to be reprocessed once acquired.

Non-utilitarian or ornamental items have higher prestige value because these generally take more time to make, are harder to acquire and are not as abundant as utilitarian good which are seen and used in everyday living.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sites\">Sites</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Sites\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Duyong_cave.2C_Palawan\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Duyong_cave,_Palawan\">Duyong cave, <a href=\"/wiki/Palawan\" title=\"Palawan\">Palawan</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Prehistoric_grave_goods_in_the_Philippines&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Duyong cave, Palawan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A male adult was excavated in an open pit with stone and shell adzes.
