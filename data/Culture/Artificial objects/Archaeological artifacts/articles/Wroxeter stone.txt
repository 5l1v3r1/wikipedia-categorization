The Wroxeter Stone is a stone unearthed at Wroxeter, England, in 1967.  It bears an inscription in an Insular Celtic language, identified by the Celtic Inscribed Stones Project (CISP) at UCL as "partly-Latinized Primitive Irish".  The text of the inscription reads:  CVNORIX | MACVSM/A | QVICO[L]I[N]E This is traditionally rendered into words as:  CVNORIX MACVS MAQVI COLINE Translation:  Cunorix son of Maqui Coline, where Cunorix and Maqui Coline are personal names.
