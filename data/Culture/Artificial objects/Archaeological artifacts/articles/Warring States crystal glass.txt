The Warring states crystal glass (戰國水晶杯 / 水晶杯) is an artifact found in a Warring States period mausoleum tomb, which dates just before 221 BCE Qin dynasty, China.  The glass however, looks no different from a modern drinking glass. The glass measures 15.4 cm tall.  It has a round opening and is transparent.   The glass is made from a natural high quality crystal.  It looks no different from a modern drinking glass.  The artifact is one of 64 that can never leave China soil.  In 1990 the glass was unearthed in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. Specifically in Bansaan town (半山鎮), Shitang village (石塘村) in a Warring states period mausoleum.   The item was found underground about one metre deep.   To Zing-gin (杜正賢) insisted on the archaeological digging when other archaeologists have already labeled that area of the village a worthless wasteland.   After two months of digging, along with other treasures, he found the glass.  It became the biggest finding of the Warring states tombs.
