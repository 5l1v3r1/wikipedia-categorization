Ralaghan Man is an anthropomorphic, carved wooden figure found in the bog of Ralaghan, County Cavan, Ireland, which dates back to the late bronze age; currently on display in the National Museum of Ireland.  Adolf Mahr, keeper of Irish Antiquities in the National Museum in Dublin wrote in 1930; The figure was found, while cutting turf, under 3 to 4 feet of peat....It is made of yew, its height being 3 feet, 8 and five eighths inches.  It was found in Ralaghan bog, which has since been drained, on a boundary. It is therefore currently regarded as a boundary marker, though it has also been referred to as a votive offering.  Although covered in cracks, the figure has strongly incised facial features.  The left eye is slightly higher than the right, with the nose off-centre and possible damage to the left of the face. The pubic area features a gouged out hole (initially reported as drilled)  which led the initial theory that the figures was female. It was established however that the figure was male; the location of the missing 'male organ' is not known.  Ralaghan man is currently part of the Kingship and Sacrifice exhibition at the National Museum of Ireland.
