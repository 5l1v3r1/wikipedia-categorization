Pecked curvilinear nucleated, (PCN)  in archaeology, is a form of prehistoric rock carving. The term was originally proposed by Teresa Miller and Reed Haslam in 1976 to describe a widespread type of rock carving in western North America.  The form is characterized by a circular or oval groove element, which results in a raised center area.  The form is quite prevalent in California and is applied to a number of Native American rock carving sites in this portion of the United States. Occurrences of this type of rock carving can be found at Ring Mountain, Marin County, California,  and in Lakeport, California.
