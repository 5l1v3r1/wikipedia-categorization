A closed-loop transfer function in control theory is a mathematical expression (algorithm) describing the net result of the effects of a closed (feedback) loop on the input signal to the circuits enclosed by the loop. The closed-loop transfer function is measured at the output. The output signal waveform can be calculated from the closed-loop transfer function and the input signal waveform. An example of a closed-loop transfer function is shown below: The summing node and the G(s) and H(s) blocks can all be combined into one block, which would have the following transfer function: We define an intermediate signal Z shown as follows:  Using this figure we write:
