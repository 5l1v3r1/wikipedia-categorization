Cyberworthiness  is the property, or navigation capability, that has the user interface of an internet site, or the web browser software itself, to facilitate the user to reach his destination as safe and efficiently as possible. This terminology, which arose with the advent of cybernetics and cyberspace navigation, corresponds to the quality of the "road structure" and/or the "vehicle" that gives access to the information content of the site.
