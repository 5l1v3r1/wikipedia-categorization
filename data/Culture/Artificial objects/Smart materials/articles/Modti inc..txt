Modti Inc. is a Finnish technology company headquartered in Joensuu, Finland, that designs, develops, and sells its shape programmable hardware technology. As of May 17, 2015, its main product is Segment, an electrically driven, paper-thin, and flexible actuator bending mechanism tailored for use in emerging flexible technologies. Modti was officially founded by Shane H. Allen and Iouri Kotorov on August 13, 2013 to develop and sell its shape programmable hardware technology. Originally registered as MottiFilm Inc. and was renamed Modti Inc. on August 13, 2014 due to its name giving the incorrect impression of being a movie company. Partners have included Joensuu Business Incubator, Karelia University of Applied Sciences, Startup Sauna, FAU Technology Business Incubator  and Joensuu Entrepreneurship Society. Currently Modti has yet to release an actual product and continues to defraud customers with missed deadlines.  They delete or pay to have deleted any negative information making it near impossible to warn consumers of the facts about this company.  The CEO is also behind the Allforge. Another product that has failed to deliver while bilking hundreds of thousands from consumers on false promises. As of yet there is no working prototype there either.  In both instances the company fraudulently claims to be made in Florida even though no manufacturing or prototyping operations take place there.  All they have is an office in Florida with the real operations being carried out in Finland.  It is my hope that the FTC or DOJ get involved and arrest Shane H Allen for defrauding customers and falsely advertising their product.  I suspect this post will be pulled but hopefully it will reach some people before they are scammed.
