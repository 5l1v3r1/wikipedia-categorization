Smart film, also called Switchable film, is a product that is capable of adjusting light transmission between transparent and opaque using AC power. Due to moisture sensitivity, earlier versions of the film were used only to make smart glass by lamination on glass. With continual improvement in moisture resistance, the new (3rd) generation of the film can be directly installed on existing windows with special glue or self-adhesive. It combines many functions, such as light adjustment, UV and infrared blocking, advertising and security. Most of the film applications are via glass, acrylic or polycarbonate laminates, mainly having to do with the voltage (110VAC) required to operate the film. Companies continue to attempt various installation methods in order to use the film by itself without having to add the lamination cost. One of the advantages of smart film is that it eliminates the need for blinds, shades or window treatments. Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals (PDLCs) 1. Without power the liquid crystal molecules (microdroplets) are disordered. This prevents light from penetrating the film, rendering it opaque. 2. When power is applied to the smart film the liquid crystal molecules are forced into alignment, rendering it transparent. Environmental and energy-saving for green building material. It uses transparent or haze temperature control film, makes the smart film a haze state when the indoor temperature is high, when the light reduces, the smart film is in a translucent state; when the light is weak, the smart film is in a transparent state. Smart film can be used as a switchable projection screen on a store window for advertising. 3G smart film is good for both front and rear projection and projected images can be viewed from both sides. New generations of smart film include low haze and colors that include: milky white, gray, and blue.
