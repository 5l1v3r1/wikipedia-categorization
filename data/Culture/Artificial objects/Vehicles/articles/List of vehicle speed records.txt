 The following is a list of speed records for various categories of vehicles. Caveats: Aircraft speed records are based on airspeed, rather than ground speed. In order to unambiguously express the speed of a spacecraft, a frame of reference must be specified. Typically, this frame will be fixed to the celestial body with the largest gravitational influence on the spacecraft, as this is the most relevant frame for most purposes.  Velocities in different frames of reference are not directly comparable; the matter of the "fastest spacecraft" depends on the reference frame. Because of the influence of gravity, maximum velocities are usually attained just after launch, at entry, or at time of closest approach to a massive body.
