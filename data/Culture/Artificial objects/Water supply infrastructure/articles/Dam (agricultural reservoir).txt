A dam often refers to a water reservoir in the ground, confined by a barrier, embankment or excavation on a pastoral property or similar. The term is found widely in Australian English  and New Zealand English, and is also found in several other English dialects such as that of Yorkshire.   The term can be found in the old English folk song Three Jolly Rogues  The expression "farm dam" has this meaning unambiguously, and where the barrier or embankment is intended, it may be referred to as the "dam wall". "On Wednesday, the 3rd inst., an inquest was held at the house of Mr. H. Lamshed, J.P. near Maitland, on the body of William Lamshed, who was drowned in his father's dam on that morning."  "The machinery is now idle, owing to the water in the dam having dried up, but everything is in readiness for a start as soon as the rain sets in."  "Will anything be done to dredge out silt from Stephens Creek and so increase its capacity? â€” Definitely no. Such an operation is never worth-while. It is always cheaper to dig a new dam."  "A farmer, Wilfred Wylam Emslie, aged 60, was drowned on Saturday in a dam on a farm at Oakura, while attempting to rescue sheep. Resuscitation attempts failed."
