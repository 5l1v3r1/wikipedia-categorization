Copton Mill is a tower mill in Copton, Faversham, Kent, England that was built in 1863  to pump water for Faversham Water Company's waterworks.  It is just south of junction 6 of the M2 motorway. Copton Mill was built by the millwrights Spray and Harmer in 1863.  The mill was marked on the 1858–72 and 1903–10 Ordnance Survey maps. It was worked by wind until 1930, when the cap and sails were removed and replaced with a 6,000 imperial gallons (27,000 l) water tank.  Copton Mill is a three-storey brick tower mill which formerly had a Kentish-style cap. It had four patent sails  37 feet (11.28 m) long and 5 feet (1.52 m) wide  carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The mill was winded by a fantail. It was rated at 15 horsepower (11 kW) and could pump 10,000 imperial gallons (45,000 l) of water per hour.  An oil engine was used as auxiliary power.
