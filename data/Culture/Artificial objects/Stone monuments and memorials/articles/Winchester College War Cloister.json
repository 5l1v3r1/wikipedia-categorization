Around 2,500 former pupils, quiristers (<a href=\"/wiki/Chorister\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chorister\">choristers</a>), and staff from the Winchester College served in the British armed forces in the war; four were awarded the <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_Cross\" title=\"Victoria Cross\">Victoria Cross</a>: Captain <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Forbes_Gordon_Kilby\" title=\"Arthur Forbes Gordon Kilby\">Arthur Kilby</a>, Second Lieutenant <a href=\"/wiki/Dennis_George_Wyldbore_Hewitt\" title=\"Dennis George Wyldbore Hewitt\">Dennis Hewitt</a>, and Lieutenant Colonel <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Doughty-Wylie\" title=\"Charles Doughty-Wylie\">Charles Doughty-Wylie</a> (all posthumously), and Lieutenant Colonel <a href=\"/wiki/Daniel_Burges\" title=\"Daniel Burges\">Daniel Burges</a> (who was the only one of the four to survive the war).  \n</p><p>The first proposal for a school memorial made as early as 1915.  The initial suggestion for a memorial hall expanded over time to include proposals for a new suite of rooms around a cloister.  Baker was engaged as the architect, and made initial suggestions in April 1918.  The large project was abandoned in 1921 due to lack of funds, and the proposals were scaled back to comprise a new cloister, together with rebuilding the <a href=\"/wiki/Reredos\" title=\"Reredos\">reredos</a> and a new altar by <a href=\"/wiki/W._D._Car%C3%B6e\" title=\"W. D. Car\u00f6e\">W. D. Car\u00f6e</a> for the school chapel, and funds to educate the sons of Wykehamists killed in the war.  (Baker was also commissioned to design a memorial cloister for his own school, at <a href=\"/wiki/Tonbridge_School\" title=\"Tonbridge School\">Tonbridge</a>, but the project was abandoned on grounds of cost.)\n</p><p>The new cloister was constructed to the southwest of the school's original medieval buildings \u2013 Outer Court, Chamber Court, and a cloister \u2013 which were erected in the 1390s by its founder <a href=\"/wiki/William_of_Wykeham\" title=\"William of Wykeham\">William of Wykeham</a>.  A foundation stone for the new War Cloister was laid by <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Grey,_1st_Viscount_Grey_of_Fallodon\" title=\"Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon\">Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon</a> on 15 July 1922.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cloister\">Cloister</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Winchester_College_War_Cloister&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Cloister\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The War Cloister was constructed from knapped flint and <a href=\"/wiki/Portland_stone\" title=\"Portland stone\">Portland stone</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Ashlar\" title=\"Ashlar\">ashlars</a>.  The cloister arcade is made of Portland stone, with round-headed arches supported by <a href=\"/wiki/Tuscan_order\" title=\"Tuscan order\">Tuscan</a> columns. \n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Crown-post\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crown-post\">crown-post</a> oak structure supports a roof of <a href=\"/wiki/Purbeck_stone\" title=\"Purbeck stone\">Purbeck stone</a> tiles.  Badges from 120 regiments, in which men from the school served, decorate the walls, corbels and roof beams, to designs by <a href=\"/wiki/George_Kruger_Gray\" title=\"George Kruger Gray\">George Kruger Gray</a> which were painted by <a href=\"/wiki/Laurence_Arthur_Turner\" title=\"Laurence Arthur Turner\">Laurence Arthur Turner</a>.  The roof also has carved wooden angels, and above the main arches over the paths that cross at the centre of the cloister are the badges from four regiments of particularly associated with the school: the <a href=\"/wiki/Rifle_Brigade\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rifle Brigade\">Rifle Brigade</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Royal_Rifle_Corps\" title=\"King&#39;s Royal Rifle Corps\">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hampshire_Regiment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hampshire Regiment\">Hampshire Regiment</a> ,and the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Artillery\" title=\"Royal Artillery\">Royal Artillery</a>. \n</p><p>There is an apse at each of the four corners of the cloister which are dedicated to: South Africa (southeast), Australia (southwest), Canada (northwest), and India (northeast).  Each apse has a large circular stone floor slab: granite from <a href=\"/wiki/Table_Mountain\" title=\"Table Mountain\">Table Mountain</a> in South Africa, <a href=\"/wiki/Syenite\" title=\"Syenite\">syenite</a> from New South Wales, marble from <a href=\"/wiki/Texada_Island\" title=\"Texada Island\">Texada Island</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/British_Columbia\" title=\"British Columbia\">British Columbia</a>, and black marble from <a href=\"/wiki/Bodh_Gaya\" title=\"Bodh Gaya\">Budh Gaya</a> in India.  Four small stones from <a href=\"/wiki/Ypres\" title=\"Ypres\">Ypres</a> set into the floor near the Meads Gate to the east. \n</p><p>The names of those killed in the First World War are listed on the outer wall of the cloister, on tablets of <a href=\"/wiki/Hopton_Wood_stone\" title=\"Hopton Wood stone\">Hopton Wood stone</a>; each of the outer walls bears a pair of large tablets, eight in all, each comprising six smaller panels listing the names.  \n</p><p>Within the cloister is a garden designed by <a href=\"/wiki/Gertrude_Jekyll\" title=\"Gertrude Jekyll\">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, with roses and white lilies, and four grass lawns separated by paths leading to a central memorial cross made by the sculptor <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_Turner_(sculptor)\" title=\"Alfred Turner (sculptor)\">Alfred Turner</a>, with a wheel-headed <a href=\"/wiki/Latin_cross\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Latin cross\">Latin cross</a> supported by an octagonal shaft on an octagonal plinth with three steps.  To either side of the cross is the carved figure of a crusader knight.  Baker had proposed a similar design of wheel-headed memorial cross to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now <a href=\"/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission\" title=\"Commonwealth War Graves Commission\">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a>), but a different design by Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Reginald_Blomfield\" title=\"Reginald Blomfield\">Reginald Blomfield</a> was selected instead: the <a href=\"/wiki/Cross_of_Sacrifice\" title=\"Cross of Sacrifice\">Cross of Sacrifice</a> familiar at many CWGC cemeteries. \n</p><p>The school's art master <a href=\"/wiki/Reginald_Gleadowe\" title=\"Reginald Gleadowe\">Reginald Gleadowe</a> designed the main gate leading to the Meads to the east, which is decorated with angels blowing trumpets.  Above the arch of the entrance is a carving of the school's patron, <a href=\"/wiki/St_Mary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St Mary\">St Mary</a>, by <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Wheeler_(sculptor)\" title=\"Charles Wheeler (sculptor)\">Charles Wheeler</a>.

The Victory Gate to the south leads to other school buildings.\n</p><p>Gleadowe also designed the <a href=\"/wiki/Beneventan_script\" title=\"Beneventan script\">Lombardic script</a> used for the main <a href=\"/wiki/Flushwork\" title=\"Flushwork\">flushwork</a> inscription running around the outer wall of the cloister.\n</p>\n<dl><dd><span class=\"smallcaps\" style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">THANKS BE TO GOD FOR THE SERVICE OF THESE FIVE HUNDRED WYKEHAMISTS, WHO WERE FOUND FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH AMID THE MANIFOLD CHANCES OF THE GREAT WAR.
