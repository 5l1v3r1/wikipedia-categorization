The Stone of Terpon or Pebble of Antibes (Galet d'Antibes) is an ancient artifact excavated near the seawall of Antibes, France (the ancient Antipolis) in 1866 ( ).  The stone is held in the Musée d’Histoire et d’Archéologie adjacent to that same seawall in Antibes.  The stone's  inscription has been dated to between 450 and 425 BC,( ) and the object may once have marked the entrance to a brothel.  The stone is formed in a phallic shape (23" long, 8" thick, 73 lbs.), with a carved inscription in Ionic Greek reading:  In standard Greek orthography the text would read:  It forms a distych in dactylic hexameter: The inscription can be roughly translated as: "I am Terpon, servant of noble Aphrodite, may Kypris return grace to those who set up (the stone)."
