The stele of Prusias is one of the ex votos at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi, constructed in honour of king Prusias II of Bithynia. The stele of Prusias  is located  to the northeast of  the entrance of the temple of Apollo in the archaeological site of Delphi. It has been restored  in situ. The monument has been identified through an inscription mentioning that it was dedicated  by the Aetolian League to honour king Prusias II of Bithynia, in northwestern Asia Minor:  «Βασιλέα Προυσίαν, βασιλέως Προυσία, τò Κοινò τῶν Αἰτωλῶν, ἀρετᾶς ἔνεκεν καὶ εὐεργεσίας τάς ἐς αὑτούς».(To the king Prusias, son of king Prusias, the Aetolian League for his virtue and the benefactions he bestowed upon them).  Due  to  this inscription it was also possible  to date the ex voto  after 182 B.C., when Prusias II succeeded his father, Prusias I, on the throne of Bithynia. Τhe monument consists of a tall base made of rows of rectangular blocks, whereas on its upper part it bears a decoration in relief depicting garlands and bucraniums; the decoration included  also  a low molding with supports (geisipodes). Its total  height reached 9.70 meters. At the top stood the statue of king Prusias on horseback. On the upper part  of the monument rows  of  rectangular slits are possibly  related to  the entire composition, as they might have been used  to fasten floral  motifs, such as crops, which probably alluded to  the benefaction of the king.  They could also have contained bronze blades aiming at protecting the monument against  the birds.  Τhe monument was similar to the pedestal the Monument of Aemilius Paullus, set up about 15 years later to the south of the entrance of the temple of Apollo, nowadays exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.
