Various agencies in the United States define necessary characteristics for flood openings. The NFIP Regulations and Building Codes require that any residential building constructed in Flood Zone Type A have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). Enclosed areas are permitted under elevated buildings provided that they meet certain use restrictions and construction requirements such as the installation of flood vents to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. This wet floodproofing technique is required for residential buildings.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Engineered_vs._non-engineered_openings\">Engineered vs. non-engineered openings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Flood_opening&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Engineered vs. non-engineered openings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most regulatory authorities in the United States that offer requirements for flood openings define two major classes of opening:<sup id=\"cite_ref-codes_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-codes-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> engineered, and non-engineered.

Under these requirements, the opening must activate before water level is one foot above the bottom of the opening, under conditions of 50 and 300 gallons per minute flooding, at a minimum of five foot per hour rate of rise. Additionally, water levels on the testing tank's \"interior\" and \"exterior\" portions must at no point differ more than one foot. To gauge performance against waterborne <a href=\"/wiki/Debris\" title=\"Debris\">debris</a>, leaves and grass clippings are added to both chambers of the tank.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ac364_7-0\"
