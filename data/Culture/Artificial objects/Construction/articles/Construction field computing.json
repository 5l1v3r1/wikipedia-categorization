Their responsibilities cover a wide variety of tasks such as:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Comparing planned to constructed conditions.</li>\n<li>Carrying out in-field quality inspections ( punch lists or snagging as it is called in the UK)</li>\n<li>Capturing data about such defects and communicating it to the relevant sub-contractors.</li>\n<li>Coordinating and scheduling events and material delivery.</li>\n<li>Monitoring jobsite conditions and correcting safety deficiencies, improving efficiency, and ensuring quality.</li>\n<li>Recording and documenting work progress, labor, inspections, compliance to specifications, etc.</li>\n<li>Communicating direction to specialty contractors, laborers, suppliers, etc.</li>\n<li>Clarifying plans and specifications, resolving differing conditions, adapting methods and materials to site-specific requirements.</li></ul>\n<p>These tasks require that information is readily accessible and easily communicated to others and the company database. Since construction sites are unique, the device and system must be adaptable and flexible. Durability, predictability, and perceived value by the field management will determine the system's acceptance and thus proper use. Construction personnel are not well known for adapting to new technologies, but they do embrace methods that are proven to lighten work load and increase income.\n</p><p>Construction industry field personnel were quick to adopt new technologies such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Fax_machine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fax machine\">FAX machine</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_phone\" title=\"Mobile phone\">mobile phone</a>, they have been slower to embrace the PC, tablet PC, PDA, and other devices. <a href=\"/wiki/Disruptive_technology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disruptive technology\">Disruptive technology</a> is usually difficult in construction field use for several reasons:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Field managers have often risen 'through the ranks' and learned from their predecessors how to run a construction site.</li>\n<li>They commonly do not have exposure to higher education and the new methods and technologies being developed.</li>\n<li>Field work is demanding and varied such that suitable and durable technologies are difficult to build. Failure of the device or system means schedule slip and increase costs so that using the new technology can be untenable.</li>\n<li>Laborers generally are not highly educated and willing to invest time in change.</li>\n<li>Construction is very schedule driven and time for training or learning new methods is rare. The <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_curve\" title=\"Learning curve\">learning curve</a> is perceived to be too steep to justify implementing new technologies or methods not mandated by governing authorities or required by the contract documents.</li></ul>\n<p>Overcoming these issues is imperative for most construction firms. The augmentation and automation of managerial practices is required to make the construction process more efficient. The information appliance makes it possible field supervisors to access needed information, communicate requirements to others, and document the process effectively.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Connectivity_and_computing_power\">Connectivity and computing power</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Connectivity and computing power\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>An effective device will be able to process data into actionable information and transmit data and information to other devices or persons. The device may not actually perform computation of final communication, but it must appear as though it does. Extra steps to upload and download information will be perceived as a nuisance or waste of time to the user and cause the device to be underutilized. Some IAs are self-contained in that they have computing capacity and software to perform required tasks independent of a server or other devices. Others rely on connectivity with other devices and/or a server to perform required functions.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Communication_with_home_office\">Communication with home office</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Communication with home office\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fat_client\">Fat client</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Fat client\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Fat_client\" title=\"Fat client\">fat client</a> refers to a device that has sufficient speed and size to run programs and is loaded locally with software needed for operation.

Sometimes called dumb terminal, these devices do not have sufficient computing capacity or data storage capacity of process information, but only allow the user to access the software and data needed by them. Some advantages of this type of system are:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Real-time data. User both provides and has access to most current information. Information entered is immediately available to other users of the information through the central <a href=\"/wiki/Database\" title=\"Database\">database</a>. Updates from all contributors to the database are available immediately to the user.</li>\n<li>Automated and instantaneous action.

Especially important here are the lack of training in computer sciences and need to remain focused on the job-site activities. Any suitable device and system should support the user without their understanding of the technical aspects of the computer or system. Any data functions operations must require no knowledge of the database schema. Response to commands or input should be immediate and reversible so that the user can quickly experiment and learn by doing without causing damage to the system or data. The user will most often feel that access to information and control over the system is not unduly limited. These traits will reduce user anxiety and encourage usage and acceptance of new technologies and systems.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/User_friendliness\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"User friendliness\">User friendliness</a> is needed due to the varied level of knowledge of the user. The functional options should be easily labeled and structured such that the user can understand by viewing the screen and by intuition. Usability will in large part determine whether or not the device and/or system is utilized. An ineffective tool is not only useless, but can be deleterious in that it takes time from the user, but does not return value. Even if the user only perceives the operation of the device to be worthless, he/she will be 'demotivated' to use the device and do so improperly or insufficiently. This will render the activity useless, fulfilling the expectation of failure.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Portable_devices_available\">Portable devices available</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Portable devices available\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Laptop_and_tablet_PC\">Laptop and tablet PC</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Laptop and tablet PC\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Laptop\" title=\"Laptop\">Laptop</a> or notebook computers are small enough to be carried around the construction site, but too big to do so comfortably.

Some do have keyboards, but they must be set down to operate and thus suffer the same problem of not being usable and portable at the same time. They can be carried with one hand and used with the other, thus allowing for ambulatory use. They are generally the size of a clipboard or notepad carried by many superintendents and are a good replacement for those devices due to the automation advantages of the computer, but they are still too big to be worn so that the user can move throughout the jobsite easily (up and down ladders) and have hands available for other uses (measuring manipulating objects to demonstrate technique or effect).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PDAs\">PDAs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: PDAs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The PDA has been accepted by many construction firms to aid the management of punch lists, safety inspections, and maintenance work. They can be thin or thick devices, but are often a combination of the two, having connectivity, but containing programs to operate even when out of range of WiFi or coverage. PDAs are durable, inexpensive, and very portable (being worn on a clip or carried in a pocket).

This method is slower than keyboard entry for the experienced user.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Output_methods\">Output methods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Output methods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Screen\">Screen</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Screen\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The touch screen is the standard display method for tablet PC and smaller IAs. Color may or may not be important to the user but can be an aid in directing the user. The screen size is perhaps the most important consideration. Organization of the screen is challenging on the small screen and the user should be considered when designing the interface. See section 2.2 and 2.3 in <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman\" title=\"Ben Shneiderman\">Ben Shneiderman</a>'s \"Designing the user interface\" (<a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-321-19786-0\" title=\"Special:BookSources/0-321-19786-0\">0-321-19786-0</a>) concerning design of the interface.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Voice\">Voice</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Voice\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Voice or tonal output from the IA can be effective as a reminder, warning, or indication of action performed, but tends to be irritating to the user if it is the principal method of interaction. Verbal output is slower than viewing the information and it is difficult for a person to pay attention to and understand information. Systems such as <a href=\"/wiki/JAWS_(screen_reader)\" title=\"JAWS (screen reader)\">JAWS screen reader</a> for the visually impaired do exist, but are not practical for construction site users and application.

Before implementing a system, a study on how it will add value to the user must be done. Having more data from the field is not directly beneficial to the site superintended. Reducing the time it takes to do 'paperwork' is valued. Sending an image taken from the IA camera directly to an architect for clarification does save time and effort and will be valued by the user.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Training\">Training</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Training\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The system and device should be designed such that it encourages experimentation and usage. Immediate response to input and adaptability based on level of experience are better than sitting through a training seminar to get a few dry donuts. Training is best accomplished by showing and encouraging use. A 'guru' or user expert within the company may be best way to resolve questions and provide answers to questions and concerns. See 'The social life of information' (need reference).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scalability_and_continual_change\">Scalability and continual change</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_field_computing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Scalability and continual change\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Technologies will evolve and the user will be facing new challenges with each change. It is usually wiser to adopt a small system that works and then later add features. This gradual adoption reduces anxiety and increases acceptance and use.

Users do not always know or care what software is being used or which database is being accessed and do not understand why they must enter the same information again. For example, once the date has been entered, the user will be frustrated to be prompted to enter it again during the same session. Taking this further, the user may be frustrated to have to enter a date since there is a calendar function on the IA being used.\n</p><p>Web Based Mobile IT \n</p><p>These systems from leading vendors are not simply all about mobility in field and cutting the work required by in field managers in the area of report writing.  Cloud based tablet and PC systems provide not just mobile capture and access to data in field but also for the first time they both computerise and move to the cloud the quality function.  The use of powerful relational databases at the back end permits the data captured in field to be analysed. This can be used for instance to rate sub-contractors and to feed into continuous quality improvement. \n</p><p>Benefits of Mobile IT in Construction \n</p><p>Studies from the UK organisation COMIT and others have shown there is a valuable ROI from using this technology.  Firms have reported faster delivery of projects,  project hand over with zero defects, reduced costs from the process of managing sub-contractors and report writing and the value of having a secure audit trail. \n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span
