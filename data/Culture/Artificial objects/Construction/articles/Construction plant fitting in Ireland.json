Bull-dozers, dump trucks, four-wheel drive vehicles, cement mixers and water pumps are all types of equipment worked on by construction plant fitters (cp fitters).\n</p><p>Since 1979, and up until its closure in December 2010, the Cabra Training Centre was the only place in Ireland to offer Phase 2 apprenticeship training. Since the Cabra closure, the section has moved to a rented workshops about 300 metres away from the FAS Baldoyle Training Centre. This was to have been a temporary move while the main training centre was modified to accommodate the course. The promised work never happened, and the CP Fitters' section have been running courses from this temporary premises since May 2011. Generally speaking, four courses per year are run-with 12 apprentices on each course. In recent years, as many as 10 courses (120 apprentices) and as few as 2 courses (24 apprentices) have been run in Cabra.\n</p><p>Apprenticeship Training in the trade was regulated by <a href=\"/wiki/Foras_%C3%81iseanna_Saothair\" title=\"Foras \u00c1iseanna Saothair\">F\u00c1S, Ireland's Industrial Training Authority</a>. \nThe name of that organisation was changed to SOLAS. At present, apprenticeship training is standards based, and broken into 7 phases, with the odd-numbered phases being conducted on-the-job, and the even numbered phases being conducted in a temporary industrial unit rented by the Dublin and Dun Laoighre Education and Training Board (DDLETB)in Baldoyle (Phase 2), or the Institute of Technology in Cork (Phases 4 and 6). Since February 2016, it has become apparent that the Institute of Technology in Cork are now also offering Phase 2 training.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_2_Training\">Phase 2 Training</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_plant_fitting_in_Ireland&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Phase 2 Training\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Up until November 2010, the F\u00c1S Training Centre in <a href=\"/wiki/Cabra,_Dublin\" title=\"Cabra, Dublin\">Cabra</a> was the only training centre in the country to offer apprenticeship training at Phase 2 level. The Cabra Training Centre was closed down permanently on Christmas Eve, 2010, and no longer functions as a training centre. Since May 2011, Phase 2 apprenticeship training is being delivered in a satellite industrial unit close to the Baldoyle Training Centre. At present, two courses are running there concurrently. Since February 2016, Phase 2 training is also being offered in the Institute of Technology, Cork. \nDuring the 20 weeks allotted to Phase 2, apprentices will study 6 different modules:\n</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul><li>Engines</li>\n<li>Plant Vehicles</li>\n<li>Small Plant Machinery</li></ul>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul><li>Transmissions</li>\n<li>Plant Vehicle Electricity</li>\n<li>Hydraulics</li></ul>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Construction_plant_fitting_in_Ireland&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cpfitters.info\">Log in as a guest</a> to see more about the CP Fitters' Section, and the training facilities</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://86.43.94.97/moodlecp9a/course/view.php?id=65\">Keep up with the latest site news about CP Fitters</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2235\nCached time: 20180920091113\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.052 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 177/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 1118/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 190/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.007/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 711 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   41.348      1 -total\n 85.90%   35.518      1 Template:EngvarB\n 39.37%   16.278      2 Template:DMCA\n 33.08%   13.676      2 Template:Dated_maintenance_category\n 21.53%    8.903      2 Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME\n 14.72%    6.086      2 Template:Ns_has_subpages\n 13.86%    5.731      1 Template:Use_dmy_dates\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:17220334-0!canonical and timestamp 20180920091113 and revision id 836407629\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"EngvarB_from_April_2018"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2018"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Construction"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:EngvarB from April 2018"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Use dmy dates from April 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cabra, Dublin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Foras \u00c1iseanna Saothair"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:EngvarB"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:DMCA"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Dated maintenance category"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ns has subpages"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Use dmy dates"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Ns has subpages"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.cpfitters.info","http://86.43.94.97/moodlecp9a/course/view.php?id=65"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Phase 2 Training","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Construction_plant_fitting_in_Ireland","byteoffset":1813,"anchor":"Phase_2_Training"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Construction_plant_fitting_in_Ireland","byteoffset":2644,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Construction plant fitting in Ireland","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5164476"}]}}
