Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mid-Atlantic states\">mid-Atlantic states</a>, experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Terne\" title=\"Terne\">terne</a>\u201d or \u201cterneplate\u201d was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin <a href=\"/wiki/Alloy\" title=\"Alloy\">alloy</a>. It is frequently confused with <a href=\"/wiki/Tinplate\" title=\"Tinplate\">tinplate</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Lead <a href=\"/wiki/Came\" title=\"Came\">came</a> was also frequently used for window panes in skylights and stained glass. It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation. Lead was frequently added to paint, with red lead used as an anti-corrosive pigment for iron, and white lead used as paint for wooden houses. <a href=\"/wiki/Lead-based_paint\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lead-based paint\">Lead-based paint</a> was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating. The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings, due to concerns of <a href=\"/wiki/Lead_poisoning\" title=\"Lead poisoning\">lead poisoning</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tin\">Tin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_metals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Tin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The principal architectural uses of <a href=\"/wiki/Tin\" title=\"Tin\">tin</a> fall into two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as <a href=\"/wiki/Copper\" title=\"Copper\">copper</a> to form <a href=\"/wiki/Bronze\" title=\"Bronze\">bronze</a>, and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term \u201ctin ceiling\u201d is a misnomer, as these decorative sheets were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Tinplate\" title=\"Tinplate\">Tinplate</a> was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron coated with tin. \u201cTin roofs,\u201d a type of tinplate, was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material. Tinplate was also used for decoration, such as ornamental windows, door lintels. Although tinplate is still available today for roofing and flashing, it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as <a href=\"/wiki/Asphalt\" title=\"Asphalt\">asphalt</a> shingles or built-up roofs. A well-maintained tinplate roof typically lasts several times longer than either of these types of roofing, and is more economical when the longer lifespan is taken into account.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zinc\">Zinc</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_metals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Zinc\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Pure <a href=\"/wiki/Zinc\" title=\"Zinc\">zinc</a> was used for roofing in Belgium, France and Germany, where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing. Starting in the 1820s, Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America, used by builders in New York City and elsewhere. Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures.\n</p><p>Zinc-coated metals were first <a href=\"/wiki/Patented\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Patented\">patented</a> in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a \u201chot dipping\u201d process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 \u201cgalvanized\u201d sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany and Austria as early as 1832. Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc, since it molded readily, was inexpensive compared to stone, and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Zinc_oxide\" title=\"Zinc oxide\">Zinc oxide</a> paints were nontoxic and resistant to <a href=\"/wiki/Pollution\" title=\"Pollution\">pollution</a>. They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s. They had the added benefit of being good rust inhibitors on iron and steel.\n</p><p>During the early decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final <a href=\"/wiki/Patina\" title=\"Patina\">patina</a>.  Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey.  Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process.  Zinc is still used in alloys such as <a href=\"/wiki/Brass\" title=\"Brass\">brass</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Nickel_silver\" title=\"Nickel silver\">nickel silver</a>, and in the <a href=\"/wiki/Electroplating\" title=\"Electroplating\">electroplating</a> of steel as well. Today, <a href=\"/wiki/Galvanized_steel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Galvanized steel\">galvanized steel</a> and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of <a href=\"/wiki/Titanium\" title=\"Titanium\">titanium</a> in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common.\n</p><p>Architectural grade zinc is 90 to 95% recycled.  Replacement costs are negligible with a long lifetime of 80 to 100 years for zinc roofing and 200 to 300 years for wall systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This long-life durability is a key component in durability.  At the end of its service life, zinc building products can be recycled indefinitely without loss to chemical or physical properties.  The use of architectural grade zinc can help building qualify for <a href=\"/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design\" title=\"Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design\">LEED</a> certification due to its high recycled content and sustainability.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Copper_and_its_alloys\">Copper and its alloys</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_metals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Copper and its alloys\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Copper_in_architecture\" title=\"Copper in architecture\">Copper in architecture</a></div>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Copper\" title=\"Copper\">Copper</a> is a very durable metal, withstanding <a href=\"/wiki/Corrosion\" title=\"Corrosion\">corrosion</a> when forming a bluish-green <a href=\"/wiki/Patina\" title=\"Patina\">patina</a> that variably consists of copper <a href=\"/wiki/Carbonates\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Carbonates\">carbonates</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sulfates\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sulfates\">sulfates</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sulfides\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sulfides\">sulfides</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Chloride\" title=\"Chloride\">chlorides</a>. Sheet copper used as roofing is lighter than wooden shingles and much lighter than slate, tile, or lead. Roofing copper can be folded readily into waterproof seams, or shaped over curved frameworks for <a href=\"/wiki/Cupolas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cupolas\">cupolas</a> and domes.\n</p><p>The initial cost of copper was traditionally high, but its length of service more than compensated for the price. Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at roof edges and dormers. All nails, screws, bolts, and cleats used with sheet copper must be made of copper or a copper alloy, otherwise galvanic action between the dissimilar metals would occur, causing deterioration.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Copper was also used for decorative purposes, including architectural ornaments or sculptures.

It has been called \u201cwhite brass\u201d but probably should be termed \u201cnickel brass,\u201d because it generally contains 75% copper, 20% nickel, and 5% zinc. Different percentages result in a range of colors, including silvery-white, yellow, slight blue, green or pink. Nickel silver hardware was popular in the US during the <a href=\"/wiki/Art_Deco\" title=\"Art Deco\">Art Deco</a> and Depression Modern periods. Architects and designers preferred nickel silver because it could take and retain appropriate finishes, and it resisted corrosion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Monel metal is an alloy of approximately two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It is similar to platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad\" title=\"Pennsylvania Railroad\">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City_Public_Library\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New York City Public Library\">New York City Public Library</a> at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Iron_and_its_alloys\">Iron and its alloys</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_metals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Iron and its alloys\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Iron has become an important architectural building component. It has been used in four common forms: wrought iron, cast iron, sheet iron, and steel.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Wrought_iron\" title=\"Wrought iron\">Wrought iron</a> was used for minor structural and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails, bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Cast_iron\" title=\"Cast iron\">Cast iron</a> was a major 19th century building material of the <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\" title=\"Industrial Revolution\">Industrial Revolution</a>. Although brittle, it is remarkably strong in compression. It was frequently used for structural purposes, such as columns, building fronts, domes and light courts. Decorative uses have included stairs, elevators, lintels, grilles, verandas, balconies, railings, fences, streetlights, and tombs. The <a href=\"/wiki/Bradbury_Building\" title=\"Bradbury Building\">Bradbury Building</a> is an example of extensive decorative cast iron. Today, cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction, and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices.\n</p><p>Sheet iron can be subject to rapid corrosion, forming rust. Sheet iron was used throughout the 19th century, although it is not clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became. Pressed decorative sheet iron used for ceilings was frequently called a \u201ctin ceiling,\u201d although tin was generally not used indoors.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Steel\" title=\"Steel\">Steel</a> was introduced to the construction industry at the end of the 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the <a href=\"/wiki/Bessemer_process\" title=\"Bessemer process\">Bessemer process</a> was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be \u201cfireproofed\u201d in some manner, utilizing a cladding of <a href=\"/wiki/Terra-cotta\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Terra-cotta\">terra-cotta</a>, tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or sprayed <a href=\"/wiki/Building_insulation\" title=\"Building insulation\">insulation</a>. Ferro concrete, also called <a href=\"/wiki/Reinforced_concrete\" title=\"Reinforced concrete\">reinforced concrete</a>, was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.\n</p><p>Decorative steels used in buildings include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Stainless_steel\" title=\"Stainless steel\">Stainless steel</a>, a chromium-nickel steel, developed between 1903 and 1912. Its most important property is its resistance to corrosion. It contains about 18% chromium and 8-12% nickel. Stainless steel is expensive, so it was used primarily as a nonstructural metal or where there is a high potential for corrosion. One of the most extensive early uses of stainless steel was in the <a href=\"/wiki/Chrysler_Building\" title=\"Chrysler Building\">Chrysler Building</a>.</li>\n<li>Copper-bearing steels, containing from .15% to .25% copper, develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion, when compared to ordinary steel, by forming a protective oxide coating, having a uniform deep brown color and texture. <a href=\"/wiki/Eero_Saarinen\" title=\"Eero Saarinen\">Eero Saarinen</a> experimented with the material in the <a href=\"/wiki/Deere_and_Company\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deere and Company\">Deere and Company</a> building in 1964.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aluminium\">Aluminium</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_metals&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Aluminium\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Much like copper, <a href=\"/wiki/Aluminium\" title=\"Aluminium\">Aluminium</a> is highly resistant to <a href=\"/wiki/Corrosion\" title=\"Corrosion\">corrosion</a>. It also has the added benefit of being a third lighter than steel with comparable strength. Aluminium can also be easily and repeatedly recycled. It has been estimated that of the estimated 900 million tonnes of aluminium produced since 1880, three quarters is still in productive use, 35% of which is in building construction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Aluminum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aluminum\">Aluminium</a> was unavailable at reasonable cost or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century. Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s, mainly for decorative detailing. It was used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, wall panels, and spandrels.
