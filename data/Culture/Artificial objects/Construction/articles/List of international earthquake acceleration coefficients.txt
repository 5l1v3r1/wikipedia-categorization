List of international earthquake acceleration coefficients. A list of earthquake coefficients used in structural design for earthquake engineering around the world. For example, a coefficient of 0.09 indicates that a building is designed that 0.09 of its weight can be applied horizontally during an earthquake.[clarification needed] From Australian Standard 1170.4. Coeffiecients are based on 10% chance exceedence in 50 years. Note: Meckering, Western Australia, has the largest coefficient in Australia of 0.22. From ΕAΚ 2003 building code
