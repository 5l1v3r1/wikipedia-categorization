Avonite Studio collection is a polyester solid surface material. Avonite Foundations collection is an acrylic solid surface material.   Both Avonite series are solid surfaces that have a textured granite or gemstone look manufactured by the company Avonite Surfaces and Aristech Acrylics LLC. Avonite resembles stone, with the color being the same throughout the material. It is a popular material for use in baths and kitchens (as countertops) since it can be worked and polished with woodworking tools.  Avonite also manufacturers a 40% Post Industrial RECYCLED series of solid surfaces.
