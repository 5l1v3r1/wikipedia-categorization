Stabilization is the retrofitting of platforms or foundations as constructed for the purpose of improving the bearing capacity and levelness of the supported building. Soil failure can occur on a slope, a slope failure or landslide, or in a flat area due to liquefaction of water-saturated sand and/or mud. Generally, deep pilings or foundations must be driven into solid soil (typically hard mud or sand) or to underlying bedrock.
