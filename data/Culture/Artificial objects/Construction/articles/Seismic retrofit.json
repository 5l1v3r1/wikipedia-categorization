Prior to the introduction of <a href=\"/wiki/Built_environment\" title=\"Built environment\">modern seismic codes</a> in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many other parts of the world (Turkey, China etc.),<sup id=\"cite_ref-Link1_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Link1-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world \u2013 such as the ASCE-SEI 41<sup id=\"cite_ref-Link2_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Link2-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)'s guidelines.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Link3_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Link3-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> These codes must be regularly updated; the <a href=\"/wiki/1994_Northridge_earthquake\" title=\"1994 Northridge earthquake\">1994 Northridge earthquake</a> brought to light the brittleness of welded steel frames, for example.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Reitherman_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Reitherman-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The retrofit techniques outlined here are also applicable for other natural hazards such as <a href=\"/wiki/Tropical_cyclone\" title=\"Tropical cyclone\">tropical cyclones</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tornado\" title=\"Tornado\">tornadoes</a>, and severe <a href=\"/wiki/Wind\" title=\"Wind\">winds</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Thunderstorm\" title=\"Thunderstorm\">thunderstorms</a>.  Whilst current practice of seismic retrofitting is predominantly concerned with structural improvements to reduce the seismic hazard of using the structures, it is similarly essential to reduce the hazards and losses from non-structural elements.

(or rehabilitation) strategies have been developed in the past few decades following the introduction of new seismic provisions and the availability of advanced materials (e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic\" title=\"Fibre-reinforced plastic\">fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP)</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fiber-reinforced_concrete\" title=\"Fiber-reinforced concrete\">fiber reinforced concrete</a> and high strength steel).<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Retrofit strategies are different from retrofit techniques, where the former is the basic approach to achieve an overall retrofit performance objective, such as increasing strength, increasing deformability, reducing deformation demands while the latter is the technical methods to achieve that strategy, for example <a href=\"/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic#Structural_applications_of_FRP\" title=\"Fibre-reinforced plastic\">FRP jacketing</a>.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Increasing the global capacity (strengthening). This is typically done by the addition of cross braces or new structural walls.</li>\n<li>Reduction of the seismic demand by means of supplementary damping and/or use of <a href=\"/wiki/Base_isolation\" title=\"Base isolation\">base isolation</a> systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Increasing the local capacity of structural elements. This strategy recognises the inherent capacity within the existing structures, and therefore adopt a more cost-effective approach to selectively upgrade local capacity (deformation/ductility, strength or stiffness) of individual structural components.</li>\n<li>Selective weakening retrofit. This is a counter intuitive strategy to change the inelastic mechanism of the structure, while recognising the inherent capacity of the structure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Allowing sliding connections such as passageway bridges to accommodate additional movement between seismically independent structures.</li>\n<li>Addition of seismic friction dampers to simultaneously add damping and a selectable amount of additional stiffness.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Performance_objectives\">Performance objectives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Performance objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the past, seismic retrofit was primarily applied to achieve public safety, with engineering solutions limited by economic and political considerations. However, with the development of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Performance_based_earthquake_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Performance based earthquake engineering (page does not exist)\">Performance based earthquake engineering</a> (PBEE), several levels of performance objectives are gradually recognised:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Public safety only. The goal is to protect human life, ensuring that the structure will not collapse upon its occupants or passersby, and that the structure can be safely exited. Under severe seismic conditions the structure may be a total economic write-off, requiring tear-down and replacement.</li>\n<li>Structure survivability. The goal is that the structure, while remaining safe for exit, may require extensive repair (but not replacement) before it is generally useful or considered safe for occupation. This is typically the lowest level of retrofit applied to bridges.</li>\n<li>Structure functionality. Primary structure undamaged and the structure is undiminished in utility for its primary application. A high level of retrofit, this ensures that any required repairs are only \"cosmetic\" \u2013 for example, minor cracks in <a href=\"/wiki/Plaster\" title=\"Plaster\">plaster</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Drywall\" title=\"Drywall\">drywall</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Stucco\" title=\"Stucco\">stucco</a>. This is the minimum acceptable level of retrofit for <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital\" title=\"Hospital\">hospitals</a>.</li>\n<li>Structure unaffected.

Discovery of these unanticipated brittle fractures of framing connections was alarming to engineers and the building industry.  Starting in the 1960s, engineers began to regard welded steel moment-frame buildings as being among the most ductile systems contained in the building code.  Many engineers believed that steel moment-frame buildings were essentially invulnerable to earthquake induced damage and thought that should damage occur, it would be limited to ductile yielding of members and connections.  Observation of damage sustained by buildings in the 1994 Northridge earthquake indicated that contrary to the intended behavior, in many cases, brittle fractures initiated within the connections at very low levels of plastic demand.  In September, 1994, The SAC joint Venture, AISC, AISI, and NIST jointly convened an international workshop in Los Angeles to coordinate the efforts of various participants and to lay the foundation for systematic investigation and resolution of the problem.  In September 1995 the SAC Joint Venture entered into a contractual agreement with FEMA to conduct Phase II of the SAC Steel project.  Under Phase II, SAC continued its extensive problem-focused study of the performance of moment resisting steel frames and connections of various configurations, with the ultimate goal of developing seismic design criteria for steel construction. As a result of these studies it is now known that the typical moment-resisting connection detail employed in steel moment frame construction prior to the 1994 Northridge earthquake had a number of features that rendered it inherently susceptible to brittle fracture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shear_failure_within_floor_diaphragm\">Shear failure within floor diaphragm</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Shear failure within floor diaphragm\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Floors in wooden buildings are usually constructed upon relatively deep spans of wood, called <a href=\"/wiki/Joist\" title=\"Joist\">joists</a>, covered with a diagonal wood planking or <a href=\"/wiki/Plywood\" title=\"Plywood\">plywood</a> to form a subfloor upon which the finish floor surface is laid.

To prevent the beams from tipping over onto their side, blocking is used at each end, and for additional stiffness, blocking or diagonal wood or metal bracing may be placed between beams at one or more points in their spans. At the outer edge it is typical to use a single depth of blocking and a perimeter beam overall.\n</p><p>If the blocking or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the shear forces applied to the building.

Additionally, older attachments (without substantial corrosion-proofing) may have corroded to a point of weakness. A sideways shock can slide the building entirely off of the foundations or slab.\n</p><p>Often such buildings, especially if constructed on a moderate slope, are erected on a platform connected to a perimeter foundation through low stud-walls called \"cripple wall\" or <i>pin-up</i>. This low wall structure itself may fail in shear or in its connections to itself at the corners, leading to the building moving diagonally and collapsing the low walls. The likelihood of failure of the pin-up can be reduced by ensuring that the corners are well reinforced in shear and that the shear panels are well connected to each other through the corner posts. This requires structural grade sheet plywood, often treated for rot resistance. This grade of plywood is made without interior unfilled knots and with more, thinner layers than common plywood. New buildings designed to resist earthquakes will typically use OSB (<a href=\"/wiki/Oriented_strand_board\" title=\"Oriented strand board\">oriented strand board</a>), sometimes with metal joins between panels, and with well attached <a href=\"/wiki/Stucco\" title=\"Stucco\">stucco</a> covering to enhance its performance. In many modern tract homes, especially those built upon expansive (clay) soil the building is constructed upon a single and relatively thick monolithic slab, kept in one piece by high tensile rods that are stressed after the slab has set. This poststressing places the concrete under compression \u2013 a condition under which it is extremely strong in bending and so will not crack under adverse soil conditions.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multiple_piers_in_shallow_pits\">Multiple piers in shallow pits</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Multiple piers in shallow pits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Some older low-cost structures are elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings.

In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used.\n</p><p>One simple retrofit is to surround the column with a jacket of steel plates formed and welded into a single cylinder. The space between the jacket and the column is then filled with concrete, a process called grouting. Where soil or structure conditions require such additional modification, additional pilings may be driven near the column base and concrete pads linking the pilings to the pylon are fabricated at or below ground level. In the example shown not all columns needed to be modified to gain sufficient seismic resistance for the conditions expected.

Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, each of which is secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete.

Soil failure can occur on a slope, a <a href=\"/wiki/Slope_failure\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slope failure\">slope failure</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Landslide\" title=\"Landslide\">landslide</a>, or in a flat area due to <a href=\"/wiki/Soil_liquefaction\" title=\"Soil liquefaction\">liquefaction</a> of water-saturated sand and/or mud. Generally, deep pilings must be driven into stable soil (typically hard mud or sand) or to underlying bedrock or the slope must be stabilized. For buildings built atop previous landslides the practicality of retrofit may be limited by economic factors, as it is not practical to stabilize a large, deep landslide. The likelihood of landslide or soil failure may also depend upon seasonal factors, as the soil may be more stable at the beginning of a wet season than at the beginning of the dry season. Such a \"two season\" <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mediterranean_climate\" title=\"Mediterranean climate\">Mediterranean climate</a></i> is seen throughout <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>.\n</p><p>In some cases, the best that can be done is to reduce the entrance of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both water-saturated and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving <i>en masse</i>, carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to  monolithic concrete foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building will no longer be in its proper location.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Utility_pipes_and_cables:_risks\">Utility pipes and cables: risks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Utility pipes and cables: risks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Natural_gas\" title=\"Natural gas\">Natural gas</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Propane\" title=\"Propane\">propane</a> supply pipes to structures often prove especially dangerous during and after earthquakes.

This tube was constructed at the bottom of <a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay\" title=\"San Francisco Bay\">San Francisco Bay</a> through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) <a href=\"/wiki/Spaghetti\" title=\"Spaghetti\">spaghetti</a> in a bowl of <a href=\"/wiki/Gelatin_dessert\" title=\"Gelatin dessert\">gelatin dessert</a>. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding <a href=\"/wiki/Slip_joint\" title=\"Slip joint\">slip joint</a> was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark <a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco_Ferry_Building\" title=\"San Francisco Ferry Building\">Ferry Building</a>.\n</p><p>The engineers of the construction consortium PBTB (Parsons Brinckerhoff-Tudor-Bechtel) used the best estimates of ground motion available at the time, now known to be insufficient given modern computational analysis methods and geotechnical knowledge. Unexpected settlement of the tube has reduced the amount of slip that can be accommodated without failure. These factors have resulted in the slip joint being designed too short to ensure survival of the tube under possible (perhaps even likely) large earthquakes in the region. To correct this deficiency the slip joint must be extended to allow for additional movement, a modification expected to be both expensive and technically and logistically difficult. Other retrofits to the BART tube include vibratory consolidation of the tube's overfill to avoid potential liquefying of the overfill, which has now been completed. (Should the overfill fail there is a danger of portions of the tube rising from the bottom, an event which could potentially cause failure of the section connections.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bridge_retrofit\">Bridge retrofit</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Bridge retrofit\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Bridge\" title=\"Bridge\">Bridges</a> have several failure modes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Expansion_rockers\">Expansion rockers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: Expansion rockers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many short bridge spans are statically anchored at one end and attached to rockers at the other.

Wood is one of the best materials for earthquake-resistant construction since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry.

These connections are intended to prevent the braced walls from rocking up and down when subjected to back-and-forth forces at the top of the braced walls, not to resist the wall or house \"jumping\" off the foundation (which almost never occurs).</li>\n<li>In two story buildings using \"platform framing\" (sometimes called \"western\" style construction, where walls are progressively erected upon the lower story's upper diaphragm, unlike \"eastern\" or <i>balloon framing</i>), the upper walls are connected to the lower walls with tension elements. In some cases, connections may be extended vertically to include retention of certain roof elements.  This sort of strengthening is usually very costly with respect to the strength gained.</li>\n<li>Vertical posts are secured to the beams or other members they support.  This is particularly important where loss of support would lead to collapse of a segment of a building.  Connections from posts to beams cannot resist appreciable side-to-side forces;  it is much more important to strengthen around the perimeter of a building (bracing the cripple-walls and supplementing foundation-to-wood-framing connections) than it is to reinforce post-to-beam connections.</li></ul>\n<p>Wooden framing is efficient when combined with masonry, if the structure is properly designed. In Turkey, the traditional houses (bagdadi) are made with this technology. In <a href=\"/wiki/El_Salvador\" title=\"El Salvador\">El Salvador</a>, wood and bamboo are used for residential construction.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reinforced_and_unreinforced_masonry\">Reinforced and unreinforced masonry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40\" title=\"Edit section: Reinforced and unreinforced masonry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In many parts of developing countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced or in some cases reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form in the early part of the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.\n</p><p>In the western United States, much of what is seen as masonry is actually brick or stone veneer. Current construction rules dictate the amount of <i>tie\u2013back</i> required, which consist of metal straps secured to vertical structural elements. These straps extend into mortar courses, securing the veneer to the primary structure. Older structures may not secure this sufficiently for seismic safety. A weakly secured veneer in a house interior (sometimes used to face a fireplace from floor to ceiling) can be especially dangerous to occupants. Older masonry chimneys are also dangerous if they have substantial vertical extension above the roof. These are prone to breakage at the roofline and may fall into the house in a single large piece. For retrofit, additional supports may be added;  however, it is extremely expensive to strengthen an existing masonry chimney to conform with contemporary design standards.  It is best to simply remove the extension and replace it with lighter materials, with special metal flue replacing the flue tile and a wood structure replacing the masonry. This may be matched against existing brickwork by using very thin veneer (similar to a tile, but with the appearance of a brick).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Destructive_testing\" title=\"Destructive testing\">Destructive testing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Earthquake_engineering\" title=\"Earthquake engineering\">Earthquake engineering</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Earthquake_Engineering_Research_Institute\" title=\"Earthquake Engineering Research Institute\">Earthquake Engineering Research Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Earthquake_simulation\" title=\"Earthquake simulation\">Earthquake simulation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mitigation_of_seismic_motion\" title=\"Mitigation of seismic motion\">Mitigation of seismic motion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/OpenSees\" title=\"OpenSees\">OpenSees</a> \u2013 Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge\" title=\"San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge\">San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge</a> \u2013 An extensive retrofit of the western portion is now complete and construction of large portions of the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_span_replacement_of_the_San_Francisco_%E2%80%93_Oakland_Bay_Bridge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge\">eastern replacement span</a> is underway.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Seismic_hazard\" title=\"Seismic hazard\">Seismic hazard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Seismic_performance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seismic performance\">Seismic performance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Superadobe\" title=\"Superadobe\">Superadobe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Tsunami-proof_building\" title=\"Tsunami-proof building\">Tsunami-proof building</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Vibration_control\" title=\"Vibration control\">Vibration control</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seismic_retrofit&amp;action=edit&amp;section=42\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Link1-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Link1_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/10092/204/1/12605029_Main.pdf\">NZSEE Bulletin 39(2)-June 2006</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Link2-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Link2_2-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147485435\">ASCE-SEI 41</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003840/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147485435\">Archived</a> 2013-03-03 at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Link3-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Link3_3-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nzsee.org.nz/PUBS/2006AISBEGUIDELINES_Corr_06a.pdf\">NZSEE 2006</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081120021105/http://www.nzsee.org.nz/PUBS/2006AISBEGUIDELINES_Corr_06a.pdf\">Archived</a> 2008-11-20 at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Reitherman-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Reitherman_4-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Reitherman, Robert (2012). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877\"><i>Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History</i></a>.
