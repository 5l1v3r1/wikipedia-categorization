Home construction is the process of constructing a home. Beginning with simple pre-historic shelters, home construction techniques have evolved to produce the vast multitude of living accommodations available today.  Different levels of wealth and power have warranted various sizes, luxuries, and even defenses in a "home".  Environmental considerations and cultural influences have created an immensely diverse collection of architectural styles.  From castles to mud thatches, mansions to shanties, the 'home' has grown to represent a seemingly limitless array of structures. While homes may have originated in pre-history, there are many notable stages through which cultures pass to reach the current level of modernization.  Countries and communities throughout the world currently exhibit very diverse concepts of housing, at many different stages of home development. Two methods for constructing a home can be distinguished: the method in which architects simply assume free choice of materials and parts, and the method in which reclaimed materials are used, and the house is thus during its entire construction a "work in progress" (meaning every single aspect of it is subject to change at any given time, depending on what materials are found). The second method has been used throughout history, as materials have always been scarce. Nowadays, more advanced sourcing maps (such as the Superuse.org materials map) have become available. The modern family home has many more systems and facets of construction than one might initially believe.  With sufficient study, an average person can understand everything there is to know about any given phase of home construction.  The "do it yourself" (DIY) boom of the late twentieth century was due, in large part, to this fact. And an international proliferation of kitset home and prefabricated home suppliers, often consisting of components of Chinese origin has further increased supply and made DIY home building more prevalent.
