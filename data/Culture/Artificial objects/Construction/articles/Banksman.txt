In Irish and British civil engineering, a banksman is the person who directs the operation of a crane or larger vehicle from the point near where loads are attached and detached. The term 'dogman' may be used in Australia and New Zealand, while 'spotter' is the more common term in United States.  Crane or large vehicle drivers do not always have clear visibility of the loading area, especially when tower cranes are employed. The banksman is in charge of the crane movements from the point of loading and unloading. They may use a system of hand signals or a radio link. A banksman may also be responsible for directing the movement and loading/unloading of lorries, or directing the movement of other plant.   A banksman may also control the movements of an excavator, by carefully monitoring the bucket for any obstructions or underground services.
