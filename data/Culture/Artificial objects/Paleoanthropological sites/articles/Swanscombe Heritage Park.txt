Swanscombe Skull Site or Swanscombe Heritage Park is a 3.9 hectares (9.6 acres) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Swanscombe in north-west Kent.   It contains two Geological Conservation Review sites,   and a National Nature Reserve.  The park lies in a former gravel quarry, Barnfield Pit.  The area was already famous for the finds of numerous Palaeolithic-era handaxes—mostly Acheulean and Clactonian artifacts, some as much as 400,000 years old—when in 1935/1936 work at Barnfield Pit uncovered two fossilised skull fragments. These fragments came to be known as the remains of Swanscombe Man. The bones were later found to have belonged to a young woman.  The Swanscombe skull has been identified as early Neanderthal (pre-Neanderthal, Homo heidelbergensis), dating to the Hoxnian Interglacial around 400,000 years ago.   Swanscombe  is one of only two sites in Britain which have yielded Lower Paleolithic human fossils, the other being Boxgrove Quarry, where   500,000-year-old leg bones and teeth ("Boxgrove Man"), were found. The skull fragments were found in the lower middle terrace gravels at a depth of almost 8 metres beneath the surface. They were found by Alvan T. Marston, an amateur archaeologist who visited the pit between quarrying operations to search for flint tools. A third, matching fragment of the same skull was found in 1955 by Bertram and John Wymer.  Further excavations, carried out between 1968-1972 by Dr. John d'Arcy Waechter, uncovered more animal bone and flint tools, and established the extent of a former shoreline that the bones were found on.  Most of the bone finds are now in the Natural History Museum in London, with the stone finds at the British Museum. The other key paleolithic sites in the UK are Happisburgh, Pakefield, Pontnewydd, Kents Cavern, Paviland, and Gough's Cave.
