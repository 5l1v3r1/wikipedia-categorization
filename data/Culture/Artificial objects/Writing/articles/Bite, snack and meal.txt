"Wash a car without leaving streaks - research shows special technique works best" When the option is available, the bite links to the content. "Wash your car the right way and you'll avoid annoying streaks, while saving water. Research from the Car Washing Institute of America's new study shows that starting at the top washing your way down works best. Avoid streaks, reduce damage from grit and reduce water use by 50% when you start at the top." The snack then links to the content. Example: a lengthy article on washing a car.
