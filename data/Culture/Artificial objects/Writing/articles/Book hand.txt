A book hand was any of several stylized handwriting scripts used during ancient and medieval times. It was intended for legibility and often used in transcribing official documents (prior to the development of printing and similar technologies). In palaeography and calligraphy the term hand is still used to refer to a named style of writing, such as the chancery hand.
