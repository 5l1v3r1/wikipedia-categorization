One of the potential attractions of these hybrid devices is the possibility that they can be designed to exhibit higher degrees of adaptability and autonomy than is possible with solid-state devices. Examples include: artificial organelle-like systems that could accomplish the synthesis of complex biomacromolecules, or synthetic multi-cellular structures that incorporate specific sensing and reporting functionalities, such that they could be used in hybrid devices for chemical or biological agent sensing.\n</p><p>Semi-biotic systems is an emerging area of research within the broader area of <a href=\"/wiki/Synthetic_Biology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Synthetic Biology\">Synthetic Biology</a>. In the European community a programme entitled NEONUCLEI was funded under FP7 whose aim is to generate synthetic analogues of cell\nnuclei capable of sustaining transcription, in self-assembled systems comprising DNA, macromolecules (or nanoparticles), and lipids <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/nest/docs/5-nest-synthetic-080507.pdf\">[1]</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Semi-biotic_systems&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Hybrot\" title=\"Hybrot\">Hybrot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Animat\" title=\"Animat\">Animat</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2163\nCached time: 20180916185402\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 5/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:19343278-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916185402 and revision id 797595293\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Semi-Biotic Systems","*":"Synthetic_biology"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Animat"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hybrot"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Synthetic Biology"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/nest/docs/5-nest-synthetic-080507.pdf"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Semi-biotic_systems","byteoffset":1252,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Semi-biotic systems","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Semi-Biotic Systems"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7449285"}]}}
