The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)  is a proposed data standard for exchanging synthetic biology designs between software packages.  It has been under development by the SBOL Developers Group since 2008. This group aims to develop the standard in a way that is open and democratic in order to include as many interests as possible and to avoid domination by a single company. The group also aims to evolve the standard over time as the field of synthetic biology evolves.  A graphical language called SBOL visual has also been created to visualize SBOL designs.
