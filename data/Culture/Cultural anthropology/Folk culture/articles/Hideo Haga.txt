Hideo Haga  (芳賀 日出男 Haga Hideo, October 10, 1921—) is known for his photography of traditional Japanese festivals and folk culture. Hideo Haga was born in 1921, Dalian, Manchuria on October 10, 1921. He took up the camera as a child, encouraged by his father, an engineer whose hobby was photography. In 1941 he enrolled in Literature at Keio University, where he also joined the camera club, often to the neglect of his studies. Lectures by the folklorist Shinobu Orikuchi (1887 - 1953), which he joined when he heard that he could get credits for attendance, were a strong influence on his future interests. He graduated with a degree in Literature in 1944. During the war he was recruited to make aerial photographs for the navy, and in 1946 found employment with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone company. Retrenched, he returned to live with his father and started to devote himself to photography of traditional culture. Heibonsha publishers issued his first book, on the Japanese rice festival,  in 1959. A further thirty-five books followed. Haga Library Co. which he established in 1985 markets his over 300,000 stock photos, made over sixty years, of festivals and folk culture in Japan and other countries. In 1950 he was one of the founders of the Japan Professional Photographers Society (JPS) of which he became chairman for seven years in 1981. In 1955 a photograph of a heavily pregnant woman against a blurred street scene by Hideo Haga (Pregnant Japanese Woman Hurrying on Her Way, 1952) was selected, for its (then) unusual public perspective on pregnancy,  by Edward Steichen for MoMA’s The Family of Man which was seen by nine million people as it toured thirty-seven countries.  He was producer for the Festival Plaza at Expo '70 in Osaka. His book, Folk Customs of Japan - Festivals & Performing Arts, (Creo, 1997, ISBN 4877360158) shows his B/W photos of festivals taken all over Japan since the 1950s.
