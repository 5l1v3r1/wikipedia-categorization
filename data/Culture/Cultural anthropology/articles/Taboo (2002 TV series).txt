Taboo is a documentary television series that premiered in 2002 on the National Geographic Channel. The program is an educational look into "taboo" rituals and traditions practiced in some societies, yet forbidden and illegal in others.  Each hour-long episode details a specific topic, such as marriage or initiation rituals, and explores how such topics are viewed throughout the world. Taboo generally focuses on the most misunderstood, despised, or disagreed-upon activities, jobs, and roles. National Geographic TV producers did not produce Taboo in seasons of fixed episode counts, thus the number of episodes in each production batch varies wildly.   The production order does not necessarily match the order episodes were arranged into for DVD "season" boxsets. "Death" is not featured on the National Geographic page for the show. However it does appear on the first season boxset. This "season" consists of episodes from a spin-off series: "Taboo USA".
