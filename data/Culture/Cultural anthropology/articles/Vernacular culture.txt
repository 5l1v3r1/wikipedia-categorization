Vernacular culture is the cultural forms made and organised by ordinary, often indigenous people, as distinct from the high culture of an elite.  One feature of vernacular culture is that it is informal.  Such culture is generally engaged in on a non-profit and voluntary basis, and is almost never funded by the state The term is used in the modern study of geography and cultural studies. It generally implies a cultural form that differs markedly from a deeply rooted folk culture, and also from tightly organised subcultures and religious cultures. One could also include the design of home-made vernacular signage and notices Some of these activities, such as gardens, family albums, and grave memorials, will be organized on a family basis. Larger activities are usually organized through informal variations of the British committee system, consisting of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, agenda, minutes, and an annual meeting with elections based on a quorum.
