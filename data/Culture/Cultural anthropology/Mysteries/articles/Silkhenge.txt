Silkhenge structures are a means of spider reproduction used by one or more currently-unknown species of spider. It typically consists of a central "spire" constructed of spider silk, containing one to two eggs, surrounded by a sort of fence of silk in a circle.  In 2013, Georgia Tech student Troy Alexander was visiting Tambopata National Reserve in Peru. He found, under a tarpaulin, a tiny bit of silk in a circular pattern one inch wide. Searching around, he found three more. He posted a picture  on Reddit asking for help identifying it. No information was forthcoming, as this turned out to be a completely unknown phenomenon. His discovery acquired the name silkhenge because of its similarity to Stonehenge. At the end of that year, an eight-day expedition led by Phil Torres found dozens more examples of this phenomenon, generally on the trunks of bamboo and cecropia trees.  Spiderlings hatching from the structures were documented, but like many baby arthropods they lacked the features typically used to identify adults, and none lived to adulthood, and they invariably died before reaching adulthood. DNA tests were also inconclusive, so the species creating these structures remained unidentified. A video was posted on YouTube of spiderlings hatching.   Among the hypothesized reasons for the fence are the possibility that it is intended to trap mites that live in the same environment, as food for the hatchlings, or to protect the egg and baby spider from ants.
