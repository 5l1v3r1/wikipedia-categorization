His initial post was lecturer in the Department of English in the (now-defunct) College of General Education. Thereafter, he taught in the Department of Social Structure and Change in the Graduate School of Information Sciences and was an associate professor of society and culture at the (now-defunct) School of Language and Culture. In 2001 he was appointed professor of mediated sociology in the Graduate School of International Cultural Studies (GSICS), becoming the first foreigner to secure tenure at Tohoku University since its establishment in 1907. Twice Chair of the Department of Multi-Cultural Societies, he helped build a small, but dynamic graduate program on media, culture and society. He retired in 2014 after nearly 27 years of service.\n</p><p>In 2000 Holden served on the planning committee of Tohoku University's \"International Symposium on Research and Education in the 21st Century,\" (ISRE 2000), an assembly that led to exchange agreements with 29 universities and 114 university departments from 31 nations. In 2005 he was part of the working group that designed the so-called Internet School (ISTU), the university's first step toward establishing a distance education program.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In 2008 he was a Visiting Lecturer in Geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching a course on sports globalization; in 2013, he was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University's Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, working on \"<i>Ukiyo</i>-ad\", a book on Japanese advertising, cultural communication and media theory.\n</p><p>During his career, Holden held executive positions in various international professional associations, including two terms (8 years) as Chair of the Gender and Communication section of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR), 4 years as Vice-President of the Asia-Pacific Sociology Association (APSA), and 4 years as Executive Committee Member of Anthropology of Japan in Japan (AJJ).

Funded and published research has explored: <a href=\"/wiki/Cell_phone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cell phone\">cell phones</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a>, television, advertising, <a href=\"/wiki/Novels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Novels\">novels</a>, children\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Picture_books\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Picture books\">picture books</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Film\" title=\"Film\">film</a>. The work has generally, but not exclusively, centered on Japan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Reflecting his familiarity with various communication platforms, his scholarship has appeared in the <i>Sage Handbook of Media Studies </i> (a global survey of advertising), <i>The Encyclopedia of Television</i> (a historical overview of Japanese TV), the first book ever on <i>Japanese Cybercultures</i> (a chapter on Internet dating), and <i>Global Youth</i> (a study of adolescent cell phone use in Japan). His Internet dating study, co-authored with Takako Tsuruki,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> has been extensively cited,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> as has his grounded theorization of media-reproduced \"surveillance\" in Japanese society.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Despite the core attention to media/tion, Holden\u2019s overriding concern has been the interaction between indigenous and exogenous values and practices \u2013 what is generally referred to as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Globalization\" title=\"Globalization\">globalization</a>\". This intellectual thread is directly traceable back to Agnew\u2019s \"landmark\" study of place,<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> completed during Holden's final year at SU.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> For Holden, it is the mediation between people, media technologies and communication content in specific contexts that best accounts for political, cultural, and social phenomena, (and thereby reveals the contours and extent of globalization). This focus is most evident and best captured in the title of his 2006 book <i>medi@sia: Global media/tion in and out of context</i> (co-edited with Timothy J. Scrase). Even so, this geo-symbolic mediation can be discerned a decade earlier, in his comparative content analysis of 3,059 Japanese and American television ads,<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> and his study of differential presentations of the body in national advertisements<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> \u2013 a research topic that also bears some echoes of Glassner\u2019s body study, launched during the latter's time at SU.\n</p><p>The question of place also arises in Holden\u2019s widely circulated<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> updating, to Japan, of <a href=\"/wiki/Goffman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Goffman\">Goffman</a>'s classic \u201cgender advertisements\u201d. This Japanese study, Medcalf noted, demonstrates that discrepancies in the hetero-normative narrative are \u201cnot a result of post-modern, globalizing transformations, but, rather, of long standing internal cultural and historical processes and contradictions.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Such complex relationships between gender, media and local distinctiveness were further explored in a much-sampled 2005 article on masculinities in Japanese cooking shows.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Holden has also employed other approaches to expose the distinctiveness of place-based ideas and practices. For instance, qualitative, semiotic-attuned content analysis demonstrated the integral role color plays in generating cultural meaning in American and Japanese advertising.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  The significance of such research, Patrick Hunout has observed, is that:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Holden points to numerous localized practices, which do not transcend national/cultural borders. Context-specific meanings serve to underscore the limits on globalization; they indicate the large degree to which cultures communicate in distinct, unique ways. Coloration becomes more than a semiological tool; it provides insight into societal ontology. It can be used to explain how cultures have been organized, how they \u201cthink\u201d and even suggest, at times, why they act.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, not all of his studies of mediation in context have found clear-cut divergence. His ethnographic study of the advent of <a href=\"/wiki/Political_consultant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Political consultant\">political consultants</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/TV_spot\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TV spot\">spot</a>-centered campaigns in the 1996 Japanese national elections<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was his content analysis of what he has labeled \u201cadentity\u201d. In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous\u2014insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West. Appraising the implications of Holden's grounded theorization, Kenji Kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Non-Academic_Involvements\">Non-Academic Involvements</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Todd_Joseph_Miles_Holden&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Non-Academic Involvements\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Between 1989 and 1994 Holden served as Head Coach of the men\u2019s basketball team at Tohoku University.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> A perennial Division 2 bottom-dweller, the team ascended to Division 1 in Holden\u2019s second season at the helm.

Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life\u2014what Holden calls \u201cperipatacity\u201d\u2014and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life\u2019s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan\u2014trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, <i>Peripatetic Postcards</i> operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.\n</p><p>In 2013 Holden published a novel, <i>Mr. Big Maus</i>, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. <i>Mr. Big Maus</i> is a blend of late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Needs reliable, third-party sources (September 2014)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Needs reliable, third-party sources (September 2014)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character\u2019s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Needs reliable, third-party sources (September 2014)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Needs reliable, third-party sources (September 2014)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape\u2014reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants\u2014as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.\n</p><p>Holden's current projects include two novels about the events surrounding Japan's triple disaster of March 11, 2011: <i>Tsunami</i> and <i>Escape from Sonoyo</i>. The former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance through the eyes of victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. The result can be read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation\u2019s history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Needs reliable, third-party sources (September 2014)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>\n</p><p>Other projects in various stages of development include: <i>Red Dot, Orange Rock, Blues</i>, an autobiographical meditation on being and becoming, based on Holden's six years coaching men\u2019s collegiate and women\u2019s professional basketball in Japan; <i>The Seekers of Wisdom</i>, a novel blending the prodigal return, philosophical detection, high school sports, the literary canon, hard-boiled mystery and police procedural; and <i>Orphan 7Y-05-O</i>, a dystopian tale centering on a training school for terrorists and, possibly, capitalist democracy's inescapable future.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Personal\">Personal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Todd_Joseph_Miles_Holden&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Personal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Holden was born in <a href=\"/wiki/Pasadena,_California\" title=\"Pasadena, California\">Pasadena, California</a> in 1958.
