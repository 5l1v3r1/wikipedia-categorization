Mary Lewis Harper Milne known as Mrs. Leslie Milne (1860â€“1932) was an English anthropologist who traveled extensively and wrote about the ethnic peoples of the Shan State in Northern Burma. Her best known book, The Shans at Home,  was an account of the cultural practices and day-to-day life of the Shan people of the village of Namkham in Shan State and was based on the many months she spent living in that village. She was also the author of The Home of an Eastern Clan,  a book about the life and culture of the Palaung people, and wrote the first,  and what is possibly the only English-Palaung dictionary. Mary Milne is the daughter of Carter Milne and the paternal-granddaughter of William Milne.
