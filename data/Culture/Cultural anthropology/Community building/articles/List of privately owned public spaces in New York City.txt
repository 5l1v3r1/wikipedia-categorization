Privately owned public spaces (POPS) in New York City were introduced in a 1961 zoning resolution.  The city offers zoning concessions to commercial and residential developers in exchange for a variety of spaces accessible and usable for the public.  There are approximately 503 POPS  at 320 buildings in New York City and are found principally in Manhattan.  Spaces range from extended sidewalks to indoor atriums with seating and amenities.  International attention was brought to POPS during the Occupy Wall Street movement begun in 2011 in Zuccotti Park.  List of noteworthy spaces.   See also 6Â½ Avenue Downtown Long Island City
