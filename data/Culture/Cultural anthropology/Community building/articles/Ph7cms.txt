 pH7CMS (formerly known as pH7 Social Dating CMS) is an open source Social Dating software that allows creation of online communities and social dating services. pH7CMS is written in PHP 5.6,  is object-oriented and uses the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller). The software is based on the homemade pH7Framework and is designed with the KISS principle in mind. For better flexibility, the software uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) abstraction which allows the choice of the database. The principle of development is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds (not duplicate code). It also wants to be fast, low-resource-intensive, extremely powerful and very secure. pH7CMS is distributed in two distinct packages. One free with less features, no update/upgrade script and only for personal sites and another one sold for commercial sites, including premium features and update/upgrade scripts. pH7CMS is included with 31 natives modules pH7CMS Core uses its homemade pH7Tpl and the installer uses Smarty. In addition, pH7CMS is also included with the PH7Xsl, a XSLT PHP template engine. In almost each version, the installation of the software is improved and is easier. pH7CMS is also included with a Web setup wizard and is also available on Softaculous   Recommended Social Networking Software by BestHostingSearch
