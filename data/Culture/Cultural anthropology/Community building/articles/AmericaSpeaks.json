The conclusions from these meetings are then brought to the attention of decision-makers in the hopes that citizen input will influence policy.\n</p><p>In 1994, after more than ten years of service in the public sector, America<i>Speaks</i> president Carolyn Lukensmeyer had grown concerned that citizens were increasingly being shut out of public decision-making processes. Carolyn traveled the United States and held vision meetings to conceptualize a model for large-scale citizen engagement forums, and a vision for how these forums could be used in national dialogues on key public policy issues.\n</p><p>America<i>Speaks</i>\u2019 mission is to create innovative mechanisms through which citizens can enhance their voice in local, regional, and national governance, and to renew democracy through the development of a national infrastructure for democratic deliberation and citizen engagement.\n</p><p>In January 2014, America<i>Speaks</i> closed its doors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"21st_Century_Town_Meeting\">21st Century Town Meeting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AmericaSpeaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: 21st Century Town Meeting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>AmericaSpeaks\u2019 21st Century Town Meeting is intended to create engaging, meaningful opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision making.

The 21st Century Town Meeting focuses on discussion and deliberation among citizens rather than speeches, question-and-answer sessions or panel presentations. The purpose of the Town Hall Meeting is to gather diverse groups of citizens who will participate in round-table discussions (10-12 people per table) and deliberate in depth about key policy issues. Each table discussion is supported by a trained facilitator to keep participants on task. Participants receive discussion guides that present further information about the issues under consideration.\n</p><p>Technology collects the individual table discussions and the results are compiled into a set of collective recommendations. Each table submits ideas using wireless <a href=\"/wiki/Groupware\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Groupware\">groupware</a> computers and each participant can vote on specific proposals with <a href=\"/wiki/Keypad_polling\" title=\"Keypad polling\">keypad polling</a>. These two pieces of technology allow for real-time reporting and voting. Results from discussions are presented to participants within minutes and polling results within seconds. The entire group votes on the final recommendations to submit to decision makers. Before the meeting ends, results from the meeting are put into a report, which is distributed to participants, decision makers and the <a href=\"/wiki/News_media\" title=\"News media\">news media</a> as they leave.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"21st_Century_Summit\">21st Century Summit</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AmericaSpeaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: 21st Century Summit\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The 21st Century Summit was created to help organization leaders tap into the collective wisdom of their constituents and stakeholders through large-scale meetings.

The money is the first  step toward financing a city recovery plan officials say will cost  $1.1 billion. When releasing the money, The Louisiana Recovery Authority board recognized that the Unified New Orleans Plan was a citizen- driven recovery vision developed with \"unprecedented participation and representation from every part of the city.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CaliforniaSpeaks\">CaliforniaSpeaks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AmericaSpeaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: CaliforniaSpeaks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Nearly 3,500 Californians gathered in eight cities on August 11, 2007 in an interactive forum on\nhealth care priorities called <a href=\"/wiki/California_Speaks\" title=\"California Speaks\">California Speaks</a>, and 82 percent advocated major changes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The project was created and led by AmericaSpeaks.\n</p><p>The most popular suggestions called for putting people before profit, prioritizing wellness and prevention, and making health care affordable and accessible to everyone. The statewide conversation was created to enable ordinary Californians to tell state lawmakers what they think about the current health care reform proposals.\n</p><p>Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, Senate President pro Tem Don Perata, Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines and other Republican and Democratic legislators attended the event. Each of the lawmakers emphasized his commitment to passing health care reform in 2007.\n</p><p>The real-time, nonpartisan health care discussion blended small-group dialogue with cutting-edge technology. Satellite television, webcast, simultaneous television broadcast, groupware and individual voting keypads were used.

The event took place in 60 different cities, including 19 primary meeting sites hosted by AmericaSpeaks and more than 40 smaller volunteer-led conversations.  All sites were linked through the use of technology, including satellite-based live webcast and individual voting keypads.  The priorities that emerged from the discussion were to be presented to Congress and President Obama, as well as the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform  and the Bi-Partisan Policy Center\u2019s Debt Reduction Task Force.\n</p><p>The AmericaSpeaks: Our Budget, Our Economy was politically neutral, which they tried to accomplish by assembling a diverse <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://usabudgetdiscussion.org/about-2/our-funders/\">group of funders</a>, a diverse <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://usabudgetdiscussion.org/about-2/national-advisory-committee/\">National Advisory Committee</a>, and selecting participants that were demographically representative in terms of race, age, income, and political orientation. Despite this, the event received criticism from both the right and the left.  Dean Baker, a left-leaning blogger, wrote that Our Budget, Our Economy materials would \"guarantee\" large cuts to Social Security and Medicare, while <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4262098/tax-hikes-needed-to-cut-debt\">Fox News reported</a> that the event was slanted toward raising taxes. There was also support for the national discussion, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-newmark/americaspeaks-town-halls_b_617303.html\">this post from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark</a>, as well as a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/archon-fung/public-deliberation-the-l_b_627983.html\">piece from Harvard Professor Archon Fung</a>.\n</p><p>The preliminary results of the June 26 discussion differed from Baker's predictions.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://usabudgetdiscussion.org/written-testimony-for-the-national-commission-on-fiscal-responsibility-and-reform/\">In a blog post</a>, AmericaSpeaks President Carolyn Lukensmeyer detail the results presented to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform for its public meeting on Wednesday, June 30, 2010.  Some highly supported proposals included a raise tax rates on corporate income and those earning more than $1 million, a reduction in military spending by 10 to 15 percent, and a carbon tax and a securities-transaction tax.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advancing_the_Field_of_Deliberative_Democracy\">Advancing the Field of Deliberative Democracy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AmericaSpeaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Advancing the Field of Deliberative Democracy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>AmericaSpeaks is dedicated to advancing citizen deliberation and aims to one day create an infrastructure in the United States that deeply incorporates citizens into the decision-making process.
