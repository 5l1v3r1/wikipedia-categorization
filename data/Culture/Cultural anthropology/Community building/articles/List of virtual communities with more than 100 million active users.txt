 This is a list of current virtual communities with more than 100 million active users. As of  2016[update], 46% of the world's human population (or 3.4 billion) and 4.15 billion have, at the end of December 2017, used the services of the Internet within the past year—over 100 times more people than in 1995 (see Global Internet usage).    Brazil Note: An "active user" is defined as a user who has interacted with the community in the last 30 days while logged in.   This metric is different from monthly unique visitors, which includes unregistered readers who are only consumers and not creators of content. See also monthly active users.
