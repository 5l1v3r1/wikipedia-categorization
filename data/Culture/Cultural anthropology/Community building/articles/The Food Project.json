Participants are hired in the Spring, with equal representation from the city and nearby suburbs, and are divided into crews of about 10 crew workers, an assistant crew leader and a crew leader.  The program is 8 weeks long (now 6.5 due to budget), beginning in late June and ending in August to coincide with the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Massachusetts_public_school&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Massachusetts public school (page does not exist)\">Massachusetts public school</a> calendar.  There is also an academic year program and an internship program, both of which run throughout the year, though with fewer participants than the Summer Program.\n</p><p>While The Food Project is an employer, the experience it offers youth is far more extensive than most jobs.  Throughout the summer, regular workshops are held to discuss <a href=\"/wiki/Community_building\" title=\"Community building\">community building</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Urban_improvement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Urban improvement (page does not exist)\">urban improvement</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture\" title=\"Sustainable agriculture\">sustainable agriculture</a>, and a wide variety of other related topics.  Activities are designed to engage participants in discourse centered around particular themes. Educators are often recruited to lead these activities, which can include brainstorming, group discussion and journal writing.  <b>Flip charts</b>, or large pads of paper mounted on easels, have become notoriously ubiquitous within the organization as a tool for these group discussions.\n</p><p>Crews are rotated throughout the growing season so each has experience working on the farms in Lincoln and Roxbury.  In addition to doing farmwork and harvesting, all crews also work in local hunger-relief institutions like the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pine_Street_Inn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pine Street Inn (page does not exist)\">Pine Street Inn</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=ReVision_House_and_Urban_Farm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"ReVision House and Urban Farm (page does not exist)\">ReVision House and Urban Farm</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rosie%27s_Place\" title=\"Rosie&#39;s Place\">Rosie's Place</a>, where they help serve food cooked from the vegetables they grow.  Using this paradigm, summer crew workers experience all aspects of their labor, from planting and harvesting to food donation.\n</p><p>The program also emphasizes good workplace practices by putting crew workers in unusually responsible roles.  Feedback or <b>\"Straight Talk\"</b> is an important tool and members within a crew give each other feedback in the form of compliments and <b>\"deltas\"</b>, or points for improvement.\n</p><p><b>Community lunches</b> have also become a summer tradition at the Lincoln farms.  Each week, a local chef or caterer is invited to cook lunch for crew workers, staff, parents and friends using vegetables grown and harvested by crews.  Several noted chefs from Boston, Cambridge and surrounding areas have cooked at community lunches and have helped bring about a high level of awareness about the program.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Program_structure\">Program structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Food_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Program structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Participants are grouped into crews of 10 <b>Crew Workers</b> and are led by a <b>Crew Leader</b>.  The Crew Leader is usually slightly older, around college age, and sometimes has had prior experience in the Food Project.  Each crew also has an <b>Assistant Crew Leader</b> who helps lead the crew and is typically a returning Crew Worker.  Each site has a <b>Site Supervisor</b> that oversees the function of the farm and manages the Crew Leaders.  There are also several <b>Growers</b> who are knowledgeable in aspects of agriculture and organic farming and who advise and help maintain the lots.  There are also several <b>interns</b> that help with the management and function of the program.\n</p><p>Hiring for all positions requires a formal application and interview, given once a year in the early Spring for summer crew workers.  The application process can be somewhat selective as the program is popular, although the program deeply emphasizes diversity and a sense of inclusiveness, and all are encouraged to apply.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Program_sites\">Program sites</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Food_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Program sites\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Food Project has 10 growing sites in total. Lincoln, Massachusetts, and several in Roxbury, Massachusetts.  The North Shore branch has a 1-acre (4,000&#160;m<sup>2</sup>) farm in Lynn and a 2-acre (8,100&#160;m<sup>2</sup>) farm in Beverly.  The main offices for The Food Project are located in Lincoln Center.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Community_Supported_Agriculture\">Community Supported Agriculture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Food_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Community Supported Agriculture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>One of the main tenets of The Food Project is that the land that the program uses is a part of the community and therefore must be integrated.  One of the innovative ways in which this is accomplished is through <a href=\"/wiki/Community_Supported_Agriculture\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Community Supported Agriculture\">Community Supported Agriculture</a> (CSA), an agricultural model founded in Japan (<a href=\"/wiki/Teikei\" title=\"Teikei\">teikei</a>) and implemented in the U.S. by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indian_Line_Farm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Indian Line Farm (page does not exist)\">Indian Line Farm</a>, in Massachusetts.  In this model, local consumers buy a share of the farm's harvest.  Produce from the harvest is then distributed at the farm to shareholders up to a defined limit.  Selection and volume depends on the time of year, but freshness is frequently unmatched by standard retail vendors because the food can be consumed immediately after harvesting.\n</p><p>The Food Project's 400 member CSA Farm Share program offers fresh vegetables, herbs and flowers and has pickup locations in Lincoln, Cambridge, Somerville, Arlington and Jamaica Plain.  They publish a CSA Newsletter which is distributed to all shareholders weekly.  Additionally, shareholders can harvest their produce themselves from specially designated plots at certain Food Project growing sites.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Program_milestones\">Program milestones</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Food_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Program milestones\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:blue;\">1991:</span> Founded by Ward Cheney in conjunction with the <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Audubon_Society\" title=\"Massachusetts Audubon Society\">Massachusetts Audubon Society</a>.<br />\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">1992:</span> First growing season funded with $100,000 and farmed on a 2.5-acre (10,000&#160;m<sup>2</sup>) plot on Drumlin Farm in Lincoln.<br />\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">1995:</span> Groundbreaking of the half-acre Langdon Street Lot in Roxbury.<br />\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">1996:</span> First growing season for the Langdon Street Lot.<br />\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">1997:</span> West Cottage Street Lot is cleared by summer crew workers and land is prepared for growing.<br />\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">1998:</span> A video, two books and many manuals document The Food Project's program and philosophy.
