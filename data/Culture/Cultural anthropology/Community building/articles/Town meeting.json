England towns</a>, <i>town meeting</i> can also refer to meetings of other governmental bodies, such as <a href=\"/wiki/School_district\" title=\"School district\">school districts</a> or water districts. While the uses and laws vary from state to state, the general form is for residents of the town or school district to gather once a year and act as a <a href=\"/wiki/Legislative_body\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Legislative body\">legislative body</a>, voting on operating budgets, laws, and other matters for the community's operation over the following 12 months.\n</p><p>In 1854 <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau\" title=\"Henry David Thoreau\">Henry David Thoreau</a> said, in a speech entitled \"Slavery in Massachusetts\":\n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>When, in some obscure country town, the farmers come together to a special town-meeting, to express their opinion on some subject which is vexing the land, that, I think, is the true Congress, and the most respectable one that is ever assembled in the United States.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The painting <a href=\"/wiki/Freedom_of_Speech_(painting)\" title=\"Freedom of Speech (painting)\">Freedom of Speech</a> depicts a scene from a town meeting.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Puritans\" title=\"Puritans\">Puritans</a>, who believed in <a href=\"/wiki/Congregationalist_church_governance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Congregationalist church governance\">Congregationalist church governance</a>, established town meetings when they established the various New England colonies.\n</p><p>Its usage in the English language can also cause confusion, since it is both an event, as in \"Freetown had its town meeting last Tuesday\", and an entity, as in \"Last Tuesday, Town Meeting decided to repave Howland Road.\"\n</p><p>In recent years, \"town meeting\" has also been used by political groups and political candidates as a label for moderated discussion group in which a large audience is invited. To avoid confusion, this sort of event is often called a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Town_hall_meeting\" title=\"Town hall meeting\">town hall meeting</a>.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Connecticut\">Connecticut</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_meeting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Connecticut\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Connecticut\" title=\"Connecticut\">Connecticut</a> town meetings are bound to a published agenda. For example, in Connecticut, a Town Meeting may discuss, but not alter, an article placed before them, nor may they place new items on the agenda. If a Town Meeting rejects a budget, a new Town Meeting must be called to consider the next proposed budget. State Law allows the Board of Selectmen to adopt an estimated tax rate and continue operating based on the previous budget in the event a Town Meeting has not adopted a new budget in time.\n</p><p>They also do not exercise the scope of legislative powers as is typically seen in Massachusetts; for example, while many Massachusetts towns adopt and modify land-use and building zoning regulations at Town Meeting, in Connecticut the Town Meeting would have \"adopted zoning\" as a concept for the town, however the actual writing and adopting of specific regulations fall to an elected Planning &amp; Zoning Board created by the adoption of zoning.\n</p><p>A moderator is chosen at each meeting. Meetings are typically held in school auditoriums, however they may be moved to larger venues as needed. Town meetings can physically meet in another town if necessary to find a proper space to host the attendance. Votes are taken by voice, and if close by show of hands. Meetings on controversial topics are often adjourned to a referendum conducted by machine vote on a date in the future. Such adjournment may come from the floor of the meeting, or by a petition for a paper or machine ballot filed before the meeting.\n</p><p>In towns with an Open Town Meeting, all <a href=\"/wiki/Registered_voter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Registered voter\">registered voters</a> of a town, and all persons owning at least $1,000 of taxable property, are eligible to participate in and vote at Town Meetings, with the exception of the election of officials. Representative Town Meetings used by some larger towns consist solely of a large number of members elected to office. Some towns utilize a so-called Financial Town Meeting, where an Open Town Meeting exists with limited <a href=\"/wiki/Jurisdiction\" title=\"Jurisdiction\">jurisdiction</a> to only vote on financial affairs and the town's legislative powers have been vested in a Town Council.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Maine\">Maine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_meeting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Maine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Maine\" title=\"Maine\">Maine</a>, the town meeting system originated during the period when Maine was a <a href=\"/wiki/District\" title=\"District\">district</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts\" title=\"Massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a>. Most cities and towns operate under the town meeting form of government or a modified version of it. Maine annual town meetings traditionally are held in March. Special town meetings also may be called from time to time.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Executive_(government)\" title=\"Executive (government)\">executive</a> agency of town government is an <a href=\"/wiki/Election\" title=\"Election\">elected</a>, part-time board, known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_Selectmen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Board of Selectmen\">Board of Selectmen</a> or Select Board, having three, five or seven members. Between sessions the board of selectmen interprets the <a href=\"/wiki/Policy\" title=\"Policy\">policy</a> set at Town Meeting and is assigned numerous duties including: approving all town non-school expenditures, authorizing <a href=\"/wiki/Highway\" title=\"Highway\">highway</a> construction and repair, serving as town purchasing agent for non-school items, issuing <a href=\"/wiki/License\" title=\"License\">licenses</a> and overseeing the conduct of all town activities. Often the part-time selectmen also serve as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_assessor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Town assessor (page does not exist)\">town assessors</a>, overseers of the poor as well as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Road_commissioner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Road commissioner (page does not exist)\">road commissioners</a>. Generally, there are other elected town officers whose duties are specified in law. These may include clerks, assessors, <a href=\"/wiki/Tax_collector\" title=\"Tax collector\">tax collector</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Treasurer\" title=\"Treasurer\">treasurer</a>, school committee, <a href=\"/wiki/Constable\" title=\"Constable\">constables</a>, and others.\n</p><p>In 1927 the town of <a href=\"/wiki/Camden,_Maine\" title=\"Camden, Maine\">Camden</a> adopted a special charter and became the first Maine town to apply the <a href=\"/wiki/Town_manager\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Town manager\">manager</a> concept to the town meeting-selectmen framework. Under this system, the manager is administrative head of town government, responsible to the select board for the administration of all departments under its control. The manager's duties include acting as purchasing agent, seeing that laws and ordinances are enforced, making appointments and removals, and fixing the compensation of appointees. (See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Council-manager_government\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Council-manager government\">Council-manager government</a>)\n</p><p>From 1927 to 1939, eleven other Maine towns adopted special act town meeting-selectmen-manager charters similar to the Camden charter. Today, 135 Maine towns have the town meeting-selectmen-manager system, while 209 use the town meeting-selectman system.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Massachusetts\">Massachusetts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_meeting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Massachusetts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG/220px-Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"318\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG/330px-Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG/440px-Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"1691\" data-file-height=\"2441\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Faneuil_Hall_Boston_Massachusetts.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Faneuil_Hall\" title=\"Faneuil Hall\">Faneuil Hall</a> in Boston</div></div></div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\nI am more and more convinced that, with reference to any public question, it is more important to know what the country thinks of it than what the city thinks.

The townspeople instead elect Town Meeting Members by precinct to represent them and to vote on the issues for them.

At this meeting, the town takes care of any outstanding housekeeping items it has remaining before the end of the current fiscal year, and prepares to enter the new fiscal year by approving the new fiscal year's budget. It may also vote on non-budgetary issues on the warrant, including the town's general and zoning bylaws.\n</p><p>An article may be placed on the warrant by the Selectmen, sometimes at the request of town departments, or by a petition signed by at least ten registered voters of the town.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_town_meetings\">Special town meetings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_meeting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Special town meetings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p><b>Special town meetings</b> are held whenever necessary, usually to deal with financial or other pertinent issues that develop between Annual Town Meetings.

While the Selectmen generally call such a meeting, voters may call one through petition, and the number of signatures required on a petition to call a Special Town Meeting is 200 or 20% of the registered voters, whichever number is lower.

When two or more towns share an operating budget for district activity that includes those towns, for example, a multi-town regional school district,  the governing body of that entity will typically issue each town an assessment for its operation. The town then includes its assessment as part of its budget.\n</p><p>If Town Meeting in one town votes to approve its assessment based on the figures provided, and Town Meeting in another town votes a lesser figure than it was assessed, the disagreement becomes problematic.  If the issue cannot be resolved by a revised budget submitted to subsequent additional individual town meetings, the governing body has the authority to call a meeting of all registered voters from all towns in the district: a Joint Town Meeting. The action of the Joint Town Meeting is binding for all involved communities.

Massachusetts cities do not have town meetings, because the legislative body is the elected city council, also sometimes called the board of aldermen or, in the case of cities styled as \"Town of _____\", the town council. However, as noted, the official style of a city or town is defined in its charter, and there is no legal barrier to cities calling themselves \"town\" or vice versa. As a result, not all of the municipalities that entitled <i>Town of _____</i> have a Town Meeting legislative body. (Only communities with a population of at least 12,000 are allowed to adopt a city form of government.)\n</p><p>Common practice distinguishes between a \"town meeting\" (with an <a href=\"/wiki/Article_(grammar)\" title=\"Article (grammar)\">article</a>), which may refer to any such gathering, even if municipal business is not the subject, and \"Town Meeting\" (never an article), which always refers to the legislative governing body of a town.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Hampshire\">New Hampshire</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_meeting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: New Hampshire\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/New_Hampshire\" title=\"New Hampshire\">New Hampshire</a>, towns, village districts (which can deal with various government activities but usually concern public water supplies)<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and <a href=\"/wiki/School_district\" title=\"School district\">school districts</a> have the option of choosing one of two types of annual meeting: Traditional meetings, and ballot-vote meetings that are known informally as \"SB&#160;2\" or \"Senate Bill&#160;2\".

Residents vote in an SB&#160;2 election at a polling place throughout the day. They may also vote by absentee ballot. Municipalities that have adopted the SB 2 form of government may switch back to the traditional town meeting form by a 3/5 majority vote.\n</p><p>Under SB&#160;2, a first session, called a \"Deliberative Session\", is held about a month prior to the town election. This session is similar in many ways to the traditional town meeting. However, unlike the town meeting, while the wording and dollar amounts of proposed ballot measures may be amended, no actual voting on the merits of the proposals takes place. The second session, held on a set election day, is when issues such as the town's budget and other measures, known as warrant articles, are voted upon. When adopting SB&#160;2, towns or school districts may hold elections on the second Tuesday in March, the second Tuesday in April, or the second Tuesday in May. The election dates may be changed by majority vote. If a vote is taken to approve the change of the local elections, the date becomes effective the following year.\n</p><p>In 2002, according to the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire\" title=\"University of New Hampshire\">University of New Hampshire</a> Center for Public Policy studies, 171 towns in New Hampshire had traditional town meeting, while 48 had SB&#160;2.

The study found that 102 school districts had traditional town meeting, 64 had SB&#160;2 meeting and 10 had no annual meeting.\n</p><p>Because traditional-meeting communities tend to be smaller, only one-third of the state's population was governed by traditional town meetings in 2002, and only 22 percent by traditional school-district meetings.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Official_ballot_town_council\">Official ballot town council</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Town_meeting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Official ballot town council\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Town_Council#New_Hampshire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Town Council\">Town Council</a></div>\n<p>The Official Ballot Town Council is a variant form of the Town Council, in which certain items are to be placed on the ballot to be voted on by the registered voters.
