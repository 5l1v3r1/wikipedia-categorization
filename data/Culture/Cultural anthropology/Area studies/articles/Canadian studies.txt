Canadian studies is a college-level study of Canadian culture, the spoken languages of Canada, Canadian literature, Quebec, agriculture in Canada, the history of Canada, and Canadian government and politics. Most universities that offer the discipline recommend that students take a double major (e.g. Political Science, International Relations or French), if not included in the course. Some careers for students who take Canadian studies include the foreign service and working at Canadian embassies or the foreign embassies in Canada. Scholars known for their work in Canadian studies include Fernand Ouellet, Linda Hutcheon, George Ramsay Cook, William T. R. Fox, Annette Baker Fox, Susan Swan, Christl Verduyn, Sergey Rogov, and George Melnyk. The Governor General's International Award for Canadian Studies is an award for excellence in the field and was established in 1995 by the International Council for Canadian Studies.
