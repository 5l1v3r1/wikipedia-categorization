She discusses the different psychological processes the mind uses to distort reality about oneself and the world. She explains how these self-delusions serve to convince ourselves and others that we are better and less flawed than we actually are, and that our perception of the world is more accurate than it really is.  Delusions of Gender: Fine exposes the flaws in popularized scientific findings presented as evidence of hardwired, inherent differences in interests that are often taken to explain present-day inequalities between men and women.  Testosterone Rex: Fine argues that contemporary scientific understanding in the fields of evolutionary biology, behavioral endocrinology, gender psychology, and neuroscience do not support the common belief that evolved, biological processes can explain persistent sex-inequalities in society.
