A gaming house is a co-operative living arrangement where several players of video games, usually professional eSports players, live in the same residence.  Professional gaming houses began in South Korea for professional StarCraft players.  It also refers to gambling establishments.  They provide opportunity for professional gaming teams to house all of their players in a streamlined environment that the teams can cater and control. Instead of the players having to link up online, all are in a singular area so they can effectively scrimmage and practice with one another to get better at their respective video game. The houses can even have psychologists, analysts, nutritionists, trainers, and chefs so the players can take advantage of them should the need arise.   The houses can bring a sense of reality into a virtually fueled lifestyle. Because all of the players are with one another, they must learn to live with each other and will bond through the good and bad. With how strenuous these players lives can be, it is important to keep them in their senses and have a grasp of social connection, apart from the games itself.   The houses range in aesthetic appeal and can be smaller few bedroom houses with players sharing rooms where they might just have a mattress on the ground, or they can be extremely lavish and furnished with quality amenities in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California with A-List celebrities.
