Increasingly, supportive/ed housing may be required as unemployment increases, for newly emerging groups such as newly legalized gay and lesbian partners, multi-generational immigrant groups in the new multicultural world, and for those adolescents aging out of their parents' homes to new community options. One of the 2000s textbooks on Supported/ive Housing is a report on state projects in the US for older adults which includes use of the home and community-based (HCBS) waiver, efforts to reform more than 43 congregate residential categories in states, use of housing subsidies for low income persons, assisted living options, \"comprehensive case/care management\", and technical area such as \"at-risk\" housing and non-profit development (Pynoos et al., 2004).<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Benefits_of_supportive_housing_for_specific_populations_groups\">Benefits of supportive housing for specific populations groups</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Supportive_housing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Benefits of supportive housing for specific populations groups\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Supportive Housing proposes to be a comprehensive solution to a problem rather than a band-aid fix (such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Emergency_shelter\" title=\"Emergency shelter\">shelter</a>.)  While many of those who stay in the shelter system remain in or return to the system for extended periods of time, a much higher percentage of those who are placed in supportive housing remain housed on a more permanent basis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-endhomelessness1_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-endhomelessness1-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> This idea is also referred to as the <a href=\"/wiki/Housing_First\" title=\"Housing First\">Housing First</a> model, an approach to combating chronic homelessness by providing homes upfront and offering help for illnesses and addictions.

A review of the impact of these services found that they can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, including positive changes in self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> In the Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness (CICH), participants who had been homeless for an average of eight years were immediately placed into permanent housing. The CICH evaluation reported that 95% of those individuals were in independent housing after 12 months.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> A study of <a href=\"/wiki/Homeless_people_in_New_York_City\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Homeless people in New York City\">homeless people in New York City</a> with serious mental illness found that providing supportive housing to the individuals directly resulted in a 60% decrease in emergency shelter use for clients, as well as decreases in the use of public medical and mental health services and city jails and state prisons. Another study in Seattle in 2009 found that moving \"people with chronic alcoholism\" into supportive housing resulted in a 33% decline in alcohol use for clients.<sup id=\"cite_ref-endhomelessness1_22-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-endhomelessness1-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There is significant support for the contention that supportive housing also costs less than other systems where its tenant base may reside, such as <a href=\"/wiki/County_jail\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"County jail\">jails</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital\" title=\"Hospital\">hospitals</a>, mental health facilities, and even shelters. Research on the overall costs to the taxpayer of supportive housing has consistently found the costs to the taxpayer to be about the same or lower than the alternative of a chronically homeless person sleeping in a shelter.

According to a 2007 study done by the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Alliance_to_End_Homelessness\" title=\"National Alliance to End Homelessness\">National Alliance to End Homelessness</a>, supportive housing helps tenants increase their incomes, work more, get arrested less, make more progress toward recovery, and become more active, valued and productive members of their communities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-endhomelessness2_25-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-endhomelessness2-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Impact_on_neighborhoods\">Impact on neighborhoods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Supportive_housing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Impact on neighborhoods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Supportive housing can help people facing health challenges to continue to live in the community.

In some areas, this produced a movement to find alternative solutions rather than continuing to fund the traditional solutions, including shelter system, jails, asylums and hospitals. In addition to homelessness, the movement today is to downsize or close psychiatric centers (e.g., Olmstead initiative)<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> and develop regular options for housing and support in the local communities; these population groups have also been counted in some reports as the homeless populations.\n</p><p>In the U.S., hundreds of city governments have produced \"10-year plans\" that provide for supportive housing to end chronic homelessness because the Bush administration began pushing for creation of the plans in 2003. The goal: put the homeless people with complex situations and needs into permanent or transitional \"supportive\" housing with counseling services that help them get healthy lifestyles of their own choosing. The evidence shows supportive housing may be a viable solution: the number of street people in cities across the United States has plummeted for the first time since the 1980s. In 2005-2006, Miami, Florida reported a 20% decline in homeless populations and dozens of other U.S. cities reported similar census results: San Francisco, CA (30%), Portland, OR (20%), Dallas, TX (28%), New York, NY (13%).<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2006_41-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2006-41\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Guided by research, Congress has taken several steps to encourage the development of permanent supportive housing. Beginning in the late 1990s, appropriations bills have increased funding for HUD\u2019s homeless assistance programs and targeted at least 30 percent of funding to permanent supportive housing. Congress has also provided funding to ensure that permanent supportive housing funded by one of HUD\u2019s programs (Shelter Plus Care) would be renewed non-competitively, helping to ensure that chronically homeless people could remain in their housing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> The 2009 legislative mandate from the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act created bipartisan political support to adopt a collaborative approach to end homelessness. From this effort spawned the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness\u2019s Opening Doors Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness in 2010. With a focus on permanent supportive housing as a means of ending chronic homelessness, the plan outlines an interagency effort aligning mainstream housing, health, education, and human services.<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Imperfect_markets\">Imperfect markets</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Supportive_housing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Imperfect markets\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Seller's Markets: where demand exceeds the supply of permanent supportive housing, many housing providers can be selective when admitting tenants.
