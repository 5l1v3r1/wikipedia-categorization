Weroom is the first international social network dedicated to flatsharing. It is a platform for those seeking or offering rooms in a flatshare. The company was launched in 2013 by Thomas Villeneuve. With more than 300,000 users worldwide, Weroom has gained an international presence. After starting in Paris, it expanded into London and has gone on to list properties and users on a global scale.  Based on the fact that the flatsharing market consists of 1 million people in France and 10 million people across Europe, Thomas Villeneuve launched Weroom to fill this market. The service helps bring the community of flatsharers, landlords, tenants and agencies together to make finding a flatshare easier.  This platform allows users to see listings of properties and to find their future flatmates on a more personal level. Users are able to book their rooms online with the online booking system.  Thomas Villeneuve and Isabelle George founded Weroom in 2013, in Paris.  In early 2014, the start-up was backed up by the real-estate group, Nexity, who detains 80% of its capital.  In August 2014, Weroom opened up another office in London.  The concept is born from a sharing economy. It is structured to act as the middle ground between offer (agencies, networks, landlords) and demand (students, young professionals, mobile professionals, seniors).
