Euro-orphan or EU orphan   is a neologism used metaphorically to describe a "social orphan" in the European Union whose parents have migrated to another member state, typically for economic reasons. The child is left behind, often in the care of older relatives. The expression itself is a misnomer, since it is meant to describe temporary child abandonment, rather than the death of both parents. A similar name is White Orphans.   Such abandoned children may require therapeutic or psychiatric care to cope.  The EU supports family reunification.  Migrating families are sometimes divided by local child services  (Jugendamt).  The number of Euro-orphans in the EU is estimated to be between 0.5-1 million, more Euro-orphans live outside the EU, eg. in Ukraine.   Łukasz Krzyżanowski has coined a similar term, "old euro-orphans", describing elderly parents left behind by migrants.
