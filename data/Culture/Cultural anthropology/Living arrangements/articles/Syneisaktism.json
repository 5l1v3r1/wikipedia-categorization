Some independently wealthy women were able to seclude themselves on their estates, others were supported by family, but many had no means with which to support themselves. Monasteries for women were a later development; in the 2nd century CE there would have been very few in existence. Thus, spiritual marriage may have emerged as a solution to this problem. An ascetic woman would have gone to live with an ascetic man in his house, living as brother and sister in a sort of unofficial marriage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Spiritual marriages would have also offered a rare opportunity for a man and a woman to engage in an emotionally and spiritually intimate friendship, something that was next to unheard of in the ancient world, in which it was believed that men and women could never be friends, as friendship implied parity, and the sexes were not considered equal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Thus, spiritual marriages would have been a desirable option for both ascetic men and women.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Condemnation\">Condemnation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Syneisaktism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Condemnation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Despite the appeal of spiritual marriages, subintroductae and the practice itself were continuously condemned by various councils, writers, and theologians.

The second letter is addressed to a group of virgins newly returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He gives advice on how to continue their ascetic lives properly, including a section on spiritual marriage. Here, he condemns the practice of spiritual marriage and of the subintroductae, suggesting that it is a betrayal of the Bridegroom Christ to whom all virgins devote their life to when they take their vows of chastity. He mentions those virgins who \"dare[d] even to live and mix with men, not considering such a great danger or how easy it is to fall in this life\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> and goes on to call on women to abandon their practice of spiritual marriage, \"lest you break your covenant with the heavenly bridegroom\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"John_Chrysostom\">John Chrysostom</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Syneisaktism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: John Chrysostom\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>John Chrysostom, another fourth-century writer, wrote two treatises on the subject of spiritual marriage, both condemning the practice.
