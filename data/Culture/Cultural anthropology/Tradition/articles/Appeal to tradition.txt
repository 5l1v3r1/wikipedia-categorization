Appeal to tradition (also known as argumentum ad antiquitatem,  appeal to antiquity, or appeal to common practice) is an argument in which a thesis is deemed correct on the basis that it is correlated with some past or present tradition. The appeal takes the form of "this is right because we've always done it this way."  An appeal to tradition essentially makes two assumptions that are not necessarily true: An appeal to tradition is only a fallacious argument in itself if the argument is not developed further, for example by pointing out that the widespread acceptance of the practice means that there would be significant implications/disruption/cost involved in abandoning the tradition. (The further development may introduce other fallacies.) The opposite of an appeal to tradition is an appeal to novelty, claiming something is good because it is new.
