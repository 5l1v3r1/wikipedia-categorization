In social theory, detraditionalization refers to the erosion of tradition in religion (Secularization, agnosticism, Religious disaffiliation) and society in (post)modernism. Traditional societies belief in established, timeless, authoritative orders and values, above the individual, and timeless attainable goals. Factors that contribute to loss of tradition are endorsement of individual choice and responsibility or the "sacred" (in Ã‰mile Durkheim's sense of the term) individual itself in democratic societies, and the revolution in communications. Among the theorists who believe that society is moving from a modernity that has been largely traditional to a post-traditional time is Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens.
