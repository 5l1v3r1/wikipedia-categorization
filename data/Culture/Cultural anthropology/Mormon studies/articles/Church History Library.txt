The Church History Library in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah houses materials chronicling the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This new building opened to the public on June 22, 2009. A new archives building was originally planned in 1960, as an 11-story home for the offices and libraries of the Church Historian and the Genealogical Society of Utah.  The need for such large facilities diminished due to advances in modern document preservation, as well as with the 1963 completion of the Granite Mountain Vault, which had vast storage for genealogical materials.   Following the completion of the Church Office Building in 1972, the Church Historian's Office and Church History Library resided in the four floors of the east wing.  In April 2005, plans were announced to construct a new Church History Library to be completed in late 2007.   The site was then a Temple Square parking lot, and was the same site as in the 1960 plan, northeast of the intersection of Main and North Temple.   This new facility houses the Church History Department (the modern name of the Church Historian's Office) and the church's historical archives.   The building was dedicated on June 20, 2009 and became open to the public on June 22 with extended hours, improved technology, assistance staff and additional educational and training programs. The LDS Church History Library preserves materials related to its history, from the 1820s in upstate New York, to the current day with more than 14 million members around the world. Since 1972, these historical collections have been stored in the LDS Church Office Building in Salt Lake City, but that facility closed in April 2009 to prepare for the move to the Church History Library. The historical materials of the LDS Church contain rich information about both Mormon history and the development of the western United States. These collections include: The new 230,000-square-foot (21,000 m2) building provides temperature, humidity, and air quality control for the Church’s historical collections. Materials are stored in two types of archival storage rooms. The 10 main storage rooms are kept at 55 °F (13 °C) with 35 percent relative humidity. There are also two special rooms that will be kept at minus four degrees Fahrenheit for color motion picture films, photographs, and records of special significance. The building has areas for conservation, collections development, and research. The Church’s conservation efforts involve 300 to 500 books and documents and 3,000 to 4,000 audiovisual recordings every year. Collections development staff acquire and catalog 500 to 700 new collections annually, including 6,000 publications. Other staff members housed in the new building will be responsible for publications, historic sites, and web content. In 2005, the Church History Library applied to be certified through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, the national standard for the design, construction, and operation of environmentally friendly buildings.   After construction, the project will be eligible for certification.  All research facilities opened to the public on June 22. Some resources are also available online, including the Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel database.  This database is the most complete listing of LDS pioneer emigrants and companies who traveled to Utah from 1847 through 1868. In September 2010 the Church History Library began posting some of their digital collections online in partnership with the Internet Archive. Currently the library is working on getting many of their pre-1923 (Public domain) collections digitized and available to a worldwide audience on the Internet Archive and through Brigham Young University's digital collections.
