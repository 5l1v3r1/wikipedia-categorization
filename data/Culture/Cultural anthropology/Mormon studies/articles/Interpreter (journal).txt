Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture is a non-profit peer-reviewed educational academic journal published by the Interpreter Foundation covering primarily LDS apologetics as well as Mormon studies.   It was established in 2012 by The Interpreter Foundation with Daniel C. Peterson as founding editor-in-chief.  Peterson had previously been the founding editor of the journal FARMS Review, which in 2011 had been renamed Mormon Studies Review     and soon thereafter re-launched without apologetics as its main focus.  The Interpreter Foundation also sponsors debates and discussions. These have included two symposia focused on the relationship between science and Mormonism
