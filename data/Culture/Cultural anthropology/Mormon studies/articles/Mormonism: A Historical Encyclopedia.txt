Mormonism: A Historical Encyclopedia   is an encyclopedia designed for a general readership about topics relating to the  History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, edited by W. Paul Reeve and Ardis E. Parshall.    Reeve is a professor of history at the University of Utah and Parshall is an independent historian, newspaper columnist, and freelance researcher. Most of the encyclopedia's articles were written by historical researchers expert in the specific area covered, while the tone employed is one of objectiveness, yet respect for the beliefs of Mormonism and its  culture. It is published by ABC-CLIO, a Santa Barbara, California-based publisher of reference works, as well as of the history journal, Journal of the West. Eras: Events: People: Issues: Sidebars:   Booklist's Wade Osburn said the work is "tailor-made for those wanting information on the most prominent figures, the most influential moments, and the hottest topics."   School Library Journal contributor Donna Cardon wrote, "Controversial issues, such as polygamy, are handled objectively and explored more extensively than other topics. 'Non-Mormon Views of Mormonism' and 'Mormonism and Other Faiths' are also considered. Occasional use of church-specific jargon occurs without explanation."
