Daniel Arlon Vogel (born 1955)  is an independent researcher, writer, and author on a number of works that include Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. and is most known for his work on Early Mormon Documents.  Vogel was awarded the "Best Book" award in September 2004 by the John Whitmer Historical Association and the "Turner-Bergera Best Biography" award by the Mormon History Association in May 2005 for his biography Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet.   In this Smith biography, Vogel argues that Joseph Smith was a pious fraudâ€”that Smith essentially invented his religious claims for what he believed were noble, faith-promoting purposes. Vogel identifies the roots of the pious fraud in the conflict between members of the Smith family, who were divided between the skepticism and universalism of Joseph Smith, Sr., and the more mainstream Protestant faith of Lucy Mack Smith. Vogel interweaves the history of Joseph Smith with interpretation of the Book of Mormon, which is read as springing from the young man's psychology and experiences. Vogel's scholarship on the topic has been debated by Mormon apologists and scholars who allege he is critical of Mormon faith claims.    He is sometimes also criticised by ex-Mormons[who?] and anti-Mormons[who?] for not being sufficiently critical of Joseph Smith. Larry Morris praised his efforts to produce the award-winning multi-volume Early Mormon Documents.  Vogel has also edited volumes skeptical of the possibility of receiving the future through the word of God.   Many of Vogel's books have been critically reviewed by members of FARMS.  For example, in 1991, Mormon religion professor and FARMS scholar Stephen E. Robinson suggested that Vogel's arguments closely resemble those of Korihor, an atheist polemicist in the Book of Mormon.
