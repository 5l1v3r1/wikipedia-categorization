Lowell Lindsay Bennion (July 26, 1908 – February 21, 1996) was an American educator, sociologist, and humanitarian.  He wrote extensively on religious living in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon or LDS Church), and was an advocate for volunteer service in Utah and Idaho. Bennion was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, the son of Milton Bennion and Cora Lindsay Bennion.  In 1928, Bennion graduated from the University of Utah, married Merle Colton and then left to serve in the Swiss–German Mission of the LDS Church.   Bennion spent much of his mission in Zürich, where he served as branch president.   After serving two and a half years as a missionary Bennion began studies towards his Ph.D. at the University of Strasbourg.  His wife came to France to live with him at about this point. After earning his Ph.D. in sociology in 1933, Bennion returned to Utah and founded the Institute of Religion adjacent to the University of Utah in 1934.   Bennion later founded Teton Valley Boys Ranch and served as its director for many years.   He served as a bishop in the LDS Church. The first food bank and homeless shelters in Utah were founded by Bennion.  Books
