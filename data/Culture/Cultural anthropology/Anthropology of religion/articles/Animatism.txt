Animatism is a term coined by British anthropologist Robert Marett to refer to "a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control".  Marett argues that certain cultures believe "people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects were endowed with certain powers, which were both impersonal and supernatural."  Mana, Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success.
