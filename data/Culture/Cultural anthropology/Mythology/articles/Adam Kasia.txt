Adam kasia means "the hidden Adam",  and comes from Iranian mythology where it means the soul of the first man. The hidden Adam is also called Adam Qadmaia ("the first Adam").  Among the Mandean (south Iraq and south-west Iran) Adam kasia means the soul of every human.  Adam Kasia shows many similarities with the Jewish idea of Adam Kadmon.
