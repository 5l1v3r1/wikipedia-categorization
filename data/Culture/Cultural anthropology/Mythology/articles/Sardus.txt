Sardus (also Sid Addir or Σάρδος in Ancient Greek) or also Sardus Pater ("Sardinian Father") was the eponymous mythological hero of the Nuragic Sardinians. Sardus appears in the writings of various classical authors, like Sallust and Pausanias. According to Sallust, Sardus son of Hercules, left Libya along with a great multitude of men and occupied the island of Sardinia, that was so named after him. Later Pausanias confirms the story of Sallust and in the second century A.D. writes that Sardus was the son of Makeris (identificable with Melqart, the Libyan Hercules) and that the island of Sardinia changed its name from Ichnusa to Sardinia in honor of Sardus.
