The Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (abbreviated LIMC) is a multivolume encyclopedia cataloguing representations of mythology in the plastic arts of classical antiquity.  Published serially from 1981 to 2009,  it is the most extensive resource of its kind,  providing "full and detailed information."  Entries are arranged alphabetically, with black-and-white illustrations indexed to their respective entries.  The work was prepared by international scholars from nearly 40 countries  who contributed in their language of choice, resulting in entries written variously in English, German, French, or Italian.  LIMC also offers a multilingual online database that is updated independently of the print publication.  LIMC has been called an "indispensable research instrument,"  "monumental,"  and "magnificent."  In the  United States, LIMC is based at the Alexander Library of Rutgers University.
