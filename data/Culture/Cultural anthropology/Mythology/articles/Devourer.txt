In certain religions and mythologies, a devourer is a powerful destructive entity, such as Satan or Boreas (the North Wind in Greek mythology). Devourers are typically associated with death, either by devouring the living (thereby killing them) or by devouring the dead.  In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the chimera-like creature Ammit acts as a devourer of the souls found unworthy by the balance of Maat.
