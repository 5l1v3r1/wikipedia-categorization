Combined with the early frame of cultural development relative to elsewhere in Mesoamerica and given that the Southern area remains distinctly mysterious with respect to how and why complex societies developed as dramatically as they did, the Southern Maya Area is almost as much a theoretical construct as it is a geographical and temporal reality. This is because topics such as cultural evolution, complex societies, early urbanism, and the construction of (ancient) identity, all framed and discussed in highly abstract ways, necessarily are raised.\n</p><p>If the Southern Maya Area is a part of Mesoamerica delineated from the rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense \u2013 by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how \u201corigins\u201d might be considered or defined \u2013 essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is \u201cMaya civilization\u201d? What is \u201cMaya\u201d? What is \u201ccivilization\u201d? What allows us to call this or that civilization \u201cgreat\u201d? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made \u201cMaya\u201d \u201cMaya.\u201d Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription,<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> peer polity interaction,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and other theories.\n</p><p>Despite these seemingly terminologically pitfall-laden inquiries, the question of Maya origins is justified for professional focus and elaboration, since all historical topics are, by their nature, constituted not only by ascriptions weighting the given topic in importance and cast by this or that interpretation or interpretative context but also by \u201cfact.\u201d Of necessity, these kinds of questions are rooted in the history of scholarship about this or that topic, taking into account different or new emphases or de-emphases, usually generationally or paradigmatically determined. Accordingly, \u201cMaya civilization\u201d is both a reality  - as <a href=\"/wiki/John_Lloyd_Stephens\" title=\"John Lloyd Stephens\">John Lloyd Stephens</a> first discovered - and a scholarly construct, with strands in the weave composed of actual patterns and \u201cemergent\u201d entities and characteristics but also of patterns and agentive decisions historically in the scholarly world, these, themselves, retroactively considered and reconsidered.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Thermometer_theory\">The Thermometer theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Southern_Maya_area&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The Thermometer theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2><p>\nMaya scholarship long has considered the ancient Maya in a temporal and geographic sense to have come into being, thermometer-fashion \u2013 as things began to \u201cwarm up,\u201d socially and culturally \u2013 at the \u201cbottom,\u201d that is, in Southern Mesoamerica, in the Early Preclassic period: events and processes coalesced on the Pacific coast of what is now Guatemala and southern Mexico and in the piedmont and highlands of Guatemala and in northern El Salvador, moved north in Classic period times to the Maya Lowlands of northern Guatemala and southern Chiapas, Mexico; and migrated still further north into Yucat\u00e1n following the Maya \u201ccollapse\u201d in the 10th century AD.

Fundamentally, the debate is between those who put more weight on the temporal priority of complex cultural and social achievements in the South and those who favor northern Guatemala for these developments. Large Preclassic cities with structures boasting the most massive scale in the ancient Maya world include <a href=\"/wiki/El_Mirador\" title=\"El Mirador\">El Mirador</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Nakbe\" title=\"Nakbe\">Nakbe</a>, Tintal, Wakna, and others from the <a href=\"/wiki/Mirador_Basin\" title=\"Mirador Basin\">Mirador Basin</a>, north of the greatest Maya city in Classic times, <a href=\"/wiki/Tikal\" title=\"Tikal\">Tikal</a>. Without doubt, these cities represent an extraordinary development in Maya civilization; however, their dating remains essentially Late Preclassic, and scant evidence is found of two of the hallmark traits of Classic Maya civilization: upright carved shaft stones called <a href=\"/wiki/Stelae\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stelae\">stelae</a>, which marked the birth of the cult of kingship, and <a href=\"/wiki/Maya_script\" title=\"Maya script\">hieroglyphic writing</a>. While stelae and hieroglyphic writing from the Preclassic abound in the Southern area, proponents of the Lowlands, i.e., the Mirador Basin, as the origin locus for Maya civilization assert that the first Maya societies to reach the level of the state, accordingly, base their claim fundamentally on size and scale of construction, as well as on myriad evidence of distinct connections between these northern cities including even the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sacbe\" title=\"Sacbe\">sacbeob</a></i>, the \u201cwhite ways\u201d or \u201chigh roads\u201d that networked among them.\n</p><p>Some of the debates between Southern Maya area scholars and what might be called the \u201cautochthonous school\u201d of Maya scholarship \u2013 those advocating a unique or primary role to antecedents to Classic Maya civilization in the Northern Pet\u00e9n \u2013 are based as well on highly theoritized accounts of expansion of Maya peoples as interpreted by changing ceramic spheres.

The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on absolute dating, although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by <sup>14</sup>C (\u201ccalibrated\u201d or \u201cuncalibrated\u201d) \u2013 still the most widely used absolute dating method in Mesoamerica \u2013 and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved unless and until other absolute dating methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, thermoluminescence), are applied more widely, or <a href=\"/wiki/Long_Count\" title=\"Long Count\">Long Count</a>-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods \u2013 principally ceramic \u2013 are highly reliable, having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar\u2019s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\".22High_Traits.22_of_the_Southern_Maya\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;High_Traits&quot;_of_the_Southern_Maya\">\"High Traits\" of the Southern Maya</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Southern_Maya_area&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;High Traits&quot; of the Southern Maya\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>\u201cHigh traits\u201d of ancient Maya civilization prominently include hieroglyphic writing and the Maya Long Count calendar, with the former constituting one of a handful, worldwide, of pristine inventions of writing and the latter comprising the invention of the concept of zero and other mathematical achievements unequalled at the time in Europe as well as extraordinary achievements in astronomy. Beginning in the Late Preclassic period and proliferating exponentially during the Classic Maya period, Maya texts are dateable because correlation can be made between Maya Long Count dates and the Gregorian calendar. Accordingly, with great certainty we can speak of the Classic period as framed by the large-scale appearance throughout the Maya world by the third to fourth century AD of dated texts on carved monuments, and by the disappearance of these texts on monuments by the 10th century AD. (Consensual acceptance of one correlation between the Maya Long Count and the Gregorian calendar \u2013 known as the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson or \"G.M.T.\u201d correlation \u2013 has come only fairly recently. In this correlation, a beginning date of August 12, 3114 BC, gives the Maya calendar its arrow-of-time character, just as the 0 date for the Christian calendar divides Western time-keeping into an absolute divide by virtue of which an infinite counting of both past and future time is permitted as opposed to \u201ccyclical time.\u201d)<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As mentioned, one of the arguments in favor of the Southern area as \u201cmore seminal\u201d to those of the Pet\u00e9n is based on the presently inarguable fact that by far the greatest number of Preclassic hieroglyphic texts are found in the South; for example, numerous texts were carved on monuments from Kaminaljuyu, the greatest city in the Southern area and one of the great ancient cities in world cultural patrimony. Several of  the earliest calendrical texts, as well, are found in the South at, for example, Takalik Abaj and <a href=\"/wiki/El_Ba%C3%BAl\" title=\"El Ba\u00fal\">El Ba\u00fal</a>, although the very earliest \u2013 by ca. 60 years \u2013 confirmed thus far are found at Chiapa de Corzo and <a href=\"/wiki/Tres_Zapotes\" title=\"Tres Zapotes\">Tres Zapotes</a>, that is, from sites with an Olmec (or \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Epi-Olmec_culture\" title=\"Epi-Olmec culture\">epi-Olmec</a>\u201d) identity.

Calendrical origins, themselves, from the most compelling evidence, must be attributed to a thin latitudinal band stretching across southern Guatemala, and including sites such as Chocol\u00e1 and Takalik Abaj.\n</p><p>In addition to hieroglyphics and calendrical innovations, the Southern area is noted for sites that, early on in the trajectory of Mesoamerica civilization, can be characterized as fully urban, and also for the appearance of long-distance trade in such vital commodities as obsidian and cacao, for the first true cults of sacred rulership or kingship, for masterfully carved monumental art, and for a very complex ideology and religion, probably based on some primordial version of the <a href=\"/wiki/Popol_Vuh\" title=\"Popol Vuh\">Popol Vuh</a>.\n</p><p>We are left with the developments in the South still attributable fundamentally to their own autochthonous emergence, excepting, as mentioned, the evidence of some kind of Olmec influence spreading east to west across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, south along the Pacific coast, and west to east through the Guatemalan piedmont to the highlands, at Kaminaljuyu, and then east still farther. This putative march of Olmec missionaries, warriors, and/or traders \u2013 a scenario really feasible only if one accepts the <i>Cultura Madre</i> concept of Olmec civilization as opposed to the <i>primus inter pares</i> argument and if one interprets artifacts as \u201cOlmec\u201d and not simply \u201cOlmecoid\u201d \u2013 conceivably would have been catalyzed by the threefold attractions of cacao, in Soconusco, Mexico; the Guatemalan piedmont, centrally in which lie Chocol\u00e1 and Escuintla, Guatemala; obsidian, from enormous beds in the highlands, with Kaminaljuyu as the main beneficiary of trade in this \u201csteel of the New World;\" and blue jade, hallmark of Olmec lore and treasure, from a great outcrop above the Motagua River east of Kaminaljuyu. That the Southern area originally constituted a truly astonishing source of material wealth, indeed a breadbasket, may have underlain the primordial appearance of cultural achievements such as writing, the calendar, kingship, masterful art, and complex religion, receives further support continuing through time in the Early Classic and evidence of interaction with <a href=\"/wiki/Teotihuacan\" title=\"Teotihuacan\">Teotihuacan</a>, the single greatest ancient city of Mesoamerica and the religious if not imperial capital for much of central Mexico, with hegemony extending far and wide. Such a profound material basis for the unique importance of the Southern area to civilizational developments is evidenced, as well, throughout the Classic period, with the appearance of the Cotzumalguapan culture \u2013 its sites ca. 60 kilometers east of Chocol\u00e1 \u2013 and its emphasis on cacao and warfare, indicative of competition over this most highly prized commodity in Mesoamerica, and throughout the Postclassic, as ethnohistory records the enormous amounts of products, including cacao, exported from the South, a pattern that continued after the Conquest, with Spanish <i>encomiendas</i> still exploiting this vital resource and other agricultural products, and which constituted the beginning of the transformation of much of Guatemala into a vast farm growing cash-crops for export.\n</p><p>Returning to the fact that \"Southern Maya Area\" risks being a misnomer, that the Southern Maya Area comprised a volatile mix of peoples, languages, and cultures with correspondingly dynamic interactions provides more support for the argument that the South took part in seminal developments and a vault upward socially and culturally to Classic Maya civilization, in a manner at least co-equal to the northern Pet\u00e9n.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Early_and_Middle_Classic:_Chocolate_Wars\">The Early and Middle Classic: Chocolate Wars</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Southern_Maya_area&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: The Early and Middle Classic: Chocolate Wars\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It may be argued in favor of a greater unity in the Southern Maya Area than the ethnic and linguistic diversity might otherwise indicate simply by virtue of the fact that a \u201cPreclassic collapse\u201d occurred extending through much of the Southern Maya Area .<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> In the Southern Maya Area, in times called Classic for the Maya in the Lowlands to the north, tantalizing evidence exists of an abhorrence of a vacuum in the materially very rich breadbasket of the Area \u2013 and, as mentioned, particularly of a continuation of what must have been an extraordinary intensively cultivated commodity of enormous importance in Mesoamerica, and the Maya, in cuisine, ideologically, and even as currency, cacao. In the Guatemalan piedmont, located not more than sixty kilometers east of Chocola, Cotzumalguapa, of Middle Classic trajectory, is renowned for carved stone sculpture intimately associating decapitation and other sacrifice with cacao, associations we must conclude are representative of fierce warfare over this commodity, and copious ethnohistory from early after the Spanish Conquest makes reference to \u201cchiefs\u201d and chiefdoms fighting over production and distribution of the chocolate bean and/or its processed forms.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a
