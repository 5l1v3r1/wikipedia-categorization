Cesare Biseo (April 18, 1843 â€“ January 25, 1909) was an Italian painter known mainly for his orientalist themes. He was born in Rome to a family originally from Brescia. He trained under his father. He initially worked in decorative paintings of houses. Biseo was invited by the Viceroy of Egypt to Alexandria, Egypt, to decorate his palace. This trip gave him subjects for future works as painter. He returned to the Muslim world; for example, in the company of Stefano Ussi and Edmondo De Amicis. They were part of the first embassy to Morocco.  With De Amicis, Biseo published a book on observations in Morocco and Costantinople, edited by the brothers Treves of Milan. In the 1887 Mostra di Venezia, he exhibited watercolors titled: Ricordi de Cairo.
