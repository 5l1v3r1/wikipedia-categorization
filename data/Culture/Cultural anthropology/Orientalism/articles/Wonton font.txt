A wonton font (also known as Chinese font, chopstick font or chop-suey font, type or lettering) is a font with a visual style expressing "Asianness" or "Chineseness". Styled to mimic the brush strokes used in Chinese characters, wonton fonts are often used to convey a sense of Orientalism. Some Asian-Americans find the use of these fonts offensive or racist, particularly when paired with caricatures which hark back to the Yellow Peril images of the late 19th century and 20th century. In 2002, the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a public relations disaster when it produced a series of T-shirts with buck-toothed images and wonton font slogans.  The Chicago Cubs were hit with backlash from the Asian community after a similarly offensive T-shirt was produced by an independent vendor in 2008.   The questionable use of such fonts was recently the subject of an article in the Wall Street Journal by cultural commentator Jeff Yang.
