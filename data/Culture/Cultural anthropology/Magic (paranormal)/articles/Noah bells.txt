"Noah bells" is the common name given to a distinct type of bell hand-manufactured in India by ancient and inherited traditions. Some monasteries in India are credited with manufacturing Noah bells for hundreds of years. The profits from the selling of authentic Noah bells are used to finance the activities of the particular monastery which fashioned them. These bells are popular among collectors because of their intricate resonances and also because of the mystique that surrounds them. One tale proclaims that these bells are divinely imbued with the power to ward off demons. Maharani Imports was the first company to import these bells about 40 years ago. The founders, Bonny Karstadt and Ratilal Shah named them after their son Noah Shah. It has become the common name to describe these particularly shaped handmade copper shepard bells. They are often used in gardens for decoration in America.
