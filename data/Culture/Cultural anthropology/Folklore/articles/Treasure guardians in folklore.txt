The treasure guardian is a recurring motif in folklore of a being that guards a treasure. Typically, the hero must overcome the guardian in order to obtain the treasure. In some cases the treasure guardians are non-human beings, although one subtype, known as "treasure ghosts", were deceased humans who had been murdered and buried with the treasure to protect it.    Animals are often shown as treasure guardiansâ€”an index of folklore chronicles stories of snakes, crows, ravens, cocks, swans, and night-birds as treasure guardians.  In some stories, the treasure is guarded by "the Devil himself".  :44-45
