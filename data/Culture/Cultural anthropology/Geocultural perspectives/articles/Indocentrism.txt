Indocentrism is any ethnocentric  perspective that regards India to be central or unique relative to other countries and holds that the "host" culture i.e. of India, is superior to others.   According to Indologist Michael Witzel, there is a recent tendency of indigenously minded revision and rewriting of India's history and archeology in scholarly publications, media, the Internet and government publications. This Indocentric rewriting includes claims that the first human civilization in the world formed in India in c. 10,000 BC, that there is an uninterrupted continuity of the Indian civilization from 7500 BC to present, and that Indo-European speaking Europe was populated by the immigrant people from the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
