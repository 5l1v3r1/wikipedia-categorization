A self-guided tour is a self-governing tour where one navigates a route oneself as opposed to an escorted tour where a tour guide directs the route, times, information, and places toured.  Many tourist attractions provide suggestions, maps, instructions, directions, and items to see or do during self-guided tours. As with escorted tours, self-guided tours may be conducted on foot or by vehicle. Audio tours are frequently presented in a self-guided format using booklets, smart phones or standalone handheld devices, as are virtual tours.
