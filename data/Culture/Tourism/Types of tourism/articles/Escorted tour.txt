Escorted tours are a form of tourism in which travelers are escorted in a group to various destinations, versus a self-guided tour where the tourist is on their own.    Escorted tours are also known as Guided tours or Package Tours. Escorted tours are normally conducted by a tour director who takes care of all services from the beginning to end of the tour. Escorted tours also normally include the flights, hotels, transportation, transfers to the airport/hotel, most meals and some sightseeing. Escorted tours are often conducted by motor coach and usually no more than three nights are spent in each location visited. They are usually fast-paced and prices include most everything.
