Microstays are residency in a hotel room for less than 24 hours, choosing the check in time and length of the stay.   Although new to the western travel industry,  it emerged as a trend in the World Travel Market Global Trends Report 2013.   Under 24 hours bookings became more popular in Europe during a time where travellers demanded further flexibility in their journeys and hotels needed other sources of income, and ways to increase revenue.  Microstays provide a way for hoteliers to boost revenues,  as they can increase room inventories by selling the same room twice in a day.   Business travellers make up the majority of the customer base.   This system also allows tourists and those taking day trips to take a break at a hotel without paying for overnight accommodation.
