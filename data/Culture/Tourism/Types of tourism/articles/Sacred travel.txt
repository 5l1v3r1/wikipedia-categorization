Sacred travel, spiritualized travel, or metaphysical tourism is a growing  niche of the travel market. It attracts New Age believers and involves tours and travel to "spiritual hotspots" on the Earth.  Destinations are often ancient sites where there is an alleged mystery concerning their origin or purpose, such as Machu Picchu in Peru, The Pyramids of Egypt, Stonehenge in England, the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, or the various Black Madonnas. These travelers see the journey as more than just tourism and take the trips in order to heal themselves and the world. Part of this may involve rituals involving (supposedly) leaving their bodies, possession by spirits (channelling), and recovery of past life memories.  The travel is considered by many scholars as transcendental, a life learning process or even a self-realization metaphor.
