Heritage trails are walking trails and driving routes in urban and rural settings that are identified in most cases by signage and guidebooks as relating to cultural heritage. The heritage might be built, or it can also be cultural heritage narrative.  In most cases it is in public space. The nature of the trail can be seen to be beneficial for community development,  community participation,  for discovering community heritage,  and for involvement by community in developing the trails.  In many countries heritage trails are self guided.  However for the interpretation of features and items of historical note, tour guides are required. In many countries former railway formations are used as walking and heritage trails.
