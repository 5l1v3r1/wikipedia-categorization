Recreational travel involves travel for pleasure and recreation.  Following the introduction of rail transport (note the concept of the railway excursion), the automobile has made recreational travel more available for people worldwide. Automobiles also allow the easy hauling of trailers,  travel trailers,  popup campers, off-road vehicles,  boats  and bicycles,  which fosters recreational travel.  Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms suggests the word "trip" as particularly appropriate with reference to relatively short journeys, especially connotating business or pleasure.
