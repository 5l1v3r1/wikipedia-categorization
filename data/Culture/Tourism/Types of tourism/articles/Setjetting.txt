Set-jetting is the trend of traveling to destinations that are first seen in movies.   It is also referred to as a "Location Vacation". Touring London in a high-speed boat like James Bond, or visiting the stately homes that are seen in the Jane Austen films are good examples.  The term was first coined in the US press in the New York Post by journalist Gretchen Kelly.  An analysis about the use of Geospatial technologies in setjetting was proposed by Thierry Joliveau in The Cartographic Journal.  Corporations, convention and tourism boards are exploiting the trend, creating their own set-jetting travel maps, like the Elizabeth: The Golden Age movie map published by VisitBritain.
