A tourist trolley, also called a road trolley, is a rubber-tired bus designed to resemble an old-style streetcar or tram. The vehicles are usually fueled by diesel, or sometimes compressed natural gas. The name refers to the American English usage of the word trolley to mean an electric streetcar. As these vehicles are not actually trolleys, and to avoid confusion with trolley buses,  the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as "trolley-replica buses".  Tourist trolleys are used by both municipal and private operators.  Municipal operators may mix tourist trolleys in with the regular service bus fleet to add more visitor interest or attract attention to new routes. In many cities tourist trolleys are used as circulators.  Tourist trolleys are also run by private operators to carry tourists to popular destinations. In San Francisco, tourist trolleys mimic the city's famous cable cars. Tourist trolleys sometimes operate in places which also have streetcars. For example, tourist trolleys operate in Philadelphia,  which also has actual trolley service.  Notable operators of tourist-trolley buses:
