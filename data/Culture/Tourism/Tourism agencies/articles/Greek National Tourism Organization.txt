The Greek National Tourism Organization (Greek: Εθνικός Οργανισμός Τουρισμού, Ethnikos Organismos Tourismou), often appreviated as GNTO (Greek: EOT) is the governmental department for the promotion of tourism in Greece. It functions under the supervision of the Ministry for Culture and Tourism. The Greek National Tourism Organization was founded in 1927 with the aim of promoting tourism in Greece.  For a time period after its establishment the organization was taken over by various ministries, until it was re-founded in 1950.

Currently, the agency is the single largest tourism promotion agency in the country, and has 27 offices in 21 countries, on four continents.  Since 2005, the organization has been subdivided into Regional Departments of Tourism.  Every year the organization chooses a different theme and motto for its advertising campaigns. Over the years, various successful advertising campaigns have been funded by the organization, including the very successful "Live your myth in Greece" campaign.
