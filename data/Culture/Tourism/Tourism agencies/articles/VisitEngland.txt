VisitEngland is the official tourist board for England.  Before 1999 it was known as the English Tourist Board and between 1999 and 2009 as the English Tourism Council. In 2003, it merged with the British Tourist Authority to form VisitBritain before re-launching as a separate corporate body in 2009. VisitEngland's stated mission is to "build England's tourism product, raise Britain’s profile worldwide, increase the volume and value of tourism exports and develop England and Britain’s visitor economy".  The VisitEngland accommodation assessment schemes were run under licence by Quality in Tourism from 2012 - 2017 when the AA took on the license.  The scheme issues quality awards to holiday accommodation, hotel, bed and breakfast, Self catering holiday cottages and others.
