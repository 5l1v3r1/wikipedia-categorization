The United States Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) operated the country's official travel and tourism offices worldwide.  In 1981, it replaced the United States Travel Service in its role of promoting travel to the United States.  In 1996, the U.S. government decided that it would no longer need such and closed all offices. Since, there are some Visit USA Committees in countries where many U.S. tourism companies have offices.
