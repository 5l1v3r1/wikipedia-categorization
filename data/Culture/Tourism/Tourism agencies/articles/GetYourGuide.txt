GetYourGuide is a website where tourists can search and book travel experiences. GetYourGuide's global inventory includes tours and excursions, activities like cooking classes, and tickets to numerous tourist attractions.  It currently offers more than 33,000 products in destinations around the world.  GetYourGuide acts as an online platform for third-party companies to list their products for users to easily find. Businesses offering sightseeing tours, adventure activities, multiple day tours, attractions passes, and other products can upload and manage their products under their own brand. Customers can book these products directly on the website as well as through iOS and Android Apps or through its distribution network.  Founded in 2008, the website is owned by the Switzerland-based startup company GetYourGuide AG.  The company currently employs more than 400 people (at 31.08.17) in the main office in Berlin, Germany, and also have more offices around the world.  In April 2013, GetYourGuide acquired competing website Gidsy. GetYourGuide has partnered with websites such as  Expedia.  The company has four major competitors in this market, Viator (acquired by TripAdvisor ), Musement, a Milan-based startup, Klook, Hong Kong-based startup,  and Peek.com, a U.S.-based startup.
