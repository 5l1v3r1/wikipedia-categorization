The Act brought together all regulatory and monitoring functions of the Department of Tourism within the Ministry of Tourism and Transport, and all promotional and marketing activities of the Seychelles Tourism Marketing Authority.  The Policy Planning and International Co-operation Division was retained under a newly formed Department of Tourism and Transport which fell under the vice-president\u2019s office.  The Seychelles Tourism Marketing Authority ceased to exist as legal entity.\n</p><p>However, in 2007 all policy planning and international cooperation functions for tourism in the Department of Tourism and Transport in the vice-president\u2019s office and the Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Training College were transferred to STB.  The SHTTC was then renamed the Seychelles Tourism Academy.  This restructuring brought together all government agencies involved in tourism-related matters under one roof.  The new structure meant the STB could serve and promote the industry more effectively and efficiently.  It also brought better co-ordination and responsiveness with the trade partners to meeting the challenges of the tourism industry.\nIn 2010 the portfolio for tourism was transferred from the vice-president\u2019s to the president\u2019s office.  In 2012, a new Ministry of Tourism and Culture was created, however, the functions and roles of Seychelles Tourism Board remained unchanged.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#STB_Act_(Amendment)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">STB Act (Amendment)</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Marketing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Marketing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Corporate_Affairs\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Corporate Affairs</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Foreign_offices\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Foreign offices</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span id=\"STB_Act_.28Amendment.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"STB_Act_(Amendment)\">STB Act (Amendment)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seychelles_Tourism_Board&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: STB Act (Amendment)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Under the STB Act 2005, STB was administered by a board of at least 12 directors, which was composed of members of the private sector and the government.  It was headed by a chief executive officer for the day-to-day running of the office and administration and execution of decisions of the board of directors.\nThe act was amended in December 2008 which changed the number of directors from 12 to 7. The amendment also established a Tourism Marketing Fund committee to manage the marketing fund and one committee to oversee the Seychelles Tourism Academy (ex-SHTTC).  The act was amended again in December 2010 to reinstate the post of chief executive and add the promotion of eco-tourism among its statutory functions.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Organisational structure of the Seychelles Tourism Board.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf/page1-220px-STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"311\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf/page1-330px-STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf/page1-440px-STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1240\" data-file-height=\"1754\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:STB_Organisational_Structure_2016.pdf\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The organisational structure of the Seychelles Tourism Board.</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Marketing\">Marketing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Seychelles_Tourism_Board&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Marketing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Marketing Department consists of the following fours sections:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>International Marketing</b></li></ul>\n<p>Responsible for marketing the destination to major source markets and identifying new emerging markets.
