The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA; simplified Chinese: 国家旅游局; traditional Chinese: 國家旅游局; pinyin: Guójiā Lǚyóu Jú) is a dissolved Chinese government authority responsible for the development of tourism in the country. The CNTA is subordinate to the State Council. Its headquarters are in Beijing, with regional branches in various provinces.  CNTA does not have the authority of a full department within the Chinese government to enforce regulations, but in other respects it acts as a ministry. Provincial CNTA offices in each Chinese province report to the central office in Beijing. CNTA has eighteen overseas offices called CNTO (China National Tourism Offices) that are charged with promoting tourism to China.  In Europe, there are CNTO offices in London and Paris.  CNTA is unique as a tourism office in that it is also responsible for controlling the outflow of tourists from China abroad. The CNTA is dissolved on March 19, 2018; the duties are merged to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.  The agency is organized into the following areas.  The organisation administers the five Tourist Attraction Rating Categories, ranging from A (lowest) to AAAAA (highest).
