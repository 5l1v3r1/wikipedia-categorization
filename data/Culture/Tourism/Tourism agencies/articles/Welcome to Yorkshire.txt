  Welcome to Yorkshire (WTY) is the official tourism agency for the traditional county of Yorkshire, the UK's largest county, promoting Yorkshire tourism both nationally and internationally. It was formerly known as the Yorkshire Tourist Board until 2009, but underwent a rebranding: a new Welcome to Yorkshire brand, a new website,  the launching of various new marketing campaigns and a move to the present site in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The stated aim of the organisation is: 'to grow the countyâ€™s visitor economy'.  The current Chief Executive is Sir Gary Verity. Following the 2009 rebranding, Welcome to Yorkshire has become involved in a range of new campaigns and initiatives. Aside from the more traditional forms of tourism marketing usually associated with tourist boards, Welcome to Yorkshire has been involved in cultural partnerships such as the Yorkshire entries to the Chelsea Flower Show,  The Railway Children tour,  the Hockney tour  and the Yorkshire Sculpture Triangle.  They are also an official partner  of Yorkshire County Cricket Club,  sponsoring the team's Twenty20 tour of South Africa in 2012.  Welcome to Yorkshire ran the campaign to host the 2014 Grand Depart of the Tour de France in the county.  On 14 December 2012 Yorkshire was confirmed as the starting place for the race.
