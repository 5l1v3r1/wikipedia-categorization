On 18 June 2017, gunmen attacked Le Campement Kangaba in Dougourakoro, east of Bamako, Mali, a luxury resort frequented by tourists. Hostages were reported to have been taken and at least 5 people are reported to have been killed, including a Franco-Gabonese civilian, a Chinese citizen and a Portuguese soldier.  According to an eyewitness, the attack began when a man on a motorcycle arrived at the compound and fired at the crowd. He was followed by two other assailants.  Security forces supported by United Nations troops managed to rescue around 60 people staying at the resort.   Some residents hid in a cave near the resort and managed to avoid the attackers.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the attack, and Mali security minister Salif Traore confirmed it was a jihadist attack. Malian troops and France's Operation Barkhane counter-terrorist force came to the site. Four assailants were killed in the aftermath and four arrested.
