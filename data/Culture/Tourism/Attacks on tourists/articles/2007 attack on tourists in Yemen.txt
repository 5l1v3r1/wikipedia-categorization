The 2007 Yemen tourist attack was a suicide car bomb attack on Spanish tourists visiting the Queen of Sheba temple in Mareb, Ma'rib Governorate on July 2, 2007. A member of Al-Qaeda rammed an explosive-laden car into a tourist convoy killing 8 Spanish tourists, 2 Yemeni Drivers, and injuring 12.  On August 8, four militants died in a Yemeni security forces raid near Mareb, one of them Kassem al-Raimi, who was the top al-Qaeda operative who masterminded the attacks. Raimi was involved in other operations and was one of 13 convicted prisoners who escaped from a Sanaa prison in 2006.
