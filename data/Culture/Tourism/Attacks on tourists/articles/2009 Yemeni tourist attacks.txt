Two explosions targeting tourists in Yemen took place in mid-March 2009. Sixteen South Korean tourists were in Shibam, Yemen, at the time of the first blast. Four Korean tourists alongside their local Yemeni guide were killed in the original attack on 15 March, while three more tourists were injured. Relatives of the victims were involved in the second blast on 18 March; however, the perpetrator succeeded only in killing himself. The initial attack followed numerous calls by members of the Al-Qaeda military network to attack visitors in the region.  The 15 March blast took place when a series of tourists were posing for photographs on a hill overlooking Shibam.  Five were killed and three were injured.  The 18 March attack took place when a convoy of South Korean investigators and the relatives of the victims of the previous attack were journeying from their Sana'a hotel to an airport. A young adult man walked between two cars and detonated his explosive vest, killing no one except himself.  According to AFP, Yemeni security officials stated that they had found a fragment of the bomber's identity card.  The fragment revealed his address and showed that he was a 20-year-old student.
