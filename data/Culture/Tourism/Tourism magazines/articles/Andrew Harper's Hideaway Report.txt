Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report is a monthly newsletter that reviews luxury hotels and resorts, typically smaller, more individual ventures.  The first issue appeared in 1979.  "Andrew Harper," a pseudonym, was concerned about the influence of commercial considerations on travel reviews, so he travels anonymously and pays his own expenses.  Each year, the company conducts a survey of subscribers' favorite small hotels.  Andrew Harper, LLC employs 80 full-time staff with offices in Austin, Chicago, and New York.  It also operates a luxury travel agency.
