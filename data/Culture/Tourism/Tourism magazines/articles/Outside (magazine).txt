Outside is an American magazine focused on the outdoors. The first issue of Outside was published in September 1977.   Outside's founders were Jann Wenner (the first editor in chief), William Randolph Hearst III (its first managing editor), and Jack Ford (an assistant to founding publisher Donald Welsh and a son of former U.S. President Gerald Ford).  Wenner sold Outside to current owner Lawrence J. Burke two years later. Burke merged it into his magazine Mariah (founded in 1976) and after a period of using the name Mariah/Outside kept the Outside name for the merged magazine.   Christopher Keyes is the current editor. Outside launched the careers of Sebastian Junger, Jon Krakauer, and other freelance travel and adventure writers. Though the magazine has tilted toward a more commercial aesthetic in recent years, it has also recruited figures from the literary world for freelance assignments. Writers whose work has appeared in Outside include Bruce Barcott, Tim Cahill, Daniel Coyle, E. Annie Proulx, naturalist and author David Quammen, and Bob Shacochis. Songwriter David Berkeley also worked for Outside.  Effective June 1, 2010, its owner Santa Fe, New Mexicoâ€“based Mariah Media, launched Outside Television in partnership with Resorts Sports Network, which was rebranded Outside Television.
