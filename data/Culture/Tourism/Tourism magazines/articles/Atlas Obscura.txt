Atlas Obscura is an online magazine and digital media company    led by American journalist David Plotz.  It was founded in 2009 by author Joshua Foer and documentary film-maker Dylan Thuras.   It catalogs unusual and obscure travel destinations, and relies heavily on user-generated content.  It features a mixture of feature and news articles on topics including history, science and some news, in addition to travel and exploration, as well as hosting a collaborative "guide" to the world's most obscure places. Thuras and Foer met in 2007, and soon thereafter started discussing ideas for a different kind of atlas, featuring places not commonly found in guidebooks.    They hired a web designer in 2008 and launched Atlas Obscura in 2009.  In 2010, they organized the first of the international events known as Obscura Day.    According to Thuras, one of Atlas Obscura's main goals is "Creating a real-world community who are engaging with us, each other and these places and getting away from their computers to actually see them."  In addition to the annual Obscura Day, Atlas Obscura organizes frequent local outings in various cities.  In 2012, Slate editor in chief David Plotz negotiated a deal to feature some of Atlas Obscura's content in Slate. Two years later, Atlas Obscura hired Plotz as its CEO.  In 2015, Atlas Obscura raised its first round of major funding, securing $2M USD from a range of investors and angels including the New York Times.  In September 2016, the site launched a spin-off book of the same name published by Workman Publishing Company.   In late 2017, following another funding boost of $7.5m, the site launched Gastro Obscura, a food section covering "the distinctive food locations of the world."   Its current editor-in-chief is Sommer Mathis, formerly of The Atlantic's CityLab, while its deputy editor is Samir Patel, formerly of Archaeology magazine.
