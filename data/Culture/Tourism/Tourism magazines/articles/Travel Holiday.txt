Travel Holiday, formerly Travel, was an American travel magazine, published from 1901 to 2003. The magazine was first published in 1901  as the Four-Track News by the New York Central Railroad. It was sold in 1906, and went bankrupt in 1946. The magazine was bought out of bankruptcy by Herman Shane. Travel merged with the competing magazine Holiday in 1977. The Reader's Digest Association bought Travel Holiday from the Shane family in 1986. The company sold it to Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in March 1996.  Hachette Filipacchi closed the magazine in 2003 due to low advertisement revenue.   The last issue was published in June 2003.
