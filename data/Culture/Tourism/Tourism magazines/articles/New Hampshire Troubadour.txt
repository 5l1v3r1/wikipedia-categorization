The New Hampshire Troubadour was a monthly magazine supported by the State Planning and Development Commission of New Hampshire which was originally published from 1931-1951.   It was subsequently published under several private owners and titles, most prominently as New Hampshire Profiles.  It was briefly revived under the original name for a few years early in the twenty-first century, as a quarterly magazine published by a 501(c)(3) charitable organization with no paid employees.  The magazine's first editor was Thomas Dreier.  During the Troubadour's original run three covers were illustrated by American artist Maxfield Parrish.
