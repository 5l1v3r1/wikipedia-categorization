Celebrated Living is a free, quarterly in-flight magazine available on American Airlines flights in First and Business Class, and American Airlines Admirals Clubs worldwide.  Celebrated Living was established in 1999.  The first issue appeared on 1 October of that year.  The magazine is published quarterly, with a spring, summer, fall and winter issue, reaching 19.5 million premium class passengers annually.  The magazine was published by American Airlines Publishing and is based in Fort Worth, Texas.   In 2014, American Airlines appointed Ink as the new publisher of Celebrated Living.  The revamped magazine contains new editorial sections focused on luxury, in the form of property, style and culture topics.  For the first time, Celebrated Living will be available to readers both in inflight and in the lounges via the print version, as well as in digital editions for mobile devices, tablets and online.
