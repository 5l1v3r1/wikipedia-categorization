Wanderlust is a British travel magazine, covering adventurous, cultural and special interest travel.  It is published ten times a year. It was established in Windsor, Berkshire in 1993 by Paul Morrison and Lyn Hughes, who had observed the absence of a publication combining their interests in wildlife, activities and cultural insights. Morrison died in December 2004 and Hughes took on the roles of publisher, managing director and editor-in-chief. In 2008, the Haymarket Media Group bought a stake in the business. The annual Wanderlust Photo of the Year competition is a travel photography competition. Most of the categories are for amateurs, one also being open to professionals. The annual Wanderlust World Guide Awards for tour guides and tour leaders are supported by The Daily Telegraph.
