Global Heritage Network (GHN), established by Global Heritage Fund (GHF), was created in response to the damage and destruction facing cultural heritage sites throughout the developing world. GHN is an online multimedia platform that uses Google Earth and social networking for threat monitoring and collaborative preservation of those sites. GHN features an online community for networking and discussion of possible solutions, while critical support and software for the platform have been donated by Google, DigitalGlobe, Autodesk, Ashtech, Exelis Visual Information Solutions and ESRI.  — GHN consists of an extensive database (GHN Sites) of approximately 650 globally significant sites in the developing world color-coded by threat level: Destroyed (Black), Rescue Needed (Red), At Risk (Yellow), Stable (Green). Each site contains a profile with background information, photos, documentation, maps, videos and satellite imagery. GHN's partnership with DigitalGlobe ensures that these sites are updated frequently with recent satellite imagery.   GHN invites global conservation experts and local stakeholders to become site coordinators, which entails guiding a GHN site through a program of investigation, planning, scientific conservation, community development, and partnerships.  ″° GHN has also incorporated a customized social network (GHN Community) that provides site-based and thematic discussion groups, composed of national governments, local communities, professional archaeologists, conservators and other concerned parties.  Lastly, the GHN library houses a collection of heritage preservation-related electronic documents including bibliographies, management plans, guidelines, case studies held in the GHN Library.
