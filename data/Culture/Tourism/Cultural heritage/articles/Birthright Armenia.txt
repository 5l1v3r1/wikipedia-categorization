Birthright Armenia, also known as Depi Hayk, is a volunteer internship enhancement program that also offers travel fellowships to eligible participants to assist in the development of Armenia.  Birthright Armenia was established in 2003 by Edele Hovnanian  as an international nonprofit organization.  The organization's goals include strengthening ties between Armenia and Armenian Diaspora youth representatives by providing them an opportunity to take part in the daily life of fellow Armenians.  Applicants need only be of Armenian descent, between the ages of 21â€“32, and must agree to a minimum 9 week stay.  As of 2017, over 1330 individuals from more than 48 countries have participated in the Birthright Armenia program.  Birthright Armenia was inspired by Birthright Israel, which offers educational and cultural exchange opportunities related to Jewish history and culture. Another similar project is Birthright Greece, aimed at the Greek Diaspora.
