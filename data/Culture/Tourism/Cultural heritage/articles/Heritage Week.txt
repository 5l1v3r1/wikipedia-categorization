The week's attractions usually includes tours, events and activities related to history and culture. Heritage Week is part of the European Heritage Days, a joint action between the Council of Europe and the European Commission.  There is a volunteer programme associated with the organization of the events.  Heritage Week is usually the last week in August.  Event guides are usually available in Tourist Offices, Libraries, Heritage Centres, Museums, Bus Stations and in many hotels. There are competitions run as part of the weeks activities and awards, nominated by the public, for the volunteers and organisations which put on the best events.
