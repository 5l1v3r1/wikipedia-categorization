PD Aerospace (Japanese: ＰＤエアロスペース株式会社, Hepburn: Pī Dī Earosupēsu Kabushiki-gaisha), often abbreviated PDAS, is a Japanese space tourism company based in Nagoya founded in 2007 by Shuji Ogawa.  The "PD" in the company's name stands for "pulse detonation".  PDAS is developing a suborbital spaceplane to carry two pilots and six passengers using a hybrid of jet and rocket power. Initial tickets are planned for ¥ 14,000,000 (about $125,000 USD as of April 2017) eventually lowering to ¥400,000 (about $3,600).    PDAS plans to develop a hybrid engine that produces jet and rocket thrust, using pulse detonation jet and pulse combustion rocket modes.  To reduce the cost of development and keep the vehicle low-cost, PDAS plans to use commercially available hardware, instead of custom-designed parts.  PDAS plans to launch an unmanned prototype in 2018, perform manned testing by 2020, and start commercial flights in 2023.  H.I.S. and ANA own 10% and 7% of the company, respectively.
