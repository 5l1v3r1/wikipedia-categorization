Formerly called Agodi Zoological and Botanical Gardens, Agodi Gardens was created in 1967.

The garden was renovated in 2012 by the Oyo State Government and the new Agodi Gardens was reopened in 2014.  In late September 2017, a zookeeper at the Agodi Zoo was attacked by one of the lions. The zookeeper attacked by the lion was Mr. Hamzat Oyekunle popularly known as Baba Olorunwa. He later died from injuries sustained.  The zoo was closed immediately by the Oyo State Government.
