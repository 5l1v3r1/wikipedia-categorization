[[File:George_washington_inn_logo.jpg George Washington Inn is  a bed and breakfast inn located between Sequim and Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It was built as a replica of Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. The inn opened for business on February 16, 2008.  Located near the Olympic National Park, the inn is on a ten-acre waterfront estate and lavender farm in the Sequim Valley at the foot of the Olympic Mountains. The Strait of Juan de Fuca stretches northward from the inn's 130 foot (40Â m) high bluff to the city of Victoria, British Columbia and the San Juan Islands. The New Dungeness Light, the Discovery Island Light and the Race Rocks Light are all visible from the inn. A reproduction of The Washington Family by Edward Savage (artist) hangs above the inn's grand staircase.  Also known for its in-house roasted coffee,  George Washington Inn has sent packages of its specialty coffee to overseas troops since its beginning.
