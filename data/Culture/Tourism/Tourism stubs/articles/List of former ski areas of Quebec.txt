It catered to novice skiers.  The ski station was one of the first alpine ski station in the country, and was very popular in the 1950s.  The ski station was deeded to the municipality by Charles Bronfman, with a clause saying that it needed to stay a ski slope.

At the end of the station operating history, it was composed of a base chateau, four ski lifts, three T-bars and a magic carpet, five pistes, two green (runs 40, 60), a blue (run 80), a black diamond (run 100), and a glade double black diamond (run 120 or "Bois joli").
