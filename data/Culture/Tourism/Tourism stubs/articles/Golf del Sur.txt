Golf del Sur is a holiday resort and golf course situated in Tenerife, Canary Islands within the municipality of San Miguel de Abona. In 1989, 1992, 1993 and 1994, Golf del Sur hosted the Tenerife Open tournament.  Originally a private urbanisation built along with the Golf del Sur golf course, the resort of Golf del Sur occupies 410 acres (1.7 km2) and is now a holiday and residential village just a few kilometres from the Tenerife South Airport.  Golf del Sur has developed tremendously in recent years and now is one of the major tourism resorts in Tenerife. Being situated alongside a golf course and marina, Golf del Sur has evolved into a more tranquil holiday environment than its busier neighbours of Los Cristianos and Playa de las Américas. Marina San Miguel is a new marina built between the resorts of Golf del Sur and Amarilla Golf on the south Tenerife coast. It is an active marina providing berths for private yachts and other vessels, and enabling extended tourism facilities such as yacht charters and undersea submarine excursions.
