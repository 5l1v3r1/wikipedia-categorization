Momentum Adventure was founded in 2005 by Matthew Robertson who said that he wanted to add an "element of velvet lining" to adventure travel.  Momentum guides are all experts in their field and hold the highest IFMGA accreditation.   They include Johan Aregard, a former Swedish Special Forces soldier,   Dave Pearce, a former Royal Marine  & survival consultant for Bear Grylls, and John Falkiner, a stunt coordinator on over 70 films, including GoldenEye.  The custom designed trips start at around $7,000 a person, span all seven continents and range in length from two to 21 days.   They are tailer created to the fitness level and interests of the client.  Areas of specialty for the company include the Arctic Circle, Borneo, Baja, Jordan, Yukon, Lebanon, British Columbia and Japan.   Each trip has fewer than six people, and due to the specialised nature of the packages, the company only runs a dozen of them per year.  Momentum also offers corporate team building events.
