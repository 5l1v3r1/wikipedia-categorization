A botel is a boat that serves as a hotel or hostel.   The word is a portmanteau of boat and hotel.  Botels may range from small  or larger  purpose-built or converted boats or other watercraft, to converted ships.  They may be permanently moored  or grounded,  or spend part of the year taking guests on tours.  Alexander von Humboldt (ship) was built in the early 1900s, and after century of sailing the seas was coverted to botel floating in Bremen. Another converted sailing ship is the Viking (barque), floated in Sweden The Bellis Botel at Pickwick Landing on the Tennessee River in Hardin County, Tennessee Botel Zebra in Amsterdam Amstel Botel in Amsterdam River boat hotel Bakkara Art in Kiev, Ukraine Ship hotel Bohdan Khmelnytsky in Kyiv, Ukraine
