PLTD Apung 1 is an electric generator ship in Banda Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia that has become a tourist attraction. The 2,600 ton vessel had been in the sea and was flung 2 to 3 kilometres inland by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.   It was owned by PLN, the local power generating company, and crashed upon two homes when it landed, killing those inside. Visitors are able to enter the ship, and can explore the interior in its entirety. This boat was given to Aceh during the Aceh conflict between the government and GAM (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka). In 2012–2013 the boat was renovated and now has 2 towers, a monument, a flying walk & jogging area and a fountain.  Coordinates: 5°32′47″N 95°18′24″E﻿ / ﻿5.546381°N 95.306783°E﻿ / 5.546381; 95.306783
