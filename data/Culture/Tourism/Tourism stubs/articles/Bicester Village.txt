Bicester Village is an outlet shopping centre on the outskirts of Bicester, a town in Oxfordshire, England. It is owned by Value Retail plc.   The centre opened in 1995. Most of its stores are in the luxury goods and designer clothing sector. The centre is the second most visited location in the United Kingdom by Chinese tourists, after Buckingham Palace.  On 17 April 2015 Cherwell District Council approved plans to demolish the nearby Tesco store and to construct a further 28 retail units and an extra 519 parking spaces. A new Park & Ride and major road improvements, funded by the centre's owners, were also announced.  It is hoped that this expansion will create around 3,500 new jobs in Bicester Village.  The new stores opened on 19 October 2017.    The centre is served by Bicester Village railway station, which has a regular direct connection to London Marylebone and Oxford, provided by Chiltern Railways. This station was formerly known as Bicester Town. This service is planned to be extended  to Milton Keynes Central and Bedford by 2024. The centre is also served by the X5 express coach service between Oxford and Cambridge via Milton Keynes and Bedford.
