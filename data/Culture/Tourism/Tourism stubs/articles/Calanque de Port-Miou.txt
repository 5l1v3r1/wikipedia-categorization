The Calanque de Port-Miou is one of the three big Cassis calanques. It is very long and narrow, and thus was very suitable for establishing a marina. The name Port-Miou is an approximative transcripcion in french orthography of the occitan Pòrt-Melhor (the "best port") which is locally pronuncied /pwɔʁ.mi.ju/.
