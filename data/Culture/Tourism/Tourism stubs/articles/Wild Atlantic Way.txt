The Wild Atlantic Way (Irish: Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin) is a tourism trail on the west coast, and on parts of the north and south coasts, of Ireland. The 2,500 km  (1,553 mile) driving route passes through nine counties and three provinces, stretching from County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula in Ulster to Kinsale, County Cork, in Munster, on the Celtic Sea coast.   The route is broken down into 5 sections.   Along the route there are 157 discovery points, 1,000 attractions and more than 2,500 activities. The route was officially launched in 2014 by  Minister of State for Tourism and Sport,  Michael Ring, T.D..
