Omenahotelli (Omena Hotels) is a Finnish low cost hotel chain. It is known for cheap rates and self-service. There is no reception desk or receptionists in the hotels – rooms are booked and paid for on the Internet. The customer then receives a passcode which unlocks the front door and the room for the duration of the stay.
