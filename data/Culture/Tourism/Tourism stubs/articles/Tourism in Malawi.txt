There is considerable potential for tourism in Malawi. The tourist industry has grown greatly since the mid-1970s, and the Malawian government is attempting to expand it further. The tourist sector was badly affected in the 1980s by an economic recession in South Africa, the source of most of Malawi's tourists. The industry was also badly affected by the destabilization of Zimbabwe but has seen double digit growth in recent years. Tourism contributed 4,5% to the national GDP in 2014 and provided 3,8% of all jobs.  Main attractions are Lake Malawi, mountains such as Zomba Plateau and Mulanje Mountain and the country's national parks.  The tourist industry promotes Malawi's national parks including Nyika National Park, Kasungu National Park, and Liwonde National Park.  Beach resort along Lake Malawi Zomba Plateau
