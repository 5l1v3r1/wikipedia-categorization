The Ministry of Culture (Albanian: Ministria e KulturÃ«s) is a department of the Albanian Government responsible for the implementation of government tourism, cultural affairs, youth and sports policy. The current minister is Mirela Kumbaro of the Rama II Cabinet.  Since the establishment of the institution, the Ministry of Culture has been reorganized by joining other departments or merging with other ministries, thus making its name change several times.
