The Ministry of Tourism (Hebrew: מִשְׂרַד הַתַּיָּרוּת‬, translit. Misrad HaTayarut) is the Israeli government office responsible for tourism. The office was created in 1964, with Akiva Govrin being the first minister, but was appended to the Trade and Industry Ministry between 1977 and 1981. The Minister of Tourism (Hebrew: שָׁר הַתַּיָּרוּת‬, Sar HaTayarut) is the political head of the ministry and a member of the Israeli cabinet. Ehud Barak is the only Prime Minister to have held the position whilst serving as the Prime Minister, whilst Moshe Katsav, who was Minister of Tourism from 1996 to 1999, went on to become President. On one occasion there was a Deputy Minister of Tourism.
