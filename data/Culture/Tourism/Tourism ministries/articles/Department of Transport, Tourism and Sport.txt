Childers as its first minister. Over the years its name and functions have changed, with a discontinuity in 1987. In 1987, at the formation of the 20th government, the Department of Transport was abolished, in accordance with section 14 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1983. At the same time, the Department of the Public Service, which had been established by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1973, was renamed as the Department of Tourism and Transport, and the substantive functions of the Department of the Public Service were transferred to the Department of Finance; therefore, the current Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is formally a successor to the Department of the Public Service established in 1973.
