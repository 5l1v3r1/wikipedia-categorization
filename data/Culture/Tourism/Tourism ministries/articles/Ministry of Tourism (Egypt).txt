The Ministry of Tourism of Egypt is part of the Cabinet of Egypt and is responsible for tourism in Egypt. On 14 January 2018, Rania Al-Mashat was appointed Minister of Tourism. Tourism is one of the most important sectors in Egypt's economy. More than 12.8 million tourists visited Egypt in 2008, providing revenues of nearly $11 billion. In 2009, the sector employed about 12 percent of Egypt's workforce.  In 2016, the minister of tourism expressed his concern and optimism about tourists returning to Egypt despite the downing of a Russian flight in 2015. The minister has said "we are all in this together" referring to terrorism that hurts a country's tourism industry.    In 2018 the UAE Minister of Happiness met with the Egyptian Minister of Tourism to discuss the philosophy of making tourists happy.  In May 2018, the last chariot belonging to King Tut was escorted with a parade to the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM). It is hoped that the investment in this new museum will stimulate more tourism to Egypt.
