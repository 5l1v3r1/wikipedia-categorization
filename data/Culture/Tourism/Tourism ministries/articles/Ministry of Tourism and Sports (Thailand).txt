The Ministry of Tourism and Sports of the Kingdom of Thailand (Thai: กระทรวงการท่องเที่ยวและกีฬา; RTGS: Krasuang Kan Thong Thiao Lae Kila; Abrv: MOTS) is a cabinet ministry in the Government of Thailand. The ministry's primary areas of responsibility are tourism and sports. The ministry is in charge of managing the tourist industry and sports both in schools and other institutions. The ministry organises and directs Thailand's important sporting events. Its FY2017 budget is 6,548 million baht.  As of  2018[update] the Minister of Tourism and Sports is Weerasak Kowsurat. He was appointed to the position on 24 November 2017, replacing Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul who held the post for three years.  Weerasak previously served in the same position for three years beginning in 2008.  The ministry was created in 2003 during the administration of Thaksin Shinawatra. The government wanted a sports ministry, but the senate refused to support it as professional sports were not big enough to warrant a ministry. To overcome the objection, the government added tourism to the ministry's portfolio. Two agencies manage Thai tourism: The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), is responsible for "bodycount", i.e., attracting visitors. The Department of Tourism in the Sports and Tourism Ministry regulates the industry and manages infrastructure. TAT's success in driving up numbers—more than 35 million visitors arrived in 2017—has overwhelmed the 130 employees responsible for managing the industry.  Established in 1985, SAT is responsible to attend all sport association in Thailand. Established in 1960, TAT is responsible for the promotion of Thailand tourism. It has 35 regional offices in Thailand and 15 abroad.
