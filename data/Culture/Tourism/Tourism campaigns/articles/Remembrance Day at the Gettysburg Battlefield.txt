Remembrance Day is an annual Gettysburg Battlefield event for the anniversary of the 1863 Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg during which President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.  Initially commemorating the Grand Army of the Republic, the event is held on a weekend (e.g., Saturday November 16, 1957),  and the Consecration anniversary was resolved "Dedication Day" by the U.S. Congress in 1949.    A costume ball held the Friday evening before Remembrance Day,  a "Remembrance Illumination" of Gettysburg National Cemetery graves (instead of on Memorial Day), a fundraiser at the Gettysburg Cyclorama, a Citizenship Ceremony,  and other events promote tourism to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
