Lodging or a holiday accommodation is a type of residential accommodation. People who travel and stay away from home for more than a day need lodging for sleep, rest, food, safety, shelter from cold temperatures or rain, storage of luggage and access to common household functions.  Lodging is done in a hotel, motel, hostel, inn or hostal, a private home (commercial, i.e. a bed and breakfast, a guest house, a vacation rental, or non-commercially, with members of hospitality services or in the home of friends), in a tent, caravan/camper (often on a campsite). Lodgings may be self-catering, in which case no food is provided, but cooking facilities are available. A lodger can also refer to someone who, on a long term basis, rents a room from a home owner or sublets the room from a tenant and is not on the tenancy agreement.
