In 2017, the firm ran a worldwide contest called The Best Job on the Planet, to hire a person to travel through luxury residences in the world and share his experience on various platforms.     It was inspired by The Best Job in the World campaign, and the firm collaborated with the winner of that  campaign for the development of the competition.   Since May 2018, Thirdhome has been available to the public.  The firm was conceived as a home exchange. Owners of luxury second homes apply online, and,  if they meet  requirements for location, characteristics of the house, and home value,  become eligible as members.  Each owner lists which weeks their house will be available.   When someone is staying at their house, the owner receives credits, usable to reserve weeks at any property available on the system,    or for stays in affiliated clubs and resorts .  The site charges a one-time enrollment fee and a variable fee per exchange  The site also rents properties to users who register on the site, without exchange.
