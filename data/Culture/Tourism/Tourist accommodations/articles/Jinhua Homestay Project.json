Thus not language barrier but to break the cultural barrier this program was initiated by the Jinhua Municipal People\u2019s government foreign and overseas Chinese affairs office.\nDue to urbanization many people from these villages travelled to the bigger cities and the government too did not have adequate funds to provide for 195 of these villages and fund the bigger cities as well. So while bigger cities were gaining popularity the village condition was degrading, thus the Government thought that tourism can help uplift these villages and through this program let the world know about the culture, traditions and people of these villages.\nThe team who put together this project and has been running it for 3 years now, is the Jinhua Municipal People\u2019s government foreign and overseas Chinese affairs office. The project is now conducting its 5th session, being held at Suoyuan village.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Villages\">Villages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jinhua_Homestay_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Villages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Shangjing</b> Village is located in the west of Jinhua, Zhejiang, 30&#160;km away from Jinhua Downtown area and 2.5&#160;km away from the town of Tangxi, It is close to Yuexi Brook to the East,adjacent to Houdayuan on the South and near the Jiufeng mountain to the West. The village was formerly known as Fenglinzhuang (or Maple Forest Village) and changed to the current name due to its \"wind and water favorable\" location. Since 1048 when Liu Qing, the first ancestor of Liu clan, brought his family in this village and settled down, the Liu clan has been living here  for 36 generations. Shangjing is laid out generally like a boat setting sail, implying that \"the boat sets off smoothly  for a long and good journey\". The Village is surrounded by two brooks, called Dongzhen and Xizhen, respectively and dotted with ancient alleys, houses, halls, and  wells here and there. To date, Shainging still preserves more than 50 ancient houses and 20 grand halls that can be dated back to Ming and Qing Dynasties. Among them, is the provincially unique five-room ancestral hall, known as Lui Clan Ancestral Hall and other six architectural sites, that is Baishun Hall, Liuji Hall, Qianji Hall, Xizhen Lane # 48 Folk House (i.e. Upstairs Hall).The Trail Gate Tower, Dragon Eye Well and Lui Clan Ancestral Grave were named the \" Provincial Cultural Relics Protection Units\" in January 2017.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Siping_Village\">Siping Village</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jinhua_Homestay_Project&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Siping Village\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This Village is located in Town, in the Wucheng District of Jinhua City, Siping Village boasts a long history of about 700 years.

Moreover, Siping has the most charming brick-carving houses and was the Hometown of Yinning, one of the ten great beauties of ancient China.

Its name is derived from the shape of the village as it resembles an ancient longevity lock, thus the literal English translation of the name is Jade Garden. Most residents carry the surname \u201cYan\u201d, as they are descendants of Yan- Zi-Ling, a famous hermit of Eastern <a href=\"/wiki/Han_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Han Dynasty\">Han Dynasty</a>.\nThis village has a history of over 480 years and the same is reflected by the ancient halls namely Wuben hall, Yan ancestral hall, liagmian halls, Jishu hall, zhongshu hall, huaide hall, Jiyi hall,  henghui hall and yongsi hall which are highlights of the village to serve as major tourist attractions. While many of these halls have a history of over 200 years modern buildings can be seen in the village. Though the village is a little far from the city it has all the facilities like a bakery shop, Coffee shop, a small clinic, and two convenience stores to comfort the travelers. There is also a museum at the north end of the village.\nMany young people have left the village to work in cities, a common phenomenon in China today. Therefore, the population consists mainly of older people. However, because Suoyuan is relatively close to <a href=\"/wiki/Jinhua\" title=\"Jinhua\">Jinhua</a> city, the age profile is more mixed than in similar villages in more remote locations.\nIt is one of the oldest villages in Jinhua.

Chinese Martial Arts include hundreds of different styles and it is undoubtedly the most versatile martial art in the world. Specifically, we learned Wu Jing Boxing from our master. Wu Jing Boxing, which is about 200 years old, is a combination of inside and outside boxing. Every gesture and motion is strong, vicious, flexible, and fairly easy for people to attack and defend. However, the biggest emphasis is to use it to defend\nThis program organizes martial art training by Mr. Wang Shenjiang who has 57 years of experience in Wu Jing Boxing and he was also a school teacher for many years. The moves and tactics which are learnt throughout the session are then performed by the participants during the closing ceremony.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
