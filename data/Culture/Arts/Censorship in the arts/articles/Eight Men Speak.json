{"parse":{"title":"Eight Men Speak","pageid":16113082,"revid":826445472,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><i><b>Eight Men Speak</b></i> is a <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canadian</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Play_(theatre)\" title=\"Play (theatre)\">play</a> written in 1933 by a committee of Oscar Ryan, E. Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg.  Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister <a href=\"/wiki/R._B._Bennett\" title=\"R. B. Bennett\">R. B. Bennett</a>. \n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Agit-prop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Agit-prop\">agit-prop</a> play told the story of <a href=\"/wiki/Tim_Buck\" title=\"Tim Buck\">Tim Buck</a> and his arrest as a <a href=\"/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Canada\" title=\"Communist Party of Canada\">Communist</a> under <a href=\"/wiki/Section_98\" title=\"Section 98\">Section 98</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada)\" title=\"Criminal Code (Canada)\">Criminal Code</a> that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime.  However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a <a href=\"/wiki/Prison_riot\" title=\"Prison riot\">prison riot</a> when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way.\n</p><p>The play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at <a href=\"/wiki/Toronto\" title=\"Toronto\">Toronto</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_Theatre_(Toronto)\" title=\"Standard Theatre (Toronto)\">Standard Theatre</a> on December 4, 1933.  The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in <a href=\"/wiki/Winnipeg\" title=\"Winnipeg\">Winnipeg</a> had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there.\n</p><p>When the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Arts_Club&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Progressive Arts Club (page does not exist)\">Progressive Arts Club</a> had a meeting to protest this <a href=\"/wiki/Censorship\" title=\"Censorship\">censorship</a>, a former minister, <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Edward_Smith\" title=\"Albert Edward Smith\">A. E. Smith</a>, described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader.  As a result, Smith was indicted for <a href=\"/wiki/Sedition\" title=\"Sedition\">sedition</a>, but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court.  Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Eight_Men_Speak&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Tim_Buck\" title=\"Tim Buck\">Tim Buck</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Canada\" title=\"Communist Party of Canada\">Communist Party of Canada</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Agitprop\" title=\"Agitprop\">Agitprop</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Eight_Men_Speak&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.grubstreetbooks.ca/essays/timbuck2.html\">Tim Buck Too, pg. 2</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2183\nCached time: 20180920171351\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.020 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.033 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 30/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.005/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 594 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   22.374      1 Template:Italic_title\n100.00%   22.374      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:16113082-0!canonical and timestamp 20180920171351 and revision id 826445472\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Canadian_plays"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Censorship_in_the_arts"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1933_plays"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Communism_in_Canada"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1933_in_Canada"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Censorship_in_Canada"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Agit-prop"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Agitprop"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Albert Edward Smith"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Canada"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Censorship"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Communist Party of Canada"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Criminal Code (Canada)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Play (theatre)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Prison riot"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"R.
