The Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy is awarded once a year by the Inamori Foundation for lifetime achievements in the arts and philosophy. The Prize is one of three Kyoto Prize categories; the others are the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology and the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences. The first Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy was awarded to Olivier Messiaen in 1985, the "greatest composer to have emerged from 20th century France".  The Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in fields which are traditionally not honored with a Nobel Prize.  A Kyoto laureate is awarded a gold medal, a diploma, and a prize money of 50 million yen (US$530,000 or â‚¬413,000 as of March 2013), making it one of the richest literary prizes in the world. The Kyoto Prize is awarded annually in three categories: Advanced Technology, Basic Sciences, and Arts and Philosophy. The category Arts and Philosophy consists of four fields which are awarded in alternating cycles: Music, Arts, Theater and Cinema, and Thought and Ethics.
