The Vladimir Nazor Award (Croatian: Nagrada Vladimir Nazor) is an annual award given by the Croatian Ministry of Culture to Croatian artists for highest achievements in various artistic fields. It was established in 1959 and is named for poet Vladimir Nazor. As of  2016[update], the award is given in the following six categories: Two awards are given in each category every year - a life achievement award (for overall contributions to their respective field) and an annual award (for notable works in the field in the past twelve months). The winners for the preceding year are announced every year on 19 June, the anniversary of Nazor's death. Awards marked with † denote shared wins.
