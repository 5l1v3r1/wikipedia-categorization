A Virtual Season or Virtual Series is a fan-driven continuation of a television program.  While they are typically written for cancelled programs, they sometimes run concurrently with programs that are still airing original episodes.  Virtual Seasons can be written by a single author, by several collaborating authors in a fandom, or even reproduced episodically in a single video or series of videos. These series can be written in screenplay or prose format.
