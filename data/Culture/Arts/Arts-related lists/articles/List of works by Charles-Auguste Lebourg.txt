Charles-Auguste Lebourg was a French sculptor born in Nantes in 1829. He died in Paris in 1906. This is a listing of his main works. These are listed below. In 1881, Lebourg executed an allegory of Nantes as part of the town hall's decoration.  Lebourg executed the bronze statue "Travail" for the École Diderot.  It was shown at the 1885 Paris Salon and the Paris Exposition Universelle (1889).    In 1872 Lebourg completed a posthumous bust in white marble based on a photograph of the Wallaces by Étienne Corjat of 1855. His white marble bust of Lady Wallace shown here was exhibited at the Paris salon in May 1872.  This Lebourg sculpture depicting a shepherd reading stands in the grounds of the Château de Fontainebleau.  Lebourg has three of his sculptures decorating parts of the outside of the Louvre. The Mollien Pavilion and the Ailes Mollien (an "aile" is a wing) is part of the cour Napoléon and is named after a Treasury minister at the time of the French Empire (Nicolas François, Count Mollien) and Lebourg's "La Chasse" is one of the group of children decorating what is known as the "aile en retour Mollien". The second of Lebourg's sculptures can be seen in the Richelieu pavilion where the tympanum of the arcade of the passage leading to the rue de Rivoli is decorated with Lebourg's bas relief "Vérite et Histoire". The third sculpture, again part of the cour Napoléon, decorates the Apollon rotunda and is entitled "La Force".  The Musée d'Orsay hold the plaster model of "La Chasse".  Lebourg is arguably best known for his caryatids for the famous cast-iron Wallace fountain, a public drinking fountain seen all over France and in many parts of the world. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. The caryatids depict "La Simplicité", "La Bonté", "La Sobriété" and "La Charite" as shown below. As external decoration of this building in Paris' 9th arrondissement, Lebourg created two caryatids.   This monument stands in Nantes's Place Duchesse-Anne. Four sculptors worked on the monument, Georges Bareau, Charles-Auguste Lebourg, Henri Émile Allouard and Louis-Auguste Baralis. Lebourg's contribution was the statue of the infantryman. The monument was erected in 1897 and the inauguration ceremony in April of that year was attended by Félix Faure, Jules Méline, Louis Barthou, Admiral Armand Besnard and Hippolyte-Étienne Étiennez the Nantes mayor. The bronze at the monument's summit, entitled "Pour le drapeau" was by Georges Bareau and had been cast in bronze by Barbedienne. It depicted a man slaying an eagle and at the monuments base were "le Fantassin" by Lebourg, "le Marin" by Louis Baralis, "l’Artilleur" by Émile Allouard and "Le Fusilier colonial" also by Allouard. In 1940 the occupying Germans dismantled the bronze believing that the slain eagle could be construed as representing the German eagle but the municipal workers of Nantes delegated to carry out the dismantlement managed to hide the sculpture, so stopping it being melted down. The work was retrieved in 1981, restored and re-erected in 1987. There is a Lebourg decoration on the outside of this building. Lebourg executed several medallions for tombs in this cemetery including that of Général Mellinet.   This bust is in Nantes' Jardin des plantes. Lebourg executed the equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in Nantes.         "Joueur de biniou, dansant la nigouce".  A bronze statuette shown at the 1857 Salon. "Vierge gauloise marchant au sacrifice".
