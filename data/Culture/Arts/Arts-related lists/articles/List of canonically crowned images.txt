The following list enumerates the various Marian, Josephian, and Christological images venerated in the Roman Catholic Church, by which a Pope has officially issued a Papal bull of canonical coronation either by the Pontiff, a Papal legate or a Papal nuncio. The very first Marian image crowned without a direct papal approval was by Cardinal Francesco Sforza Pallavicino with La Madonna della Oropa on 30Â August 1620. The first Marian image Pontifically crowned was the painted image of La Madonna della Febbre (Madonna of Fever) on 27 May 1631 by Pope Urban VIII through the Vatican Chapter located at the Sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica. The solemn prescription of ritual to crowning images is embedded in Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis published by the Holy Office on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of canonical coronations were handwritten on parchment. After 1989, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments began issuing the specific recognition to crown a religious image, spelling out its approved devotional title and authorizing Papal legate. Several venerated  images of the Child Jesus and Saint Joseph have also been granted a Pontifical coronation.
