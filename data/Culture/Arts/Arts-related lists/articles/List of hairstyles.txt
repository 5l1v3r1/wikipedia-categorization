The teeth edge of a comb was then used to define a central parting running from the crown to the nape at the back of the head, resembling, to many, the rear end of a duck. The hair on the top front of the head was usually that of a pompadour. The sides on back were styled to resemble the folded wings of the duck. Frosted tips were prominent throughout the late 1990s. 2. Longer hair worn in several ponytails running from front of the head to the back of the head resembling a mohawk. Unlike normal mohawk, hair is not cut from the sides. The word is a portmanteau of 'ponytail' and 'mohawk'.
