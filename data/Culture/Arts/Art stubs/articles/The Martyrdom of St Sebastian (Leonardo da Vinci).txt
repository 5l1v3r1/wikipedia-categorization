The Martyrdom of St Sebastian is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci showing the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. It was rediscovered in Paris in March 2016, classed as a 'tr√©sor national' and presented to the press on 10 January 2017. Its auction estimate was 15,000,000 Euros and initially it was placed under an export bar in June 2017 to give French museums 30 months to raise sufficient funds to buy it.
