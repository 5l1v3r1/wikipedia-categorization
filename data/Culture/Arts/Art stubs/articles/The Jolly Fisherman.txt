  The Jolly Fisherman is a poster created by artist John Hassall in 1908 after he had been commissioned by the Great Northern Railways (GNR). It is regarded as one of the most famous holiday advertisements of all time and is believed to have influenced the success of Skegness, Lincolnshire as a holiday destination.  The poster depicts a fisherman skipping along the beach, with the slogan "Skegness is SO bracing". There are different versions of the poster, however, the fisherman and the slogan are always part of the design. He is now the mascot for Skegness and celebrated his 100th birthday in 2008. "The Jolly Fisherman" is also the name of places located in Lincolnshire, such as a restaurant, a resort, among others.
