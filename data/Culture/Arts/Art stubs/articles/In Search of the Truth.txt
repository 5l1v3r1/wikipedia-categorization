In Search of the Truth is an interactive project composed of a touring, portable Truth Booth,    established in 2011. The initiative is run by The Cause Collective, a collaboration between Cause Collective artists Ryan Alexiev, Hank Willis Thomas and Jim Ricks.    The Truth Booth is 16-foot-tall by 23-foot-wide video booth, shaped like a giant inflatable speech bubble that invites visitors to record videos of themselves completing the sentence, "The truth is...".    The project was started in 2011 by artists Ryan Alexiev, Hank Willis Thomas and Jim Ricks.  In 2011, the project was first shown at the Galway International Arts Festival in Ireland.  In 2016, it launched into a 50-state tour of the United States before the United States presidential election, 2016.  As of 2017, the project has appeared in Ireland, South Africa, Afghanistan, Australia and in 50 cities across the United States.
