Within the 20th century, there came the use of plastics in art.  In the latter half of the century, plastic technology advanced so that it was feasible for artists to start using plastic and acrylics as an artwork medium. Artist Roxy Paine created a sculpture-making machine "Shumak No2.":  a large metal contraption that oozed acrylic on to a conveyor belt that jiggled slowly back and forth. The barely liquid plastic would pile up and solidify. After a few hours, the conveyor belt would move the pile forward and begin a new sculpture. Art made of commodity materials sometimes use found objects made of plastic.   Plastic containers are useful in papier-mâché for building frames.  Liquid acrylics can be used to create two and three dimensional plastic images and objects. Artist, Tyler Turkle, pours multiple thin layers of pigmented liquid acrylic to form sheets of plastic that result in paintings and sculptures. After adequate drying time between applications, these solid plastic sheets can be readily peeled off most surfaces and readhered to others.  Examples can be seen in the “Other plastic artwork” images below.
