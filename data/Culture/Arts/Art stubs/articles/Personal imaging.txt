Personal imaging is the continuous realtime capturing, archiving, recording, and sharing of personal experience through images. Typically the images are accompanied by other media such as audiovisual streams, or with textual narratives such as diaries, and often in an interactive way, i.e. people viewing the images comment on the images in realtime while they are being captured, so as to influence the capture process.
