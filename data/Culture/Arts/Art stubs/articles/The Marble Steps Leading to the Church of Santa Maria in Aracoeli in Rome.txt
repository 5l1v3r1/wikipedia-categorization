The Marble Steps Leading to the Church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in Rome is a painting by the Danish painter, C. W. Eckersberg. It was painted in 1814-1816. Choosing a position from below, Eckersberg created a composition of firm vertical and diagonal lines in this painting of a medieval church in Rome. He painted the picture while being outside and carefully recorded the mid-morning sunlight and shadows.
