Industrial Painting  is defined by the 1959 "Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art",  a text by Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio which was originally published in Notizie Arti Figurative No. 9 (1959). A French translation was soon published in Internationale Situationniste no.3 (1959).  In May 1997, Molly Klein translated the original Italian-language version into English.
