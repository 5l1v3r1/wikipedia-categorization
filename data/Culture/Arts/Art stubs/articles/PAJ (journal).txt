PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art, originally Performing Arts Journal, is a triannual academic journal of arts that was established in 1976 by Bonnie Marranca and Gautam Dasgupta. It has taken a particular interest in contemporary performance art and features expanded coverage in video, drama, dance, installations, media, and music. The journal is published by special arrangement with the MIT Press. Issues can also be accessed through the online databases JSTOR and Project MUSE. PAJ integrates theatre and visual arts in an expanded view of performance history. The journal publishes essays, interviews and artists' writings, reviews of new exhibitions, performances, and books, and also, plays and performance texts from the United States and abroad. The journal publishes a play in each issue. In recent years PAJ has featured new series on performance drawings; art, spirituality and religion; dialogues on crossovers in performance and visual arts. PAJ Publications is the journal's book division, with more than 150 titles reviewed to date.
