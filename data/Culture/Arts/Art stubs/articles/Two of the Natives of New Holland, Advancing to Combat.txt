Two of the Natives of New Holland, Advancing to Combat is a drawing by Sydney Parkinson, drawn in 1770 and published posthumously in 1773. It is the earliest known portrayal of an Australian Aborigine by a European, and a typical example of a painting in the noble savage ideal, showing proud warriors, bravely advancing in defence of their land. The stance of the warriors is said to be based upon the Borghese Gladiator.
