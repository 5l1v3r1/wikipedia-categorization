This is a list of stage mothers.  In the entertainment industry, a stage mother is the term for the mother of a child performer.  Often the stage mother is the manager of the child's career and oversees their auditions, costuming and preparation for performances and negotiates financial remuneration on the child's behalf. There is sometimes a negative connotation for the term, sometimes implying a mother who exerts unreasonable demands for the child's treatment, or puts undue pressure on the child, or who may take advantage of the child's income or notoriety for her own selfish purposes.
