Lineography is the art of drawing without lifting the pen, pencil, or paintbrush that is being used.  The practice originated in France in the seventeenth century. It fell into disuse by the early nineteenth century.  Lineography experienced a resurgence in 1960 with the release of the Etch A Sketch.  In some instances, entire landscapes and still lifes have been drawn or painted using this lineographic technique.  Famous works of art, such as the Mona Lisa, have been reproduced using the Etch A Sketch.  The television show How It's Made used Lineography in the short segments at the beginnings of many episodes giving a summary of the history of the episode's subject.
