Chromolithe ("light from stone") is a light art that gives the impression that the buildings have been painted with glowing colours.  Chromolithe installations have been made for cathedrals and churches, historic public buildings, modern art museums, and even banks. The chromolithe process starts with data collection, using a specially-built photographic chamber, months of meticulous art work on computer screens, and finally re-projecting the image, printed to 24x24 cm photographic plates, back onto the building from a series of custom-built 6000Kva Xenon projectors, discreetly placed, so as to make the light source appear invisible.  Some of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, work like that of Patrice Warrener's can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.
