The Oregon Historic District is a neighborhood in Dayton, Ohio. The Oregon District includes one of the earliest surviving combinations of commercial and residential architecture in Dayton. Examples of Dayton’s architectural history from 1820 to 1915 line the brick streets and lanes in this 12 square block area.  Styles range from Federal to Queen Anne. Excellent examples of late Victorian commercial and residential architecture illustrate both the entrepreneurial success and the increasing affluence of many Oregon merchants and residents. The district is populated with art galleries, specialty shops, pubs, nightclubs, and coffee houses.  In 1974, Oregon was registered on the National Register of Historic Places, between Patterson Blvd. and Wayne Ave., north to Gates St. and south to U.S. Route 35, and Downtown Dayton (No. 75001506).
