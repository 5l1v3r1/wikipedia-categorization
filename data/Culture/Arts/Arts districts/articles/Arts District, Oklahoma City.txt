The Arts District is an area containing many of Oklahoma City's best attractions and venues. Many of the buildings in the district are known for urban art deco architecture and charm. Located at the near western portion of downtown OKC just outside the skyscrapers of the Central Business District, the Arts District includes World Class attractions such as the Myriad Gardens, the Civic Center Music Hall, Stage Centre for the Performing Arts, the Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library, the Oklahoma City Municipal Building, the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, and the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The district is currently experiencing a building boom (along with the rest of downtown), as announcements for new housing and retail projects frequent the Oklahoma City media circles. Due west of the Arts District is the Film Exchange District and WesTown, soon to experience a boom of their own as the renaissance of downtown Oklahoma City continues to move west.
