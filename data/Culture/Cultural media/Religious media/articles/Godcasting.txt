A Godcast is a podcast of religious nature, including music, preaching, seminary lectures, Bible readings, meditations and kids' programs. Such podcasts are available within most religious traditions and across multiple formats - audio only as well as audio-visual. The number of Godcasts is growing rapidly - many are created by independent churches, synagogues, and seminaries and materials have been recorded by Pope Benedict XVI.   The Godcast Network appears[where?] to have been the first to register the term on the web, creating its Christian podcast site in October 2004. Founder Craig Patchett holds a trademark on the term.
