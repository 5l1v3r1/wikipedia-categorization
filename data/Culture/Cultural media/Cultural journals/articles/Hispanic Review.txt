It is available online through Project MUSE and JSTOR. The current general editor is Román de la Campa (University of Pennsylvania). Russell P. Sebold has been the longest-serving editor, having directed the journal for over twenty-nine years. Ignacio Javier López, Barbara Fuchs, and Michael Solomon have served as editors in the past.
