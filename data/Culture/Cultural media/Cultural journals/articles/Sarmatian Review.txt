Sarmatian Review (ISSNÂ 1059-5872)  is an English language peer reviewed academic journal on Slavistics, which is the study of culture, history, and societies of Slavic nations (located in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe) published by the Polish Institute of Houston at Rice University three times a year in January, April, and September. Since 1992 an abbreviated web edition appears six to ten weeks after the print edition and is available freely from their website. The editor is Ewa Thompson. It was founded in 1981 under the title of Houston Sarmatian under the auspices of the Houston Chapter of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences. In 1988 it was renamed the Sarmatian Review. The Polish Institute of Houston was formed in 1999 as a nonprofit public foundation, a cultural and educational institution whose main goal has been to continue the publication of Sarmatian Review.  The intent of the publication: "The Sarmatian Review was conceived by a group of American Polish scholars who observed a dearth of scholarly journals that would allow the Polish-American points of view to be heard. Polish-Americans, and other Americans of Central European ancestry, will be able to speak for themselves in a scholarly publication that reflects Central European and Polish-American identity."  The name of the publications comes from Sarmatia, a semi-legendary name for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a multi-cultural state that spanned most of Eastern Europe from 16th to 18th centuries. It deals with a variety of subjects: country-related articles (Poland, Russia and Ukraine being most prominent), the post-Soviet period, the American and European ethnic issues and matters related mass media, higher education, literature, government, religion and politics. It contains articles, review and sometimes literature samples (poetry).
