Terrain is a French academic journal of ethnology, social and cultural anthropology (the three terms are not clearly distinguished in France).  Each issue is entirely devoted to a specific theme.  It aims to address both specialists and the educated general public; it was initially focused on contemporary France society and then extended on Europe; it also addresses theoretical considerations but with a language accessible to the general public.
