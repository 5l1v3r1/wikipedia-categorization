The Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies (HJAS) is an English-language scholarly journal published by the Harvard-Yenching Institute. HJAS features articles and book reviews of current scholarship in East Asian Studies, focusing on Chinese, Japanese, and Korean history, literature and religion, with occasional coverage of politics and linguistics. It has been called "still Americas's leading sinological journal."   Serge Elisséeff founded the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies in 1936 under the auspices of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, an independent, non-profit organization founded in 1928 to further the spread of knowledge and scholarship on East and Southeast Asia.  Elisséeff's wide range of knowledge came to be reflected in the diverse character of the journal during the twenty-one years he served as its editor (1936-1957). He received a degree from Tokyo Imperial University, making him the first Westerner to do so. Fluent in eight languages, including Chinese and Japanese, Elisséeff was one of the foremost Japanologists of his time, both in the West and in Japan. He had close personal ties to many of the greatest literary names of the first half of the century and wrote occasional articles for the Asahi Shimbun.  Since the days of Elisséeff, the journal has been guided by: The journal was published three times yearly from its inception until 1947. From 1948 until 1957 it was released biannually, but from 1958 to 1976 the journal was released only annually or in two-year periods. Since 1977 it has been published twice yearly in June and December. The Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, with Monumenta Nipponica, is one of the largest and most influential American journals on East Asian scholarship. The journal focuses on analytical articles and does not print translations, unlike Monumenta Nipponica.
