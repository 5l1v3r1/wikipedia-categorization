  Essays in French Literature and Culture is an annual peer-reviewed academic journal published by the University of Western Australia.  It was established in 1964 by James R. Lawler, the Foundation Chair of French Studies at this university. The journal focuses on French Studies, in a broad sense. From its inception, the journal’s main aim has been "to draw attention to broader aspects of French literary culture".  The Journal is currently available in print and online. The journal was established in 1964 by James R. Lawler.  In 1975, the journal's editorship passed on to Denis Boak who, in a commemorative issue celebrating the journal's fiftieth anniversary, argues that Essays in French Literature was a "free-standing intellectual endeavour" providing "an extra outlet for young scholars to publish".  He was succeeded by Andrew Hunwick in 1995. Hélène Jaccomard took over in 2007.A growing interest in cultural studies in the field of French studies led to a widening of the scope of the journal and its renaming in 2008. The new title reflects this wider emphasis on culture. In the context of the crisis in academic publishing,  and as one of only two French Studies academic journals in Australia, Essays in French Literature and Culture has shown a remarkable ability to survive thanks to the quality of the articles it stringently selects, and its widening readership which is its only financial means of support. The journal's importance is acknowledged by the Australian Society of French Studies  and Informit database.
