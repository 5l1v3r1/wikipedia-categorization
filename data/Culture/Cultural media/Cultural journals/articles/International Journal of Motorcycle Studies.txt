The International Journal of Motorcycle Studies (IJMS) is the first peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study and discussion of motorcycling culture. The journal considers motorcycling culture in all its forms â€” from the experience of riding and racing to the history of the machine, the riders and design to the images of motorcycling and motorcyclists in film, advertising and literature.
