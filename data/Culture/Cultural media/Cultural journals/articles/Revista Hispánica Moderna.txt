Revista Hispánica Moderna is a peer-reviewed academic journal which focuses on research in Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian literature and culture. It was founded in 1934 as Boletín del Instituto de las Españas at Columbia University. The current editor is Carlos J. Alonso, the Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University. The journal is published semiannually by the University of Pennsylvania Press. It is available online through Project MUSE and JSTOR. In 2009, the Council of Editors of Learned Journals awarded the Revista Hispánica Moderna the 2009 Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement.   The description reads as follows: "This award goes to the most improved journal, regardless of its state at the time the renovations began. A weak journal that has become excellent is eligible, but so too is an admired journal that manages to become dramatically better. Submissions must feature significant editorial change and may also feature change in design and other aspects of the journal's publication."
