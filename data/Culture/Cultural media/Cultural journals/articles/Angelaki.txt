Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities is a British-based international academic journal founded in 1993 that "represents the productive nexus of work in the disciplinary fields of literary criticism and theory, philosophy, and cultural studies."   Since 1998, it has been published by Routledge, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group. In 1996, while it was still an independent publication, the journal was named "Best New Journal" in the annual awards of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals.  The journal is abstracted and indexed in Scopus,  Current Contents/Arts & Humanities, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index,  amongst others.    From 1993 until 2010 the journal published three issues a year. This was increased to four issues a year in 2011. In 2018, the journal's 25th-anniversary year, the frequency was further increased to six issues per volume, a volume normally comprising four special issues and two general (nontheme) issues.  Special issues of the journal are frequently republished by Routledge as books. In 1996 editors of the journal established an associated book series, Angelaki Humanities, with Manchester University Press.
