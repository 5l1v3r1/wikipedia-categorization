Naked Punch Review is a quarterly interdisciplinary review and magazine of philosophy, art, politics and poetry. Contributors have included  Antonio Negri, Jacques Ranciere, Tariq Ali, Wim Wenders, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Arthur Danto, Richard Shusterman, Simon Critchley, Walden Bello, Michael Taussig, Adonis, Mahmoud Darvish among others. The magazine was founded in 2002 by a collective of young London-based thinkers called the PostAnalytic group,  now dissolved. The founding editors were Qalandar Bux Memon, Lorenzo Marsili  and Jacopo Moroni. The journal initially emerged in contraposition to the dominant analytical thought in British philosophy. It advocated an approach open to the arts, literature, and continental theory, with a strong political focus. The journal presents a strong focus on non-European philosophy, political theory, and arts. Special issues have looked at contemporary cultural production in China, Pakistan, and Latin America.
