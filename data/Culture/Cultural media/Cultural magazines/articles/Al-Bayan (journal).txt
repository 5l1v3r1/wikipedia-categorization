 The Arabic periodical al-Bayān (English: "announcement" or "declaration") was published once or twice a month from 1 March 1897 until 16 August 1898. It was edited in Cairo by Ibrahīm Al-Yāziǧī (1847–1906)  and Bišāra Zalzal (1851–1905) and was the successor of the medical journal aṭ-Ṭabīb (1884–1885). Since 1898, Al-Yāziǧī, a linguist and journalist from Lebanon, particularly built up his reputation as the chief editor of the journal aḍ-Ḍiyāʾ (1898-1906).  Apart from scientific articles, al-Bayān focuses on cultural and anthropological topics such as language and education.
