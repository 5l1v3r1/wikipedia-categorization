Abolishing The Borders From Below was an anarchist magazine published by a Berlin-based collective since 2001.     It was formed by a handful of Eastern European migrant anarchists and political and counter-cultural anti-authoritarians. The bi-monthly magazine was filled with articles from correspondents around Eastern Europe and consisted of information about different political and cultural processes and activities in the region seen, commented on and analysed from an anarchist perspective. It was printed regularly and distributed around the globe by Eastern Europe contributors and by Active Distribution,  from South Africa to the Philippines. The magazine folded in 2010.
