FUTU Magazine is a concept magazine about design, art and trends in luxury. It appears every two months and is distributed worldwide in concept stores (like 10 Corso Como in Milan or Colette in Paris), design boutiques and museum bookshops (Tate Modern in London). FUTU is co-created by some well-known graphic design studios in Europe like Studio8 Design and Alber Folch Studio. FUTU was awarded many prestigious awards, e.g. International Press Design "Chimera" Award 2008 for the best magazine, Grand Front Annual Contest 2009 award for the best cover page and Certificate of Typographical Excellence by Type Directors Club in New York. It was also shortlisted for the Design Week Awards for the editorial design.
