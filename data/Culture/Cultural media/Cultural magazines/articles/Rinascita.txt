 Rinascita (meaning Rebirth) was an Italian political and cultural magazine published in Rome, Italy between 1944 and March 1991. It was one of the media outlets of Italian Communist Party (PCI). Rinascita was founded in 1944.   The founder was Palmiro Togliatti.  The magazine, published on a monthly basis, was headquartered in Rome.  It was an official organ of the Italian Communist Party (PCI).    The magazine described the party as the one, which had the most comprehensive vision of the nation's interests.  It attempted to make a connection between Gramsci and Stalin.  From 1962 the magazine was published weekly.   At the end of the 1980s Rinascita temporarily stopped publication due to low circulation figures.  It was soon relaunched, but again ceased publication in March 1991.  Alberto Asor Rosa was the last editor of the magazine.
