Usona Esperantisto (English: American Esperantist) is the bi-monthly publication of Esperanto-USA, the organization for Esperanto speakers in the United States. Most of the content is in Esperanto, with the remainder in English. Topics include discussions of Esperanto culture, book reviews, short stories, and games.  First appearing in the 1960s, the magazine has changed names several times, from North American Esperanto Review to ELNA Newsletter to Esperanto USA. The name Usona Esperantisto was adopted in 2008. In 2012 the magazine became a web publication. The website features both current articles as well as a growing archive of back-issues.
