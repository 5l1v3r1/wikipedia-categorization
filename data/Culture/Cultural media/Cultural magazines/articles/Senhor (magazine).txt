 Senhor (also stylized as Sr., meaning Sir in English) was a monthly cultural magazine published in the period of 1959 and 1964. The magazine was headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Senhor was established by Nahum Sirotsky in 1959.   Nahum Sirotsky was a Brazilian diplomat and journalist, who hailed from a Jewish family.  The first issue of Senhor was published in March 1959.  Its headquarters was in Rio de Janeiro.  Senhor was published on a monthly basis.  The magazine was very creative in terms of graphic design and its design is regarded as one of the significant projects in the Brazilian press of the 1960s.  The covers of Senhor were produced by well known artists, including artist Carlos Scliar and caricaturist Jaguar.  The latter also served as the main caricaturist of the magazine.  Regular contributors were Paulo Francis, Armando Nogueira, Luiz Lobo, Clarice Lispector,  Otto Lara Resende, Carlos Heitor Cony, Graciliano Ramos, Rubem Braga  Jorge Amado and Carlos Drummond de Andrade.  Senhor's target audience was the Brazilian upper-classes with higher levels of education.  The magazine featured articles concerning literature, visual arts, society and politics.  The novella by Jorge Amado, The Two Deaths of Quincas Wateryell, was first published in the inauguration issue of Senhor, which was later published as a book.   Various stories of Clarice Lispector were also first published in the magazine, including Uma grama de radium-Mineirinho in 1962.  Two years later the story was published in her book named A Legi√£o Estrangeira.  Senhor folded with the January 1964 issue after producing a total of 59 issues.
