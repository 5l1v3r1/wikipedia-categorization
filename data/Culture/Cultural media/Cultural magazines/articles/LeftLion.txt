Alison Emm (October 2013 – May 2017) LeftLion is a printed and online culture and listings magazine which covers Nottingham, with a specific focus on the local music and arts scene. It was originally set up by three childhood friends: Jared Wilson, Alan Gilby and Tim Bates and launched as a website on 1 September 2003. The first issue of the printed magazine came out a year later in Autumn 2004. The organisation takes its name from a stone lion in Nottingham's Old Market Square, which since Nottingham Council House was built in the 1920s has been known as a meeting point for people in Nottingham City Centre. LeftLion is put together by a range of creatives who all either live in or have links to the city of Nottingham. Most of these contribute on a voluntary basis. Contributors have included Al Needham, actor Paul Kaye, Miles Hunt (lead singer of The Wonder Stuff), Nicola Monaghan, Tom Hathaway (author of Full Bacon Jacket), Rob Cutforth (award-winning Canadian blogger), Wayne Burrows, Ash Dilks, Jennie Syson, Andrew 'MulletProofPoet' Graves, Nathan Miller and Roger Mean. The current editorial team consists of Alison Emm, Jared Wilson, Adrian Bhagat, Paul Klotschkow, James Walker, Aly Stoneman, Penny Reeve, Scott Oliver, Dave Parry, and Dominic Henry. The magazine's artistic team run by Alan Gilby and Photo Editor Dave Parry, including Raphael Achache, Becca Hibberd, Si Mitchell, Rob White, Rikki Marr, and Steve Larder. Cover artists in 2013 included Jon Burgerman and Jon Blanche.

In late 2006 and 2007, LeftLion were nominated for a series of awards including Best Free Music Magazine by Record of the Day, Ambassadors of Nottingham by BBC Radio Nottingham and for their use of technology in the Nottingham Creative Business Awards. The Nottingham Evening Post referred to them as "the high priests of Nottingham culture". In 2009, LeftLion won the 'Writing and Publishing' award at the Nottingham Creative Business Awards, in a ceremony held at the Nottingham Council House on 7 October 2009. They were also runners-up for the award of Creative Business of the Year.

LeftLion also sponsors free music nights at venues in the city featuring bands from the area, a weekly pub quiz and has produced a series of podcasts and live literature events.
