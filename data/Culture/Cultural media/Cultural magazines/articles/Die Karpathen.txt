Die Karpathen (The Carpathians) was a German-language publication that appeared twice a month in Kronstadt, Austria-Hungary (now Braşov, Romania) between 1907 - 1914. Subintitled Halbmonatsschrift für Kultur und Leben  (Bimonthly publication for culture and life), the work was originally posted by Adolf Meschendörfer. Die Karpathen featured articles on science and economics but Meschendörfer affirmed that he supported the "Saxons' need to escape from the traditional frame and from the vision they had about themselves".  As an example of the themes that appeared in the magazine, below is a summary of topics from a magazine from the third year of appearance, first semester, October 1909 - March 1910: The magazine stopped publishing because of the First World War.
