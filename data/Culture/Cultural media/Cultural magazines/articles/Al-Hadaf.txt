 Al-Hadaf (Arabic: الهدف‎), (English: The Target) is a Palestinian weekly political and cultural magazine published in Lebanon.  Al Hadaf was founded in Beirut in 1969  by Ghassan Kanafani as the political mouthpiece of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),   espousing a Marxist–Leninist version of pan-Arab Palestinian nationalism. Kanafani also served as the editor-in-chief of the weekly.   In 1972, Kanafani was killed by a car bomb, but Al Hadaf remains in publication. The magazine is based in Beirut.
