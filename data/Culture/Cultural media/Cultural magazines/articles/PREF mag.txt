PREF mag or Préférences Mag was a French bimonthly gay magazine founded in March 2004.  The magazine was part of Prefmag Editions.  The headquarters was in Levallois-Perret.  It was a competitor of the magazine Têtu. It was known for its high quality images among other attributes.  Although it was a leading prominent and well selling publication for the gay communities it faced criticisms for being politically bland and not embracing non-consumeristic aspirations.    They included some more risque content including supportive of LGBT families and open-marriages in line with that of modern French culture.  They also were supportive of non-standard views of masculinity and how one's sexuality should conform to traditional models.  PREF mag ceased publication in March 2011.  Category:LGBT culture
