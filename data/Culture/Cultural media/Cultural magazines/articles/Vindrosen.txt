It focused on literary work.  During the 1950s the magazine was under the influence of the writers contributed to Heretica.  However, later it abandoned their views  and  their cold war approach, and began to adopt an emphasize on the third world countries.  In addition, it became one of the supporters of modernism and radicalism in the 1960s and 1970s in Denmark.  In the 1960s it also featured criticisms of literature and society.  The magazine closely collaborated with the paper Information on these issues.  Around the 1968 Student Revolution events the magazine was a platform for the young leftist intellectuals.
