 Tokyo Journal is an English-language quarterly magazine about Tokyo and Japan, which was established in 1981. The international edition of the magazine was published under the title Japan Journal for a time.  Tokyo Journal was founded in 1981, and owned for a number of years by the Japanese magazine distributor Yohan.  Its editors-in-chief have included Don Morton and Greg Starr.   In 1987, Boy√© Lafayette De Mente became Associate Publisher of the Tokyo Journal. Together with Editor Glenn Davis, they made Tokyo Journal the first publication in Japan to produce a magazine on a computer from scratch using Apple Macintosh computers. He later returned as a regular contributor to the Tokyo Journal, which continues to print articles he left to the magazine in tribute to him. The magazine was later sold to the Tokyo-based translation and publishing company Nexxus Communications K.K.  Ownership was transferred to Tokyo Journal International, Inc. in 2012, and the magazine's first publication under the new ownership was the December 2012 issue, number 270.  Tokyo Journal is the oldest English magazine still on sale in Japanese bookstores.  The magazine's approach has been to cover Japanese culture as seen through the eyes of those who know and live it.
