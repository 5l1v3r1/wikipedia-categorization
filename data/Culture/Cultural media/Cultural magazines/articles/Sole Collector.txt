Sole Collector started in Portland, Oregon where it quickly became the leading source for sneaker news. Currently, the company is based in New York. The company reports on everything sneaker related. Sole Collector reports on trends in niche cultures such as sneaker culture. Sole Collector was founded in 2003 by Steve Mulholland, Alex Wang, and Nicole Fesette as a print magazine aimed at providing young males a report of the latest in sneaker culture. Its origins reach back to 1999 when Mulholland created Instyleshoes.com which was both a forum and web store. Instyleshoes (The Forum) was later re-branded Sole Collector (the brand) along with a print magazine and blog. After Sole Collector began to take off, Instyleshoes.com (The web store) was sold in 2010 and is now run by parent company "Ivehademall." In 2013, Sole Collector was purchased by Complex Media (now Complex Networks), adding the magazine and website to its roster of "owned and operated" brands.  In 2010, Sole Collector released issue 34 dubbed â€˜The Ultimate Issue' which was the first issue released in hard cover format. The magazine released its first IPAD all digital magazine issue in 2012 with an exclusive interview with Tinker Hatfield and Tiffany Beers, shot at a secret location on Nike campus. Sole Collector has worked with many sneaker companies including Nike, Jordan Brand, Reebok and Under Armour to create unique sneakers for the brand.
