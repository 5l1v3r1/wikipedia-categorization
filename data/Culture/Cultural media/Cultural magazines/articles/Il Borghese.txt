 Il Borghese is a weekly cultural and political magazine with a right-wing stance published in Rome, Italy. Il Borghese was established by Leo Longanesi in 1950.   He founded other magazines such as L'italiano and Omnibus.  The magazine was named after the conservative Borghese family.  It is published weekly and has a right-wing and conservative stance.   Leopoldo Longanesi and Indro Montanelli were the early co-editors of Il Borghese.  The former held the post until his death in 1957.  In the 1950s the magazine was close to Christian Democracy Party.  However, its support ended when Longanesi argued that the party was too weak to counter the "communist threat".  Il Borghese was closed down in 2001.  It was relaunched in Rome in December 2012.
