Irana Esperantisto (Iranian Esperantist) is an independent quarterly culture magazine, which is published in Esperanto and in Persian in Tehran and distributed internationally. Its Persian title is Payame Sabz-andishan (literally: Message of the Green-Thinkers or the Green-Adepts). About half of the content of each edition is in Esperanto and the other half in Persian. This magazine is an important forum for liberal and progressive thinking. In 2003, long articles about Shirin Ebadi, Alfred Nobel and Berta von Suttner were published in this magazine. Newsweek published some articles which were first published in Irana Esperantisto.
