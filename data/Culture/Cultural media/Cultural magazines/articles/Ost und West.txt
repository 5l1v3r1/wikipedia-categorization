Ost und West ("East and West") was a German magazine meant to bridge the German Jewish world and the Eastern European Jewish world.  The magazine, headquartered in Berlin, operated from 1901 to 1923.   It was the first "ethnic magazine" in human history and the first Jewish illustrierte (DE).  The editors intended to reverse assimilation of Jewish people into the wider German society and David Brenner, author of "Neglected 'Women's' Texts and Contexts: Vicki Baum's Jewish Ghetto Stories," stated that the editors hoped to accomplish this "by constructing an ethnic identity that included East European or "Eastern" forms of Jewishness."  David A. Brenner, author of German-Jewish Popular Culture before the Holocaust: Kafka's kitsch, wrote that the magazine is an "ideal" source for evaluating the reception to Yiddish theatre in Germany especially since "studies of popular Berlin theater, including Yiddish-language theater, are few and far between".
