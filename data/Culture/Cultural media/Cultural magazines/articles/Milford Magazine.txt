Milford Magazine, a regional lifestyle publication, was published from 2001 to 2009.   It produced approximately 10 issues per year and was distributed to over 200 high-traffic locations by Pike Media Partners, a media startup co-owned by Sean Strub.  Krista Gromalski served as its Editor from 2001 through 2005.  While located in Milford, Pennsylvania, it was distributed throughout the Delaware River Highlands region: Pike, Wayne, and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania; the Orange and Sullivan counties in New York; and Sussex county of New Jersey. Milford Magazine's core distribution area, Pike County, is the fastest growing county in Pennsylvania. Milford Magazine's editorial mission was to re-brand Milford and the northern Pocono Mountains area as a distinct region known as the Delaware River Highlands, and to distance it from the traditional Pocono brand.   The magazine's tagline was Navigating the Delaware River Highlands. Milford Magazine received a 2005 Community Service Award from the Upper Delaware Council in recognition of the publication's mission to cover topics of importance within the Delaware River Valley.
