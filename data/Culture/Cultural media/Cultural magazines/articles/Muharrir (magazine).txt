The Ottoman journal Muharrir (Ottoman-Turkish: محرر; DMG: Muḥarrir; english: "Author") was published in Istanbul in 8 issues from 1876 to 1878. The editor was Ebüzziya Tevfik (1848-1913), a member of the Young Ottomans (a predecessor movement of Young Turks) to which also the journalists and authors İbrahim Şinasi, Namık Kemal and Ziya Paşa belonged.  Ebüzziya published among others the political newspapers İbret (1872), Hadika (1872) and Sirac (1873) as well as the literary journals Cüzdan and Mecmua-i Ebüzziya (1880-1912).  Muharrir was also more a literary than a political journal. Because of his journalistic and political activities Ebüzziya fled for some years to exile to Rhodes and Konya. During this time he handed over the management of the journal to Şemsettin Sami (1850-1904).  He returned to Istanbul after the death of Sultan Abdülaziz and founded a publishing house which published the products of well-known authors like Namık Kemal, Ziya Paşa, İbrahim Şinasi, Ahmet Rasim, Recaizade Ekrem and Muallim Naci.
