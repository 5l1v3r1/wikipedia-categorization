 Magyar Demokrata (Hungarian Democrat in English)  is a weekly magazine published in Budapest, Hungary. Magyar Demokrata is published on a weekly basis and has its headquarters in Budapest.  The magazine has a right wing conservative political leaning and is run by András Bencsik who is the editor.   The weekly is described by Krisztián Ungváry as a far-right publication  and by János Salamon as a neo-Nazi or neo-Arrow Cross magazine.  The magazine is also regarded as part of conservative media which appeared in the country in 2010.  Magyar Demokrata, a social-criticism and cultural magazine, features anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi articles, according to the Heinrich Böll Stiftung and the United States Department of State.    However, the weekly claims that anti-Semitism does not exist in Hungary and that it is “a political weapon used by liberals and leftists."  Péter Csermely is one of the former editors of Magyar Demokrata.
