 Heretica was a conservative cultural and literary magazine published in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1948 to 1953.   Heretica was established in 1948.  One of the founders was Thorkild Bjørnvig.  It was largely inspired by the British periodical The Criterion by T. S. Eliot.  The magazine adopted an anti-ideological humanism approach.   Heretica was produced by the poets who looked for new reality and challenged the conventional ideas of Christianity, humanism and communism.  The magazine also covered the poems and writings of promising authors.  The contributors of the magazine were called the Heretica School members, who had conservative existentialist views.  The magazine was edited by the following Danish writers and poets: Thorkild Bjørnvig (volumes 1-2), Martin A. Hansen and Ole Wivel (volumes 3-4) and Frank Jæger and Tage Skou-Hansen (volumes 5-6).  Some of the contributors were Jørgen Gustava Brandt, Benny Andersen, Per Højholt,  Paul la Cour and Erik Knudsen.  The magazine ended publication in 1953  and was succeeded by another magazine, Vindrosen.
