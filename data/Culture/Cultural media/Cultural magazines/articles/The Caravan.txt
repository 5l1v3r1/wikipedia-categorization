  The Caravan is an Indian English-language, long-form narrative journalism magazine covering politics and culture. It was relaunched in January 2010 as "India’s only narrative journalism magazine."   The Caravan was first launched in 1940 by founder Vishwa Nath as Dehli Press's first magazine. The magazine lasted until 1988 when it was closed. The Caravan magazine was revived in 2009 and since its first issue in 2010 it is published from New Delhi, India, by Delhi Press.    The managing editor called The Caravan an "editorial success, not a business success".  The audience for The Caravan was described as the "pop intelligentsia."  The circulation has grown to 40,000 since its launch.  The magazine was issued legal notices in April 2013 regarding its May cover story about Attorney General Goolam Essaji Vahanvati but the top three editors decided to continue with its publication.  Paresh Nath is editor-in-chief and his son Anant Nath is the managing editor. Vinod K. Jose is the executive editor.   While rebuilding The Caravan's brand, the staff was less than 10 and grew three-fold over the next five years.  Jonathan Shainin, formerly with The New Yorker, joined the team in 2010 as a senior editor and left to go back to his former employer as a news editor in 2013.  Accomplished writers like Ramachandra Guha, Arundhati Roy, Pankaj Mishra, William Dalrymple, Siddhartha Deb, Fatima Bhutto, Amitava Kumar, Deborah Baker, Basharat Peer have written for this magazine. In 2011, the magazine was the subject of a Rs 50 crore defamation suit by the Indian Institute of Planning and Management after it featured a profile of its head, Arindam Chaudhuri.   In 2015, The Caravan was served a legal notice by the Essar Group. Essar later filed a ₹250 crore civil defamation suit against the magazine.
