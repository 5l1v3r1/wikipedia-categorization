The Revue des deux Mondes (French: [ʁəvy de dø mɔ̃d], Review of the Two Worlds) is a French language monthly literary, cultural and political affairs magazine that has been published in Paris since 1829.  According to its website, "it is today the place for debates and dialogues between nations, disciplines and cultures, about the major subjects of our societies". The main shareholder is Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière's FIMALAC Group. The Revue des deux Mondes was founded by Prosper Mauroy and Pierre de Ségur-Dupeyron, first appearing on 1 August 1829. The anodyne periodical with the subtitle Journal des voyages was purchased by a young printer, Auguste-Jean Auffray, who convinced his college roommate François Buloz to edit it: its original emphasis on travel and foreign affairs soon shifted;  according to its website, it was created in order to "establish a cultural, economic and political bridge between France and the United States", the Old World and the New.[a] It was purchased in 1831 by Charles Buloz, who was its editor until 1877. Another influential editor in its history was Ferdinand Brunetière (after 1893). Among the early regular contributors who established the review's reputation as an elite liberal vehicle of haute culture  were Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, François Guizot, Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry, Ludovic Vitet, Paul-François Dubois (fr), the literary critics Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Gustave Planche, and Jean-Jacques Ampère.
