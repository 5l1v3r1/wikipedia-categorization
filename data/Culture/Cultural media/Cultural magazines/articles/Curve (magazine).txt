Curve is a lesbian magazine published in the United States. It covers news, politics, social issues, and includes celebrity interviews and stories on entertainment, pop culture, style, travel, and a website that hosts an internet forum focusing on lesbian issues, active since 2000. Founded by Frances Stevens in San Francisco in 1990, the magazine was first published as Deneuve but was renamed in 1996 after a trademark dispute with French actress Catherine Deneuve . The magazine reports its circulation at 52,237, with a readership whose median household income is $85,372.  The magazine was acquired by Avalon Media in 2010.  The magazine has its headquarters in San Francisco.  The magazine was featured on the Showtime series The L Word when a writer from the magazine interviews the character Jenny about her book. In May 2007, actress Michelle Rodriguez criticized Curve magazine and accused its editors of attempting to "out" her. She posted the following on her blog; "...but when people come out of nowhere and put words in my mouth or call me Gay, they should really think for one second How they could truly affect my life by doing such things. You don't know what producer, director, would be husband or future audience member may be influenced by these opinions and media content."  Her comments ended up angering many in the gay community and some even accused her of being homophobic. Rodriguez has denied those claims as well. In the July/August 2007 issue of Curve, editors responded to this criticism by stating: "If you read the article, you will see that the author did not, in fact, 'out' Rodriguez; rather, the article stated both that "Rodriguez has never publicly come out" and "Rodriguez has said she is not a lesbian."
