 Razpotja (Slovene for Crossroads) is a Slovenian quarterly cultural magazine, part of the Eurozine network of European magazines.   Razpotja was founded in the autumn of 2010 in Nova Gorica, Slovenia, by a local association of students and young scholars of humanities and social sciences, with the aim to open a new space for public discussion.  It has four issues per year, providing a platform for informed non-academic debate, mostly written from the perspective of the millennial generation.  Each issue is dedicated to a topic of broad public interest, approached in the form of longreads articulating different standpoints. These articles are usually selected from responses to an open call for papers, thus enabling the participation of emergent authors.  The magazine includes sections of contemporary debates and cultural phenomena in Europe and North America. It is renowned for its long interviews with public intellectuals, including Garry Kasparov, Timothy Snyder, Jordan Peterson, Michael Freeden, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Stuart Ewen, Padraic Kenney, Thomas Hylland Eriksen, Simona Škrabec, or Vinko Globokar.      Since 2014, Razpotja has been collaborating with young Slovenian illustrators, who contribute illustrations and visual essays relating to the main topic of the issue.  Several notable authors have contributed to Razpotja, including Julián Casanova Ruiz, Manuel Castells, Božidar Debenjak, Jordi Graupera, David Graeber, Drago Jančar,   Dean Komel, Mirt Komel, Janko Kos, Geoff Manaugh, Stephen Mulhall, Sofi Oksanen, Vinko Ošlak, Jože Pirjevec, Boris Podrecca, Peter Pomerantsev, Paul Preston, Alenka Puhar, Mykola Riabchuk, Anton Shekhovtsov, Timothy Snyder, Kirmen Uribe, and more than 200 others.  As of spring 2018, 29 issues of the magazines have been published, which include two double issues and a special edition dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the town of Nova Gorica (in 2017).
