Mirage is an international fashion and culture magazine headquartered in Paris, France. Mirage was founded independently in 2009 by Henrik Purienne and Frank Rocholl as a 400-page fashion and culture magazine inspired by the photographic aesthetic and hedonistic culture of the 1960s and 1970s.  The Magazine intends to revive and reflect upon the spirit of artists such as The Velvet Underground, The Doors and Nick Drake, architects like John Lautner, and Paolo Soleri designers Massimo Vignelli, and Marcello Gandini and fashion icons Lauren Hutton, Anita Pallenberg and Betty Catroux. The subject matter of Miragepredominantly focuses on timeless aesthetics in the fields of architectural-, automotive- and product design combined with features about forgotten utopias and influential creative personalities like Robert Evans or Peter Saville.
