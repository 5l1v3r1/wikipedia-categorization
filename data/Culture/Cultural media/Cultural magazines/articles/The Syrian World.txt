The Syrian World was a short-lived magazine devoted to the celebration and cultural diffusion of Syria,  which at the time consisted and referred to the modern day states and territories of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine. It was the first English-language magazine in the USA, which was established by a Syrian immigrant.  The magazine was headquartered in New York City.  The Syrian World was founded in 1926 by a Lebanese-American journalist and intellectual, Salloum Mokarzel.   The magazine was printed entirely in English  and was pitched to the first generation Syrians; who were born in the United States.  Salloum founded the magazine as a non-sectarian and non-partisan publication that would seek, to educate the first generation of Syrian-Americans of their illustrious and ancient cultural heritage, and to strengthen their ties to their culture. In the second year of its publication, 1927, a single issue cost 50 cents, and a yearly subscription set back the reader 5 dollars. Although very popular when it was founded, it proved difficult to keep afloat during the Great Depression, and it ceased publication in 1932.
