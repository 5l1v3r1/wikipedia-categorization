 Cuadernos para el Diálogo was a Spanish monthly cultural magazine published between 1963 and 1978 in Spain. Cuadernos was established in October 1963 by Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez, a former minister of education under Franco.    It was the first current affairs magazine of Spain.  During its initial phase Cuadernos had a Christian democratic political leaning.  However, over time it had more democratic and less Christian stance.  Then it supported center-left trends and later, it became a socialist publication.  Spanish journalists who favored pluralism in the country contributed to Cuadernos.  In the words of Paul Preston, the magazine was, together with Triunfo, one of two "champions of democratic ideals".  During the transition to democracy it was one of the major publications focusing on the need for democratic reforms.  Cuadernos ceased publication at the end of 1978.
