Anything That Moves was a literary, journalistic, and topical magazine published in the United States from 1990 to 2002.  It was created as an expansion of the San Francisco Bay Area Bisexual Network (BABN) newsletter by BABN member, Karla Rossi, in collaboration with bisexual and bi-friendly editors, writers, and artists to become a full 64-page magazine with an international subscriber base. The complete title of the magazine, Anything That Moves: Beyond the Myths of Bisexuality, was purposely chosen for its controversial nature, while its tag line indicated a clear intent to challenge stereotypes of bisexual identities and behaviors. The magazine took its name from the stereotype depicting bisexuals as willing to have sex with "anything that moves".  The magazine's mission was to confront and redefine concepts of sexuality and gender, to defy stereotypes and broad definitions of bisexuals and to combat biphobia. Most of the issues were theme-based, designed to cohesively present the vast array of diverse bisexual voices and experiences across the lines of gender, class, race, ethnicity, spirituality, lifestyle, age, politics, culture, and sexual behaviors, desires, and preferences. Special care was taken to include a wide variety of perspectives, from straight-identified to queer-identified bisexuals, while inclusion did not require the declaration of an identity or label to indicate where one fell along the spectrum of ways to be bisexual. Changes in managing editors at the helm precipitated changes in the magazineâ€™s tag line that were made to reflect the evolving, exploratory, and creative nature of its subject matter and content.
