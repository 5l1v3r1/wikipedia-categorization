 Società (meaning Society) was an Italian communist cultural magazine published between 1945 and 1961. Società was founded as a quarterly magazine in Florence in 1945.   The founders were Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli, Cesare Luporini and Romano Bilenchi.  Bandinelli also directed the magazine.  In 1948 the magazine became closely connected to the Italian Communist Party (PCI),  but not published by the party.  The headquarters was later moved to Rome  and in 1954 the frequency was switched to bimonthly.  Società featured Italian fiction and poetry and occasionally included some essays on the theater and the cinema.  It was one of the publications read by the Italian intellectuals, who had Gramscian views.  Giorgio Napolitano was one of the regular contributors of the magazine.  The magazine folded in 1961.
