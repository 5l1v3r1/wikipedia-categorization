The Jewish Review of Books is a quarterly magazine with articles on literature, culture and current affairs from a Jewish perspective. It is published in New York City. The magazine was launched in 2010 with an editorial board that includes Michael Walzer and Ruth Wisse, Shlomo Avineri and Ruth Gavison.  The editor is Abraham Socher. The magazine is funded by the Tikvah Fund, founded by Zalman Bernstein,  which also sponsored the Jewish Ideas Daily.  The initial press run was 30,000 copies.  An affiliate of the fund, Bee.Ideas, LLC, also publishes Mosaic, a magazine launched in June 2013 as the successor to the Jewish Ideas Daily.    According to The Jewish Week, the JRB is "unabashedly" modeled after the venerable New York Review of Books.  Harvey Pekar and Tara Seibel collaborated on comic strips for the first two issues of the magazine.
