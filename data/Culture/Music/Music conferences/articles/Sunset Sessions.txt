Sunset Sessions is a conference for music industry professionals, established in 1998, and features showcase performances from new musical talent and established acts with the intention of getting the executives excited about upcoming albums and artists. The event is usually held in a tropical location and takes place over several days and nights, once or twice per year.  Invited guests include radio programmers, music supervisors from film, television, ads, games and sports, artists, artists’ managers, major and independent record labels, TV bookers, press and booking agents. The conference includes daytime panels, keynote speakers and meetings for the industry to discuss current problems and solutions.   Sunset Sessions historically focused on specific types of music such as the Triple A music format and the Rock and Alternative music format beginning in 2011.  Sunset Sessions began hosting songwriters retreats for its alumni performers in Las Vegas, and a Sunset Sessions Tour which featured Duncan Sheik, Alpha Rev, Courrier and Laura Warshauer and focused on radio station markets who are guests of the conferences.  https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Duncan-Sheik-Kicks-Off-Michelle-Clarks-Sunset-Session-Tour-2012-119-20121031 Some of Sunset Sessions most notable alumni are Jack Johnson, The Zac Brown Band,  Fun., Jason Mraz and The Black Keys    The 2nd Songwriters Retreat took place in Tulum, Mexico October 26–30, 2013 at Shambala Petit Hotel.
