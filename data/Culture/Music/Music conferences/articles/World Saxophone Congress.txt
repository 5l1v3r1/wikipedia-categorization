The World Saxophone Congress is a festival gathering approximately 1000 saxophonists and other musicians from all over the world.  It is held every three years at a different congress centre in a different country and focuses primarily (although not exclusively) on the performance of classical saxophone music. The Congress presents an opportunity to meet saxophonists from many countries and to listen to various concerts and performances of saxophone soloists, chamber ensembles, big bands and symphony orchestras that run simultaneously throughout the day in different halls of the congress centre. Each of the five days is concluded by an evening concert of the orchestra and outstanding international soloists. It is also convened with the purpose of presenting the advancements of music production and distribution as well as innovations in instrument-making and equipment. The seventeenth and most recent World Saxophone Congress, known as SaxOpen, was held between July 9 and 14, 2015 in Strasbourg France.    The eighteenth World Saxophone Congress is slated to be held in 2018 in Zagreb, Croatia.
