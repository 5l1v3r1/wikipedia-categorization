The NAMM Show is an annual event in the US that its organizers describe as "the worldâ€™s largest trade-only event for the music products, pro audio and event tech industry".  It is held every January in Anaheim, California, US at the Anaheim Convention Center, and is one of the two largest music product trade shows in the world. Its European counterpart is the Musik Messe in Frankfurt. The event attracts numerous famous musicians, many of whom are endorsed by exhibitors and come to promote their own signature models and equipment. NAMM is a trade-only business show catering to domestic and international dealers and distributors. The product exhibits are an integral part of the show, allowing the dealers and distributors to see what's new, negotiate deals and plan their purchasing for the next 6 to 12 months. Exhibitors are allotted a specific number of badges based on the size of their booth. Retail Members are allowed a certain number of badges based on their full-time employees. Founded in 1901, "NAMM" stands for the National Association of Music Merchants, although, since its inception, NAMM has evolved from a national retail association into an international association whose members now include commercial companies, distributors, affiliates and manufacturers. The association's other show,  Summer NAMM, takes place in the Summer in Nashville, Tennessee, at the newly constructed Music City Center. Summer NAMM is approximately one quarter the size of the NAMM Show in January and focuses more on industry meetings and professional development than products.
