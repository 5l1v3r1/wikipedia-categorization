 Midwest Music Summit is an annual music festival held in Indianapolis, Indiana which showcases musicians from the Midwest. The festival also includes music business seminars, covering topics such as A&R, promotion, artist development and copyright issues. The festival was created in 2001 by Indianapolis natives Josh Baker, Kevin Ahern, and Jason Beatty. In its first year, the festival featured 100 bands. 2005 marked a unique year for Midwest Music Summit, as it took over Indianapolis along with NAMM summer session. The festival took place July 22–24 and featured over 250 bands. The festival was attended by over 16,000 people. The festival took place August 10–12 and featured 342 bands on 20 stages. Unlike 2005, the festival only took place in Broad Ripple venues, with no events downtown. The lineup was diverse, with rock, hip-hop, country, and indie rock bands performing. It also featured more nationally recognized acts than in previous years. 2006 Lineup Highlights: According to a statement posted on the Internet on April 12, 2007, Midwest Music Summit will not take place in 2007, but will return in 2008.  For the best interest of the MMS we are taking the 2007 year to reorganize our beloved event and therefore we have elected to produce the next Midwest Music Summit August 7–9, 2008. The MMS has grown tremendously over the past 6 years and can become very overwhelming for our staff of volunteers. We will utilize 2007 to establish relationships with new sponsors and partners as well as continue working on our 501 (c) (3) filing, and start planning for one of the most aggressive MMS events in our history. The Summit will take place August 7–9, 2008.
