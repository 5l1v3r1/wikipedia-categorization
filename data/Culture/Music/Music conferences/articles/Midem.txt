 Midem is the acronym for Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale, which is organised annually in and around the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès in Cannes, France. The trade show, which is billed as the leading international business event for the music ecosystem, has been held since 1967.  Several thousand musicians, producers, agents, managers, lawyers, executives, entrepreneurs and journalists from around the globe regularly attend the event, which is usually held at the end of January or early February. While delegates from recording, artist management, and publishers network, new artists showcase their material.  Also live music is on show in the evenings. The event is developing like the industry and is now focused on the core music business (labels, publishers, rights societies and more), the technology sector (startups, developers and big tech companies), and brands and the agencies that represent them (for music and brand campaigns). Midem provides a forum for business talks, political and legal discussions. It is a market where global distribution and music deals are sealed. It also is a platform for showcasing new artists, musical trends and music-related products. In January 2013, Midem was attended by 6,400 delegates from 3,000 companies (out of which 1,350 had stands or pavilions of their own). The event was covered by 350 international journalists. Although there are attendees from all over the world, the majority of delegates have been from Western Europe and North America. In 2015 many more international delegates registered.
