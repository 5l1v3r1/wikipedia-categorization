The Virtual Library of Musicology or VifaMusik (German: Virtuelle Fachbibliothek Musikwissenschaft) is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) to provide sources and materials for music and musicology. The project has been active since July 2005 at the Bavarian State Library, in cooperation with the State Institute for Musicological Research in Berlin and the German Musicological Society. ViFaMusik, the central portal for music and musicology, offers access to an extensive digital library containing scholarly research and online resources such as bibliographical data, entries to experts and research projects as well as current events on search topics.  The available material includes items from the inventory of the Bavarian State Library and sources and databases from other institutions. During the further development of the ViFaMusik numerous additional sources will be added to the ViFaMusik search engine and to the ViFaMusik web site.
