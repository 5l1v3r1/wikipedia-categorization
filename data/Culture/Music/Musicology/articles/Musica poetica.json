Its first known use was in the <i>Rudimenta Musicae Planae</i> (Wittenberg: 1533) of Nicolaus Listenius. Previously, music had been divided into <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Musica_theoretica&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Musica theoretica (page does not exist)\">musica theoretica</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Musica_practica&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Musica practica (page does not exist)\">musica practica</a>, which were categorised with the <a href=\"/wiki/Quadrivium\" title=\"Quadrivium\">quadrivium</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Trivium_(education)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trivium (education)\">trivium</a>, respectively. Since music of the time primarily meant vocal music, it was natural for theorists to make analogies between the composition of music and the composition of <a href=\"/wiki/Eloquence\" title=\"Eloquence\">oratory</a> or poetry. Hence, the term <i>musica poetica</i>.\n</p><p>Analogies between music and the rhetorical arts were made on several levels. <a href=\"/wiki/Gallus_Dressler\" title=\"Gallus Dressler\">Gallus Dressler</a> (1563) suggested to liken the structure of a musical composition with that of a speech, as outlined in <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_antiquity\" title=\"Classical antiquity\">Classical</a> sources, dividing it into such sections as <a href=\"/wiki/Exordium_(rhetoric)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Exordium (rhetoric)\">exordium</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Medium_(rhetoric)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Medium (rhetoric) (page does not exist)\">medium</a> and finis (literally, \"beginning\", \"middle\" and \"end\"). Another kind of analogy was to liken the rules or <a href=\"/wiki/Grammar\" title=\"Grammar\">grammar</a> of composition with those of speech, as illustrated by <a href=\"/wiki/Joachim_Burmeister\" title=\"Joachim Burmeister\">Joachim Burmeister</a>'s use of <i>tauto\u00ebpia</i> to  label consecutive fifths and octaves (which were generally regarded as illegal except in special circumstances). \n</p><p>Most significantly, though, special melodic, harmonic, or technical devices in music began to be associated with the figures of <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_antiquity\" title=\"Classical antiquity\">Classical</a> oratory: for example, a rising or falling <a href=\"/wiki/Sequence\" title=\"Sequence\">sequence</a> in music was usually called climax in the literature of <i>musica poetica</i>. However, it must be pointed out that such analogies were not always direct: terms used in <i>musica poetica</i> do not always correspond equivalently to their rhetorical counterparts (for example, in oratory, <i>anaphora</i> means a straightforward repetition of a word, but in music it can denote various kinds of repetitive device, such as the development of a subject through imitation (<a href=\"/wiki/Fugue\" title=\"Fugue\">fugue</a>); also, the presence of a rhetorical figure in the text being set to music did not imply an automatic application of that figure's musical equivalent (that is, it was never mandatory for composers to respond to such verbal ideas as \"going up\" with rising musical phrases (known as <i>anabasis</i> or <i>ascensus</i> in <i>musica poetica</i>). \n</p><p>A knowledge of both Classical rhetoric and <i>musica poetica</i> can greatly enhance the listener's understanding and appreciation of works composed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially by such figures as <a href=\"/wiki/Heinrich_Sch%C3%BCtz\" title=\"Heinrich Sch\u00fctz\">Heinrich Sch\u00fctz</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Giacomo_Carissimi\" title=\"Giacomo Carissimi\">Giacomo Carissimi</a>. However, it is also important not to seek examples of musical figures on every page; while rhetoric and musical theory were strongly associated, the nature of this association was complex and variable.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Musica_poetica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Jones, T.D.: \"Passions in Perspective: An Analytical Discussion of the Three Passion Settings of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz (1585-1672) against their Historical and Stylistic Backgrounds\", (Ph.D. thesis, University of Birmingham, UK, 2000).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Musica_poetica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2169\nCached time: 20180919031225\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.031 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 29/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 244/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.006/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 646 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   20.511      1 Template:Other_uses\n100.00%   20.511      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:2218848-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919031225 and revision id 542551106\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"de","url":"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_Poetica","langname":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","*":"Musica Poetica"},{"lang":"no","url":"https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_poetica","langname":"Norwegian","autonym":"norsk","*":"Musica poetica"},{"lang":"ru","url":"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0","langname":"Russian","autonym":"\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439","*":"\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Musica Poetica","*":"Renaissance_music"},{"sortkey":"Musica Poetica","*":"Musicology"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Classical antiquity"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Eloquence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Exordium (rhetoric)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Fugue"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gallus Dressler"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Giacomo Carissimi"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Grammar"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Heinrich Sch\u00fctz"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Joachim Burmeister"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Musica poetica (disambiguation)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Quadrivium"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sequence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Trivium (education)"},{"ns":0,"*":"Musica theoretica"},{"ns":0,"*":"Musica practica"},{"ns":0,"*":"Medium (rhetoric)"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Other uses"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Other uses"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote list"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:TableTools"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Sources","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Musica_poetica","byteoffset":2849,"anchor":"Sources"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Musica_poetica","byteoffset":3093,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Musica poetica","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Musica Poetica"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q931615"}]}}
