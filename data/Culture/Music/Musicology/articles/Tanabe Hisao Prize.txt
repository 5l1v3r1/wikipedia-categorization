The Tanabe Hisao Prize (Japanese: 田辺尚雄音楽賞 or 田辺尚雄賞) (often known more simply as the "Tanabe Prize") was created in 1983 by the Tōyō Ongaku Gakkai (Japanese: 東洋音楽学会, "Society for Research in Asiatic Music"), the oldest musicological society of Japan (headquartered in Tokyo).  The prize is named after the musicologist Tanabe Hisao (Japanese: 田辺尚雄,1883–1984), one of the founding members of the society.  The prize is awarded annually to one or several individuals or groups who have published an outstanding work of Asian musicology  during the previous year, one that "promotes further research in Asian musicology and contributes to Japanese scholarship."  It is generally considered the most prestigious award in the field of Asian musicology awarded in Japan.
