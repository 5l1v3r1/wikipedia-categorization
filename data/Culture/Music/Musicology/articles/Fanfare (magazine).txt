Fanfare is an American bimonthly magazine devoted to reviewing recorded music in all playback formats. It mainly covers classical music, but since inception, has also featured a jazz column in every issue. Fanfare was founded on 1 September 1977 "as a labor of love"  by an elementary-school teacher turned editor named Joel Bruce Flegler (born 1941).  After 41 years, he is still the publisher.   The magazine now runs to over 600 pages in a 6" x 9" format with about 80% of the editorial copy devoted to record reviews, and a front section with a substantial number of interviews and feature articles.  It avoids equipment and pop music coverage and manages to include reviews of many more classical releases than is typical for other magazines in this genre.   Subscriptions include online access to current content and archives of past issues.  Fanfare's editorial contributors have a range of expertise from the medieval to contemporary work.  Describing itself as "the magazine for serious record collectors", its reviews cover not only the quality of live performance, but also that of sound and recording.
