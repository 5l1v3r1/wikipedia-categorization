The Banjo, Mandolin and Guitar (BMG) movement is a music genre based on the family of stringed instruments played with a plectrum, including the banjo, mandolin and guitar.  This became popular in the USA in the late 19th century and into the 20th century.   It fell from favour in the 1930s but there is still an organised movement in the UK where the BMG Magazine, founded in 1903, is the country's oldest music periodical still publishing. In the United States, a major magazine for the movement was The Cadenza magazine, published by Clarence L. Partee.
