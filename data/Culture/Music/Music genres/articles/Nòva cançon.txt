Nòva cançon (Occitan pronunciation: [ˈnɔβɔ kanˈsu, -ɔvɔ], also spelled Nòva chançon [ˈnɔvɔ tʃanˈsu], "New Song") is a musical renewal wave that swept through Occitania in the 1970s. Its leaders were Joan Pau Verdier, Claudi Martí, Patric, Maria Roanet and Mans de Breish, most of whom are still very active singers. Nòva cançon was a phenomenon similar to Catalonia's Nova cançó.
