Transposing instruments are most commonly found in C, E-flat, F, G, A, and B-flat. Instruments in D-flat, D, E, A-flat, and B do or did exist but are uncommon or obsolete. Instruments in G-flat/F-sharp are completely lacking (leaving aside French horns with crooks which come in any key). The instruments that are available nowadays in the greatest number of keys (again leaving aside historical French horns with crooks) are trumpets and clarinets. In order to give complete descriptions of families of transposing instruments this page also includes a section listing their non-transposing members. Authorities disagree on whether instruments in this category are properly called "transposing", but they are included here for completeness. Note: This section is only for non-transposing members of families of transposing instruments.
