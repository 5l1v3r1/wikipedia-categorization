 This page is a list of cities and venues that have hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, one or more times. Future venues are shown in italics. The first edition took place in 2003 in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Following the hosting problems for the 2004 edition, the location of the subsequent contests were appointed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), following a bidding process with broadcasters from the participating countries. Belgium was therefore the first country to successfully bid for the rights to host the contest in 2005.  Originally, unlike its adult version, the winning country did not receive the rights to host the next contest. However for the contests from 2014 to 2017, the winning country had first refusal on hosting the next competition. Italy used this clause in 2015 to decline hosting the contest that year after their victory in 2014.  On 15 October 2017, the EBU announced a return to the original system in 2018, claiming that it would help provide broadcasters with a greater amount of time to prepare, ensuring the continuation of the contest into the future.   11 countries have hosted the competition, of which 3 have hosted the contest twice: the Netherlands (2007 and 2012), Ukraine (2009 and 2013) and Malta (2014 and 2016). Georgia hosted for the first time in 2017. The next contest in 2018 will be held in Minsk, Belarus for the second time after 2010. The biggest venue to ever host the competition was the Ethias Arena in Hasselt in 2005 followed by the arenas which hosted the 2007, 2010, 2015 contests in Rotterdam, Minsk and Sofia respectively. Forum Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark hosted the 2003 Contest. Ahoy in Rotterdam, Netherlands hosted the 2007 Contest. Minsk Arena in Minsk, Belarus hosted the 2010 Contest and will host the 2018 Contest. Karen Demirchyan Sports and Concerts Complex in Yerevan, Armenia hosted the 2011 Contest. Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands hosted the 2012 Contest. Arena Armeec in Sofia, Bulgaria hosted the 2015 Contest.
