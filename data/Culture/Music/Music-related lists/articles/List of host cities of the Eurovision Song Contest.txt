This page is a list of cities and venues that have hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, one or more times. Future venues are shown in italics. Since 1958, the host city has customarily been in the winner country of the previous year. There have been exceptions, however, when certain issues have prevented the winner from hosting the following year's contest. Hosting then passed to the country that had come second, or to another country that agreed to host. Such events occurred in 1960, 1963, 1972, 1974 and 1980.  With 6 contests, Dublin is the city that has hosted the most frequently. It is followed by London and Luxembourg (4 contests each), and Copenhagen  and Stockholm (3 contests each). Host City Insignia is a rotating trophy awarded to cities hosting the Eurovision Song Contest. The symbol is a large key ring to which the Eurovision Song Contest Host Cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city. Additionally, there is a fob with a picture of the Helsinki Senate Square attached to the key ring. The idea of the rotating trophy was proposed jointly by the City of Helsinki, the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE and EBU in connection with the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: "Eurovision Song Contest Host City", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers. The concept and fob were designed by the ANTEEKSI Team and the ring by jewellery designer Taru Tonder.
