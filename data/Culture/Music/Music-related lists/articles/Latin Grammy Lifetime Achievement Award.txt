The Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award is an honor presented annually by the Latin Recording Academy, the same organization that distributes the Latin Grammy Awards, to commend performers "who have made unprecedented contributions of outstanding artistic significance to Latin music and the Latin community".  Award recipients are honored during "Latin Grammy Week", a string of galas just prior to the annual Latin Grammy Awards ceremony.  Since its inception, the award has been presented to musicians originating from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Spain, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The awards were first presented to Mercedes Sosa, José José, Roberto Carlos, Willie Colón, and Antonio Aguilar in 2004.  José and Carlos were later honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year award in 2005 and 2015.   Mexican singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero and American singer Linda Ronstadt  have also been recipients of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014 and 2016 respectively.   Colombian musician Joe Arroyo is the only recipient to have posthumously receive the Latin Grammy Lifetime Award in 2011 following his death four months earlier.  Upon receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014, Carlos do Carmo became the first artist from Portugal to win a Latin Grammy Award.  ^[I]  Each year is linked to an article about the Latin Grammy Awards ceremony of that year. ^[II]  The artists occupation(s) are listed on the Special Awards page on the Latin Grammy Award website.
