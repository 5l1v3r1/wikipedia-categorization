 Marzuki was an indie folk rock band from Holland, MI, with a significant fan base in western Michigan in the mid to late 1990s. They were especially popular among Hope College, Calvin College, and Grand Valley State University students. Marzuki's members included Shannon Stephens on vocals and guitar, Jamie Kempkers on cello, Matthew Haseltine (brother of Jars of Clay's Dan Haseltine) on guitar and bass, and Sufjan Stevens on guitar, percussion, and the more exotic instruments (especially the recorder). Their lyrics often explored spiritual or romantic themes. Marzuki was named after Sufjan Stevens' brother, Marzuki Stevens, a professional long-distance and marathon runner.
