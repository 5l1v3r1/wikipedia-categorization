A Pe침a is a meeting place or grouping of musicians or artists, either in Spain (where it is known as Pe침a Flamenca) or in various South American countries.  In Chile in particular, the term came to mean a cheap, popular venue where folk music was played and simple food and drink were available, usually in the form of Nueva Canci칩n, the kind of music popularised by musicians such as Violeta Parra and Victor Jara in the 1960s and early 1970s   Because of its association with the Unidad Popular Government of Salvador Allende, the concept of a Pe침a is often associated with social justice and grassroots culture.
