Small Drum Corps Association (SDCA), was founded in 2007 to develop venues for smaller drum and bugle corps to perform and compete.  SDCA provides venues for smaller drum corps to perform and potentially compete. The association welcomes concert and parade-only corps, as well as active members of Drum Corps International or Drum Corps Associates. Membership is open, meaning any group that performs at a hosted event is considered a member of the association. Drum lines, color guards and marching bands are not excluded.  Sanctioned events are often hosted in conjunction with community events, such as parades and festivals.  Emphasis is placed on audience engagement and entertainment. Scoring, if available, features spectator input. Like DCI and other associations, SDCA pays appearance fees to participating groups.
