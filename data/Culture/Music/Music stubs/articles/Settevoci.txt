Settevoci was an Italian musical variety show broadcast by Rai 1 (at the time called "Programma Nazionale") from 1966 to 1970, hosted by Pippo Baudo and aired on Sunday afternoon.  The program was a large success, and contributed to launch the careers of many artists, including Albano Carrisi, Massimo Ranieri, Nicola Di Bari and Orietta Berti.  It also marked the first personal success for the presenter Baudo.  The show consisted of a contest with singers combined in couples, and included a quiz to test their knowledge in the music field. The final results were eventually determined through a clap-o-meter.
