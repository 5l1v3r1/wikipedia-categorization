Welcome to the Blackout (Live London '78) is a live album by David Bowie recorded on the Isolar II Tour. It had a limited vinyl release on 21 April 2018 for Record Store Day.    A more widely available CD edition followed on 29 June 2018, along with digital releases for download and streaming.  The album was recorded live by the RCA mobile unit during the Isolar II tour at Earls Court, London on 30 June and 1 July 1978 by Tony Visconti, and was mixed by Bowie and David Richards at Mountain Studios, Montreux, from 17-22 January 1979.  The performance of "Sound and Vision" on 1 July 1978, the live premiere of the song, was previously released on the 1995 compilation album, RarestOneBowie, as was the included version of "Be My Wife". Originally shot as a concert film, Bowie would later abandon the idea due to being dissatisfied with the final result.  Side 1 Side 2 Side 3 Side 4 Side 5 Side 6 Live performance personnel
