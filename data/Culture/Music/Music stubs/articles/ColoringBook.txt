ColoringBook is a three-part series of recordings by composer Clayton Counts.  Incorporating elements of drone, minimalism, and found sound, the records feature an array of instrumentalists, with a heavy focus on stringed and keyed instruments. The project is regarded as a work of noise music, though some of it is structurally similar to jazz, contemporary classical, or electroacoustic music.  It is known for its use of synthesis, layering, and spatialization.
