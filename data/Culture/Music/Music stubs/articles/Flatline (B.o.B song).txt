"Flatline" is a song by American rapper B.o.B, initially released on SoundCloud in January 2016. "Flatline" is a diss song aimed at physicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson, whom he had gotten into an argument with on Twitter, over B.o.B's stated belief that the earth is flat. In addition to dissing Tyson and expressing belief in a flat earth, the song's lyrics also include other conspiracy theories, including Holocaust denial, "mirror lizards", and the belief that Freemasons are indoctrinating young people. The lyrics to the song refer to science as a cult.     Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, issued a statement saying that B.o.B.'s "lyrics are irresponsible and could potentially promote anti-Semitic beliefs, especially in those people who might already be infected by such notions."  "Following criticism, B.o.B removed the song from his SoundCloud account, but it survives on YouTube and other sites where it was reposted.  In April 2016, B.o.B included the song on a mixtape titled E.A.R.T.H. (Educational Avatar Reality Training Habitat), but the song lyrics had been rewritten as titled as pt. 2.
