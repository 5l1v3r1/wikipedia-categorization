The Church Choral Society was founded in 1872 by The Rev'd. Henry George Bonavia Hunt and played a major role in the musical side of the Oxford Movement. The Church Music Society however, acquired the name of The College of Church Music, London in 1873 and a system of examinations followed. By 1876 it was incorporated under the name of the Trinity College of Music, which is now a large conservatory of music based in Greenwich in London.
