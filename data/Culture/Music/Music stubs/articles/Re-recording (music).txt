A re-recording is a recording produced following a new performance of a work of music. This is most commonly, but not exclusively, by a popular artist or group. It differs from a reissue, which involves a second or subsequent release of a previously-recorded piece of music. Re-recordings are often produced decades after the original recordings were released, usually under contract terms more favorable to the artists. This is especially common among acts that originally agreed to contracts that would be considered unfair and exploitative today.  When re-recordings are issued under newer contracts, artists can collect far higher royalties for use in films, commercials, and movie trailers.  Other acts re-record their work for artistic reasons. Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra released a solo best-of album with new versions of previous hits like "Mr. Blue Sky", the original of which Lynne described as "[not] quite how I meant it".  Re-recordings commonly appear in online music stores and streaming services, such as the iTunes Store and Spotify;  the original recording may or may not be available.
