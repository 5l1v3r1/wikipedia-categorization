The Northern Illinois Bluegrass Association (NIBA) is a non-profit organization which promotes and preserves bluegrass music in the northern Illinois area. The NIBA was originally formed in 1996 as a group of musicians who met weekly to play bluegrass in a barn in Grand Ridge, Illinois.  Over time it has developed into a community of musicians and listeners from Illinois, southern Wisconsin, northwestern Indiana, and eastern Iowa who share a common love of bluegrass music.  The NIBA organizes and promotes local bluegrass jams and events   and participates in the Bluegrass In The Schools program. The NIBA publishes a newsletter for its members with upcoming event announcements and other bluegrass-related news items.
