Music acquisition is a theory or a term that has not yet been clearly or concisely defined, although there has been research done and attempts to prove that acquiring music, like language, is cognitively possible over time. Furthermore, the process of actually and gradually acquiring music has been carefully looked at yet not with enough information or cases to form a concrete definition or states with confidence that music acquisition is impossible or definitely possible. This theory itself is influenced by the concept and studies done on Language acquisition which is defined as the processes in which people acquire over time the cognitive ability to perceive and comprehend any language, but also, use and produce language as one form of expression. Some research conveys that the definition or attributes used for expression through language can also be used for expression through music or musical instruments.
