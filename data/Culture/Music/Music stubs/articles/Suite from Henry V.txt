Suite from Henry V is a 1963 orchestral arrangement of William Walton's musical score from the 1944 film Henry V. The suite, arranged by Muir Mathieson, is in five movements, although the second and fourth movements had already appeared in string arrangement form in Walton's own Two Pieces for Strings from Henry V.  The suite was first performed at a recording session for EMI on 15 October 1963 by the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by the composer.  In addition to this suite, EMI had in 1946 recorded another LP called "Henry V: Scenes from the film" in which Laurence Olivier spoke lines of Shakespeare's play over an orchestral and choral underscore derived from the film soundtrack.
