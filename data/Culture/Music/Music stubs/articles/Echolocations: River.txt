Echolocations: River is the eleventh solo studio album by American songwriter and musician Andrew Bird. It is the second album in his Echolocations series, the first one being "Echolocations: Canyon."  The album makes prominent use of field recording, with Bird performing in the Los Angeles River under the Hyperion Bridge. Additional studio recordings were added to supplement the field recordings and flesh out the compositions. "Gypsy Moth" is a different rendition of Bird's 2016 composition "Roma Fade."
