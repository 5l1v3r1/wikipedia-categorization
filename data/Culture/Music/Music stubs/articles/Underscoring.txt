In a musical theater or film production, underscoring is the playing of music quietly under spoken dialogue or a visual scene . It is usually done to establish a mood or theme, frequently used to recall and/or foreshadow a musical theme important to the character(s) and/or plot point, onstage or onscreen.  In a play, sometimes incidental music is used for this purpose.
