Cascading strings (also sometimes known as "tumbling strings") is an arrangement technique of British light music. This technique is associated in the U.S. with the style of easy listening known as beautiful music. The cascading strings effect was first developed by British composer/arranger Ronald Binge, but most associated with Annunzio Paolo Mantovani and his Mantovani Orchestra.  U.S. Record producers Hugo and Luigi also did a series of recordings under the name "Cascading Voices" and later "Cascading Strings." One effect of the cascading strings technique is to emulate the acoustic properties of a large hall such as a cathedral, through simulated reverberation. The effect is achieved in an orchestra using multiple string sections, which would play slightly different parts from one another, in a cascading effect, thus creating the  illusion of reverberation of the original sound.
