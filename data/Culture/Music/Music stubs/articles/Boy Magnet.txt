 "Boy Magnet" is the second international single by Indonesian singer Agnez Mo.  It was released by The Cherry Party on 13 November 2015, with five remixes of the song being available for download.  The song was remixed by Hector Fonseca, John Dish, Tommy Love and Xavi Alfaro, while the original version is expected to appear on her upcoming debut international album.  In Indonesia, "Boy Magnet" remixes were only commercially released on iTunes Store and charted at number three on its chart.  Like the previous single, "Boy Magnet" failed to make impact on any Billboard charts in the United States.  Due to underwhelming response of the single, Agnez Mo's full-length international debut album—previously announced to be released in Spring 2016—was postponed.  She eventually dropped out of The Cherry Party, and released her debut international album, X, in 2017.
