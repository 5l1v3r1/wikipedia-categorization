Electronic Squelch is a type of electronic beat originating from Chicago in the 1980s and describable as a combination of "squeak" and "oonts", similar to the sound made by disproportionately amplifying the start/"attack" and/or attenuating the "hold" and "release" of the sound made by forcefully pushing a flexible object (such as a finger or cleaning cloth) across and against a smooth inflexible surface (such as glass). This type of sound occurs often in rave, trance, techno, and especially house music.
