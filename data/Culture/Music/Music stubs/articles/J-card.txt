A j-card is the paper card inserted in the plastic storage case of most pre-recorded audio cassette releases, as well as cassettes of bootleg or copied concerts of the jam band scene.  The j-card usually contains an image of the album cover, a track listing, credits, and copyright information. The j-card gets its name from being folded into the shape of the letter J (when viewed from the side) to fit inside the cassette's case. Today, custom made CD-R covers are often called J-cards. J-card-style covers were used in CD covers in the 1990s for single cases and are still used today.
