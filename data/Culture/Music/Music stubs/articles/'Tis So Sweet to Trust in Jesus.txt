Refrain Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more!  O how sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to trust His cleansing blood; Just in simple faith to plunge me ’Neath the healing, cleansing flood!  Refrain  Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus, Just from sin and self to cease; Just from Jesus simply taking Life and rest, and joy and peace.  Refrain  I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee, Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend; And I know that Thou art with me, Wilt be with me to the end.  Refrain
