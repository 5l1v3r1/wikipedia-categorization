WhoSampled is a website and app database of information about sampled music or sample-based music, cover songs and remixes. Nadav Poraz founded the site in London, England, in 2008, as a way to track musical samples and cover songs.  Mobile apps were released in 2012 and 2014 for iPhone and Android, respectively.   The website's database is user-generated and reviewed by moderators before the content goes live.  As of 2016, the site's most sampled track is the Amen break from The Winstons.   In 2015, the site added support for film and television clips.   The following year, it partnered with Spotify  and introduced a six degrees of separation-inspired game that tracks relationships between artists, producers, and their tracks.  In October 2017, WhoSampled partnered with KPM and Ableton and organised third 'Samplethon' competition at Point Blank Studios in London.
