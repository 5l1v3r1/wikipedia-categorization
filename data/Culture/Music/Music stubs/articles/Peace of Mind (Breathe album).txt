Peace of Mind is the second and final studio album by English pop rock band Breathe. The album was released in August 1990 by A&M and Virgin Records. Two years after the band burst onto the American scene with the hits "Hands to Heaven" and "How Can I Fall" from All That Jazz (1988), the album brought the group back to the charts with two more singles. Reviews were mixed, praising lead singer David Glasper's strong, soulful voice , while some dismissed the album itself as a bit too seamless and proper.  Peace of Mind peaked at #116 on the US Billboard 200, while the singles "Say a Prayer" and "Does She Love That Man?" both reached their highest peaks in the US Adult Contemporary charts at #3 and #17, respectively.    "Where Angels Fear" would later be covered by American Contemporary Christian artist Clay Crosse under the title "Where Angels Dare".
