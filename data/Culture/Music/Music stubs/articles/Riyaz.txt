Riyaz (also Riyaaz) is an Urdu language term used for music practice, for honing of Hindustani classical music vocal as well as instrument skills.   It is known as Sadhakam or Sadhana in Carnatic music.   It is followed rigorously by the students as well as exponents of vocal as well as dancing forms.  The Riyaaz or Sadhakam, which often starts early in the morning at four,  is taken seriously by the students for it requires intensity, discipline and commitment for years and forms an important component in the Guru - Shishya parampara (teacher-student tradition).    In Carnatic music, the impression is that the assiduous sadhakam of the Trinity of Carnatic Music was the bedrock of the excellence of the old-world vidwans.
