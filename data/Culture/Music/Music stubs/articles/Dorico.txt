  Dorico(/ˈdɒrɪkoʊ/) is a scorewriter developed and released by Steinberg for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Released on 19 October 2016,  it was created largely by former developers of the competing product Sibelius,     who were hired by Steinberg following the closure of Avid's London office in July 2012.  The project was first unveiled on the Making Notes blog by Daniel Spreadbury, on 20 February 2013. The program's title Dorico was revealed on the same blog on 17 May 2016.  The name honours the 16th-century Italian music engraver Valerio Dorico (1500–c.1565), who printed first editions of sacred music by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Giovanni Animuccia  and pioneered the use of a single impression printing process first developed in England and France.  The integrated built-in tutorial can be helpful to reduce the learning curve of this software for some people.
