In music, a tape phase is a recorded composition using a tape loop or its electronic simulation to produce and vary sounds.  It is a form of tape music.  Tape phase compositions generally make little use of tonality owing to the difficulty of producing and maintaining a coherent pitch.  They may have a strong pulse and rhythm, as in the work of Steve Reich, or may be free form in this regard, as in the work of Jimi Hendrix.
