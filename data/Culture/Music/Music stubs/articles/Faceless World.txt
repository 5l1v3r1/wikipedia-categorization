Faceless World is the third studio album by German heavy metal band U.D.O., released on February 25, 1990, by RCA Records. It was recorded in Dierks Studios in Cologne and mastered in Hamburg. The album's musical style features a more light approach than previous and future albums, and achieved great success. Previous guitarist Andy Susemihl had left the band, but takes writing credits for "System of Life", "Living on a Frontline" and "Future Land". Guitarist Wolla BÃ¶hm was added, but is only credited and pictured in the album as a member, although he does perform with the band in the "Heart of Gold" music video. All guitar work was done by Mathias Dieth.  All lyrics written by Udo Dirkschneider and Stefan Kaufmann; all music composed by Dirkschneider, Kaufmann and Mathias Dieth except where noted.
