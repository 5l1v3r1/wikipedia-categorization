The Liverpool Wall of Fame on Mathew Street, Liverpool, England, in front of the Cavern Club is a litany of, and a tribute to, the groups which played at the original Cavern Club, including acts from the city which have reached number one in the UK Singles Chart. The wall also features a disc for every Liverpool musical act that had a number one hit.  It was unveiled on 14 March 2001 by Lita Roza, whose song "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?" was the first Liverpool based act's song to reach number one in the UK. It features 54 Liverpool number 1 UK chart hits since 1952, and also incorporates an award winning[which?] musical themed seat. The wall is dominated by The Beatles, who have 17 discs thereon.
