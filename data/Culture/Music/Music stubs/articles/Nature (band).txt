Nature (Hangul: 네이처; Stylized as NATURE) is a South Korean girl group formed by N.CH Entertainment in Seoul, South Korea.  The group debuted on August 3, 2018, with the single album Girls And Flowers with the title track "Allegro Cantabile".  On August 3, the same day as the group's debut single's release, the title track, "Allegro Cantabile" had its music video released as well.    The music video features the current 8 members, as well as former member Yeolmae, who departed from the group quietly before debut. The songs were re-recorded to only feature the current 8 members, and the music video was re-structured to only include close-ups of the current members, and Yeolmae is only present in the choreographic segments. The Title track "Allegro Cantabile" is a remake of the opening to Nodame Cantabile, a popular anime, which was previously recorded by Suemitsu & the Suemith.  The group has performed the song through busking performances, as well as on various music shows, including MBC TV, Music Bank, Inkigayo, Arirang TV, and Mnet, where they have performed the song frequently since August 4, with a final performance not scheduled as of now.  On August 24, three weeks after the music video's original release, the group released a Dance Practice Version of "Allegro Cantabile".  Nature won their first award, "New Artist of the Year", on August 30, at Soribada Best K-Music Awards.   On September 3, a month after its release, the group announced on their official Facebook page that the "Allegro Cantabile" Music Video had reached over 2 million views on Youtube.  On August 29, the group began a special project called "Pop Cover Project", where the girls vocally cover a popular pop song and perform a dance sequence. The first song to be covered was Walk Like An Egyptian by The Bangles.
