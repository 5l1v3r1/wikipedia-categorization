Romanian Christmas Carols, Sz, 57, BB 67 (Hungarian: Román kolindadallamok) is a set of little colinde, typical Christmas songs from Romanian villages, habitually sung by small groups of children, adapted in 1915 by Hungarian composer Béla Bartók to be played on the piano after hearing them sung in the below villages. This work consists of twenty little songs put together into two major series.

Bartók also wrote a concert version with slight variations to the original version. These changes consist mostly of denser chords and octaves. Notable recordings of this composition include:
