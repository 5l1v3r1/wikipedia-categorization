The music of Nauru demonstrates its Micronesian heritage. Its music has been scantly recorded and documented, partially as a result of a ban on traditional dance by German colonial authorities after the 1888 annexation by Germany. The national anthem of Nauru is "Nauru Bwiema" ("Song of Nauru").  Margaret Hendrie wrote the words; Laurence Henry Hicks composed the music. Nauru adopted the anthem in 1968. Baron Waqa, who has also served as a government minister, has been noted for his musical composition activity.
