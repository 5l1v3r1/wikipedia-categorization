Twin Fantasy, later re-titled Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror), is the sixth solo album by American indie rock musician Will Toledo, under the Car Seat Headrest alias.  Since its release in 2011, the album has amassed an online cult following,   with the internet forums 4chan and Reddit playing major roles in the album's success.  A re-recording of the album was released via Matador Records on February 16, 2018.  Toledo began working on Twin Fantasy shortly after transferring to the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Toledo specified in an interview with Uproxx, that it was the first Car Seat Headrest project to be conceived of, and written as a full album, rather than a collection of songs.  The album features a prominent use of lo-fi production, as it was largely recorded with a cheap laptop microphone. Audio effects were also used to enhance this aesthetic. All instruments on the album are performed by Toledo, as he did not have a band at the time of recording. The album was released on November 2, 2011,  via Bandcamp. The album was downloaded by around 100 people upon its initial release.  Lyrically, the album deals with themes of depression, mental illness, love, and homosexuality. Toledo stated via Tumblr that Twin Fantasy is a concept album which explores a relationship he was in at the time.  "Beach Life-In-Death" is the longest song on the album, clocking in at 12 minutes and 11 seconds. The song changes styles multiple times throughout, with the lyric sheet separating the song into three parts. In an interview with Peyton Thomas, Toledo noted that his main sources of influence for the album were Pink Floyd, Of Montreal, Destroyer, and They Might Be Giants, along with various romantic poets he has been studying at the time.   The chorus from They Might Be Giants song "Ana Ng" was interpolated into "Cute Thing" with some minor changes. All tracks written and performed by Will Toledo.
