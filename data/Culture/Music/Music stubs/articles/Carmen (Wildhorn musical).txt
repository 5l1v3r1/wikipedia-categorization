Carmen is a musical with a book by Norman Allen, lyrics by regular collaborator Jack Murphy, and music by Frank Wildhorn. It is based on the novella of the same name. It premiered in Prague in October 2008 at the Karlín Musical Theater.  Carmen, inspired by the Mérimée classic, contains the essence but explores the iconic story in a new way, this time against the backdrop of an extravagant circus.     In May 2017, Dimitri Rassam and Helen Estabrook will produce Benjamin Millepieds film adaptation of the musical.
