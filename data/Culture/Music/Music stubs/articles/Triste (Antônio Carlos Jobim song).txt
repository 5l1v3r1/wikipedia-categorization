"Triste" (meaning "Sad" in English) is a bossa nova song composed in 1966 by Antônio Carlos Jobim, who also wrote lyrics for it in both English and Portuguese. Jobim wrote the song in late 1966 while staying at the Sunset Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles, as he waited for Frank Sinatra to return from a holiday in Barbados so they could begin recording their album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim (1967).  The first recording of the song was an instrumental version by Jobim for his 1967 album Wave. Sinatra recorded it with Jobim two years later on the sessions for their planned second album, SinatraJobim, which was ultimately released as Side A of Sinatra & Company (1971). Jobim recorded an English-language vocal version in 1980 on the album Terra Brasilis.
