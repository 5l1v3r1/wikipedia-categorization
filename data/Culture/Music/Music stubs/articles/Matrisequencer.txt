The Matrisequencer is an electronic device that controls or plays  other devices for example, synthesizers, drum machines, so that they can all play at the same time and be in sync with each other. It was succeeded by the Geiss Digisequencer.  It was designed and built by Michel Geiss for Jean-Michel Jarre for the album Ã‰quinoxe. . The device has also been used on the album Rendez-Vous  and also Revolutions. He designed the device with the musician in mind for ease of use as opposed to other sequencers that were around at the time.
