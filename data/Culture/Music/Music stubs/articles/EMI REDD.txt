The EMI REDD .17, .37 and .51 were vacuum tube based mixing consoles designed by EMI for their Abbey Road Studios.  They were used to mix several influential albums, including most of the Beatles' albums and the first two Pink Floyd albums.  In 2013, Waves Audio released a plug-in that emulates the REDD .17, .37 and .51.
