The Music Technology Group (MTG) is a research group of the Department of Information and Communication Technologies of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. It was founded in 1994 by its current director, Xavier Serra, and it specializes in sound and music computing research. The research of the MTG is quite close to the core of the Sound and Music Computing interdisciplinariety; combining strengths in basic disciplines, such as Signal Processing, Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction while being able to apply other disciplines/technologies in order to approach music related application-driven problems. Current active topics include: The MTG is very active in educational activities within the UPF and in collaboration with the ESMUC. Here is a list of the main academic degrees in which the researchers of the MTG are involved with Apart from the standard academic results in the form of academic publications and teaching, one of the major aims of the MTG is to promote technology transfer. To that aim the MTG collaborates with companies like Yamaha or Microsoft Research to develop new technologies, it promotes artistic productions through the Phonos Project, it has created three spin-off companies to commercialize some of the developed technologies, BMAT, Reactable Systems, and Voctro Labs and it has developed and maintains technologies that are available online for anyone, like Freesound. Some of the developed technologies have had a big impact, like Vocaloid, Reactable or Freesound. Of the current research project being carried out at the MTG it is worth mentioning:
