Purple Songs Can Fly is a non-profit organization that sponsors a music program at the Texas Children's Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.  It allows patients at the hospital to compose and record songs in a real studio.  The program was founded in March 2006 by Anita Kruse,  a songwriter and pianist.   The Love Street Light Circus donated $10,000 to build a studio at the hospital.  By January 2009, patients have recorded over 116 songs.  According to David Poplack, "the arts have therapeutic value" and can improve the recovery of the patients.  In 2007, seven songs created through Purple Songs Can Fly were burned on purple CDs  and were then played on Continental Airlines flights.
