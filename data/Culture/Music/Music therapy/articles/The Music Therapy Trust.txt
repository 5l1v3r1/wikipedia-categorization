  The Music Therapy Trust is a registered charity in India founded by Margaret Lobo, who is the Founder and Director of the Otakar Kraus Music Trust, UK. The trust is concerned with providing music therapy to children and adults facing difficult psycho social and physical challenges especially those from poorer section of the society. The trust is also going to establish a professional body for recognising qualified Indian music therapists named Indian Association of Professional Clinical Music Therapists (IAPCMT). The organisation operates its administrative headquarters in India at New Delhi and in Kathmandu in Nepal. The idea of The Music Therapy Trust was conceived by its founder Dr. Margaret Lobo, herself a musical talent during her visit to India to give talks on music therapy in New Delhi and Mumbai. The Music Therapy Trust was established in 2005 as a registered Indian society and became the first to introduce clinical music therapy network in India.   TMTT launched an academy in New Delhi to train Indian musicians by offering a year-long post-graduate diploma in clinical music therapy. The course is located in the Action For Autism's National Centre for Autism in Jasola Vihar in the capital, and takes a new batch of students to train every year. It was launched by famous cricketer Brett Lee, whose foundation MEWSIC is a partner in the programme.
