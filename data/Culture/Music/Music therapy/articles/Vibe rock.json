Vibe rock has been identified as a response to the often \"disempowering story telling and violent messages\" that is prevalent in today's modern popular music. \n</p><p>Vibe Rock is a musical movement that holds the belief that we can all get along, communicate, respect and harmonize with one another. A movement that allows a space for both light and dark to come together in the middle to Rock with a smile, dance with abandon and release the human spirit authentically. Because both light and dark forces want to feel strong and vibrant. Vibe Rock is that meeting place for both sides (light and dark forces) to engage in life-affirming music that helps foster strength and vibrancy. The ultimate goal of the Vibe Rock movement is to increase the awareness that we are all truly one voice of the Universe, a chorus of high and low voices that are equally important to the song, just as the dark and light colors are necessary for the painting upon the canvas to become a masterpiece. \n</p><p>Vibe Rock has been described as a diverse, non-religious musical movement dedicated to producing music that is lyrically <a href=\"/wiki/Nietzschean_affirmation\" title=\"Nietzschean affirmation\">life-affirming</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/01/health/la-he-0301-brain-music-therapy-20100301\">[1]</a>. \n</p><p>A popular Vibe Rock mantra: Good Vibes in, Good Vibes out\n</p><p>Example of a Vibe Rock artist: Shine Nine\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2172\nCached time: 20180919143735\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:34498055-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919143735 and revision id 478165354\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Music_therapy"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Alternative Music"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Electronic Music"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Folk Rock"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nietzschean affirmation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pop Rock"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rock Music"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/01/health/la-he-0301-brain-music-therapy-20100301"],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Vibe rock","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7924576"}]}}
