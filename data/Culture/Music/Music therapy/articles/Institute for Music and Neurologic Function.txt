The Institute for Music and Neurologic Function is a US nonprofit organization conducting research into and applying music therapy.  It is located in The Bronx, New York City. The institute—a member of the CenterLight Health System (formerly Beth Abraham Family of Health Services)—has for 35 years conducted clinical research studies on the effects of music on the human condition. The tax-exempt private foundation was founded in 1995. It is directed by music therapist Dr. Concetta M. Tomaino and was provided scientific guidance by neurologist Oliver Sacks, now deceased. Its aim is to restore, maintain and improve the physical, emotional and neurologic functioning in people who have been debilitated through stroke, trauma, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and other processes through the systematic use of music.  The director of the institute Dr. Concetta M. Tomaino states that "If you're stimulating almost every key component of our brain at one time, you have a way of reaching areas of the brain that are still functioning."  The mission of the institute is to develop and apply music-based therapies emanating from new discoveries and educational collaborations within the international research and treatment communities. The institute claims results of their treatment such as regaining memory loss, rebuilding motor skills, calming and counteracting apprehension or fear, promoting movement for physical rehabilitation, and recovering language skills.
