Music informatics is an emerging interdisciplinary research area dealing with the production, distribution, consumption, and analysis of music through technology (especially in digital formats). Music Informatics research topics include music technologies such as peer-to-peer application, digital audio editors, online music search engines and Music information retrieval; cognitive, social, and economic issues in music; as well as improvisation and music performance. It studies this range of topics not only to better design music search and retrieval systems, but to develop a fundamental understanding of the nature of music and its associated behaviors as well. Because music informatics is an emerging discipline, it is a very dynamic area of research with many diverse viewpoints, whose future is yet to be determined. Music informatics, as a degree subject, offers a similar learning experience to music technology, but goes further into learning the principles behind the technology.   Informatics students will not just use existing music hardware and software, but will learn programming and artificial intelligence.
