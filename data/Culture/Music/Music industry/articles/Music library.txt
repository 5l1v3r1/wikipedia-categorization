Use of such materials may be limited to specific patron groups, especially in private academic institutions.  Music library print collections include dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, printed music, music serials, bibliographies, and other music literature.

Examples can be found in Canada;   Perth, Australia;  and Massachusetts,    Illinois,  Ohio,  Washington  and New Paltz, New York  in the United States.
