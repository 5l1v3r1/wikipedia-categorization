Basic Concepts in Music Education is a landmark work published in 1958 as the Fifty-Seventh Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education. In 1954, the Music Educators National Conference (MENC) had formed its Commission on Basic Concepts in an attempt to seek a more soundly-based philosophical foundation. The work of the commission resulted in the publication of Basic Concepts, which advocated an aesthetic justification for music education. According to the aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified for its own sake rather than for its extra-musical benefits. Richard Colwell edited Basic Concepts in Music Education II in 1991. This volume included updates from the living authors of the original volume as well as new contributions from leaders in the field. Henry, N. B. (Ed.). (1958). Basic Concepts in Music Education.
