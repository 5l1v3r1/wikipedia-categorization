Music described as piano six hands (or piano trio).    is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one or two pianos. Because of the limited range available to each player, many of the pieces written for this combination are elementary in nature; many more are arrangements of pieces for other forces. But there are a small number of original works, and a handful of virtuoso three-player groups have emerged in the 21st century. Compositions include five pieces by Percy Grainger, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romance and Valse, Alfred Schnittke's Hommage, Carl Czerny's opp. 17, 84, 227-229, 295-298, 609, 689, 741 and 798, Jean Cras's "Âmes d’enfants", Paul Robinson's  "Pensees" and "Montmartre", various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs (de),  Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynov's  "Metrorhythmia 1",   John Pitts's "Are You Going?",  Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalas's "Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich", Canadian composer Paul Frehner's "Slowdown" , Malaysian composer Samuel Cho's "S[wim]" .
