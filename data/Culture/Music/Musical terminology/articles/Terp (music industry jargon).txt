Terp is music and dance industry jargon for "dance". The term is an eponym for Terpsichore, the Greek muse of dramatic chorus and dance.   The term, still in use, was more common from the 1930s to the 1970s by dance professionals and music entertainment industry magazines, including Billboard, which uses the terms "terp" and "terpsichore" (lower case "t"), interchangeably.
