Tutti is an Italian word literally meaning all or together and is used as a musical term, for the whole orchestra as opposed to the soloist. It is applied similarly to choral music, where the whole section or choir is called to sing.  Music examination boards may instruct candidates to "play in tuttis", indicating that the candidate should play both the solo and the tutti sections.
