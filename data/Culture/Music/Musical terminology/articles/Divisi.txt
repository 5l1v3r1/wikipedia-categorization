In musical terminology, divisi, or as typically printed “div.,” is an instruction to divide a single section of instruments into multiple subsections.  This usually applies to the violins of the string section in an orchestra, although violas, cellos, and double basses can also be divided.  Typically, 4-part French Horn sections include divided sections if Horns 1/2 and/or 3/4 are not playing the same music ("a2"). Other brass instruments can also be divided but it is not as frequent as with the Horn section. Woodwinds - especially Flutes and Clarinets - also utilize "divisi" to divide music between parts and even between players of the same part.
