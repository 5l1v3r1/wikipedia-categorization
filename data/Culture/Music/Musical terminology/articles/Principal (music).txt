The principal musician in an orchestra, as well as any large musical ensemble, is the lead player for each respective section of instruments. For example, there are multiple sections of an orchestra. The strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion sections all have subsections. The first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, double basses, flutes, clarinets, oboes, bassoons, trumpets, trombones, French horns, tubas, and percussion are all subsections, each possessing a principal musician. Most musical ensembles possess some variety of subsection, with each subsection having a principal player. The principal for each section is the most talented and valuable player. The principal is usually decided with a rigorous audition process.   Not only does a principal lead each section with their talented playing, they lead with verbal and physical communication. Verbally, principals must communicate directions from the conductor to the rest of their section. String principals must communicate direction of bowings as well as any changes in direction of bowings.  Principals also verbally communicate to their section specific notes that sound wrong, or sections in the music that need practicing, in order to maintain the performance level of their section. Physically, sections look to the principal for entrance cues, expression, and intensity.   In addition to leading the section, principal musicians play all of the solos written for their instrument in any given piece. The principal first violin is called the concertmaster (or "leader" in the UK) and is considered the leader of not only the string section, but of the entire orchestra, subordinate only to the conductor.
