In 1889 the French government staged the great <a href=\"/wiki/Exposition_Universelle_(1889)\" title=\"Exposition Universelle (1889)\">Paris Exposition</a>, an event that was to have profound effects on many areas of Western art and music. Debussy visited the exposition and it was here that he first heard <a href=\"/wiki/Gamelan\" title=\"Gamelan\">gamelan</a> music performed by <a href=\"/wiki/Sundanese_people\" title=\"Sundanese people\">Sundanese</a> musicians. He was transfixed by the hypnotic, layered sound of the gamelan orchestra and reportedly returned to the <a href=\"/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies\" title=\"Dutch East Indies\">Dutch East Indies</a> pavilion over several days to listen to the <a href=\"/wiki/Indonesian_music\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indonesian music\">Indonesian musicians</a> perform and to study the structure and tuning of this novel musical form. His exposure to gamelan music had a direct influence on the composition of his famous <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nocturnes_(Debussy)\" title=\"Nocturnes (Debussy)\">Nocturnes</a></i> for <a href=\"/wiki/Orchestra\" title=\"Orchestra\">orchestra</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the case of Debussy, some of this long process of appropriation also had an educative effect, and by the 1960s Western audiences were beginning to move beyond the confines of the Western musical tradition and explore traditional music from other countries and continents. As <a href=\"/wiki/Eurocentric\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eurocentric\">Eurocentric</a> social biases began to be broken down during the 1960s, music from other cultures gained increasingly broad acceptance.\n</p><p>The key factor in this transition was the invention of sound recording, but it was also greatly influenced by the wide-ranging program of collection of European traditional folk music by 19th- and early 20th-century European classical composers and <a href=\"/wiki/Musicologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Musicologist\">musicologists</a>. This process was, at first, simply one facet of the multifocal 19th century passion for collection and classification, but it was given greater impetus by the growing awareness that the devastating impact of Western urban-industrial culture was decimating traditional cultures.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:282px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg/280px-Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg\" width=\"280\" height=\"62\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg/420px-Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"450\" data-file-height=\"100\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Didgeridoo_Entier1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The <a href=\"/wiki/Didgeridoo\" title=\"Didgeridoo\">didgeridoo</a>, an instrument of the <a href=\"/wiki/Indigenous_Australians\" title=\"Indigenous Australians\">Indigenous Australians</a></div></div></div>\n<p>This collection activity took on some aspects of a crusade, as musicologists raced to preserve vanishing musical artefacts before they were lost to history.

A good example of this process was the enduringly popular suites of <a href=\"/wiki/Hungarian_dance\" title=\"Hungarian dance\">Hungarian dances</a> by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and <a href=\"/wiki/Johannes_Brahms\" title=\"Johannes Brahms\">Johannes Brahms</a>.\n</p><p>During the 19th century this collection program was necessarily restricted to the written notation of melodies, lyrics and arrangements, but it was transformed in the early 20th century by the invention of sound recording and the development of <a href=\"/wiki/Phonograph\" title=\"Phonograph\">portable cylinder</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction\" title=\"Sound recording and reproduction\">disc recording</a> equipment, enabling  musicologists for the first time to capture this music in actual performance, and the new technology was eagerly adopted by musicologists in <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">Europe</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/North_America\" title=\"North America\">America</a>.\n</p><p>This growing archive of \"folkloric\" recordings remained largely within the confines of academia until after <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>. But in America, these collection programs\u2014notably those sponsored by the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_of_Congress\" title=\"Library of Congress\">Library of Congress</a>\u2014were to have an immense influence on the development of the international popular music industry.\n</p><p>Folk-music collectors like the great <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Lomax\" title=\"Alan Lomax\">Alan Lomax</a> worked assiduously for decades to find and record examples of almost every facet of Native American, African-American and European-American folk music, and the work of these many scholars, enthusiasts and collectors preserved the sound of many \"folk\" performers and thousands of hours of priceless song and music from the American folk music tradition.\n</p><p>This musicological program was again revolutionised in the early 1950s by the new technology of <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetic_tape\" title=\"Magnetic tape\">magnetic tape</a> recording, which for the first time allowed music collectors to make very stable, long-duration, high-fidelity studio and field recordings. The concurrent introduction of the <a href=\"/wiki/Gramophone_record\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gramophone record\">LP</a> audio disc format, which could hold as much as thirty minutes of continuous music per side, allowed many such \"folk music\" recordings to be released into the consumer market for the first time.\n</p><p>The availability of high-quality portable tape recorders was the key innovation that led to the inception of the two keystone labels in the world music genre. <a href=\"/wiki/Folkways_Records\" title=\"Folkways Records\">Folkways Records</a>' extensive archive of folk and indigenous music was launched in the 1950s. It was followed in 1967 by <a href=\"/wiki/Elektra_Records\" title=\"Elektra Records\">Elektra Records</a>' influential <a href=\"/wiki/Nonesuch_Records\" title=\"Nonesuch Records\">Nonesuch</a> Explorer Series.\n</p><p>These \"folk\" LPs\u2014notably those of early 20th century <a href=\"/wiki/Blues\" title=\"Blues\">blues</a> music\u2014were to bring about a radical change in the style and direction of late 20th century popular music. This process is exemplified by the huge directional change in <a href=\"/wiki/Rock_music\" title=\"Rock music\">rock music</a> that came about when young British and American musicians (like <a href=\"/wiki/Eric_Clapton\" title=\"Eric Clapton\">Eric Clapton</a>) heard the recordings of an obscure <a href=\"/wiki/Mississippi\" title=\"Mississippi\">Mississippi</a> blues musician called <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Johnson_(musician)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert Johnson (musician)\">Robert Johnson</a>.\n</p><p>Another aspect of the changes in the appropriation process can be found on the music of <a href=\"/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k\" title=\"Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\">Dvo\u0159\u00e1k</a>, which itself was greatly influenced by his collection and study of the folk music of his native <a href=\"/wiki/Bohemia\" title=\"Bohemia\">Bohemia</a>. In the 1892 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was invited to become the director of the National Conservatory of Music in <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York City</a>; the period he spent in America, and especially his exposure to Native American and African-American music, led to the creation of his most famous and popular symphonic work, the <a href=\"/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k)\" title=\"Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)\">Symphony No. 9</a>, subtitled \"From the New World\".\n</p><p>This is arguably another very early example of the so-called <a href=\"/wiki/Crossover_music\" title=\"Crossover music\">crossover music</a> genre, but it also had an influence on the development of American popular music. Part of the symphony's enduring appeal is due to the nostalgic main melody in the second movement, which is said to have expressed Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's homesickness for Bohemia. Remarkably, this melody was later appropriated into the formative <a href=\"/wiki/Bluegrass_music\" title=\"Bluegrass music\">bluegrass music</a> genre as the basis for the song \"Goin' Home\" (attributed to <a href=\"/wiki/William_Arms_Fisher\" title=\"William Arms Fisher\">William Arms Fisher</a>); it soon became a bluegrass standard and was later adapted into a popular <a href=\"/wiki/Spiritual_(music)\" title=\"Spiritual (music)\">spiritual</a>-style song.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1900s\">1900s</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Appropriation_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: 1900s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Beginning around the turn of the 20th century, the invention of <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_recording\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sound recording\">sound recording</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_pictures\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Motion pictures\">motion pictures</a> enabled American mass-entertainment culture to begin to develop into a major global economic force.\n</p><p>Simultaneous with this process, two emerging streams of non-Western music\u2014<a href=\"/wiki/African-American_music\" title=\"African-American music\">African-American music</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Latin_music_(genre)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Latin music (genre)\">Latin music</a>\u2014were discovered by American and European audiences, and they were rapidly appropriated by the mainstream music industry.

Ragtime introduced African-derived <a href=\"/wiki/Syncopation\" title=\"Syncopation\">syncopated</a> (\"ragged\") rhythms into Western music and enjoyed a tremendous international vogue over the next twenty years, as well as exerted a huge influence on the subsequent development of <a href=\"/wiki/Jazz\" title=\"Jazz\">jazz</a>.\n</p><p>Ragtime and then early jazz transformed American popular music\u2014the work of songwriters like <a href=\"/wiki/George_Gershwin\" title=\"George Gershwin\">George Gershwin</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Irving_Berlin\" title=\"Irving Berlin\">Irving Berlin</a> was crucially shaped by their appropriation of influences from African-American music\u2014and these genres also strongly influenced many European classical composers, especially the French composers <a href=\"/wiki/Erik_Satie\" title=\"Erik Satie\">Erik Satie</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Claude_Debussy\" title=\"Claude Debussy\">Claude Debussy</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Maurice_Ravel\" title=\"Maurice Ravel\">Maurice Ravel</a>.\n</p><p>In terms of their influence on almost every facet of 20th century popular music, the successive historical genres of <a href=\"/wiki/African-American_music\" title=\"African-American music\">African-American music</a> have, as a group, been the most significant of all the \"exotic\" genres appropriated into Western music. Just as they influenced each other, <a href=\"/wiki/Gospel_music\" title=\"Gospel music\">gospel music</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ragtime\" title=\"Ragtime\">ragtime</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Blues\" title=\"Blues\">blues</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jazz\" title=\"Jazz\">jazz</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/R%26B\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"R&amp;B\">R&amp;B</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rock%27n%27roll\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rock&#39;n&#39;roll\">rock'n'roll</a> were also successively appropriated into mainstream Western popular music\u2014usually almost as soon as each became known as a definable genre. It is undeniable that the various genres of African-American music have, collectively, exerted a greater influence over the development and direction of Western mass-market popular recorded music than any other force.\n</p><p>Alongside the emergence of jazz, beginning around 1915, <a href=\"/wiki/Music_of_Hawaii\" title=\"Music of Hawaii\">Hawaiian music</a> reached the mainstream pop market in the United States. The Hawaiian style (or, more often, Western imitations of it) became a major music fad, retaining a significant audience following from the 1930s to the 1950s. Hawaiian music was itself a complex mixture of European, native Hawaiian and other <a href=\"/wiki/Polynesia\" title=\"Polynesia\">Polynesian</a> influences. This is well demonstrated by the work of one of the founders of the genre, Queen <a href=\"/wiki/Lili%27uokalani\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lili&#39;uokalani\">Lili'uokalani</a> (1838\u20131917), the last Queen of Hawaii before the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown. A musician and composer, she is credited as the composer of  the unofficial Hawaiian anthem \"Aloha 'Oe\". Lili'uokalani indeed wrote the lyrics and <i>arranged</i> the music but in fact she appropriated the tune from a <a href=\"/wiki/Croatia\" title=\"Croatia\">Croatian</a> folk song called \"<a href=\"/wiki/Sidi_Mara\" title=\"Sidi Mara\">Sidi Mara na kamen studencu</a>\".\n</p><p>Beginning in the late 1920s, a series of concerts under the aegis of the Pan-American Association of Composers, founded by <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Cowell\" title=\"Henry Cowell\">Henry Cowell</a>, brought the African-influenced music of Cuban composers <a href=\"/wiki/Music_of_Cuba#Classical_music\" title=\"Music of Cuba\">Alejandro Garc\u00eda Caturla</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Amadeo_Rold%C3%A1n\" title=\"Amadeo Rold\u00e1n\">Amadeo Rold\u00e1n</a> and the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Carlos_Ch%C3%A1vez\" title=\"Carlos Ch\u00e1vez\">Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</a>, much of it rooted in <a href=\"/wiki/Music_of_Mexico\" title=\"Music of Mexico\">Mexican folk music</a>, to the United States.\n</p><p>In the 1930s, the \"Latin invasion\" that had begun with the tango took off again when American jazz, dance music, and popular song were revolutionized by the \"discovery\" of other music forms of the <a href=\"/wiki/Caribbean\" title=\"Caribbean\">Caribbean</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Central_America\" title=\"Central America\">Central</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/South_America\" title=\"South America\">South America</a>, a process that was triggered by a significant influx of migrants to the United States from <a href=\"/wiki/Cuba\" title=\"Cuba\">Cuba</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Puerto_Rico\" title=\"Puerto Rico\">Puerto Rico</a> and other Caribbean islands in the 1940s.\n</p><p>The blending of Latin rhythms and instrumental jazz was pioneered by established American musicians like <a href=\"/wiki/Duke_Ellington\" title=\"Duke Ellington\">Duke Ellington</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie\" title=\"Dizzy Gillespie\">Dizzy Gillespie</a> and by recently arrived 'Latin' musicians like <a href=\"/wiki/Machito\" title=\"Machito\">Machito</a> and others, some of whom soon became stars in their own right. Latin beats rapidly became an essential part of the rhythmical vocabulary of American popular music, providing composers and musicians with a vastly enhanced repertoire of beats and meters. During the 1930s and 1940s, newly appropriated Latin music genres created a series of music movements and dance crazes, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Merengue_(music)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Merengue (music)\">merengue</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Samba\" title=\"Samba\">samba</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Cuban_Rumba\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cuban Rumba\">rumba</a>.\n</p><p>In 1944 <a href=\"/wiki/The_Andrews_Sisters\" title=\"The Andrews Sisters\">The Andrews Sisters</a> appropriated the song \"<a href=\"/wiki/Rum_and_Coca-Cola\" title=\"Rum and Coca-Cola\">Rum and Coca-Cola</a>\", which had  originally been recorded by <a href=\"/wiki/Trinidad\" title=\"Trinidad\">Trinidadian</a> musician <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Invader\" title=\"Lord Invader\">Lord Invader</a> in the 1930s. The Andrews Sisters' version sparked a new fad for this infectious new style, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Calypso_music\" title=\"Calypso music\">calypso</a></i>. The craze reached its apex of popularity in the mid-1950s with the release of the hugely successful <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Belafonte\" title=\"Harry Belafonte\">Harry Belafonte</a> single \"<a href=\"/wiki/Banana_Boat_Song\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Banana Boat Song\">Banana Boat Song</a>\" and Belafonte's million-selling 1956 <a href=\"/wiki/Gramophone_record\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gramophone record\">LP</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Calypso_(album)\" title=\"Calypso (album)\">Calypso</a></i>. Calypso also had a strong influence on the mainstream folk music boom of the late fifties and early sixties, which in turn became one of the major springboards for the development of world music as a commercial genre.\n</p><p>In the late 1950s, repeating the impact of the tango, a seductive new music style called  <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bossa_nova\" title=\"Bossa nova\">bossa nova</a></i> emerged from <a href=\"/wiki/Brazil\" title=\"Brazil\">Brazil</a> and it soon swept the world, exerting a huge effect over the course of Western pop and jazz over the next decade and beyond. Nothing better illustrates the lasting impact of this hugely popular genre than the archetypical bossa song, \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Girl_From_Ipanema\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Girl From Ipanema\">The Girl From Ipanema</a>\", written in 1962 and best known via the languid bilingual crossover version recorded by <a href=\"/wiki/Stan_Getz\" title=\"Stan Getz\">Stan Getz</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Gilberto\" title=\"Jo\u00e3o Gilberto\">Jo\u00e3o Gilberto</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Astrud_Gilberto\" title=\"Astrud Gilberto\">Astrud Gilberto</a> in 1963. Thanks largely to the enormous worldwide popularity of this single, \"The Girl From Ipanema\" now ranks as the second most-recorded song of all time, surpassed only by <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_McCartney\" title=\"Paul McCartney\">Paul McCartney</a>'s \"Yesterday\".\n</p><p>New York was one of the epicentres of the Latin-jazz crossover, so it is not surprising that the other major pop style to show a strong influence from bossa nova was the so-called \"<a href=\"/wiki/Brill_Building\" title=\"Brill Building\">Brill Building</a> Sound\", exemplified by the work of the New York-based songwriter teams such as <a href=\"/wiki/Jerry_Leiber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jerry Leiber\">Jerry Leiber</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mike_Stoller\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mike Stoller\">Mike Stoller</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gerry_Goffin\" title=\"Gerry Goffin\">Gerry Goffin</a> &amp; <a href=\"/wiki/Carole_King\" title=\"Carole King\">Carole King</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Neil_Sedaka\" title=\"Neil Sedaka\">Neil Sedaka</a> &amp; <a href=\"/wiki/Howard_Greenfield\" title=\"Howard Greenfield\">Howard Greenfield</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jeff_Barry\" title=\"Jeff Barry\">Jeff Barry</a> &amp; <a href=\"/wiki/Ellie_Greenwich\" title=\"Ellie Greenwich\">Ellie Greenwich</a> and especially <a href=\"/wiki/Burt_Bacharach\" title=\"Burt Bacharach\">Burt Bacharach</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hal_David\" title=\"Hal David\">Hal David</a>.\n</p><p>Influences from African music also began to appear in the 1950s. This process included one of the more controversial examples of appropriation process, exemplified by the pop song \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight\" title=\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\">The Lion Sleeps Tonight</a>\". A version of this song was an American #1 hit for pop band <a href=\"/wiki/The_Tokens\" title=\"The Tokens\">The Tokens</a> in 1961, and it was credited to American writers, but in fact \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" was actually an unacknowledged rewrite of the song \"<a href=\"/wiki/Mbube_(song)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mbube (song)\">Mbube</a>\", written and recorded by <a href=\"/wiki/South_Africa\" title=\"South Africa\">South African</a> musician and composer, <a href=\"/wiki/Solomon_Linda\" title=\"Solomon Linda\">Solomon Linda</a>, in 1939.\n</p><p>\"Mbube\" had been a major local hit for Linda and his band, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Evening_Birds&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Evening Birds (page does not exist)\">The Evening Birds</a>, reputedly selling 100,000 copies there, but its success at the time was entirely confined to South Africa. Some years later, a copy of Linda's recording reached the American <a href=\"/wiki/Musicologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Musicologist\">musicologist</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Lomax\" title=\"Alan Lomax\">Alan Lomax</a>; he passed it on to his friend <a href=\"/wiki/Pete_Seeger\" title=\"Pete Seeger\">Pete Seeger</a>, who fell in love with it, and it was Seeger who was mainly responsible for popularising the song in the West.\n</p><p>Seeger recorded a version of the song with his noted folk group <a href=\"/wiki/The_Weavers\" title=\"The Weavers\">The Weavers</a> in 1952, retitling it \"Wimoweh\" (an inaccurate transliteration of the song's original <a href=\"/wiki/Zulu_language\" title=\"Zulu language\">Zulu</a> refrain, \"uyimbube\"). The Weavers scored a US Top 20 hit with their studio version, and had further success with a live version of the song included on their influential 1957 live album, recorded at <a href=\"/wiki/Carnegie_Hall\" title=\"Carnegie Hall\">Carnegie Hall</a>, which led to it being covered by <a href=\"/wiki/The_Kingston_Trio\" title=\"The Kingston Trio\">The Kingston Trio</a> in 1959.\n</p><p>The Weavers' Carnegie Hall version of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Wimoweh\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wimoweh\">Wimoweh</a>\" became a favourite song of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Tokens\" title=\"The Tokens\">The Tokens</a>\u2014they used it as their audition piece when they were offered a contract with <a href=\"/wiki/RCA_Records\" title=\"RCA Records\">RCA Records</a>\u2014and this led to them recording it as their first RCA single. However, it was at this point that the lyrics were re-written by the band's producers\u2014who took full credit for the song\u2014and it would be several decades more before the full story of the appropriation of Solomon Linda's work became widely known. Sadly, by then Linda had long since died in poverty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"1950.E2.80.931970\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1950\u20131970\">1950\u20131970</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Appropriation_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: 1950\u20131970\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After World War II a small but growing market developed for Western folk music and recordings of non-Western music, and this was supplied by specialist record labels such as <a href=\"/wiki/Folkways_Records\" title=\"Folkways Records\">Folkways Records</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Elektra_Records\" title=\"Elektra Records\">Elektra Records</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Nonesuch_Records\" title=\"Nonesuch Records\">Nonesuch Records</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">USA</a> and, European labels such as <a href=\"/wiki/Disques_Cellier\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disques Cellier\">Disques Cellier</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Switzerland\" title=\"Switzerland\">Switzerland</a> and the state-run recording labels operated by eastern European governments, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Melodiya\" title=\"Melodiya\">Melodiya</a> (USSR). In the West these labels were often small \"boutique\" operations or minor specialist imprints of larger companies, releasing albums of non-Western traditional classical music, folk songs and indigenous \"ethnic\" music.\n</p><p>This market expanded enormously during the 1950s thanks to the so-called \"folk boom\" of the 1950s and early 1960s, in which artists and groups like <a href=\"/wiki/Pete_Seeger\" title=\"Pete Seeger\">Pete Seeger</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/The_New_Lost_City_Ramblers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The New Lost City Ramblers\">The New Lost City Ramblers</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Weavers\" title=\"The Weavers\">The Weavers</a> explored the traditional songs and sounds of American folk music and reinterpreted them for a mass audience. In America, this process was massively influenced by the 'discovery' of the treasure-trove of recordings of European, English, American and <a href=\"/wiki/African-American_music\" title=\"African-American music\">African-American music</a> folk musics that had been made over preceding decades. One of the key audio artifacts of this process was the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Anthology_of_American_Folk_Music\" title=\"Anthology of American Folk Music\">Anthology of American Folk Music</a></i>, the landmark six-album set compiled by the musicologist <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Everett_Smith\" title=\"Harry Everett Smith\">Harry Smith</a> from his own collection of 78s and cylinder recordings, originally released in 1952.\n</p><p>This exploratory process also led musicians to begin investigating music from non-Western cultures \u2014 as in the case of <a href=\"/wiki/Solomon_Linda\" title=\"Solomon Linda\">Solomon Linda</a>'s \"Mbube\". In each case, these processes of discovery and appropriation were made considerably easier by the increasing availability of LP recordings of \"ethnic\" music from non-Western countries.\n</p><p>This process had a definite cumulative effect, but it is fair to say that, until the late 1960s, \"ethnic\"/\"folkloric\" music remained more or less a specialist interest. Some \"exotic\" influences inevitably filtered through to the <a href=\"/wiki/Mass_market\" title=\"Mass market\">mass market</a>\u2014as in the case of \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight\" title=\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\">The Lion Sleeps Tonight</a>\" \u2014 but in general these were mostly Western reinterpretations, and very little original music produced outside of the mainstream Western popular music recording industry managed to break into the mainstream pop music market or achieve significant sales until the late 1960s.\n</p><p>Similarly, prior to the '60s, numerous classical musicians and composers wrote and/or performed music that showed the influence of novel non-Western styles (e.g. the influence of <a href=\"/wiki/Gamelan\" title=\"Gamelan\">gamelan</a> music on French composer <a href=\"/wiki/Claude_Debussy\" title=\"Claude Debussy\">Claude Debussy</a>) or attempted to explicitly combine traditional Western musical styles with influences from non-Western traditions, although this too remained largely an elite 'art' activity, and it gained relatively little mass recognition when compared to major popular genres like <a href=\"/wiki/Swing_music\" title=\"Swing music\">swing music</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jazz\" title=\"Jazz\">jazz</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Rock%27n%27roll\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rock&#39;n&#39;roll\">rock'n'roll</a>.\n</p><p>Mass-market acceptance of what is now termed \"world music\" grew dramatically as a result of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pop_music\" title=\"Pop music\">pop music</a> explosion of the 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, the more adventurous pop, rock, progressive and jazz musicians and producers attempted, with varying degrees of success, to create a 'fusion' style that combined conventional English-language popular music forms and structures with instrumental and compositional influences from exotic musical genres. The interest in these \"ethnic\" musics by groups like <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"The Beatles\">The Beatles</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones\" title=\"The Rolling Stones\">The Rolling Stones</a>, combined with their worldwide popularity, encouraged other performers and a growing number of record buyers to seek out recordings of non-Western music.\n</p><p>A prototype for this <a href=\"/wiki/Fusion_(music)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fusion (music)\">fusion</a> of pop and world music in the late '60s can be seen in the <a href=\"/wiki/Folk_rock\" title=\"Folk rock\">folk rock</a> phenomenon of the mid-1960s. Underlying this development was the fact that many leading American and English pop-rock musicians of the period\u2014<a href=\"/wiki/Roger_McGuinn\" title=\"Roger McGuinn\">Roger McGuinn</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Dylan\" title=\"Bob Dylan\">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jerry_Garcia\" title=\"Jerry Garcia\">Jerry Garcia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Donovan\" title=\"Donovan\">Donovan</a>\u2014started their musical careers on the folk scene.\n</p><p>Although the core of the \"folk\" genre at this time was traditional Anglo-American folk song, mainstream folk music was still appropriating new \"non-Anglo\" influences like <a href=\"/wiki/Calypso_music\" title=\"Calypso music\">calypso</a>, black South African popular music and even the Middle East (e.g. the pioneering music of noted UK guitarist <a href=\"/wiki/Davey_Graham\" title=\"Davey Graham\">Davey Graham</a>). Another notable feature is that many performers and fans came to acknowledge African-American music\u2014especially blues and gospel\u2014as a vital element of folk, ultimately contributing to the breakdown of entrenched industry prejudices that had for decades divided the record market into separate 'pop' (white) and 'race' (black) markets, and this connection led to the folk music movement playing an important part in the accelerating <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil rights\">civil rights</a> movement of the 1950s and '60s. On stage, many African American 'folk' performers like <a href=\"/wiki/Lead_Belly\" title=\"Lead Belly\">Lead Belly</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Odetta\" title=\"Odetta\">Odetta</a> were able for the first time to perform side-by-side and as equal attractions with white performers like Dylan and <a href=\"/wiki/Pete_Seeger\" title=\"Pete Seeger\">Pete Seeger</a>, as evidenced by the multiracial lineups at American folk scene's peak annual peak event, the <a href=\"/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival\" title=\"Newport Folk Festival\">Newport Folk Festival</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Folk_rock\" title=\"Folk rock\">Folk rock</a> can be seen an attempt to broaden the language of mainstream pop by incorporating the more \"serious\" lyrical approach and political awareness of postwar acoustic folk with the mass-market appeal of pop-rock instrumentation and production. Folk rock emerged as a genre in 1964-65, sparked by the release of two landmark pop singles. In late 1964 <a href=\"/wiki/The_Byrds\" title=\"The Byrds\">The Byrds</a> recorded an electrified cover version of <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Dylan\" title=\"Bob Dylan\">Bob Dylan</a>'s \"<a href=\"/wiki/Mr_Tambourine_Man\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mr Tambourine Man\">Mr Tambourine Man</a>\", in which The Byrds combined the pop-rock instrumentation and close harmonies made popular by <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"The Beatles\">The Beatles</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\" title=\"The Beach Boys\">The Beach Boys</a> with the earnest lyrical approach of the Anglo-American folk genre. The huge commercial success of The Byrds' version of \"Mr Tambourine Man\" spawned scores of imitations, and folk rock continued to expand and diversify over the next few years.\n</p><p>Another major folk-rock landmark was the <a href=\"/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel\" title=\"Simon &amp; Garfunkel\">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a> single \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Sounds_of_Silence\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Sounds of Silence\">The Sounds of Silence</a>\". The song was originally recorded as a simple acoustic ballad and included on the duo's 1964 debut album, but the LP flopped and the duo split soon after, and Simon left for the UK. The following year, inspired by the success of \"Mr Tambourine Man\" (and immediately after producing the historic <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Dylan\" title=\"Bob Dylan\">Bob Dylan</a> single \"<a href=\"/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone\" title=\"Like a Rolling Stone\">Like a Rolling Stone</a>\"), Columbia Records house producer <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Wilson_(producer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tom Wilson (producer)\">Tom Wilson</a> took the original track and (without even consulting Simon and Garfunkel) overdubbed an electric rhythm section, creating a new version. This was released as a single (as \"The Sound of Silence\") in late 1965 and by early 1966 it had become a major pop hit, relaunching the duo's career.\n</p><p><br />\nInspired by these developments, UK acts such as <a href=\"/wiki/Donovan\" title=\"Donovan\">Donovan</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fairport_Convention\" title=\"Fairport Convention\">Fairport Convention</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Steeleye_Span\" title=\"Steeleye Span\">Steeleye Span</a> took a similar approach,  combining <a href=\"/wiki/Pop-rock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pop-rock\">pop-rock</a> arrangements with songs, stylings and instruments drawn from traditional English and Celtic folk music, creating a hybrid style that applied the Byrds' folk-rock approach to the vast repertoire of English folk songs; like so many other English acts, all these performers were also heavily influenced by Dylan. <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Stivell\" title=\"Alan Stivell\">Alan Stivell</a> (Brittany) began working in a similar vein in the mid-1960s.\n</p><p>Solo guitarist <a href=\"/wiki/Davey_Graham\" title=\"Davey Graham\">Davey Graham</a> was a notable figure on the British folk scene whose innovative work exerted a strong influence on other musicians. Graham's complex finder-picking style (epitomised by his landmark composition \"Anji\"), his reputed introduction of the <a href=\"/wiki/DADGAD\" title=\"DADGAD\">DADGAD</a> tuning to British folk guitarists and his groundbreaking incorporations of Arabic and Indian inflections into his playing influenced many of his contemporaries, including <a href=\"/wiki/Bert_Jansch\" title=\"Bert Jansch\">Bert Jansch</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jimmy_Page\" title=\"Jimmy Page\">Jimmy Page</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Donovan\" title=\"Donovan\">Donovan</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Ray_Davies\" title=\"Ray Davies\">Ray Davies</a>, all of whom have acknowledged him as an important influence.\n</p><p>Graham's mercurial American counterpart <a href=\"/wiki/John_Fahey_(musician)\" title=\"John Fahey (musician)\">John Fahey</a> also made many remarkably innovative solo guitar recordings during this period, incorporating influences from traditional American folk, blues, Hawaiian music, Arabic and Indian music as well as exploring unusual production effects.\n</p><p>In America (and also in <a href=\"/wiki/Australasia\" title=\"Australasia\">Australasia</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>) in the late Sixties, pop-rock acts including <a href=\"/wiki/The_Grateful_Dead\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Grateful Dead\">The Grateful Dead</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Byrds\" title=\"The Byrds\">The Byrds</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Flying_Burrito_Brothers\" title=\"The Flying Burrito Brothers\">The Flying Burrito Brothers</a> then moved their music in a different direction. Drawing on their folk roots, and inspired by the hugely influential late '60s albums by <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Dylan\" title=\"Bob Dylan\">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Band\" title=\"The Band\">The Band</a>, these bands began creating a new hybrid style that fused pop and rock with American <a href=\"/wiki/Country_music\" title=\"Country music\">country music</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bluegrass_music\" title=\"Bluegrass music\">bluegrass music</a>, creating the genre now termed <a href=\"/wiki/Country_rock\" title=\"Country rock\">country rock</a>.\n</p><p>This ongoing process of exploration and experimentation by popular musicians, and the availability of recorded collections of \"authentic\" performances of English and American folk music, began to lead more and more curious listeners to explore these genres. This in turn would pave the way for the development of the \"world music\" concept in later years.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mid-1960s\">Mid-1960s</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Appropriation_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Mid-1960s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Western pop musicians first began to explore the music of other cultures in the mid-sixties, when they began to mix Western electric pop with influences taken from the traditional music of India. Although the resulting artefacts of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Raga_rock\" title=\"Raga rock\">raga rock</a>\" were sometimes risible, it  proved to be the most influential fusion of pop and \"folk\" music of the entire period, specifically because it was the first widely accepted attempt to mix Western popular music with a completely non-Western musical tradition.\n</p><p><br />\nAlthough they were by no means the only people at that time who were following this course, much of the credit for the creation of the world music genre, and for the rapid expansion of Western mass-audience interest in non-Western music, must be accorded to <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"The Beatles\">The Beatles</a>, and especially to their lead guitarist, <a href=\"/wiki/George_Harrison\" title=\"George Harrison\">George Harrison</a>.\n</p><p>Interest in Indian music increased rapidly in the mid-1960s. By 1965 a number of  British and American pop musicians were discovering Indian music and instruments; in early 1965, during a tour of America, <a href=\"/wiki/David_Crosby\" title=\"David Crosby\">David Crosby</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Byrds\" title=\"The Byrds\">The Byrds</a> introduced Harrison to the sitar and the traditional classical music of India. Harrison was captivated by the sound of the instrument; he soon developed a profound interested in Indian music, culture and spirituality, and sparked a trend by taking sitar lessons from Indian sitar virtuoso <a href=\"/wiki/Ravi_Shankar_(musician)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ravi Shankar (musician)\">Ravi Shankar</a>, whom Harrison continued to regard as the \"best musician on the planet\" long after the 1960s and who, coincidentally, had also recorded for The Beatles' label, <a href=\"/wiki/EMI\" title=\"EMI\">EMI</a>.\n</p><p>Harrison's background in popular British and American music forms had given him a grounding in the techniques of jazz-blues <a href=\"/wiki/Improvisation\" title=\"Improvisation\">improvisation</a> that are central to the genre. Like jazz and blues, the largely improvised nature of Hindustani classical music, its strong reliance on rhythm and percussion, and the extended nature of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Raga\" title=\"Raga\">raga</a></i> form were all features that Harrison was able to recognise, appreciate and begin to explore in the context of pop's ongoing quest for \"the new sound\".\n</p><p>In October 1965 Harrison made pop history when he played a <a href=\"/wiki/Sitar\" title=\"Sitar\">sitar</a> on the Beatles' song \"<a href=\"/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(This_Bird_Has_Flown)\" title=\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\">Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)</a>\", included their 1965 LP <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rubber_Soul\" title=\"Rubber Soul\">Rubber Soul</a></i>. Other musicians were attempting similar fusions at the time\u2014Brian Wilson, for example, used a <a href=\"/wiki/Koto_(musical_instrument)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Koto (musical instrument)\">koto</a> on one of the songs on The Beach Boys' classic <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pet_Sounds\" title=\"Pet Sounds\">Pet Sounds</a></i> LP, recorded, and Donovan was recording and performing with pioneering American sitarist <a href=\"/wiki/Shawn_Phillips\" title=\"Shawn Phillips\">Shawn Phillips</a>\u2014but arguably no other single recording had the instant and worldwide impact of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(This_Bird_Has_Flown)\" title=\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\">Norwegian Wood</a>\".\n</p><p>It was the first time a Western pop song had used a sitar in its arrangement, and for many Western listeners it was undoubtedly the first time they ever heard the instrument. In the wake of the song's release, the sitar became the new \"in\" sound for pop recordings, and an American guitar company even manufactured an <a href=\"/wiki/Electric_sitar\" title=\"Electric sitar\">electric sitar</a>-guitar designed to simulate the sound of the sitar.\n</p><p>More importantly, \"Norwegian Wood\" sparked a major craze for the classical music of <a href=\"/wiki/India\" title=\"India\">India</a> in general and for the work of Ravi Shankar in particular, with the direct result that recordings by Shankar and other Indian classical musicians began to sell in large quantities outside India for the first time and Shankar himself quickly became one of the world's most sought-after concert performers. The availability of tape recording and the LP were also crucial to the popularization of this particular genre of music\u2014since a typical <i><a href=\"/wiki/Raga\" title=\"Raga\">raga</a></i> performance could last twenty minutes or more, popular appreciation of this music would have been impossible without the longer duration and high fidelity provided by the LP format.\n</p><p>In 1966 Harrison took his \"Indi-psych-pop\" synthesis a step further with the highly original song \"<a href=\"/wiki/Love_You_To\" title=\"Love You To\">Love You To</a>\" (from the seminal <i><a href=\"/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)\" title=\"Revolver (Beatles album)\">Revolver</a></i> LP), which featured a sinuous Indian-influenced melody and an innovative arrangement consisting solely of Indian instruments, performed by expatriate Indian musicians living in London. The peak of Harrison's Indian synthesis project was the epic track \"<a href=\"/wiki/Within_You_Without_You\" title=\"Within You Without You\">Within You Without You</a>\" (1967) from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band\" title=\"Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band\">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></i>, recorded at Studio Two, Abbey Road by Harrison and an ensemble of musicians from the Asian Music Circle in London.\n</p><p>Another trace of Harrison's immersion in Indian music was that \"<a href=\"/wiki/Within_You_Without_You\" title=\"Within You Without You\">Within You Without You</a>\" also broke new ground on the pop scene by clocking in at over five minutes. Harrison also recorded in India with Indian instruments and musicians when producing the soundtrack music for the 1968 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wonderwall_(film)\" title=\"Wonderwall (film)\">Wonderwall</a></i>; he was given free rein by the film's director and the music he created was explicitly intended as a sort of \"primer\" of the styles of Indian instrumental music that he was exploring, but the film did not have a wide release at the time and Harrison's soundtrack remains little known outside the realm of Beatles aficionados.\n</p><p>Although by no means as influential as \"Norwegian Wood\", the 1965 song \"<a href=\"/wiki/See_My_Friends\" title=\"See My Friends\">See My Friends</a>\" by <a href=\"/wiki/The_Kinks\" title=\"The Kinks\">The Kinks</a> is another significant Western pop song of the period that shows the unmistakable influence of Indian music.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In this case, according to writer <a href=\"/wiki/Ray_Davies\" title=\"Ray Davies\">Ray Davies</a>, the song's arrangement was inspired by a stopover in India during the band's first trip to <a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a> in 1965, when during an early-morning walk, he heard local fisherman singing a traditional chant, part of which he incorporated into the song's sinuous melody line; Davies' exposure to Hindustani raga music is also evident in the sitar-like quality of the guitar accompaniment. Another early use of the sitar in pop was on <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones\" title=\"The Rolling Stones\">The Rolling Stones</a>' hit single \"<a href=\"/wiki/Paint_It,_Black\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Paint It, Black\">Paint It, Black</a>\", released in May 1966.\n</p><p>1967 proved to be a pivotal year for the development of the world music genre. In June, the three-day <a href=\"/wiki/Monterey_International_Pop_Festival\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Monterey International Pop Festival\">Monterey International Pop Festival</a>, the world's first <a href=\"/wiki/Rock_festival\" title=\"Rock festival\">rock festival</a>, was held in California, and it was attended by approximately 200,000 people. Alongside English and American pop and rock acts, the bill also featured black South African jazz trumpeter <a href=\"/wiki/Hugh_Masekela\" title=\"Hugh Masekela\">Hugh Masekela</a> as well as a performance by <a href=\"/wiki/Ravi_Shankar_(musician)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ravi Shankar (musician)\">Ravi Shankar</a>, who opened the climactic Sunday concert (and whose presence at the festival was almost entirely due to the influence of George Harrison). Shankar's performance at Monterey was seen by tens of thousands of people that day, and because the entire festival was recorded and filmed, millions more around the world heard it on record or saw it on film in the years that followed.\n</p><p>The other major landmark that year was the launch of the <a href=\"/wiki/Nonesuch_Records\" title=\"Nonesuch Records\">Nonesuch</a> Explorer Series<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> by the American <a href=\"/wiki/Elektra_Records\" title=\"Elektra Records\">Elektra Records</a> label.

Although Dibango came from a jazz background, the single contained elements drawn from the Cameroonian folk music style known as <a href=\"/wiki/Makossa\" title=\"Makossa\">makossa</a>, and Dibango became one of the very first African musicians to achieve significant success in the mainstream Western pop market. \"Soul Makossa\" also became an example of appropriation when <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Jackson\" title=\"Michael Jackson\">Michael Jackson</a> \"borrowed\" 77 seconds of music from Dibango's single and incorporated it into his song \"<a href=\"/wiki/Wanna_Be_Startin%27_Somethin%27\" title=\"Wanna Be Startin&#39; Somethin&#39;\">Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'</a>\", from the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Thriller_(Michael_Jackson_album)\" title=\"Thriller (Michael Jackson album)\">Thriller</a></i> album, leading Dibango to take legal action against Jackson.\n</p><p>In 1975 there were several important \"popular\" releases that gained wide recognition and exposed pop audiences to new musical influences. In February, <a href=\"/wiki/Led_Zeppelin\" title=\"Led Zeppelin\">Led Zeppelin</a> released an ambitious \"Arab-pop fusion\" song, the ten-minute <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_poetry\" title=\"Epic poetry\">epic</a> \"<a href=\"/wiki/Kashmir_(song)\" title=\"Kashmir (song)\">Kashmir</a>\", from their <i><a href=\"/wiki/Physical_Graffiti\" title=\"Physical Graffiti\">Physical Graffiti</a></i> LP. The song was strongly influenced by composer <a href=\"/wiki/Jimmy_Page\" title=\"Jimmy Page\">Jimmy Page</a>'s interest in <a href=\"/wiki/Arabic_music\" title=\"Arabic music\">Arabic music</a>. Although its length made it an unlikely hit, the song became a firm favorite on American <a href=\"/wiki/FM_radio\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"FM radio\">FM radio</a> stations and was even played on Australian pop radio.\n</p><p>In November that year, <a href=\"/wiki/Joni_Mitchell\" title=\"Joni Mitchell\">Joni Mitchell</a> released her LP <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hissing_of_Summer_Lawns\" title=\"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\">The Hissing of Summer Lawns</a></i>, featuring the track \"The Jungle Line\", which mixed traditional African drumming and <a href=\"/wiki/Synthesiser\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Synthesiser\">synthesiser</a>. For this recording, Mitchell was accompanied by the musical group The Warrior Drums of <a href=\"/wiki/Burundi\" title=\"Burundi\">Burundi</a>, who were visiting America at the time.\n</p><p>Two other musical events in 1975 which had a significant impact on the development of world music can both be largely credited to <a href=\"/wiki/Marcel_Cellier\" title=\"Marcel Cellier\">Marcel Cellier</a>, owner of the Swiss record label Disques Cellier.\n</p><p>That year Cellier released <i><a href=\"/wiki/Le_Myst%C3%A8re_des_Voix_Bulgares_(album)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Le Myst\u00e8re des Voix Bulgares (album)\">Le Myst\u00e8re des Voix Bulgares</a></i>, the first volume of an eventual three-album series of recordings of Bulgarian vocal folk music, performed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Bulgarian_State_Radio_Choir\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bulgarian State Radio Choir\">Bulgarian State Radio Choir</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Trio_Bulgarka\" title=\"Trio Bulgarka\">Trio Bulgarka</a>. In the years that followed, particularly after the album's re-release through the British <a href=\"/wiki/4AD_Records\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"4AD Records\">4AD Records</a> label, the Bulgarian Voices album became a significant cult hit in many countries and created a huge groundswell of interest in this form of eastern European folk music,<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The international vogue for Zamfir's music is largely due to Australian film director <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Weir\" title=\"Peter Weir\">Peter Weir</a>. His 1975 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Picnic_at_Hanging_Rock_(film)\" title=\"Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)\">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a></i>, one of the most successful Australian feature films of the period, featured evocative music from the Cellier disc on the soundtrack, and the film's success created widespread interest in Zamfir and his music.\n</p><p>Weir had been introduced to Zamfir's music a few years earlier, and when he began production on <i>Picnic</i> he decided to use pan flute music on the <a href=\"/wiki/Soundtrack\" title=\"Soundtrack\">soundtrack</a>; he approached Zamfir to compose original music in the same style, but Zamfir declined, so Weir was returned to the music he had originally heard and licensed some of the tracks from the Cellier LP.\n</p><p>In 1978, <a href=\"/wiki/Matthew_Montfort\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Matthew Montfort\">Matthew Montfort</a> formed <a href=\"/wiki/Ancient_Future_(group)\" title=\"Ancient Future (group)\">Ancient Future</a>, an ensemble of 28 members having musical masters of a song traditional to the master's country play the song along with them.

His influential, multi-million-selling <i><a href=\"/wiki/Graceland_(album)\" title=\"Graceland (album)\">Graceland</a></i> album bore the unmistakable stamp of Simon's recent discovery of <a href=\"/wiki/South_Africa\" title=\"South Africa\">South African</a> <i>township</i> music, and he recorded the album with leading South African session musicians and the vocal group <a href=\"/wiki/Ladysmith_Black_Mambazo\" title=\"Ladysmith Black Mambazo\">Ladysmith Black Mambazo</a>. These musicians performed on the subsequent concert tours, as did two other special guests, exiled South African music legends <a href=\"/wiki/Miriam_Makeba\" title=\"Miriam Makeba\">Miriam Makeba</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hugh_Masekela\" title=\"Hugh Masekela\">Hugh Masekela</a>. Simon received some criticism for his decision to record in South Africa (which was being economically boycotted by most Western nations for its <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"History of South Africa in the apartheid era\">Apartheid</a> policies).\n</p><p>Many other British and American artists contributed to the growing exploitation of \"world music\" during this period. After establishing his solo career in the late 1970s and early 1980s, former <a href=\"/wiki/Genesis_(band)\" title=\"Genesis (band)\">Genesis</a> lead singer <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Gabriel\" title=\"Peter Gabriel\">Peter Gabriel</a> was heavily influenced by African and Middle Eastern music; he became a key figure in the founding of the <a href=\"/wiki/WOMAD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"WOMAD\">WOMAD</a> organisation and later established his own \"world music\" label, <a href=\"/wiki/Real_World_Records\" title=\"Real World Records\">Real World</a>, which recorded and released successful albums by artists such as <a href=\"/wiki/Nusrat_Fateh_Ali_Kahn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn\">Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn</a>. Gabriel featured <a href=\"/wiki/Senegal\" title=\"Senegal\">Senegalese</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mbalax\" title=\"Mbalax\">mbalax</a></i> singer <a href=\"/wiki/Youssou_N%27Dour\" title=\"Youssou N&#39;Dour\">Youssou N'Dour</a> in a song on his hit album <i><a href=\"/wiki/So_(album)\" title=\"So (album)\">So</a></i> in 1986, paving the way for N'Dour's success as one of the biggest \"world music\" stars in the West. The later music of American <a href=\"/wiki/New_wave_music\" title=\"New wave music\">new wave</a> band <a href=\"/wiki/Talking_Heads\" title=\"Talking Heads\">Talking Heads</a> drew heavily on influences from African and Afro-Cuban music, notably on their album <i><a href=\"/wiki/Remain_in_Light\" title=\"Remain in Light\">Remain in Light</a></i>. The album was among several experimental <a href=\"/wiki/Post-punk\" title=\"Post-punk\">post-punk</a> recordings directly inspired by the <a href=\"/wiki/Afrobeat\" title=\"Afrobeat\">Afrobeat</a> of bandleader <a href=\"/wiki/Fela_Kuti\" title=\"Fela Kuti\">Fela Kuti</a>. Kuti's style itself began as a merger between the traditional styles of Kuti's home Nigeria and the <a href=\"/wiki/R%26B\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"R&amp;B\">R&amp;B</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Funk_music\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Funk music\">funk music</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/African_American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African American\">African American</a> artists like <a href=\"/wiki/James_Brown\" title=\"James Brown\">James Brown</a>. Many other African musicians, as well as those from other regions of the world, also drew influence from African American music, <a href=\"/wiki/Afro-Cuban_music\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Afro-Cuban music\">Afro-Cuban music</a> and other music from the West, ensuring that appropriation was continuous in many directions.\n</p><p>In the early 1980s, <a href=\"/wiki/Talking_Heads\" title=\"Talking Heads\">Talking Heads</a>' main writer and lead singer <a href=\"/wiki/David_Byrne_(musician)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"David Byrne (musician)\">David Byrne</a> also recorded a significant album called <i><a href=\"/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_(album)\" title=\"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)\">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a></i>, in collaboration with the band's producer of the time, <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Eno\" title=\"Brian Eno\">Brian Eno</a>. It was strongly influenced by musical styles outside the standard \"rock\" genre, employing African-style percussion and Afro-American funk rhythms. It is also notable as one of the first rock albums to make extensive use of the then novel technology of <a href=\"/wiki/Sampling_(music)\" title=\"Sampling (music)\">sampling</a>, incorporating vocal and musical samples from a wide range of sources including Arabic music. <a href=\"/wiki/Dub_music\" title=\"Dub music\">Dub music</a>, a more atmospheric offshoot of reggae, was also appropriated as a rhythmic and production influence by many electronic musicians and underground rock bands of the era, particularly in the United Kingdom, where reggae had achieved mainstream success.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Turntables_and_mixer.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Turntables_and_mixer.jpg/220px-Turntables_and_mixer.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"97\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Turntables_and_mixer.jpg/330px-Turntables_and_mixer.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Turntables_and_mixer.jpg/440px-Turntables_and_mixer.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1988\" data-file-height=\"881\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Turntables_and_mixer.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Turntables and mixer</div></div></div>\n<p>Sampling came into wider use among <a href=\"/wiki/Hip_hop_music\" title=\"Hip hop music\">hip hop</a> DJs, who appropriated rhythms, vocal parts or backing music from existing songs and pieces and combined and manipulated them, usually to serve as backing for <a href=\"/wiki/Rapping\" title=\"Rapping\">rap</a> vocals by an MC. Hip hop music began as an underground urban phenomenon in the 1970s, achieved mass popular success by the late 1980s and early 1990s, and by the end of the century it had become dominant over rock as the largest selling style of pop music and the primary musical export of the United States. The importance of musical appropriation to <a href=\"/wiki/Hip_hop_culture\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hip hop culture\">hip hop culture</a> has often been controversial, with many legal challenges to uncredited samples, and heavy criticism for instances where paid samples simply copied the sound of the original song (for example, <a href=\"/wiki/Puff_Daddy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puff Daddy\">Puff Daddy</a>'s sampling of a hit by The Police); however, many hip hop musicians and others have argued that sampling in hip hop is no different from the often uncredited appropriation white classical and rock musicians made of earlier black music styles such as jazz and blues, and that the DJ's creativity, as well as that of the rapper, allows the song to depart significantly from the original sources. Samples in hip hop are typically only brief snippets of the original, though they often utilize the most recognizable riff or hook of the song. Many hip hop songs sample other forms of African American music, as well. <a href=\"/wiki/Hank_Shocklee\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hank Shocklee\">Hank Shocklee</a> of the influential hip hop group <a href=\"/wiki/Public_Enemy_(band)\" title=\"Public Enemy (band)\">Public Enemy</a> has publicly debated the practice with funk bandleader <a href=\"/wiki/George_Clinton_(funk_musician)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George Clinton (funk musician)\">George Clinton</a>, who sued Public Enemy for sampling one of his songs without permission.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As of the 2000s, sampling has become a common form of appropriation in pop music, which has drawn increased influence from hip hop.
