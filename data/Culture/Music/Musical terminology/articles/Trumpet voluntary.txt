Trumpet Voluntary is the name given to several English keyboard pieces from the Baroque era. A trumpet voluntary is most commonly played on the organ using the trumpet stop, hence the name. Trumpet voluntaries usually consist of a slow introduction followed by a faster section with the right hand playing fanfare-like figures over a simple accompaniment in the left hand. In some instances, the Trumpet is replaced by the Cornet stop, or even a Flute stop. Echo effects are also used sometimes. The most celebrated trumpet voluntary is the Prince of Denmark's March, a composition by Jeremiah Clarke written circa. 1700.  It is properly a rondo for keyboard and was not originally called a trumpet voluntary. It is very popular as wedding music and was played at the 1981 wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer.    This piece,  particularly in a well-known arrangement for trumpet, string orchestra and organ by Sir Henry Wood,  was incorrectly attributed for years to Henry Purcell. It is now known to have been the work of Clarke.  The organist and composer John Stanley also wrote a number of trumpet voluntaries, as did Clarke's teacher John Blow.
