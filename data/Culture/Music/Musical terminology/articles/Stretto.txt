In music the Italian term stretto has two distinct meanings: The term stretto [ˈstretto] (plural: stretti) comes from the Italian past participle of stringere, and means "narrow", "tight", or "close".  It applies in a close succession of statements of the subject in a fugue, especially in the final section. In stretto, the subject is presented in one voice and then imitated in one or more other voices, with the imitation starting before the subject has finished. The subject is therefore superimposed upon itself contrapuntally. Stretto is typically employed near the end of a fugue, where the 'piling-up' of two or more temporally off-set statements of the subject ) signals the arrival of the fugue's conclusion in climactic fashion.  For example, J. S. Bach’s "Fugue in C major" from The Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1 (BWV 846) opens with an initial succession of statements of the subject, each at a distance of six beats: As the musical argument proceeds, the gap between the entries closes to two beats: In the final bars, the entries are even closer, with the upper two voices following at a distance of just one beat:The complete C major fugue may be heard here: . In other instances, stretto serves to display contrapuntal prowess, as in the Fugue No. 9 in E major, BWV 878, where Bach follows a traditional exposition (subject accompanied by countersubject) with a counterexposition in which the subject accompanies itself, in stretto, followed by the countersubject accompanying itself.
