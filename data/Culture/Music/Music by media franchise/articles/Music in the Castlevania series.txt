Most of Castlevania's music changes from game to game, but some themes recur often. These include Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears, and Beginning, three very popular tracks, first appearing in Castlevania, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, and Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse respectively. Other songs such as Dance of Illusions, Divine Bloodlines, and Poison Mind have been often recurring themes throughout the series. Several songs, including both Vampire Killer and Bloody Tears were also featured in the soundtracks of other Konami games, including Konami Wai Wai World, Contra: Hard Corps, and Konami Krazy Racers.
