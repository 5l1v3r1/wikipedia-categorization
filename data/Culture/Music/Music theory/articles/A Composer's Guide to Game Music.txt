Throughout the book’s fourteen chapters, Phillips draws from over a decade of experience as a composer in the video game industry in order to explore the creative and technical aspects of game music composition. The book investigates the specialized skills and training necessary for the pursuit of a game music career.  The structural requirements of game music are discussed, including the distinctive creative workflow involved in composing both interactive and linear music for games. Dynamic music constructs such as horizontal resequencing, vertical layering, MIDI, MOD, and generative music are explored.

The concluding chapter focuses on skills that help a game composer pursue a sustainable career, network in the video game industry, and build a resilient business. Phillips intersperses practical advice with personal memories and anecdotes gleaned from her years in the video game industry. She describes the impetus that caused her to pursue a game music career, her early struggles to obtain work, her breakthrough when hired to join the music composition team for God of War, and her experiences during the development of several other game projects.  Phillips also includes stories that explore the interpersonal dynamics within video game development and the gamer community, as well as the importance of game music fandom.  The book periodically turns its attention to scholarly topics, including the influence of music on the immersion phenomenon, the relationship between game music and the Demographic Game Design (DGD) model, and several discussions of the role played by traditional music theory in the creation of music for video games.
