Grand traité d’instrumentation et d’orchestration modernes, abbreviated in English as the Treatise on Instrumentation (sometimes Treatise on Orchestration) is a technical study of Western musical instruments, written by Hector Berlioz. It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date and had a chapter added by Berlioz on conducting in 1855. In 1904, Richard Strauss was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and included musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated Treatise with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.  The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948.  The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic range, tone quality, and limitations. An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the orchestra is also provided. The book also provides orchestral excerpts from classical scores to give examples of techniques discussed. These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while Mozart, Wagner, Beethoven, and Gluck are also frequently cited.  Many composers studied the work closely, such as Mussorgsky, Mahler, R. Strauss, and Rimsky-Korsakov.
