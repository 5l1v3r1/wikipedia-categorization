The memoir has received widely favorable reviews across several decades since its publication. In Rolling Stone in 2012, Rob Sheffield named it as one of the 25 best rock memoirs of all time, saying "her book, like her voice, is full of cocky, smart, self-aware humor."  Writing of the book's sections "describ[ing]" her time with The Beatles and the Stones, both in the U.K. and stateside," at NPR Alison Fensterstock says the book "deliver[s] a wild, funny, intimate and detailed account of a bunch of kids navigating fame and fun; they also describe, essentially, the singer's last flush of freedom before her relationship with Phil Spector really got bad."  The autobiography is excerpted in the 2013 Routledge anthology The Rock History Reader, which describes Be My Baby as "offering a little-seen window into the complex creative processes and inordinate power relationships behind the girl group phenomenon", in contrast to frequently trivializing depictions of the genre, or otherwise focused solely on the accomplishments of "their Svengali-like male producer or the song-writing teams that provided them with their hits."
