Mahoor Scores By Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh is a book by Saman Pourisa about an old notation of Persian Music. It was published in 2011 by Iranian Academy of Arts. The title of the book is inspired of the name of the original writer of the notation Mehdi Qoli Hedayat (Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh). It consists of 5 chapters, and was nominated for the Winter 2012 Iranâ€™s season National Book award. Persian (Iranian) music had been merely handed down orally from one generation to the other, and Abjad system of notation was only been used in musical theories, not for the practical use.  Modern staff notation entered to Iran about 1850AD. After that, some of Iranian musicians efforted to write the radif of Persian music using this method.  Among those musicians, two of them managed to write a comprehensive notation. The first one was Alinaghi Vaziri, but his recordings have been lost.   The second one which is actually the first preserved comprehensive notation of the radif has been written by Mehdi Qoli Hedayat known as Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh.
