  The Bishoprick Garland is a book compiled by Cuthbert Sharp which gives historical details of people, places and events from the Bishopric of Durham, and was published in 1834.  The Bishoprick Garland – (full title – "The Bishoprick Garland, Or a collection of Legends, Songs, Ballads, &c. Belonging to the County of Durham. [By Sir Cuthbert Sharpe]". London: Nichols, and Baldwin & Cradock. 1834) is a book of approximately 84 pages, giving historical details of people, places, songs, poems and writers pertaining to the North East of England, and in particular the County of Durham or more correctly termed Bishoprick of Durham (using an obsolete spelling of bishopric). It contains Geordie folk songs (or extracts from) and contains over 150 such song/poem lyric extracts on over 80 pages, and was published in 1834. It was edited by (Sir) Cuthbert Sharp. It is, as the title suggests (this meaning of garland being a collection of short literary pieces, such as ballads or poems; miscellany or anthology), a collection of historical facts from the area of the Bishopric of Durham. There are a surprising large number of entries and biographies, but disappointingly most of the songs/poetry are in the form of extracts, and some biographies are quite short. The front cover of the book is thus :- THE BISHOPRICK GARLAND,  OR A COLLECTION OF Legends, Songs, Ballads, &c.  BELONGING TO THE COUNTY OF DURHAM.  [By Sir Cuthbert Sharpe]  "That old and antique song we heard last night,  Methought, it did relieve my passion much,  More than light airs, and recollected terms,  Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times."  Twelfth Night.  LONDON:  NICHOLS, AND BALDWIN & CRADOCK.  1834 Are as below :-
