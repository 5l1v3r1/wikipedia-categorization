Musical Interpretation Research (MIR) is a series of monographs on the performance of classical music authored by Nils-Göran Areskoug (Sundin). The focus is on integrating the perspectives of the audience, artist and musicologist alike. The series covers aesthetic experience in music appreciation with the aim of bridging theory and practice of interpretive processes among performer and conductor, by providing in-depth analyses of masterworks, elaborating a methodology for researching interpretative cognition and designing a set of criteria for excellence in music performance. The publications, originating in a project pioneering new music research in the Nordic countries at Uppsala University and Stockholm School of Music, were funded initially by grants from The Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation and Torsten and Ragnar Söderberg Foundations jointly,  during 1979–1988. The MIR series was first presented in 1983 at University of California San Diego, La Jolla (lecture in the C.A.R.L. series) and on invitation by Professor David Lewin at a visit to the Music Department, Harvard University; then premiered at a lecture-performance event in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 10, 1984, according to the press release issued by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.  Subsequent research for the MIR series contains 'real world new music research', including dialogues with leading orchestra conductors (such as Sergiu Celibidache) and instrumentalists (pianists and violinists such as Hans Leygraf, Guido Agosti and Isaac Stern, respectively) along with studies of their rehearsal working processes.
