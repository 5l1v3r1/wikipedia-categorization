Sangita Makaranda is an ancient work on classical music written by Narada.  This work is a rare collection of definitions, descriptions and comments on all the essentials music by other ancient reputed authors from Bharata Muni to Sharangdeva. Its main feature is the treatiment of Ragas; categorizing them as male, female and neuter.  The treatise circa 1100 CE is the earliest text where rules similar to the current Hindustani classical music can be found. Narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the advent of changes as a result of Persian influences. It also hints on the uniqueness of the raga-nomenclaturing. On close study of it, one learns of three distinct stages on the nomenclaturing of the Indian ragas.
