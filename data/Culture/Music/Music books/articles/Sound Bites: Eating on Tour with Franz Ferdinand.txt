  Sound Bites: Eating on Tour with Franz Ferdinand is a book written by Alex Kapranos from the band Franz Ferdinand. It was published on 2 November 2006. In September 2005, whilst touring the world with Franz Ferdinand, Alex Kapranos had begun writing about what he ate in the various countries he had visited. The book concentrates heavily on where he eats and the people he eats with and the unusual flavours he tastes on the road. Much of the book is compiled from the column he had for The Guardian.  He said, In Scotland food has advanced and one of the biggest advances I think is that we've stopped looking outside for inspiration, I think maybe ten years ago the idea of good food had to be from somewhere else, had to be from Spain or France or Italy, whereas now we're realising we actually have some amazing stuff here.
