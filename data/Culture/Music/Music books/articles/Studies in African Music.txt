Studies in African Music is a 1959 book in two volumes by A.M. Jones. It is an in-depth analysis of the traditional music of the Ewe tribe. The work is divided into two volumes,   with the first volume being an analysis of the music presented in Volume II, and the second being full-score reproductions of the pieces in question. Steve Reich has listed this work as an influence on his music, particularly his "fooling around with tape loops, which [he] began to envision as little mechanized Africans [laughs]."   It is also cited extensively in Volume I of Gunther Schuller's (who introduced Reich to the work) History of Jazz.
