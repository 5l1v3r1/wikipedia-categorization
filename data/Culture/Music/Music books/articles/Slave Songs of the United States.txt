Slave Songs of the United States was a collection of African American music consisting of 136 songs. Published in 1867, it was the first, and most influential,   collection of spirituals to be published. The collectors of the songs were Northern abolitionists William Francis Allen, Lucy McKim Garrison, and Charles Pickard Ware.  It is a "milestone not just in African American music but in modern folk history".     It is also the first published collection of African-American music of any kind.  The making of the book is described by Samuel Charters, with an emphasis on the role of Lucy McKim Garrison.  A segment of History Detectives explored the book's history and significance.
