The Language of Music is a 1959 book about music by the critic and musician Deryck Cooke. Cooke expounds the expressionist theory of art, according to which beauty in music depends upon the accurate representation of the emotions of its creators. He matches various predicates with musical phrases or chordal sequences.  Cooke believes that memory for melodic contour and implicit harmony is allied to its affective character.  Robert M. Wallace reviewed The Language of Music in The Nation.  The Language of Music is an often cited representative of the expressionist theory of art.  No systematic experimental study of Cooke's theory has emerged relating it to musical education, but one pilot study showed that for 22 non-musician students, his characterizations of musical phrases were not experienced.  The philosopher Douglas Hofstadter writes in GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach (1979) that Cooke's book is, "A valuable start down what is sure to be a long hard road to understanding music and the human mind."
