A virtual piano is an application (software) designed to simulate playing a piano (or similar musical instruments, e.g. an organ, etc.) on a computer. The virtual piano is played using a keyboard and/or mouse and typically comes with many features found on a digital piano. Virtual player piano software can simultaneously play MIDI / score music files, highlight the piano keys corresponding to the notes and highlight the sheet music notes.
