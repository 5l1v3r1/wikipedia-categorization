This is a list of facial hairstyles. A "full beard" is one which shows full, unmodified growth on all available areas of the face and neck, including the moustache, chin, sideburns, and cheeks. The term five-o'clock shadow refers to stubble which is very short, apparently only a few hours' growth (as it would look at 5 PM after a man shaved that morning).
