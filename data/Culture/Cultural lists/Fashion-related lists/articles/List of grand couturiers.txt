A grand couturier is a member of the French Chambre syndicale de la haute couture, part of the  Fédération française de la couture, du prêt-à-porter des couturiers et des créateurs de mode. The official criteria, designed in 1945, originally implied presenting a certain number of original models each season, created by a permanent designer, handmade and bespoke models, a minimum number of people employed in the workshop and a minimum number of patterns "presented usually in Paris".  In 2001, these criteria have been relaxed. The number of models to be shown on a seasonal basis has been reduced from 50 to 25. Also, the official appellation can be granted by the Chambre syndicale de la haute couture even if one criterion is not met. Beside official members, the Chambre syndicale officially "invites" each season some "guests." They cannot use the term "haute couture" but only the term "couture" and can become grands couturiers after 2 years.  The Chambre syndicale also recognizes foreign grands couturiers who do not show in Paris, referring to them as "membres correspondants". Members at the end of 2016:
