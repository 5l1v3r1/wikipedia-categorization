In recent years, celebrities have signed contracts with perfume houses to associate their name with a signature scent, as a self-promotion campaign.  The scents are then marketed; the association with the celebrity's name usually being the selling point of the campaign. Such products generally do not have the longevity of classic perfumes. A notable exception is "Curious", endorsed by Britney Spears and made and marketed by Elizabeth Arden. It was released in 2004 and has gone on to sell over 500 million bottles worldwide,  "Fantasy" also being endorsed by Spears has had various remakes and have all sold substantial amounts[clarification needed] internationally. Most notable would be "White Diamonds", endorsed by Elizabeth Taylor and made and marketed by Elizabeth Arden. It was still the best-selling celebrity-endorsed perfume 20 years after its introduction in 1991.
