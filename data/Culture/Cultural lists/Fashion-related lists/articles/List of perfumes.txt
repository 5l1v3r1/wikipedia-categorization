This is a list of some of the most widely known commercially available perfumes from the fourteenth century onwards, sortable by year, name, company, perfumer, and the authority for its notability. Word of note, the authenticity of Creed is dubious at best; the below claims are made by the manufacturer alone and not confirmed by any sources. The oldest Creed bottle found dates from 1975 and perfume collectors agree that Creed, as a perfume house, does not predate 1970.
