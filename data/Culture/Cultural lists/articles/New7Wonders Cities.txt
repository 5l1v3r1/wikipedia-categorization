New7Wonders Cities is the third in a series of Internet-based polls operated by the New7Wonders Foundation. Founder-President, Bernard Weber, is a Swiss-born Canadian filmmaker, museum curator, aviator, and explorer. Based in San Francisco, United States, Weberâ€™s latest campaign to find the best cities in the world aimed to showcase the "cities that best represent the achievements and aspirations of our global urban civilization".  The global competition began[when?] with more than 1200 nominees from 220 countries. That list was reduced to 77, since there was a limit of one city per country. Then the 77 remaining cities were narrowed down by a panel of experts headed by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former director-general of UNESCO, to 28 suggestions. Following the announcement of the 28 finalists, the winning seven cities were chosen by voters from around the world.   Announced in 2011, it culminated in 2014 with the choice of the following 7 winning cities: Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, La Paz and Vigan.  It follows New7Wonders of the World and New7Wonders of Nature.
