Four Dharma Seals are the four characteristics which reflect true Buddhist teaching .   It is said that if a teaching contains the Four Dharma Seals then it can be considered Buddha Dharma.  although the Dharma Seals were all introduced after Gautama Buddha died.  The Four Seals can be variously translated as follows: ____________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________ As suffering is not an inherent aspect of existence  sometimes the second seal is omitted to make Three Dharma Seals.  However, when the second seal is taken to refer to existence contaminated by or influenced by the mental afflictions of ignorance, attachment, and anger and their conditioning actions (karma), this omission is not necessary.
