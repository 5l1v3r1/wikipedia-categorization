The Eight Northern Pueblos of New Mexico are Taos, Picuris, Santa Clara, Ohkay Owingeh (formerly San Juan), San Ildefonso, Namb√©, Pojoaque, and Tesuque.  Taos and Picuris are Tiwa-speaking pueblos; the rest speak Tewa.  Tiwa and Tewa are closely related languages of the Tanoan language family.  These pueblos make up the Eight Northern Pueblos Council, which sponsors craft fairs, advocates for the legal interests of the pueblos, etc. The Capital of the Eight Northern Pueblos is located in Ohkay Owingeh. Ohkay Owingeh was formerly known as San Juan, but changed to its original Tewa name in 2005.
