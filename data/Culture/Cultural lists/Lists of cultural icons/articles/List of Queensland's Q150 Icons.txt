Queensland's Q150 Icons is an official list of cultural icons compiled as part of Q150 (the 150th birthday of Queensland)  in 2009 by the Government of Queensland, Australia, that represent the people, places and events that are significant to Queensland. A list of 300 nominations for Queenlsand cultural icons was compiled by the Queensland Government, organised into 10 categories, and then the Queensland public were invited to vote to produce a final list of 150 icons. The final list was announced on 10 June 2009 by the Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, as part of Queensland's 150th birthday celebrations, a year-long event known as Q150.  This list is for people and organisations that are significant to Queensland.  Media related to Q150 Icons at Wikimedia Commons
