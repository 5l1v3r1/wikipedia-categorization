This page lists model car brand names past and present. The list is inclusive with slush mold, tinplate, pressed steel, diecast zamac, white metal, plastic and resin models and toys from all over the world. A few are even made of crystal, glass, wood, coal or other materials. Some of the brands here are more toy-like and others are purely for adult collectors. Some are from design model organizations and were never intended for sale. The price of some when new was less than 50 cents, while others cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Some are kits, some are kits that are specially handbuilt, but many are factory preassembled. Some are promotional in approach while others are solidly set in the retail realm. Some are stationary and do not roll while others roll or have friction or pull-back motors. At a different end of the spectrum, many are remote control. Models of all different sizes are represented, but the typical range is between 1:18 (about 11Â inches) to 1:87 (about an inch and a half).
