The UEFA European Football Championship has featured mascots since 1980. The very first mascot was Pinocchio, for the UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy.  Since then, every tournament has had a mascot except for the UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2012, that both had two. The mascots are mostly targeted at children, with cartoon shows and other merchandise released to coincide with the competition. There have been a total of 12 mascots (a duo was featured in both 2008 and 2012) in the nine tournaments since 1980: It wore football boots and held a football under its left arm. One of the most striking characteristics of Benelucky was its multicoloured lions mane which incorporated the colours of both the Belgian and Dutch national flags.
