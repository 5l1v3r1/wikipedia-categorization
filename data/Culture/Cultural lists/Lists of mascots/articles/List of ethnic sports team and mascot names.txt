The following is a list of sports team names and mascots derived from terms used to refer to specific ethnic groups, and words or iconography derived from different languages or traditions of these groups. Many such names are derived from ancestral groups of the same ethnicity as many of the current fans or players, such as the Boston Celtics (Irish) and the Minnesota Vikings (Scandinavian). Since ethnicity is defined by social identity there may be differences of opinion regarding membership in a particular group, and the appropriateness of the use of such references by others. Ethnicity was once distinct from race when the latter was thought to refer to biological distinctiveness as well as cultural differences. However, the biological basis for race has been largely abandoned by academic disciplines, leaving race as another social constructed concept for dividing people into groups based upon shared experience and history as well as physical characteristics. In the United States and Canada, many sports team names and mascots refer to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas.
