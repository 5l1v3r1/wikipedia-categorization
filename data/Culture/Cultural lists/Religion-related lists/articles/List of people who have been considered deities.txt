 This is a list of notable people who were considered deities by themselves or others. The Pauline epistles from the early second half of the 1st century CE offer the earliest references to Jesus as the Son of God (See Romans 1 for example). The First Council of Nicaea of 325 AD crystallized this notion in the Nicene creed and declared Jesus God Incarnate. Early Christian denominations with different christologies such as the Ebionites fell in popularity, and he is now considered divine in most Christian views of Jesus (God the Son in Trinitarian Christianity).
