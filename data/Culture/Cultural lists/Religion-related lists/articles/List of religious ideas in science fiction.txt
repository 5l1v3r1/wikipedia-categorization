Science fiction will sometimes address the topic of religion. Often religious themes are used to convey a broader message, but others confront the subject head-onâ€”contemplating, for example, how attitudes towards faith might shift in the wake of ever-advancing technological progress, or offering creative scientific explanations for the apparently mystical events related in religious texts (gods as aliens, prophets as time travelers, etc.).  As an exploratory medium, science fiction rarely takes religion at face value by simply accepting or rejecting it; when religious themes are presented, they tend to be investigated deeply. Some science fiction works portray invented religions, either placed into a contemporary Earth society (such as the Earthseed religion in Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower), or in the far future (as seen in Dune by Frank Herbert, with its Orange Catholic Bible).  Other works examine the role of existing religions in a futuristic or alternate society.  The classic Canticle for Leibowitz explores a world in which Catholicism is one of the few institutions to survive an apocalypse, and chronicles its slow re-achievement of prominence as civilisation returns. Christian science fiction also exists,  sometimes written as allegory for inspirational purposes.  Orson Scott Card has criticized the genre for oversimplifying religion, which he claims is always shown as "ridiculous and false".  Elizabeth Shaw: Before that thing ripped your head off, what did he say, David? David (AI): "Thing;" Dr. Shaw? Not too long ago, you considered them gods. Elizabeth Shaw: God never tried to kill me. So... what did he say? Where did he come from? David: There is no direct translation, but... Several of your ancient cultures had a word similar to it... "Paradise" Depictions of a fictional society dominated by a theocracy are a recurring theme in science fiction. Such depictions are mostly dystopian, in some cases humorous or satirical and rarely positive.
