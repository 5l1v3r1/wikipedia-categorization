U.S. government estimates indicate a population of approximately 30.4 million, with Sunni Muslims comprising 80 percent of the population, Shia Muslims making up about 19 percent, and other religious groups comprising less than 1 percent. The Ismailis, who self identify as a Shia denomination, comprise approximately 5 percent of the total population. Leaders of minority religious communities estimate there are 350 Sikh families and 30 Hindu families. Estimates of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed and Christian communities are less clear because neither group practices openly for fear of persecution. Reportedly, the Christian community is between 500 and 8,000 persons and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community is approximately 2,000 persons. In addition, there are small numbers of practitioners of other religions. There is one known Jewish citizen.\n<p>There are three active gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship) in Kabul and 10 in other parts of the country; there were 64 gurdwaras throughout the country before the mujahideen era, when many were seized. There are five remaining Hindu mandirs (temples) in three cities: two in Kabul, one of which shares a wall with a mosque, one in Jalalabad, one in Helmand, and one in Kandahar.\nAfghanistan\u2019s last known Jew maintains Kabul\u2019s sole synagogue, and there are also three defunct synagogues in Herat, which are no longer in use for lack of a Jewish community. There are no public Christian churches. Afghan Christians worship alone or in small congregations in private homes. Many Afghan Christians converted while living as refugees in third countries. Chapels and churches for noncitizens of various faiths are located on several military bases, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and at the Italian embassy in Kabul. Buddhist foreigners are free to worship in Hindu temples.\nFollowers of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith have practiced in the country for approximately 150 years. The community is predominantly based in Kabul, although some Bah\u00e1'\u00eds remain in Kandahar.\n</p>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Albania\" title=\"Albania\">Albania</a>\n</td>\n<td>Population 3,200,000, Christian 18.0%, Muslim 80.3%, Unaffiliated 1.4%, Other Religion 0.2%\n</td>\n<td>Muslim 56.7%, Roman Catholic 10%, Orthodox 6.8%, atheist 2.5%, Bektashi (a Sufi order) 2.1%, other 5.7%, unspecified 16.2%\n<p>note: all mosques and churches were closed in 1967 and religious observances prohibited; in November 1990, Albania began allowing private religious practice (2011 est.) \n</p>\n</td>\n<td>Bah\u00e1'\u00ed 0.2%, Christian 31.6%, Muslim 62.7%, Atheist 0.5%, Agnostic 5.0%\n</td>\n<td>According to the 2011 census, the population is 2.8 million.

For security reasons, due mainly to civil conflict, Christians concentrated in the cities of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran in the mid-1990s. According to Christian leaders, evangelical Christians, including Seventh-day Adventists, account for the largest number of Christians. Most evangelicals live in the Kabylie region. Next in size are the Methodists and members of other Protestant denominations, followed by Roman Catholics. A significant proportion of Christian foreign residents, whose numbers are difficult to estimate, are students and illegal immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa seeking to reach Europe. One religious leader estimates there are between 1,000 and 1,500 Egyptian Coptic Christians living in the country. There are no statistics on the number of religious conversions; however, according to the Minister of Religious Affairs, 150 foreigners converted to Islam and 50 citizens converted to Christianity in 2011. Christian leaders estimate that dozens of Algerians have converted to Christianity in the past two years. Officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments (MRA) report that there are approximately 16,000 mosques and 24,000 imams in Algeria.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/American_Samoa\" title=\"American Samoa\">American Samoa</a>\n</td>\n<td>Population 70,000, Christian 98.3%, Unaffiliated 0.7%, Buddhist 0.3%, Folk Religion 0.4%, Other Religion 0.3%\n</td>\n<td>Christian Congregationalist 50%, Roman Catholic 20%, Protestant and other 30%\n</td>\n<td>Bah\u00e1'\u00ed 0.3%, Buddhist 0.3%, Chinese Universalist 0.4%, Christian 98.3%, Agnostic 0.7%\n</td>\n<td>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Andorra\" title=\"Andorra\">Andorra</a>\n</td>\n<td>Population 80,000, Christian 89.5%, Muslim 0.8%, Unaffiliated 8.8%, Hindu 0.5%, Other Religion 0.1%, Jewish 0.3%\n</td>\n<td>Roman Catholic (predominant)\n</td>\n<td>Bah\u00e1'\u00ed 0.1%, Christian 92.2%, Hindu 0.5%, Jewish 0.3%, Muslim 1.0%, Atheist 0.4%, Agnostic 5.4%\n</td>\n<td>The government estimates the population to be 78,000.

For example, a 2007 survey conducted by East China Normal University states that 31.4 percent of citizens aged 16 and over, or 300 million people, are religious believers. The same survey estimates that there are 200 million Buddhists, Taoists, or worshippers of folk gods, although accurate estimates are difficult to make because many adherents practice exclusively at home.\n<p>According to the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA), there are more than 21 million Muslims in the country; unofficial estimates range as high as 50 million.

Religious demography statistics vary due to violence, internal migration, and governmental tracking capability. Numbers are often estimates from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community leaders, as the government has not yet taken a census.\n<p>According to 2010 government statistics, 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Shia Muslims, predominantly Arabs but including Turkmen, Faili (Shia) Kurds, and others, constitute 60 to 65 percent. Arab and Kurdish Sunni Muslims make up 32 to 37 percent of the population. From 18 to 20 percent are Sunni Kurds, 12 to 16 percent are Sunni Arabs, and the remaining 1 to 2 percent are Sunni Turkmen. Approximately 3 percent of the population is composed of Christians, Yezidis, Sabean-Mandaeans, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, Shabaks, Kakais (sometimes referred to as Ahl-e Haqq), and a very small number of Jews. Shia, although predominantly located in the south and east, are the majority in Baghdad and have communities in most parts of the country. Sunnis form the majority in the west, center, and the north of the country.\nChristian leaders estimate there are between 400,000 and 850,000 Christians. Approximately two-thirds are Chaldeans (an eastern rite of the Catholic Church), nearly one-fifth are Assyrians (Church of the East), and the remainder are Syriacs (Eastern Orthodox), Armenians (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox), Anglicans, and other Protestants. Evangelical Christians reportedly number approximately 5,000.\nYezidi leaders report that most of 500,000 to 700,000 Yezidis reside in the north, with 15 percent in Dahuk Province and the rest in Ninewa Province. Shabak leaders state there are 200,000 to 500,000 Shabaks, who reside mainly near Mosul in Ninewa Province. Estimates of the size of the Sabean-Mandaean community vary widely; according to Sabean-Mandaean leaders, about 4,000 remain in the country, generally along the Tigris and its tributaries. According to a leader in the Sabean-Mandaean community in Basrah, the Sabean-Mandaean population in Basrah has fallen dramatically over the last decade to an estimated 500-750 people. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed leadership report fewer than 2,000 members, spread throughout the country in small groups. The Kakai community around Kirkuk is estimated at 24,500 people. Fewer than 10 Jews reportedly reside in Baghdad, and there are unconfirmed reports that very small Jewish communities exist in other parts of the country.\nUNHCR reports that 82,260 Iraqi refugees and 218,800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) registered returns in 2012. The Ministry of Migration and Displacement (MOMD) reports that 304 of those returns were minorities. A majority of these refugees originally fled Iraq and sought asylum in Syria and Jordan due to sectarian violence triggered by the 2006 bombing of the Samara shrine. According to UNHCR\u2019s 2012 monitoring report, the majority of the Iraqi refugees who sought asylum in Iran were Shia families who had fled Iraq before 2003; those who returned in 2012 mostly settled in Najaf and Karbala.\nIn addition to Iraqi refugees, an estimated 1.1 million people of diverse religious backgrounds remain internally displaced due to sectarian violence between 2006 and 2008. The number of religious minorities internally displaced by violence remains uncertain because many stay with relatives and friends. An international NGO reports that 6,156 Christian families remain internally displaced in the country\u2019s northern governorates. The NGO largely attributes the high number to Iraqi Christians fleeing Syria where they had previously found refuge. The NGO attributes the decision of families to resettle in northern Iraq due to the area\u2019s relative security compared with elsewhere in the country. Humanitarian organizations working with displaced Christian families note that this vulnerable population is often unable to sell their homes at a reasonable price if they choose to migrate. They also face increasing rental costs in their area of displacement.\n</p>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Ireland\" title=\"Ireland\">Ireland</a>\n</td>\n<td>Population 4,470,000, Christian 92.0%, Muslim 1.1%, Unaffiliated 6.2%, Hindu 0.2%, Buddhist 0.2%, Folk Religion 0.2%\n</td>\n<td>Roman Catholic 84.7%, Church of Ireland 2.7%, other Christian 2.7%, Muslim 1.1%, other 1.7%, unspecified 1.5%, none 5.7% (2011 est.)\n</td>\n<td>Chinese Universalist 0.1%, Christian 94.1%, Hindu 0.1%, Muslim 0.7%, Atheist 0.3%, Agnostic 4.5%\n</td>\n<td>According to the 2011 census, the population is 4.6 million.
