This is an overview of festivals and observances held as part of the practice of Ryukyuan religion or tradition on the Ryukyu Islands. Unless otherwise noted, dates are according to the lunar calendar. The categories below ("January - May" and "June - December") are artificial, created for ease of article navigation. For calendars of rites particular to Miyako-jima, Yaeyama, and Ishigaki, see their respective pages. Viewing of or participation in rituals may be forbidden to outsiders, especially in rural areas which tend to be skeptical of the spiritual influence/significance of a stranger's presence. For example, Panari Island's Akamarakuromata Harvest Festival is open only to Panari people; no media or non-Panari are allowed.  The information in this article is drawn primarily from Festivals and Rituals of Okinawa, a site run by the Okinawa Prefectural government.
