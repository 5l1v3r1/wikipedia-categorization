The Seven Wonders of Poland (Polish: Siedem cud√≥w Polski) was a short list of cultural wonders located in Poland. The creation of the list was initiated by the leading Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita in a country-wide plebiscite held in September 2007.  The results were published in the following month.  Initially over 400 national monuments were selected as candidates by the magazine online-readers, however in the second round of selections a board of experts reduced the number to 27. The third and last round of public on-line voting started on 31 August 2007, to choose the top seven wonders. Results of the popular vote were announced on 21 September 2007.
