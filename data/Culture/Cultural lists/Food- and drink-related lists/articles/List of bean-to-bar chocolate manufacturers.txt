 This is a list of companies which produce chocolate, not chocolates.  That is, they process cocoa beans into a product in-house, rather than merely melting chocolate from another manufacturer. Some are large companies that own the entire process for economic reasons; others aim to control the whole process to improve quality, working conditions, or environmental impact.  (St. Louis, MO)
