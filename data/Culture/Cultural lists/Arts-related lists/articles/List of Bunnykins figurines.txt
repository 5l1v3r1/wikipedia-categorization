This is a list of Royal Doulton Bunnykins figurines.  Doulton & Co. (Royal Doulton) introduced the Bunnykins figurines in 1939 with six original Bunnykins figurines designed by Charles Noke based on illustrations by Sister Mary Barbara Bailey.  Shortly thereafter, and prior to World War II, Doulton & Co. discontinued their manufacture.  After Royal Doulton purchased the Beswick Pottery factory in 1969, Royal Doulton reintroduced the Bunnykins figurines.   After the closure of Royal Doulton factory in England in 2005, Bunnykins figurines are produced in Asia.  The Bunnykins figurines are in ascending order and include the name of the figurine, designer/modeler, date introduced, and the date discontinued.
