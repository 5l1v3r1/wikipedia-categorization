This is a list of symbols used in all branches of mathematics to express a formula or to represent a constant. A mathematical concept is independent of the symbol chosen to represent it. For many of the symbols below, the symbol is usually synonymous with the corresponding concept (ultimately an arbitrary choice made as a result of the cumulative history of mathematics), but in some situations, a different convention may be used. For example, depending on context, the triple bar "≡" may represent congruence or a definition. However, in mathematical logic, numerical equality is sometimes represented by "≡" instead of "=", with the latter representing equality of well-formed formulas. In short, convention dictates the meaning. Each symbol is shown both in HTML, whose display depends on the browser's access to an appropriate font installed on the particular device, and typeset as an image using TeX. This list is organized by symbol type and is intended to facilitate finding an unfamiliar symbol by its visual appearance. For a related list organized by mathematical topic, see List of mathematical symbols by subject. That list also includes LaTeX and HTML markup, and Unicode code points for each symbol (note that this article doesn't have the latter two, but they could certainly be added). There is a Wikibooks guide for using maths in LaTeX,  and a comprehensive LaTeX symbol list.  It is also possible to check to see if a Unicode code point is available as a LaTeX command, or vice versa.  Also note that where there is no LaTeX command natively available for a particular symbol (although there may be options that require adding packages), the symbol could be added via other options, such as setting the document up to support Unicode,  and entering the character in a variety of ways (e.g. copying and pasting, keyboard shortcuts, the \unicode{<insertcodepoint>} command ) as well as other options  and extensive additional information.   The contour integral can also frequently be found with a subscript capital letter C, ∮C, denoting that a closed loop integral is, in fact, around a contour C, or sometimes dually appropriately, a circle C. In representations of Gauss's Law, a subscript capital S, ∮S, is used to denote that the integration is over a closed surface.  then                                                 (                                                                .5                                                                                   7                                                          )                             =                                                −               5.5               ⋅               −               4.5               ⋅               −               3.5               ⋅               −               2.5               ⋅               −               1.5               ⋅               −               .5               ⋅               .5                                         1               ⋅               2               ⋅               3               ⋅               4               ⋅               5               ⋅               6               ⋅               7                                          =                                 33             2048                                                       {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}.5\\7\end{pmatrix}}={\frac {-5.5\cdot -4.5\cdot -3.5\cdot -2.5\cdot -1.5\cdot -.5\cdot .5}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 6\cdot 7}}={\frac {33}{2048}}\,\!}     (when u is positive integer) means reverse or rising binomial coefficient. Then   = {..., −8, −3, 2, 7, ...}. (Note that the notation (a,b) is ambiguous: it could be an ordered pair or an open interval. Set theorists and computer scientists often use angle brackets ⟨ ⟩ instead of parentheses.) (a, b, c) is an ordered triple (or 3-tuple). ( ) is the empty tuple (or 0-tuple). (Note that the notation (a,b) is ambiguous: it could be an ordered pair or an open interval. The notation ]a,b[ can be used instead.) (0, +∞) equals the set of positive real numbers. we can define the structure functions Sq(                        τ                 {\displaystyle \tau }    ): Note that the notation ⟨u, v⟩ may be ambiguous: it could mean the inner product or the linear span. The span of S may also be written as Sp(S).

ℤ≥ means {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} . ℤ* is used by some authors to mean {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}  and others to mean {... -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, ... }   . In mathematics written in Persian or Arabic, some symbols may be reversed to make right-to-left writing and reading easier.
