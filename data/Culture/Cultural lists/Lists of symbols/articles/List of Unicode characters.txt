This is a list of Unicode characters. As of version 11.0, Unicode contains a repertoire of over 137,000 characters covering 146 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. As it is not technically possible to list all of these characters in a single Wikipedia page, this list is limited to a subset of the most important characters for English-language readers, with links to other pages which list the supplementary characters. This page includes the 1062 characters in the Multilingual European Character Set 2 (MES-2) subset, and some additional related characters. An HTML or XML numeric character reference refers to a character by its Universal Character Set/Unicode code point, and uses the format or where nnnn is the code point in decimal form, and hhhh is the code point in hexadecimal form. The x must be lowercase in XML documents. The nnnn or hhhh may be any number of digits and may include leading zeros. The hhhh may mix uppercase and lowercase, though uppercase is the usual style. In contrast, a character entity reference refers to a character by the name of an entity which has the desired character as its replacement text. The entity must either be predefined (built into the markup language) or explicitly declared in a Document Type Definition (DTD). The format is the same as for any entity reference: where name is the case-sensitive name of the entity. The semicolon is required. 65 characters, including DEL but not SP. All belong to the common script. The Unicode Standard (version 7.0) classifies 1,338 characters as belonging to the Latin script. 95 characters; the 52 alphabet characters belong to the Latin script. The remaining 43 belong to the common script. The 33 characters classified as ASCII Punctuation & Symbols are also sometimes referred to as ASCII special characters.
