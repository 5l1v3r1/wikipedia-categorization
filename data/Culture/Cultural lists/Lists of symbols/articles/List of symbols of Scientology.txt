This is a list of the symbols of Scientology, the Church of Scientology, and related organizations. Operating Thetans are said to be in a spiritual state above Clear.  Scientologists say that one who has achieved the state of Operating Thetan is essentially a being able to operate free of the encumbrances of the material universe, as outlined in Scientology 8-8008. The symbol for the Church of Spiritual Technology is engraved into the Earth's surface in Scientology's Trementina Base, in a mountainous region of New Mexico,  large enough to be seen from a high altitude. All official symbols of Scientology are trademarks held by the Religious Technology Center (RTC). They are said by the center to be used "on Scientology religious materials to signify their authenticity ... and provide a legal mechanism to ensure the spiritual technologies are orthodox and ministered according to Mr. Hubbard's Scripture. These marks also provide the means to prevent anyone from engaging in some distorted use of Mr. Hubbard's writings, thereby ensuring the purity of the religion for all eternity."
