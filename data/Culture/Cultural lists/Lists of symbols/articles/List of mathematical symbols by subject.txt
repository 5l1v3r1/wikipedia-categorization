This list of mathematical symbols by subject shows a selection of the most common symbols that are used in modern mathematical notation within formulas, grouped by mathematical topic. As it is virtually impossible to list all the symbols ever used in mathematics, only those symbols which occur often in mathematics or mathematics education are included. Many of the characters are standardized, for example in DIN 1302 General mathematical symbols or DIN EN ISO 80000-2 Quantities and units – Part 2: Mathematical signs for science and technology. The following list is largely limited to non-alphanumeric characters. It is divided by areas of mathematics and grouped within sub-regions. Some symbols have a different meaning depending on the context and appear accordingly several times in the list. Further information on the symbols and their meaning can be found in the respective linked articles. The following information is provided for each mathematical symbol: Note: The symbols                         ⊂                 {\displaystyle \subset }     and                         ⊃                 {\displaystyle \supset }     are used inconsistently and often do not exclude the equality of the two quantities. Note: the power function is not represented by its own icon, but by the positioning of the exponent as a superscript. See also: mathematical constant for symbols of additional mathematical constants.
