   Many fandoms have their own nicknames that distinguish them from other fan communities. The nicknames are popular with singers, music bands, films, television shows, books, games, sports teams, and celebrities. Some of the terms are coined by fans while others are created by celebrities themselves. The trend of giving a name to a fandom became more popular in the beginning of the 21st century with the invention of social media, although such nicknames were used much earlier. Some people consider the Sherlockians (fans of Sherlock Holmes) and Beatlemaniacs (fans of The Beatles) to be some of the oldest known examples.
