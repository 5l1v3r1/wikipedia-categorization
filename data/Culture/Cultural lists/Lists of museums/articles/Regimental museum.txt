In countries whose armies are organised on a regimental basis, such as the army of the United Kingdom, a regimental museum is a military museum dedicated to the history of a specific army regiment. In addition to those listed below, many more units (including Yeomanry, Militia and Volunteer regiments) have museums or exhibition spaces, some open only by appointment; for fuller information see the Ogilby Trust website (below).
