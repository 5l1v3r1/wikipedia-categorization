 The following is a list of Christmas television specials and miniseries, as well as Christmas-themed episodes of regular television series. Notes: Prior to 1990, RÚV did not produce and air any Christmas calender's series. In 1994, 20010-2011, 2013-present RÚV did only air Scandinavian produced Christmas calender series. Note: All Rankin/Bass Christmas specials were written and designed in the United States, and then animated in Japan; both in the stop-motion "Animagic" and traditional animation. Some of the holiday classics aired on television networks and were also available on VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs in Japan every Christmas season, like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, which aired on the NHK network in 1967.
