  Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The show has been a large influence in the media since its inception in 1963. Along with the regular series, special Christmas episodes have also been broadcast since the programme's revival in 2005. During the first run of the programme (1963 to 1989), while not a Christmas special, one episode aired on Christmas Day: "The Feast of Steven", the seventh episode of the twelve-part serial The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired on 25 December 1965. The episode, currently missing from the BBC archive, was a comic interlude in the style of a pantomime, in the middle of an otherwise epic adventure.  In its final scene the Doctor and his companions celebrated Christmas with a toast; the episode ended with the Doctor (William Hartnell) turning to camera (breaking the fourth wall) and saying, "Incidentally, a happy Christmas to all of you at home."  ^† : Episode is missing The Christmas specials between "The Christmas Invasion" and "Last Christmas" were released as a DVD and Blu-ray boxset titled Doctor Who – The 10 Christmas Specials on 19 October 2015.
