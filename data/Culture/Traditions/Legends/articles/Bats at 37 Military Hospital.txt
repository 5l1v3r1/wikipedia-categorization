The bats at the 37 military hospital are a colony of an estimated 1 million  straw-coloured fruit bats living in the 37 Military Hospital area of Accra, the capital of Ghana. A local legend surrounds this group of animals, saying that a long time ago, a chief from a village in eastern Ghana Kibi  was admitted to the hospital accompanied by megabats. He died but the bats are still waiting for him to come home.
