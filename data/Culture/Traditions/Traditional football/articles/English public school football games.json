First, the evidence suggests that, during the 16th century, they transformed the popular, but violent and chaotic, \"<a href=\"/wiki/Mob_football\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mob football\">mob football</a>\" into organised team sports that were beneficial to schoolboys. Second, many early references to football in literature were recorded by people who had studied at these schools, showing they were familiar with the game. Finally, in the 19th century, former <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">English</a> public school boys, in a meeting organised by two old-boys of <a href=\"/wiki/Shrewsbury_School\" title=\"Shrewsbury School\">Shrewsbury</a>, were the first to write down formal codes of rules in order to enable matches to be played between different schools.

In later centuries there is no doubt that football games played at school were taken by former students to university. The earliest reference to ball games at English Universities comes from 1303 when \"Thomas of <a href=\"/wiki/Salisbury\" title=\"Salisbury\">Salisbury</a>, a student of <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oxford University\">Oxford University</a>, found his brother Adam dead, and it was alleged that he was killed by Irish students, whilst playing the ball in the High Street towards Eastgate\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-marples_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-marples-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\"><span title=\"This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears.

Horman had been headmaster at <a href=\"/wiki/Eton_College\" title=\"Eton College\">Eton</a> (1485/6\u20131494/5) and <a href=\"/wiki/Winchester_College\" title=\"Winchester College\">Winchester College</a>. His <a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a> textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\", a rough translation of the original Latin \"Lusui erit follis pugillari spiritu tumens\", which <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Peabody_Magoun\" title=\"Francis Peabody Magoun\">Francis Peabody Magoun</a> translated as \"In sport we shall have a ball inflated with air to kick\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Even as early as 1519, Horman shows us that he was well aware of the value of sports to children's education and the need to temper their enthusiasm in order not to affect their studies: \"There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren, leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none, or waxe slacke if they haue to many\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-zen_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-zen-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This conflict was discussed further by <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Johnson_(physician)\" title=\"Christopher Johnson (physician)\">Christopher Johnson</a> who was headmaster at Winchester in the 1560s, but clearly remained a dilemma for public school masters right up to modern times.  Christopher Johnson mentions the activities which he enjoyed when a scholar at Winchester himself between 1549 and 1553. He says that he: \"cared much more for balls, quoits and tops than he did for books and school\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-zen_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-zen-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Sir Henry Wotton who was at Winchester in the 1560s under Christopher Johnson makes reference to the English word \"football\" in one of his poems.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Mulcaster\" title=\"Richard Mulcaster\">Richard Mulcaster</a>, a former student at <a href=\"/wiki/Eton_College\" title=\"Eton College\">Eton College</a> and later headmaster at <a href=\"/wiki/Merchant_Taylors%27_School,_Northwood\" title=\"Merchant Taylors&#39; School, Northwood\">Merchant Taylors' School</a> (1561) and <a href=\"/wiki/St_Paul%27s_School_(London)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St Paul&#39;s School (London)\">St Paul's School</a> (1596) has been described as \"the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> He tells us that towards the end of the sixteenth century football in <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">England</a> had grown to \"greatnes ... [and was] much used ... in all places\". Mulcaster's unique contribution is not only referring to \"footeball\" by its correct English name but also providing the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster confirms that his was a game closer to modern football by differentiating it from games involving other parts of the body, namely \"the hand ball\" and \"the armeball\". He referred to the many benefits of his \"footeball\" in his personal publication of 1581 in English entitled 'Positions Wherein Those Primitive Circumstances Be Examined, Which Are Necessarie for the Training up of Children'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> He states that football had positive educational value and it promoted health and strength. Mulcaster's discussion on the merits of football was the first to refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), the benefits of a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\".  Although it is not explicitly mentioned, passing of the ball is strongly implied by the reference to different positions on the field. Mulcaster describes a game for small teams that is organised under the auspices of a referee (and is therefore clear evidence that his game had evolved from disordered and violent \"mob\" football): \"Some smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one another so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges\".  As a result of his enthusiasm for the sport and his accurate description of the modern game Richard Mulcaster is considered the father of early modern football.\n</p><p>In 1591, it is clear that ball games were being played at <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lyon%27s_Free_Grammar_School&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lyon&#39;s Free Grammar School (page does not exist)\">Lyon's Free Grammar School</a> in Harrow'. He says that \"upon Thursday only sometimes when the weather is fine, and upon Saturday, or half-holidays after evening prayer. And their play shall be to drive a top, to toss a handball, to run, or to shoot\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-zen_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-zen-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"17th_century\">17th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=English_public_school_football_games&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: 17th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There is evidence that team kicking games were being played in schools in other parts of Britain by the mid 17th century. In 1633 (cited in other references as 1636), David Wedderburn, a teacher from <a href=\"/wiki/Aberdeen\" title=\"Aberdeen\">Aberdeen</a>, mentioned elements of football games in a short Latin textbook called the \"Vocabula\". Wedderburn cites phrases that school boys might use during their game.  The text below is given in two forms: <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Peabody_Magoun\" title=\"Francis Peabody Magoun\">Francis Peabody Magoun</a>'s 1938 original (and more literal) translation and then Marples 1956 version.  It is noteworthy that Magoun does not use the word to \"pass\".\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let us choose sides//Let\u2019s pick sides.<br />\npick your man first//You have first choice.<br />\nThose on our side come here//Those who are on our side, come over here.<br />\nHow many are against us?/How many are there in the other team?<br />\nKick out the ball so that we may begin the game/Kick off, so that we can begin the match.<br />\nCome, kick it here/Pass it here.<br />\nYou keep the goal/You keep goal.<br />\nSnatch the ball from that fellow if you can/Get hold of the ball before he does, if you can manage it.<br />\nCome, throw yourself against him/Go on, intercept him.<br />\nRun at him/Charge him.<br />\nKick the ball back/Pass the ball back.<br />\nWell done.  You aren't doing anything/Well done! You\u2019re slacking.<br />\nTo make a goal/To score a goal.<br />\nThis is the first goal, this the second, this the third/This is the second, this the third goal.<br />\nDrive that man back/Keep him out, otherwise the other side wins.<br />\nThe opponents are, moreover, coming out on top, If you don't look out, he will make a goal/If you\u2019re not careful, he\u2019ll score in a minute.<br />\nUnless we play better, we'll be done for/If we don\u2019t play better, we\u2019re done for.<br />\nAh, victory is in your hands/Hi!

We still have the better chance/Come on, help me. We still have a better side?\"\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The original Latin is cited by Magoun (1938): Sortiamur partes; tu primum socium dilige; Qui sunt nostrarum partium huc se recipient; Quot nobis adversantur; Excute pilam ut ineamus certamen; Age, huc percute; Tu tuere metum; Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere; Age objice te illi; Occurre illi; Repercute pilam; Egregie. Nihil agis; Transmittere metum pila; Hic primus est transmissus. Hic secundus, hic tertius est transmissus; Repelle eum, alioqui, adversarii evadunt superiores; Nisi cavesjam occupabit metam; Ni melius a nobis ludatur, de nobis actum est.  Eia penes vos victoria est; Io triumphe. Est pilae doctissimus; Asque eo fuisset, reportassimus vicoriam; Age, subservi mihi; Adhuc potiores habemus, scilicet partes)\n</p><p>Wedderburn's Latin book is an early reference to what has been rendered in the second version of the translation as \"passing\" the ball. The word \"passing\" is not used explicitly:  the original Latin states \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and \"repercute pilam\" (strike it back - or again). The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a <a href=\"/wiki/Ancient_Rome\" title=\"Ancient Rome\">Roman</a> chariot race.   The sentence given as \"intercept him\" in the second translation above is translated in the original as \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi). There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" or to \"snatch\" it (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the \"charging\" and pushing/holding of opposing players (\"Keep him out\" above, \"drive that man back\" in the original, \"repelle eum\" in original Latin). This game is likely to have been similar to rugby football. Contrary to press reports in 2006 there is no reference to game rules, marking players, team formations, or forward passing. This text was described in 2006 as \"an amazing new discovery\" but has actually been well documented in football history literature since the early twentieth century and available on the internet since at least 2000.  It confirms that organised football games in the seventeenth century were not confined to English Schools. (An earlier description of goals, defending goals and passing the ball comes from Carew's account of <a href=\"/wiki/Cornish_Hurling\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cornish Hurling\">Cornish Hurling</a>).\n</p><p>The next specific mention of football at public schools can be found in a Latin poem by Robert Matthew, a <a href=\"/wiki/Winchester\" title=\"Winchester\">Winchester</a> scholar from 1643 to 1647. He describes how \"...we may play quoits, or hand-ball, or bat-and-ball, or football; these games are innocent and lawful. ..\".  That football at winchester was \"innocent and lawful\" at this time is very noteworthy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This is strongly supportive of the fact that by the mid-seventeenth century football and other ball games in English public schools had been tamed. <i>Nugae Etonenses</i> (1766) by T. Frankland also mentions the \"Football Fields\" at Eton.\n</p><p>A more detailed description of football is given in <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Willughby\" title=\"Francis Willughby\">Francis Willughby</a>'s Book of Sports,<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> written in about 1660.  This account is particularly noteworthy as he refers to football by its correct name and is the first to describe the following:  goals and a pitch (\"a close that has a gate at either end.  The gates are called Goals\"), tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"), scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\"). He is the first to describe a law of football:  \"They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball\". His account of the ball itself is also very informative:  \"They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in\".  He adds: \"The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still\".   His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch. Willughby's link with the public school system was that he had studied at sutton coldfield school, was a student at <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_university\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cambridge university\">Cambridge university</a> and frequented the <a href=\"/wiki/Bodleian_library\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bodleian library\">Bodleian library</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_university\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oxford university\">Oxford university</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"18th_century\">18th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=English_public_school_football_games&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: 18th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1710, football was recorded as being played on the green at <a href=\"/wiki/Westminster_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Westminster school\">Westminster school</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"19th_century\">19th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=English_public_school_football_games&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: 19th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The earliest versions of any football code rules were written down in the early nineteenth century, most notably by <a href=\"/wiki/Eton_College\" title=\"Eton College\">Eton College</a> (1815)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Richard_William_Cox_2002_243_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Richard_William_Cox_2002_243-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\nand <a href=\"/wiki/Aldenham_School\" title=\"Aldenham School\">Aldenham School</a> (1825).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Richard_William_Cox_2002_243_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Richard_William_Cox_2002_243-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By the early 19th century, (before the <a href=\"/wiki/Factory_Act_1850\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Factory Act 1850\">Factory Act of 1850</a>), most <a href=\"/wiki/Working_class\" title=\"Working class\">working class</a> people in <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland\" title=\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\">Britain</a> had to work six days a week, often for more than twelve hours a day.

For example, two clubs which claim to be the world's first and/or oldest football club, in the sense of one which is not part of a school or university, are both strongholds of rugby football: the <a href=\"/wiki/Barnes_Football_Club\" title=\"Barnes Football Club\">Barnes Club</a>, said to have been founded in 1839, and <a href=\"/wiki/Guy%27s_Hospital_Football_Club\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Guy&#39;s Hospital Football Club\">Guy's Hospital Football Club</a>, reportedly founded in 1843.

Soon, a number of schools of thought about how football should be played emerged. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, <a href=\"/wiki/Marlborough_College\" title=\"Marlborough College\">Marlborough</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cheltenham_School\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cheltenham School\">Cheltenham</a>).  \n</p><p>Others preferred a game where dribbling the ball was promoted (in particular <a href=\"/wiki/Eton_College\" title=\"Eton College\">Eton</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shrewsbury_School\" title=\"Shrewsbury School\">Shrewsbury</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Harrow_School\" title=\"Harrow School\">Harrow</a>).

At Charterhouse and Westminster, both schools at the time played on restricted sites in London, the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the cloisters making the rough and tumble of the handling game difficult.  Most of the founding members of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Football_Association\" title=\"The Football Association\">The Football Association</a> in 1863 were former schoolboys at these public schools.
