McIsaac produced rough <a href=\"/wiki/Storyboard\" title=\"Storyboard\">storyboard</a> sketches and calculated timings to provide the shooting script.

Shooting took place on six days during the school Easter holiday break in 1950 in local locations including streets and backgreens (communal drying areas) off <a href=\"/wiki/Easter_Road,_Edinburgh\" title=\"Easter Road, Edinburgh\">Easter Road</a>, and streets around the <a href=\"/wiki/Calton_Hill\" title=\"Calton Hill\">Calton Hill</a> and in the <a href=\"/wiki/Canongate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Canongate\">Canongate</a>, West Bow and the <a href=\"/wiki/Grassmarket\" title=\"Grassmarket\">Grassmarket</a>. The Shore, <a href=\"/wiki/Leith\" title=\"Leith\">Leith</a> appears briefly at the end of the film.\n</p><p>Most of the games revolve around the themes of love and death (courtship and bereavement), expressed in rhymes passed down the generations by word of mouth. Notes accompanying the issue of the film on video in 1993 explain that \"The rhymes\u2026vary from street to street and change from day to day. (\u2026) What is old seldom dies yet there is always something new appearing. The word is accepted and the poetry is kept alive. No one asks: What does that mean?\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cityof_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cityof-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The songs in the film are accompanied by various skipping and ball games.\n</p><p>The film is subtitled <i>A Merry-Ma Tanzie</i> which is a traditional Scottish wedding game sung to the same tune as <i>Here we go round the Mulberry Bush</i>. Girls join hands in a circle and, at a chosen point, fall to the ground. One player, usually chosen for her slowness in falling, leaves the circle and confides the name of the one she intends to marry to a close friend. The circle members sing verses to guess his name and, on approval, the girl and her friend, as a bridal couple, are welcomed into the circle through \"high arches\" and kiss. The first recorded mention of the game occurs in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Blackwood%27s_Magazine\" title=\"Blackwood&#39;s Magazine\">Blackwood's Magazine</a></i> published in Edinburgh in August 1821.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In one variation girls form a circle with a player in the middle covering her face while the circle moves slowly round her. The circle sing verses with the girl's name and try to guess her suitor's name. If her true love is revealed, the girl has to show her face and choose a partner. The circle then opens as a gate to allow the bridal couple to pass through. In the variation shown in the film (<i>The Golden City</i>) friends of the girl inside the circle quickly confide with each other to determine her intended sweetheart and name him in the song. She then chooses a partner from the circle in his place to form the bridal couple.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG/220px-Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG/330px-Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG/440px-Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"2560\" data-file-height=\"1920\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Crawford_Bridge_from_Bothwell_Street.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Crawford Bridge (named after a city councillor) is a footbridge over a now rarely used railway line.

The 1950s were a time when the Edinburgh Corporation (town council) had designated many inner-city streets \"children's play areas\", requesting vehicle drivers to avoid them from the end of the school day until sunset.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Also, as James Ritchie pointed out in the decade after the film, <a href=\"/wiki/Slum_clearance\" title=\"Slum clearance\">slum clearance</a> soon transformed the surroundings in which most children grew up: \"The tenement-factory conglomeration produced by accident a playing environment of exciting variety: and unless present-day architecture incorporates such ideas, it's dead from the start. The houses in modern schemes are so dull and unmysterious. They have no 'Unknown Corners' such as haunted painters like <a href=\"/wiki/James_Pryde\" title=\"James Pryde\">James Pryde</a>...\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The film won critical acclaim when it was shown at the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Union_Internationale_du_Cin%C3%A9ma&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Union Internationale du Cin\u00e9ma (page does not exist)\">UNICA</a> Festival in Barcelona Film Festival in 1952.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ssa.nls.uk_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ssa.nls.uk-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/John_Grierson\" title=\"John Grierson\">John Grierson</a>, \"father of the documentary\", wrote that it was \"the best amateur film I ever saw... The reason for it being wonderful was quite simple. Somebody loved something and conveyed it.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>James Ritchie later wrote two short books about children's songs, <i>The Singing Street</i> (1964) and <i>Golden City</i> (1965). In the latter he described how his interest in the children's games had been first aroused,\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>One morning in Norton Park School, I was teaching science in Leith [the part of the school inside Leith's boundary], and finding the response on this occasion not very lively, I asked, \"Then what do you like doing?\" The class answered: \"We like playing games.\" \"What games?\" They told me, and I began then and there to write them down. In the afternoon whilst teaching mathematics in Edinburgh [the part of the school inside Edinburgh's boundary], I also found time to jot down some more games. From then on I collected every sort of rhyme or playing jingle, and my collection grew.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The US folk-song collector <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Lomax\" title=\"Alan Lomax\">Alan Lomax</a> made audio recordings of the Norton Park pupils during the first of his three field trips to Scotland in 1951, 1953 and 1957. These can be heard on the still widely available CD entitled <i>Singing in the Streets: Scottish Children\u2019s Songs</i>. Lomax was a major inspiration behind the founding of the <a href=\"/wiki/School_of_Scottish_Studies\" title=\"School of Scottish Studies\">School of Scottish Studies</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh\" title=\"University of Edinburgh\">Edinburgh University</a> in the same year the film was first shown.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One scene, where a group of boys are singing on a flight of steps, features an onlooker wearing a hat and gloves and holding a walking stick.
