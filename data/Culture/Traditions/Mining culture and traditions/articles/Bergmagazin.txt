A Bergmagazin is a building that served as a granary for miners and the population of mining towns in German-speaking Europe. The construction of Bergmagazins in the Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony grew rapidly from 1806 at the suggestion of senior mining official (Oberberghauptmann), Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich von Trebra. As a result of the great famines in the upper Ore Mountains at the end of the 18th century caused by several poor harvests, Trebra recommended the construction of multi-storey, stone Bermagazin buildings where grain could be deposited after harvesting and stored for several months or even years.
