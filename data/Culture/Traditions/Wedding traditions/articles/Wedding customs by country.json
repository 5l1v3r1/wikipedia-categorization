Wedding procedure starts with the groom's side sending elders (Shimagle) who then request a union between the parties. The elders discuss a dowry (\u1327\u120e\u123d) and verify that the intended bride and groom are not relatives by checking their lineage a minimum of seven generations. After a dowry is agreed upon and it has been determined that there is no relationship between the intended bride and groom, the wedding is announced and the families begin preparations for a church/mosque ceremony and a mels/melsi ceremony.   On the wedding day the groom and groomsmen (\u121a\u12dc) get ready at the groom's house early in the morning and proceed to the bride's parents house to begin the wedding ceremonies. At the bride's parent's house, the bride gets ready and is seated awaiting the groom's arrival.  As the groom and his wedding party arrive, the bride's family and friends ceremonially block the entrance to the house. The groomsmen have to either serenade or bribe their way into the house so that the groom can take the bride with him. Additionally, the best man holds perfume and sprays it everywhere inside the bride's family house. After this ceremony, the groom retrieves his bride and they along with a procession go to a church/mosque to take their wedding vows.\n</p><p>After the religious ceremony, the wedding procession moves to a park/garden where lunch is served to guests.  Afterwards, the wedding party typically takes pictures while guests make their way to the reception.  At the reception, depending on the family's ethnic group there are several traditional dances performed.  Ethiopian weddings typically serve Ethiopian food and live music and the party typically goes on into the early morning.  To close the wedding ceremony, elders are seated at the exit of the venue and the bride and groom along with the wedding party bow and kiss the knees of the elders as they exit the venue.  This is typically the conclusion the first day of a typical Ethiopian wedding.\n</p><p>During the mels/i ceremony is dependent on the ethnic heritage of the family but it is typically smaller than the first ceremony and a time for close friends and family to spend some time with each other and continue to celebrate the newly married couple.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kikuyu\">Kikuyu</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Kikuyu\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Customarily, marriage proceedings often begin with the man proposing to the woman. Upon her acceptance the man then calls for a meeting with his clan elders who largely consist of extended elderly family members. A delegation carrying small gifts is then sent to the woman's home to meet with her clan elders. Deliberations on bride price actually begin on a later date and these are strictly conducted by the older men only. Upon completion of these negotiations, a wedding date is set, with the elders having provided an acceptable percentage of the full dowry. The rest of the dowry is expected later. No request is made for it, but the young man is expected to remember to finish his payment and failure to do so spells dishonor for that family.\n</p><p>The wedding day begins with a convoy from the grooms family that heads to the girl's home to collect her. However, the convoy is not immediately let into the girl's homestead. Rather the bride's gate is locked and song and dance begins as a cover for negotiations. Various goods may be asked of the groom and he willingly obliges to the demands after which he is let into the compound.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nigeria\">Nigeria</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Nigeria\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Generally, there are three types of weddings in Nigeria: traditional weddings, church weddings and court weddings. The civil marriage takes place at a registry, and then the religious ceremony follows. Finally it\u2019s the traditional Nigerian wedding ceremony. Many couples choose to do all three, depending on their financial situation. Nigerian weddings are normally characterised by lots of colours.\n</p><p>In traditional weddings, customs vary slightly from one part of Nigeria to the other. In Western parts it is called the engagement ceremony. Officials and elders sip wine while they invite the couple in for introductions and negotiations, and presentation of the bride price which consists mainly of gifts of shoes, textiles, jewelry and bags.\n</p><p>In Eastern parts of the country it is very much the same. Elders from both families retreat into an inner room to negotiate on the bride price. When concluded, the gifts are then presented to the bride's family. After this, the bride, along with her entourage of girls is presented to the husband, family and guests.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pygmy_wedding_traditions\">Pygmy wedding traditions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Pygmy wedding traditions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Pygmies#Africa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pygmies\">Pygmy</a> engagements were not long and usually formalized by an exchange of visits between the families concerned. The groom to be would bring a gift of game or maybe a few arrows to his new in-laws, take his bride home to live in his band and with his new parents. His only obligation is to find among his relatives a girl willing to marry a brother or male cousin of his wife. If he feels he can feed more than one wife, he may have additional wives.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Somali_wedding_traditions\">Somali wedding traditions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Somali wedding traditions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Gelbis\" title=\"Gelbis\">Gelbis</a></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Middle_Eastern_customs\">Middle Eastern customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Middle Eastern customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arabic_customs\">Arabic customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Arabic customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Arabic_wedding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arabic wedding\">Arabic wedding</a></div>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Etiquette_in_Canada_and_the_United_States#Weddings\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Etiquette in Canada and the United States\">Etiquette in Canada and the United States \u00a7&#160;Weddings</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ceremonial_clothing_in_Western_cultures#Marriage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ceremonial clothing in Western cultures\">Ceremonial clothing in Western cultures \u00a7&#160;Marriage</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Weddings_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Weddings in the United States\">Weddings in the United States</a></div>\n<p>Although <a href=\"/wiki/Christian\" title=\"Christian\">Christian</a> weddings in the <a href=\"/wiki/Arab_World\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arab World\">Arab World</a> bear similarities to Western weddings, <a href=\"/wiki/Muslim\" title=\"Muslim\">Muslim</a> weddings in the Arab countries are influenced by <a href=\"/wiki/Islamic_culture\" title=\"Islamic culture\">Muslim traditions</a>. Muslim weddings start with a <a href=\"/wiki/Sheikh\" title=\"Sheikh\">Sheikh</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Islamic_holy_books\" title=\"Islamic holy books\">Al-kitaab</a> (book) for the bride and groom. A wedding is not <a href=\"/wiki/Islamic_marital_jurisprudence\" title=\"Islamic marital jurisprudence\">Islamically valid</a> unless both bride and groom are willing, and the groom is often encouraged to visit her before the wedding (as advised in many <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hadith\" title=\"Hadith\">a\u1e25ad\u012bth</a></i> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Islam\" title=\"Islam\">Islamic</a> prophet <a href=\"/wiki/Muhammad\" title=\"Muhammad\">Muhammad</a>). However, these visits must be <a href=\"/wiki/Chaperone_(social)\" title=\"Chaperone (social)\">chaperoned</a> to ensure purity of action between the two.\nIt's the custom that the groom and his family pay for all the wedding expenses. The Bride's family gather together before the wedding in the Bride's parents house. The Groom's family come and take the Bride from the house in a decorated car along with the one bride's mate which usually is the bride's sister, cousin, or best friend. The rest of the family and close friends follow in their cars, honking the car's horns. The reception is usually for all the family and friends  usually with a meal and cake. Candy covered almonds is a traditional giveaway from the couple. There is a lot of dancing and (zaghareet)Ululation. The Muslims tradition is to have Men in one side and women in another so the ladies can take their head cover off.

Often, an older, married man accompanies her, holding an umbrella or parasol over her head to shelter her. This symbolises protecting and sheltering the new bride. On the day of the wedding, the bride may wear a golden crown on her head. At the wedding reception, the Dance of the Crown is performed, where the bridesmaids blindfold the bride and dance around her. The bride then places the crown on the head of one of the bridesmaids, who tradition dictates will be the next to marry. Traditionally, the bride and groom sit next to each other in designated \"seats of honour\" at the wedding reception. The bride holds in her lap a sieve covered by a shawl, into which monetary gifts are put by the guests. In some weddings, the bride's mother-in-law or godmother will place a china plate on the bride's head, after which the newlyweds will perform the first dance (usually a waltz). When the plate falls and breaks, the guests collect the pieces. The number of pieces determines how many children the couple will have.\n</p><p>The last dance in a Finnish wedding is called the weaning waltz. All the female guests dance with the bride and all the male guests dance with the groom, including children. Each guest only dances with the bride or groom for a brief period before moving on. This custom was originally conceived as a test to see how quickly the bride and groom will \"forget\" each other (i.e. how long they will dance with each other before moving on to a guest).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"French_customs\">French customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: French customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_(la_Roste).jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_%28la_Roste%29.jpg/220px-Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_%28la_Roste%29.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"144\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_%28la_Roste%29.jpg/330px-Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_%28la_Roste%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_%28la_Roste%29.jpg/440px-Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_%28la_Roste%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3270\" data-file-height=\"2142\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Soir_de_noces_dans_les_Landes_(la_Roste).jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Wedding evening in the <a href=\"/wiki/Landes_(department)\" title=\"Landes (department)\">Landes</a>: Three people bring <i>la roste</i> (roasted bread soaked in sweet wine) to a couple of newlyweds in bed.

At least one of the spouses must reside in the town where the ceremony takes place. For people choosing to also have a religious wedding, the religious ceremony can only take place after the civil one, often in the same day. Town halls often offer a more elaborate ceremony for couples who do not wish to marry religiously.\n</p><p>If the two ceremonies take place separately, the civil one will usually include close family and witnesses. Once the civil ceremony is complete, the couple will receive a <i>livret de famille</i>, a booklet where a copy of the <a href=\"/wiki/Marriage_certificate\" title=\"Marriage certificate\">marriage certificate</a> is recorded. This is an official document and, should the couple have children, each child's birth certificate will be recorded in the <i>livret de famille</i> too. The civil ceremony in France is free of charge.\n</p><p>Traditionally, the wedding guests gathered at the fianc\u00e9e home and went on procession to the church. The procession were led by the bridegroom and his mother, followed by the bride mother and bridegroom father, the witnesses, grandparents, brothers and sisters with their spouse. At last came the bride and her father followed by the bridesmaids (usually family children).\n</p><p>Nowadays, the guests usually gathered at the town hall or church and the bride and bridegroom enter together, followed by the family and guests.\n</p><p>In some regions, the groom may meet his fianc\u00e9e at her home on the day of the wedding and escort her to the chapel where the ceremony is being held. As the couple proceeds to the chapel, children will stretch long white ribbons across the road which the bride will cut as she passes.\n</p><p>At the chapel, the bride and groom are seated on two red velvet chairs underneath a silk canopy called a <i>carre</i>.\nLaurel leaves may be scattered across their paths when they exit the chapel. Sometimes small coins are also tossed for the children to gather.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Weddinghattonchatel.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Weddinghattonchatel.jpg/220px-Weddinghattonchatel.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Weddinghattonchatel.jpg/330px-Weddinghattonchatel.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Weddinghattonchatel.jpg/440px-Weddinghattonchatel.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Weddinghattonchatel.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A traditional <a href=\"/wiki/France\" title=\"France\">French</a> wedding celebration at <a href=\"/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Hattonch%C3%A2tel\" title=\"Ch\u00e2teau de Hattonch\u00e2tel\">Ch\u00e2teau de Hattonch\u00e2tel</a></div></div></div>\n<p>At the reception, the couple customarily uses a toasting cup called a <i>Coupe de Mariage</i>. The origin of giving this toast began in France, when a small piece of toast was literally dropped into the couple's wine to ensure a healthy life. The couple would lift their glass to \"a toast\", as is common in Western culture today.\n</p><p>In south west France it is customary to serve spit roast wild boar (or sanglier in French) as the wedding breakfast, a local delicacy.\n</p><p>Some couples choose to serve a <i><a href=\"/wiki/Croquembouche\" title=\"Croquembouche\">croquembouche</a></i> instead of a wedding cake. This dessert is a pyramid of cr\u00e8me-filled pastry puffs, drizzled with a caramel glaze.\n</p><p>At more boisterous weddings, tradition involves continuing the celebration until very late at night. In many regions of France, wedding rituals continue late into the night after the official ceremonies and party. In some regions after the reception, those invited to the wedding will gather outside the newlyweds' window and bang pots and pans; this is called a 'charivari'. They are then invited into the house for some more drinks in the couple's honor, after which the couple is finally allowed to be alone for their first night together as husband and wife.\n</p><p>In the rural Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, a post-wedding ritual called <i>la r\u00f4tie</i> involves a gang of unmarried men and women finding the bride and groom who have escaped from the reception, tipping them out of their bed, and serving them a concoction of champagne and chocolate served in a chamber pot, which will be passed around and drank by everyone. Afterwards, the whole group will enjoy an onion soup. The heavily scatological and sexual implications and off-putting appearance of this ritual is supposed to symbolize the day-to-day intimacy of married life, deeply connected to the rural nature of the area. L<i>a r\u00f4tie</i> is an alternative ceremony outside the official ceremonies that the youth can be involved in, and create humor by making something that \"tastes good but is in bad taste\". The commensal quality of the ritual is a symbol for the bridge between youth and adulthood that the couple becomes in marriage, as well as the community's involvement in the new couple's married life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Similar rituals are widespread across rural France, though perhaps with different foods and containers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"German_customs\">German customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: German customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Mostly it is the good friends who kidnap the bride. Here, the kidnappers go with her from bar to bar, the best man of the bride (or her father) or the groom have to pay the bill every time.  The kidnappers go to a certain place, such as a public building, and leave a few pointers to help for searching. The exemption may be associated with a task for the groom, for example an artistic performance or wash the dishes for the next few weeks.\n</p><p>In Austria and Bavaria (preferably at country weddings), it is now customary to sing a derisive song before the freeing of the bride.\n</p><p>In Lower Austria it is customary for the masked men and the bride to go to the nearest coffee bar or tavern to drink, sing and to wait for the groom to come. In most areas of Austria it is the best man, sometimes the groom or the bride's father (rarely the best man) that pays the price of the kidnappers.\n</p><p>This ordinariness is due to the supposed 'right of the first night' (German 'Recht der ersten Nacht', French 'droit du seigneur') in the Middle Ages. According to myth the clergy and nobility in the Middle Ages had the right to deflower their female subordinates in their wedding night. Back then the brides was retrieved (kidnapped) from the vassals of the government from their Weddings. The historiography sees this right rather as a literary fiction.\n</p><p>In Bavaria and Western Austria another tradition is to wake up the bride early in the morning with a gun shoot or firecrackers on wedding day.

Special guests, such as close friends and family receive sugar-coated almonds (traditionally an odd number, usually seven but sometimes five) as a gift from the couple. Most Greek ceremonies are <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church\" title=\"Eastern Orthodox Church\">Orthodox</a>.\n</p><p>After the ceremony, usually the couple hold a great wedding party in some place with plenty of food, drinks, music and dance, usually until next morning. The wedding party starts with the invited people waiting for the couple, who usually come after some time. They start the dancing and eventually eat a piece of their wedding cake. At some point during the party, they also dance the traditional <a href=\"/wiki/Zeibekiko\" title=\"Zeibekiko\">zeibekiko</a> (groom) and <a href=\"/wiki/%C3%87iftetelli\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\u00c7iftetelli\">\u00e7iftetelli</a> (bride).\n</p><p>In many places of <a href=\"/wiki/Greece\" title=\"Greece\">Greece</a>, where they hold a more traditional wedding, they usually play only <a href=\"/wiki/Music_of_Greece\" title=\"Music of Greece\">traditional music</a> and eat <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_cuisine\" title=\"Greek cuisine\">local food</a>. For example, in the region of <a href=\"/wiki/Cyclades\" title=\"Cyclades\">Cyclades</a>, they eat the traditional <a href=\"/wiki/Pasteli\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pasteli\">pasteli</a> (solid honey with sesame) and in the region of <a href=\"/wiki/Crete\" title=\"Crete\">Crete</a> they cook rice with goat. In most traditional weddings, they bake whole animals like pigs, goats or sheep just like the <a href=\"/wiki/Easter\" title=\"Easter\">Easter</a> celebration. Before the church ceremony, especially in smaller areas, usually friends and relatives of the bride and the groom, accompanies them separately to the church playing traditional instruments, according to the region.\n</p><p>A typical Greek wedding will usually have more than 100 invited people (but usually 250-500) who are friends, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts, first or second cousins, neighbors and colleagues. It is common to have guests whom the couple has never met before. This is because the people who will be invited are usually determined by the parents of the couple and not by the couple themselves. Traditionally, the whole village would have attended the wedding, so very often the parents invite friends of theirs and their children, to the weddings of their own children.\n</p><p>There are many other traditions which are local to their regional areas. One famous tradition is the pinning of money on the bride's dress. This custom originated in one part of Greece, where it is a substitute for wedding presents, however it has become more widespread recently.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Italian_customs\">Italian customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Italian customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In some parts of <a href=\"/wiki/Italy\" title=\"Italy\">Italy</a>, a party, known as a Serenade, is thrown outside of the bride's home by the groom. His family and friends come and wait for the bride, entertaining themselves until she appears. The groom then sings to his bride to further seduce her. Once his song is sung, the party ends.\n</p><p>The day of the wedding, the <a href=\"/wiki/Wedding_ceremony_participants#Groomsmen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wedding ceremony participants\">groomsmen</a> try their hardest to make the groom as uncomfortable as possible by saying things like \"Maybe she forgot where the church is\".\n</p><p>It is also traditional for the grooms family to give a <a href=\"/wiki/Dowry\" title=\"Dowry\">dowry</a> to the bride and to provide the <a href=\"/wiki/Engagement_ring\" title=\"Engagement ring\">engagement ring</a>. The bride's family is then responsible for receiving the guests of the wedding in their home for a reception afterward.\n</p><p>The color green is very important in the Italian wedding. In Italy, the tradition of something blue is replaced with something green. This color brings good luck to the married couple. The veil and <a href=\"/wiki/Bridesmaids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bridesmaids\">bridesmaids</a> also were important in an Italian wedding. The tradition began in <a href=\"/wiki/Ancient_Rome\" title=\"Ancient Rome\">Ancient Rome</a> when the veil was used to hide the bride from any spirits that would corrupt her and the bridesmaids were to wear similar outfits so that the evil spirits were further confused.\n</p><p>An old Roman custom was that brides threw nuts at rejected suitors as they left the ceremony.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After dessert, more dancing commences, gifts are given, and the guests eventually begin to leave.

In the past, the engagement ceremony was organized by the future groom as a formal family gathering, during which he asked his chosen lady to marry him. In the recent years this custom has changed and today an engagement is much more personal and intimate. An elegant dinner party afterward is still a nice way to inform the closest family members about the couples' decision to get married.\n</p><p>In some regions of Poland, the tradition to invite the wedding guests in person is still upheld. Many young couples, accompanied by the parents, visit their family and friends to hand them the wedding invitations personally.\n</p><p>According to the old tradition, a groom arrives with his parents at the house of a bride just before the wedding ceremony. At that time, both parents and parents-in-law give a young couple their blessing. The couple enter the church together and walks up to the altar followed by two witnesses and the parents. In Poland, it is quite unusual for the bride to be walked down the aisle or to have bridesmaids and groomsmen in a wedding. The couple is assisted by two witnesses, a man (usually grooms' side) and a woman (usually brides' side) who are either family members or close friends.\n</p><p>The Polish bride traditionally wears a white dress and a veil. The groom, on the other hand, usually wears a fitted suit with a bow tie and a <a href=\"/wiki/Boutonni%C3%A8re\" title=\"Boutonni\u00e8re\">boutonni\u00e8re</a> that matches the brides' bouquet. During the ceremony, wedding rings are exchanged and both the husband and wife wear them on their right hand. Right after the ceremony, the closest family and all the guest form a line in the front of the church to congratulate the newlyweds and wish them love and happiness. As soon as the married couple leave the church they get showered with rice for luck or guests drop coins at their feet for them to pick up. This is done to ensure a good and prosperous future for the newlyweds.\n</p><p>Once all the guests have showered the couple with kisses, hugs and flowers everyone heads to the reception. It is a custom in Poland to prepare \"passing gates\" on the way to the reception for the newlyweds who, in order to pass, have to give the \"gate keepers\" some vodka. This is a misinterpretation of an earlier tradition, where the \"passing gates\" were built if the bride was an orphan and money collected by \"gate keepers\" from the guests was handed over to the bride as her dowry (being an orphan usually implied poverty).\n</p><p>The married couple is welcomed at the reception place by the parents with bread and salt. The bread symbolizes the prosperity, salt stands for hardship of life, the parents wish the young couple that they never go hungry and learn how to deal with every day hardships together. The wedding party lasts (and the bride and groom remain) until the last guest leaves, usually until morning.\n</p><p>In Poland, movements like <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Human_Liberties_Crusade&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Human Liberties Crusade (page does not exist)\">Human Liberties Crusade</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> or <a href=\"/wiki/Wedding_of_the_Weddings\" title=\"Wedding of the Weddings\">Wedding of the Weddings</a> promote non-alcoholic wedding celebrations.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Romanian_customs\">Romanian customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Romanian customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/L%C4%83utari\" title=\"L\u0103utari\">L\u0103utari</a> are <a href=\"/wiki/Romania\" title=\"Romania\">Romanian</a> musicians performing traditional songs. The music of the l\u0103utari establishes the structure of the elaborate Romanian  weddings. The l\u0103utari also function as guides through the wedding rituals and moderate any conflicts that may arise during what can be a long, alcohol-fueled party. Over a period of nearly 48 hours, this can be very physically strenuous.\n</p><p>Following custom almost certainly dating back at least to the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_Ages\" title=\"Middle Ages\">Middle Ages</a>, most l\u0103utari spend the fees from these wedding ceremonies on extended <a href=\"/wiki/Banquet\" title=\"Banquet\">banquets</a> for their friends and families over the days immediately following the wedding.\n</p><p>The wedding begins at the Town hall where the couple literally gets married in the presence of their closest friends and relatives. After that, they go to the bride's house where the L\u0103utari come and sing themed songs like \"Ia-\u021bi mireas\u0103 ziua bun\u0103\" (Say goodbye, bride) while the bride, the groom and the couple's parents take part in a symbolic preparation for the wedding (the best man and the best maid put a flower on their chests, arrange the groom's tie and shaves him and put the bride's veil, all in front of a big mirror decorated with pieces of veil and white flowers, mirror that separates the bride from the groom). They then go to the church where the religious ceremony is performed. Afterwords they go to a restaurant where the banquet begins.\n</p><p>The newlyweds meet the guests at the entrance and they serve a glass of champagne while the Lautari sing the \"Mar\u0219 de intampinare\" (meeting march). After all the guests have arrived, the couple breaks the ice and starts dancing a waltz. Later on, the chefs do \"Dansul g\u0103inii\" (the chicken dance: they dress up a roasted chicken and decorate it and they dance with it while the best man negotiate the chicken's price with them).\n</p><p>Another tradition is <a href=\"/wiki/Bride_kidnapping\" title=\"Bride kidnapping\">bride kidnapping</a>. A few friends of the newlywed stake the bride while the groom is not paying attention and take her somewhere else, usually to a club. The groom is then forced to negotiate the bride's price and to redeem it, but not until the \"criminals\" show evidence of having the bride ( a shoe, her necklace, etc.). Usually, the \"thieves\" ask for beverage. They then take the bride back to the wedding and as a punishment they are forced to dance a waltz with the bride lifted up.\n</p><p>It is normal to wish the bride and groom \"Casa de Piatra\" (Stone house) which symbolizes a solid marriage.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Russian_customs\">Russian customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Russian customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_wedding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Russian wedding\">Russian wedding</a></div>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Refimprove\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>needs additional citations for <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">verification</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit\">improve this article</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.

Japanese western style weddings are generally held in a chapel, either in a simple or elaborate ceremony, often at a dedicated <a href=\"/wiki/Wedding_chapel\" title=\"Wedding chapel\">wedding chapel</a> within a hotel.\n</p><p>Before the ceremony, there is a rehearsal. Often during this rehearsal, the bride's mother lowers the veil for her daughter, signifying the last act that a mother can do for her daughter, before \"giving her away\". The father of the bride, much like in Western ceremonies, walks the bride down the aisle to her awaiting groom.\n</p><p>After the rehearsal comes the procession. The wedding celebrant will often wear a wedding cross, or cana, a cross with two interlocking wedding rings attached, which symbolize a couple's commitment to sharing a life together in the bonds of holy matrimony. The wedding celebrant gives a brief welcome and an introductory speech before announcing the bride's entrance. The procession ends with the groom bowing to the bride's father. The father bows in return.\n</p><p>The service then starts. The service is given either in Japanese, English or quite often, a mix of both. It follows Protestant ceremony, relaxed and not overtly religious. Typically part of <a href=\"/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians\" title=\"First Epistle to the Corinthians\">1 Corinthians</a> 13 is read from the <a href=\"/wiki/Bible\" title=\"Bible\">Bible</a>. After the reading, there is a prayer and a short message, explaining the sanctity of the wedding vows (<i>seiyaku</i>). The bride and groom share their vows and exchange rings. The chapel register is signed and the new couple is announced. This is often followed by the traditional <a href=\"/wiki/Kissing_traditions#Wedding_kiss\" title=\"Kissing traditions\">wedding kiss</a>. The service can conclude with another hymn and a benediction.\n</p><p>With the two types of ceremonies, Shinto and Western, available it was bound for the two to be combined into what is called a contemporary Japanese wedding. Contemporary Japanese weddings are celebrated in many ways. On the beginning of the wedding day, the participants are to get ready at the parlor's beauty shop. The responsibility of the beauty shop is to dress the bride, the groom, and the other participants in the formal Japanese attire. Dressing the bride is an important task because the bride is to change into several outfits throughout her wedding day. Due to the complexity of the design, dressing a bride can be difficult and time consuming and for this reason the bride must be the first person to arrive two hours prior to the wedding ceremony. The bride's attire consists of an extravagant kimono, heavy make-up, a wig, and a head covering. An hour prior to the wedding ceremony, the guests and the groom should start to arrive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When everyone is dressed in their formal attire, the bride and the groom are to separate from each other and meet their close relatives in a waiting room. The relatives present will appear in the family photo and will also attend the religious ceremony. During this gathering, the kaizoe (assistant) will inform the participants of what will take place and what they should do during the day since they are not familiar with the ceremony.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When all is understood, the relatives and participants are brought to the photo studio where the professional photographs are to be taken. Taking the photographs of the bride, the groom, and their relatives is considered to be the central part of the wedding day. The photographs of the couple and their family are designed to represent the couple's prospective future together.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After the lengthy photo session, the bride, the groom, and others are brought to the Shinto shrine. Nowadays, the Shinto shrine may be conveniently located inside a hotel where all the activities will take place. A Shinto priest conducts the ceremony. In the ceremony, the bride and the groom are purified. However, the ceremony's important event occurs when the bride and the groom exchange nuptial cups of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sake\" title=\"Sake\">sake</a></i> also known as <i>san-san-ku-do</i>. With the addition of Western tradition, the exchange of rings and weddings vows also take place. Those guests who did not attend the religious ceremony are able to view the ceremony on video screens located in the lobby.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Like Western-style traditions, a reception takes place right after the wedding ceremony. The guests of the reception include family members, friends, and colleagues. Due to the wedding industry's attempt to maximize time and space, the reception will last exactly two hours. The reception does not include any random activities, but follows a strict order of events. The reception includes dramatic entrances by the bride and the groom with special effects, speeches, and other performances.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Throughout the reception, the bride shall receive the guests' utmost attention because she changes two to three times for the dramatic entrances. With all the dramatic entrances, the groom will join the bride. For example, the first entrance includes the bride, the groom, and the <i>nakodo</i> couple. <i>Nakodo</i> means a \"matchmaker\" or a \"go-between\", which is usually referred to the husband. The <i>nakodo</i> couple plays such an important role that their names appear on the announcement of the wedding. The purpose of the <i>nakodo</i> is to symbolize a stable marriage. As the two couples appear a special effect of a cloud of white smoke will appear to surround them. Simultaneously, the hall lights are dimmed and the stage lighting will turn to the color of rose-pink; this astonishes the guests. Pictures are to be taken during the dramatic entrances of the bride and the groom. After the photographs have been taken, they will be led back to their table.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At this point the <a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_Ceremonies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Master of Ceremonies\">Master of Ceremonies</a> will congratulate the newlyweds and their family. He/she will then introduce the <i>nakodo</i>, who will start the opening speeches and more speeches will follow. Being that the reception is highly structured the speakers will have the idea of being formal and concise in mind. With all the speeches finished, the bride and the groom will perform the Western-style traditions, which include the following: (1) the cake cutting ceremony and (2) the newlyweds' first dance as husband and wife.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The next part of the reception is the toast, or <i>kanpai</i>, which simplifies the mood of the reception where the guests can start to relax, eat, and drink. What follows the toast are the short congratulatory speeches made by relatives, friends, and colleagues. During this time, the bride has gone to change into her first costume and continues throughout the reception. However, the groom will also have a chance to change into his costume, which is the Western tuxedo. By the end of the night, both the bride and the groom have changed from their traditional Japanese attire to their Western-style attire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After their last change of costumes, the newlyweds will perform the candle service. Both will have a long, unlit candle, which will be lit from the table where their parents are seated. Next, the couple will walk around the room in a circle and light the candles placed on their guests' table. Once all the candles are lit, the newlyweds will return to their table where they will light what is called the Memorial Candle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GG_25-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GG-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By the time the candle service is done the two hours restriction will soon expire. The remaining few minutes includes short speeches, songs, dances, etc. As the reception ends a flower presentation ceremony will take place, which is where the newlyweds will present their parents with a gift of flowers to display appreciation for their parents raising them to the people they are today. At this point, the reception has ended with quick flashes and farewells.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"South_Korean_wedding_customs\">South Korean wedding customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=35\" title=\"Edit section: South Korean wedding customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Marriage_in_South_Korea\" title=\"Marriage in South Korea\">Marriage in South Korea</a></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Southeast_Asian_customs\">Southeast Asian customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36\" title=\"Edit section: Southeast Asian customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Burmese_wedding_customs\">Burmese wedding customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: Burmese wedding customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Marriage_Traditions_in_Myanmar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marriage Traditions in Myanmar\">Marriage Traditions in Myanmar</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Filipino_wedding_customs\">Filipino wedding customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Filipino wedding customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Marriage_and_wedding_customs_in_the_Philippines\" title=\"Marriage and wedding customs in the Philippines\">Marriage and wedding customs in the Philippines</a></div>\n<p>The groom usually wears the <a href=\"/wiki/Barong_Tagalog\" title=\"Barong Tagalog\">Barong Tagalog</a> during the wedding, along with the male attendants, though nowadays the wealthy opt to don Western attire such as a tuxedo.

At the house they are greeted with sprinkling of yellow rice and scented water.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Minangkabau_wedding_customs\">Minangkabau wedding customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=43\" title=\"Edit section: Minangkabau wedding customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg/220px-Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg/330px-Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg/440px-Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1600\" data-file-height=\"1071\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Minangkabau_wedding_2.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A <a href=\"/wiki/Minangkabau_Highlands\" title=\"Minangkabau Highlands\">Minangkabau</a> wedding in <a href=\"/wiki/West_Sumatera\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"West Sumatera\">West Sumatera</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Indonesia\" title=\"Indonesia\">Indonesia</a></div></div></div>\n<p>As a <a href=\"/wiki/Matrilineal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Matrilineal\">matrilineal</a> society, the bride family will be the one who proposes to the groom.

It traditionally follows the <i><a href=\"/wiki/White_wedding\" title=\"White wedding\">white wedding</a></i> type (see also <i>Wedding types</i> below), which originates from the white color of the bride's wedding dress, but refers to an entire wedding routine. Customs and traditions vary, but common components are listed below.\n</p>\n<dl><dt>Before the wedding</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>The host sends <a href=\"/wiki/Wedding_invitation\" title=\"Wedding invitation\">invitations</a> to the wedding guests, usually one to two months before the wedding. Invitations may most formally be addressed by hand to show the importance and personal meaning of the occasion. Large numbers of invitations may be mechanically reproduced. As <a href=\"/wiki/Engraving\" title=\"Engraving\">engraving</a> was the highest quality printing technology available in the past, this has become associated with wedding invitation tradition. Receiving an invitation does not impose any obligation on the invitee other than promptly accepting or declining the invitation, and offering congratulations to the couple.<sup id=\"cite_ref-manners647_30-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-manners647-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>While giving any gift to the newlywed couple is technically optional, nearly all invited guests who attend the wedding choose to do so. Wrapped gifts can be brought to the wedding ceremony or reception, but it's considered thoughtful to have them delivered to the address on the wedding invitation or to the address given with the couple's <a href=\"/wiki/Bridal_registry\" title=\"Bridal registry\">bridal registry</a>. Typical gifts are useful household items, such as dishes, silverware, kitchen utensils and appliances, or towels. Guests are not obligated to use the couple's registry information.</li>\n<li>A color scheme is selected by some to match everything from bridesmaids' dresses, flowers, invitations, and decorations, though there is no necessity in doing so.</li>\n<li>The groom's friends throw a party for the groom, called a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor_party\" title=\"Bachelor party\">bachelor party</a>\". It usually involves alcohol and racy entertainment, as this is supposedly the groom's last chance to engage in debauchery before marriage. It has become increasingly popular for the bride's friends to organize similar \"<a href=\"/wiki/Bachelorette_party\" title=\"Bachelorette party\">bachelorette</a>\" parties.</li></ul>\n<dl><dt>At the wedding</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>A wedding ceremony may take place anywhere, but often a church, <a href=\"/wiki/Courthouse\" title=\"Courthouse\">courthouse</a>, or outdoor venue is selected. The ceremony may be dictated by the couple's religious practices, or lack thereof. The most common non-religious form is derived from a simple <a href=\"/wiki/Anglicanism\" title=\"Anglicanism\">Anglican</a> ceremony in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer\" title=\"Book of Common Prayer\">Book of Common Prayer</a></i>, and can be performed in less than ten minutes, although it is often extended by inserting music or speeches.</li>\n<li>American brides usually wear a white, off-white, silver, or other very light-colored dress, particularly at their first marriage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Brides may choose any color, although black is strongly discouraged by some as it is the color of mourning in the west.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>White seeds, or confetti is sometimes thrown at the newlyweds as they leave the ceremony to symbolize fertility. Some individuals, churches or communities choose birdseed due to a false but widely believed myth that birds eating the rice will burst.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> Because of the mess that rice and birdseed make, modern couples often leave in clouds of <a href=\"/wiki/Soap_bubble\" title=\"Soap bubble\">bubbles</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>The wedding party may form a <a href=\"/wiki/Receiving_line\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Receiving line\">receiving line</a> at this point, or later at a <a href=\"/wiki/Wedding_reception\" title=\"Wedding reception\">wedding reception</a>, so that each guest may briefly greet the entire wedding party.</li></ul>\n<dl><dt>At the wedding reception</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Drinks, snacks, or perhaps a full meal, especially at long receptions, are served while the guests and wedding party mingle.</li>\n<li>Often, best men and/or maids of honor will toast newlyweds with personal thoughts, stories, and well-wishes; sometimes other guests follow with their own toasts. Champagne is usually provided for this purpose.</li>\n<li>In a symbolic cutting of the wedding cake, the couple may jointly hold a cake knife and cut the first pieces of the wedding cake, which they feed to each other. In some sub-cultures, they may deliberately smear cake on each other's faces, which is considered vulgar elsewhere.<sup id=\"cite_ref-isbn0-609-60431-7_35-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-isbn0-609-60431-7-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-isbn0-393-05874-3_36-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-isbn0-393-05874-3-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-isbn0-06-074504-5_37-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-isbn0-06-074504-5-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>If dancing is offered, the newlyweds first dance together briefly. Sometimes a further protocol is followed, wherein each dances next with a parent, and then possibly with other members of the wedding party. Special songs are chosen by the couple, particularly for a mother/son dance and a father/daughter dance. In some subcultures, a <a href=\"/wiki/Money_dance\" title=\"Money dance\">dollar dance</a> takes place in which guests are expected to dance with one of the newlyweds, and give them a small amount of cash. This practice, as is any suggestion that the guests owe money to the couple, is considered rude in most social groups as it is contrary to basic western etiquette.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>In the mid-twentieth century it became common for a bride to toss her bouquet over her shoulder to the assembled unmarried women during the reception. The woman who catches it, superstition has it, will be the next to marry. In a similar process, her groom tosses the bride's garter to the unmarried men, followed by the man who caught the garter placing it on the leg of the woman who caught the bouquet. While still common in many circles, these practices (particularly the latter) are falling out of favor in the 21st century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wedding_gifts\">Wedding gifts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46\" title=\"Edit section: Wedding gifts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The purpose of inviting guests is to have them witness a couple's marriage ceremony and vows and to share in their joy and celebration. Gifts for the wedding couple are optional, although most guests attempt to give at least a token gift of their best wishes. Some couples and families feel that in return for the expense they put into entertaining and feeding their guests, the guests should pay them with similarly expensive gifts or cash.<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> Others believe this is contrary to proper etiquette.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The couple often <a href=\"/wiki/Bridal_registry\" title=\"Bridal registry\">registers for gifts</a> at a store well in advance of their wedding. This allows them to create a list of household items, usually including china, silverware and crystalware, linens or other fabrics, pots and pans, <i>etc.</i> Registries are intended to aid guests in selecting gifts the newlyweds truly want, and the service is sufficiently profitable that most retailers, from luxury shops to discount stores, offer the opportunity. Registry information should, according to etiquette, be provided only to guests upon direct request, and never included in the invitation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> Some couples additionally or instead register with services that enable money gifts intended to <a href=\"/wiki/Honeymoon_registry\" title=\"Honeymoon registry\">fund items such as a honeymoon</a>, home purchase or college fund. Some find bridal registries inappropriate as they contravene traditional notions behind gifts, such as that all gifts are optional and delightful surprises personally chosen by the giver, and that registries lead to a type of price-based competition, as the couple knows the cost of each gift. Traditionally, weddings were considered a personal event and inviting people to the wedding who are not known to at least one member of the couple well enough to be able to choose an appropriate gift was considered inappropriate, and registries should therefore be unnecessary.<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> Whether considered appropriate or not, others believe that weddings are opportunities to extract funds or specific gifts from as many people as possible, and that even an invitation carries an expectation of monetary reward rather than merely congratulations.\n</p><p>Letters of thanks for any gift are traditionally sent promptly after the gift's receipt. Tradition allows wedding gifts to be sent up to a year after the wedding date. Thanks should be sent as soon as possible, preferably within two weeks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-manners647_30-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-manners647-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"African-American_customs\">African-American customs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47\" title=\"Edit section: African-American customs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Jumping_the_broom\" title=\"Jumping the broom\">Jumping the broom</a></div>\n<p>Jumping the broom developed out of the West African <a href=\"/wiki/Ashanti_Empire\" title=\"Ashanti Empire\">Asante</a> custom.

For Brazilian brides, these traditions lead to extravagant, fun-filled weddings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dt>Preparations</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Bridesmaids and groomsmen are chosen months before the time of the wedding. Those selected consist of couples paired off at the altar, usually three men and three women for the brides side and more three men and three women for the grooms side. The groom arrives at the wedding ceremony location first. The bride comes to the location, usually a church, at least 10 minutes after the groom\u2019s arrival. The two should not see each other before the ceremony, however, as it is believed this will bring bad luck.</li>\n<li>In a military officer's wedding, the roles of groomsmen are replaced by swordsmen of the sword honor guard. They are usually picked as close personal friends of the groom who have served with him. Their role includes forming the traditional <a href=\"/wiki/Saber_arch\" title=\"Saber arch\">saber arch</a> for the married couple and guests to walk through.</li>\n<li>Some time before the wedding, usually about one month, either the bride, or her best friends, organizes a \"kitchen shower\" (wedding shower) with the purpose of giving the bride an intimate reunion with her closest friends.  This party used to be a \"girls-only\" event, and was usually a small intimate party. Nowadays not only have the parties gotten bigger, but they also have started to admit men to the event.  The person that is invited to this kind of party usually gives the bride something for her kitchen; hence the name \"kitchen shower\", and not wedding shower.</li>\n<li>The wedding ceremony and party are usually paid by the wife\u2019s family, although this is a tradition that is not always followed, understandably because of the high costs involved.</li></ul>\n<dl><dt>Ceremony</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Brazilian wedding ceremonies normally follow Christian traditions closely. The bride and groom recite wedding vows to each other after a prayer is read. Then the bride and groom exchange wedding rings. These rings are usually engraved with the name of the groom on the bride\u2019s ring and the name of the bride on the groom\u2019s ring.</li>\n<li>After the religious ceremony, the newlyweds usually throw a big party were they receive the compliments from all the guests.  The party usually happens in a different place, a private party house that in Brazil is called a \"ceremonial.\"  A lot of singing and dancing goes on usually after the couple dances a Waltz.</li></ul>\n<dl><dt>Reception</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Receptions for Brazilian weddings involve food, drinks and music. The married couple gives gifts to their parents, while the parents bestow a number of gifts upon the couple.</li>\n<li>Another unique thing about the weddings in Brazil is a sweet called \"bem casado\" (well married), which is normally given to the guests on their way out.  It is considered to bring good luck to the couple. Usually towards the end of the party or before the married couple leaves, the bride throws her flower bouquet to her unmarried friends.  The belief is that whoever catches the bouquet will be the next one to marry.  One other tradition for offering fortune to the couple is for the bride\u2019s friends is to write their names on the inner part of the bride\u2019s dress.  This is also said to help the unmarried bride\u2019s friends to find a husband for them.</li></ul>\n<p>The Brazilian culture is very rich with its numerous traditions, celebrations, and in many cases superstitions.  Wedding celebrations are definitely inserted in this context. This is considered a festive event for the Brazilian society and thus it is usually celebrated with a lot of music, dances and overall happiness.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wedding_customs_by_country&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.worldweddingtraditions.net/nigerian-wedding-traditions/\">\"Nigerian wedding traditions | World Wedding Traditions\"</a>. <i>www.worldweddingtraditions.net</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
