Puniya (full moon) of Sawan  Rakhri or Rakhrhee (Punjabi: ਰੱਖੜੀ) is the Punjabi word for Rakhi and a festival observed by Hindus and Sikhs.    In the Punjab region, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is celebrated as Rakhrhya (Punjabi: ਰੱਖੜੀਆ).  Rakhrhya is observed on the same day of the lunar month of Sawan. It, like Raksha Bandhan, celebrates the relationship between brothers and sisters. Rakhri means “to protect” whereby a brother promises to look out for his sister and in return, a sister prays for the well being of her brother. A Rakhri can also be tied on a cousin or an unrelated man. If a woman ties a Rakhri on an unrelated man, their relationship is treated as any other brother and sister relationship would be. The festival is a siblings-day comparable to Mother's day/Father's day/Grandparents day etc.  A sister will tie the Rakhri on her brother and her brother will give a gift. Another feature of the celebration is the consumption of sweets.  There is no special ceremony but a sister will sing folk songs  and  say something along the lines of: Punjabi: ਸੂਰਜ ਛੱਡੀਆਂ ਰਿਸ਼ਮਾਂ ਮੂਲੀ ਛੱਡਿਆਂ ਬੀਅ ਭੈਣ ਨੇ ਬੰਨੀ ਰੱਖੜੀ                 ਜੁਗ ਜੁਗ ਵੀਰਾ ਜੀਅ   Transliteration:  Suraj chhadya rishma mooli chhadya bi bhain ne banni rahkhree jug jug veera ji
