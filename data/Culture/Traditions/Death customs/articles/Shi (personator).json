The basic meaning (1) \"corpse\" was semantically extended into both (2) \"act on behalf of a corpse\" or \"personator of a dead ancestor\" and (3) \"act like a corpse\" or \"motionless; inactive; doing nothing\". Meaning (4) \"lay out, arrange; display\" generalizes \"lay out a corpse.\" Meaning (5) \"manage; direct; ancestral tablet\" links the representative <i>shi</i> (2) \"personator\" with the metaphorical replacement \"ancestral tablet\". Meaning (6) uses <i>shi</i> to transcribe proper names.\n</p><p>Meaning (1) is the core sense of \"corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass\". Early ritual texts, notably the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Liji\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Liji\">Liji</a></i> \"Classic of Rites\", <i><a href=\"/wiki/Zhouli\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zhouli\">Zhouli</a></i> \"Rites of Zhou\", and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Etiquette_and_Rites\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Etiquette and Rites\">Yili</a></i> \"Etiquette and Rites\", frequently use <i>shi</i> \"corpse\" in <a href=\"/wiki/Mortuary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mortuary\">mortuary</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Funeral\" title=\"Funeral\">funeral</a> contexts. Here is an example <i>Liji</i> passage:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)</p></blockquote>\n<p><i>Shi</i> meaning (2) \"personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit\" is discussed below.\n</p><p>Meaning (3) figuratively expands <i>shi</i> to \"corpse-like\", which can contextually mean either \"motionless; calm; quiescent\" or \"inactive; negligent; remiss\". A <i>Shijing</i> ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, \"the good men sit motionless and silent\". Karlgren explains, \"'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help.\" The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Lunyu\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lunyu\">Lunyu</a></i> (\"Confucian Analects\") uses <i>shi</i> to praise <a href=\"/wiki/Confucius\" title=\"Confucius\">Confucius</a> (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), \"In bed, he did not lie like a corpse.\" Commentators disagree whether this means \"sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out\" or \"sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)\".\n</p><p>Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese <i>chen</i> <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%99%B3\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:\u9673\">\u9673</a> \"lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display\". Examples in classic texts range from specifically \"lay out (a corpse)\" to generally \"lay out; set out; arrange\". The <i>Liji</i> distinguishes between <i>shi</i> \u5c38 \"uncoffined corpse\" and <i>jiu</i> <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9F%A9\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:\u67e9\">\u67e9</a> (with the \"wood radical\" and a <i>jiu</i> \u531b \"long; enduring\" phonetic) \"coffined corpse\" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): \"(The corpse) on the couch is called [<i>shi</i>] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [<i>jiu</i>] (being in the long home).\" A <i><a href=\"/wiki/Shijing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shijing\">Shijing</a></i> poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, \"There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes.\"\n</p><p>Meaning (5) of <i>shi</i> is defined as <i>zhu</i> <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%BB\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:\u4e3b\">\u4e3b</a> \"master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet\". The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chuci\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chuci\">Chuci</a></i> (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses <i>shi</i> asking about <a href=\"/wiki/King_Wu_of_Zhou\" title=\"King Wu of Zhou\">King Wu of Zhou</a>, whose father <a href=\"/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou\" title=\"King Wen of Zhou\">King Wen of Zhou</a> did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: \"When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?\" Commentators disagree whether this <i>shi</i> means <i>zhu</i>, specifically <i>muzhu</i> \u6728\u4e3b \"wooden spirit/ancestral tablet\" or <i>jiu</i> \"corpse in a coffin\". Hawkes justifies translating \"corpse\": \"According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it.\"\n</p><p>The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this <i>Chuci</i> usage of <i>shi</i> \"corpse; spirit tablet\". Erkes (1928) proposed that the <i>zhu</i> was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the <i>zhu</i> was phallic shaped:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped <i>muzhu</i> \"wooden lord\". For instance, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Shiji\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shiji\">Shiji</a></i> (\"Record of History\", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with <i>muzhu</i> instead of <i>shi</i>: \"He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle.\" Erkes further suggested, \"very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased.\"\n</p><p>Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of <i>shi</i>. <i>Shi</i> \u5c38 is an ancient place name (in <a href=\"/wiki/Henan\" title=\"Henan\">Henan</a>); a surname (e.g., the <a href=\"/wiki/Syncretism_(Chinese_philosophy)\" title=\"Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)\">Syncretist</a> philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/Shizi_(book)\" title=\"Shizi (book)\">Shizi</a> \u5c38\u5b50, ca. 390\u2013330 BCE); and a variant of <i>shi</i> <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B2\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:\u9cf2\">\u9cf2</a> (which is used in bird names like <i>shijiu</i> \u9cf2\u9ce9 \"cuckoo; turtledove\").\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pronunciations_and_etymologies\">Pronunciations and etymologies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shi_(personator)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Pronunciations and etymologies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_Chinese\" title=\"Standard Chinese\">Standard Chinese</a> <i>sh\u012b</i> pronunciation of \u5c38 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_Chinese\" title=\"Middle Chinese\">Middle Chinese</a> and (ca. 6th century BCE) <a href=\"/wiki/Old_Chinese\" title=\"Old Chinese\">Old Chinese</a>.

Karlgren proposed that <i>si</i> &lt; *<i>sj\u0259r</i> \u6b7b \"die, dead\" and <i>shi</i> &lt; *<i>\u015bj\u0259r</i> \u5c38 \"the dead, corpse\" were etymologically <a href=\"/wiki/Cognate\" title=\"Cognate\">cognate</a>.

He rejects Karlgren's assumption that <i>shi</i> \"corpse\" is cognate to <i>si</i> \"to die\", \"because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial <i>\u015b-</i> (&lt; *<i>lh-</i>, *<i>nh-</i>, *<i>hj-</i>) never derives from an *<i>s-</i>, except when they share an initial *<i>l</i> or *<i>n</i>.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translations\">Translations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shi_(personator)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Translations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>English translations of the ceremonial <i>shi</i> \u5c38 include <i><a href=\"/wiki/Personator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Personator\">personator</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Impersonator\" title=\"Impersonator\">impersonator</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/representative\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:representative\">representative</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mediumship\" title=\"Mediumship\">medium</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Shaman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shaman\">shaman</a></i>.

Paper [1995] suggests <i>Incorporator of the Dead</i>, which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words <i>incorporate</i> and <i>incorporation</i> commonly have other meanings. <i>Medium</i> and <i>shaman</i> are similar with <i>shi</i> in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a <a href=\"/wiki/Nonce_word\" title=\"Nonce word\">nonce word</a>, such as Waley's [1937] \"the Dead One,\" Eberhard's [1968] \"death boy,\" or Wilhelm's [1967] \"corpse boy,\" but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear.

However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower <a href=\"/wiki/Social_status\" title=\"Social status\">social status</a> than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mencius_(book)\" title=\"Mencius (book)\">Mengzi</a></i> (\"Book of Mencius\") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>You should ask him, \"Which do you respect most, \u2014 your uncle, or your younger brother?\" He will answer, \"My uncle.\" Ask him again, \"If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, \u2014 to him or to your uncle?\" He will say, \"To my younger brother.\" You can go on, \"But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?\" He will reply to this, \"I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies.\" (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). </p></blockquote>\n<p>The <i>Liji</i> reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): \"Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such.\" Another <i>Liji</i> passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: \"A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father.\" When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. \n</p><p>Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. <a href=\"/wiki/Marcel_Granet\" title=\"Marcel Granet\">Marcel Granet</a> (1930:337\u2013338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic <a href=\"/wiki/Primogeniture\" title=\"Primogeniture\">primogeniture</a>; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. <a href=\"/wiki/Wolfram_Eberhard\" title=\"Wolfram Eberhard\">Wolfram Eberhard</a> (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. <a href=\"/wiki/Julian_Jaynes\" title=\"Julian Jaynes\">Julian Jaynes</a> (1976:344\u2013345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/Iamblichus\" title=\"Iamblichus\">Iamblichus</a> wrote that \"young and simple persons\" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides <i>shi</i> rituals.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns.

When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the <a href=\"/wiki/Xia_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Xia Dynasty\">Xia Dynasty</a> (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.\n</p><p>Two <i>Liji</i> chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, \"The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club.\" (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu \u4f55\u4f11's 2nd-century commentary to the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals\" title=\"Spring and Autumn Annals\">Chunqiu</a></i> (\"Spring and Autumn Annals\") <i><a href=\"/wiki/Gongyang_Zhuan\" title=\"Gongyang Zhuan\">Gongyang Zhuan</a></i> says (tr. Carr 2007:371), \"The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts.\" Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: \"It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Doubts_about_personation\">Doubts about personation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shi_(personator)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Doubts about personation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The above <i>Liji</i> description of Zhou \"subscription club\" personation ceremonies quotes <a href=\"/wiki/Confucius\" title=\"Confucius\">Confucius</a>'s student and compiler <a href=\"/wiki/Zengzi\" title=\"Zengzi\">Zengzi</a> (505-436 BCE). The <i>Liji</i> contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Zengzi] asked, \"Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?\" Confucius said, \"In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely.\" (7, tr.

Henri Dor\u00e9 (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.\n</p><p>The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The <a href=\"/wiki/Tang_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tang Dynasty\">Tang Dynasty</a> historian <a href=\"/wiki/Du_You\" title=\"Du You\">Du You</a> criticizes the <i>shi</i>:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or <i>shenxiang</i> \u795e\u8c61 \"image of the spirit\". The <a href=\"/wiki/Han_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Han Dynasty\">Han Dynasty</a> historian <a href=\"/wiki/Ban_Gu\" title=\"Ban Gu\">Ban Gu</a> explains:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Carr (2007:386) notes, \"This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony.\"    \n</p><p>Some <a href=\"/wiki/Qing_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Qing Dynasty\">Qing Dynasty</a> scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The <i>Jishuo quanzhen</i> \u96c6\u8aaa\u8a6e\u771f \"Collected Sayings Explaining Truth\" says, \"The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest.\" The <i>Yuzhou dayiyi</i> \u5b87\u5b99\u5927\u7591\u8b70 \"Discussion of Universal Great Doubts\" says: \"The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet \u2026 hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected.\"\n</p><p>The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading <a href=\"/wiki/Neo-Confucianist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neo-Confucianist\">Neo-Confucianist</a> philosophers held this judgment.\n<a href=\"/wiki/Cheng_Yi_(philosopher)\" title=\"Cheng Yi (philosopher)\">Cheng Yi</a> writes: \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. </p></blockquote>\n<p>His follower <a href=\"/wiki/Zhu_Xi\" title=\"Zhu Xi\">Zhu Xi</a> concurs:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for <i>shi</i> \"corpse\" personation: <a href=\"/wiki/Julian_Jaynes\" title=\"Julian Jaynes\">Julian Jaynes</a>'s psychological <a href=\"/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)\" title=\"Bicameralism (psychology)\">bicameralism</a> hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human \"<a href=\"/wiki/Consciousness\" title=\"Consciousness\">consciousness</a>\", meaning <a href=\"/wiki/Self-awareness\" title=\"Self-awareness\">self-awareness</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cognition\" title=\"Cognition\">cognition</a>, began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had \"bicameral mentality\" in which one part of the brain \"spoke\" (often in an <a href=\"/wiki/Authority_figure\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Authority figure\">authority figure</a>'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) </p></blockquote>\n<p>If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a <i>shi</i> \"corpse\". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead.

The <i>shi</i> was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good.
