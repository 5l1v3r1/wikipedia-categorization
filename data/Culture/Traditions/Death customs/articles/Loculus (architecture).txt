Loculus (Latin, "little place"), plural loculi, is an architectural compartment or niche that houses a body, as in a catacomb, hypogeum, mausoleum or other place of entombment. In classical antiquity, the mouth of the loculus might be closed with a slab,  plain, as in the Catacombs of Rome, or sculptural, as in the family tombs of ancient Palmyra.
