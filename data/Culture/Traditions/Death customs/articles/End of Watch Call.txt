The End of Watch Call or Last Radio Call is a ceremony in which, after a police officer's death (usually in the line of duty but sometimes from illness), the officers from his or her unit or department gather around a police radio, over which the police radio operator issues one call to the officer, followed by a silence, then a second call, followed by silence, then finally announces that the officer has failed to respond because he or she has fallen in the line of duty.   An example: Sometimes the operator will mention the officer's honors, and may add other words in memoriam. In some cases the call is made twice, once immediately after  the officer's death, then more formally closer to the date  of or actually at the officer's funeral.   The practice of the end of watch call began in the midâ€“2000s in police departments on the East Coast of the United States. By 2010 the practice had spread to the West Coast, and to firefighters, forest rangers, and wardens[disambiguation needed] in the United States and Canada.  The custom as practiced in the New York Police Department was depicted in "End Of Watch," an episode of the police procedural Elementary.   The practice of the Los Angeles Police Department was shown in "Reckoning," an episode of Southland.    On the soap opera General Hospital, the character Jordan Ashford uses the radio to make the Last Call to Nathan West, an officer killed in the line of duty by his father, Cesar Faison.  An End of Watch call also occurs in one of the final episodes of the dramatic comedy The Mysteries of Laura, starring Debra Messing and Josh Lucas.
