The Seven Labors of Rostam or Haft-Khan-e-Rostam (Persian: هفت خوان رستم) are a series of acts carried out by the greatest of the Persian heroes, Rostam, also romanized as Rustam. The story of Haftkhan was retold by Ferdowsi in his epic poem, Shahnama. In his labors, Rostam was often accompanied only by his horse, Rakhsh. In two of his labors, he was also accompanied by a champion, Olad. Rostam was from zabolistan of (khurasan-e-kabir) present Afghanistan. According to the traditional narrative, the story starts when Kai Kaus's expedition to Mazandaran fails, and the army are captured by the Divs. Rostam engages to liberate them, and proceeds by the labors. The traditional order of the labors is: Rostam also kills the magician king of Mazandaran (not to be confused with Mazandaran Province) and returns to Estakhr accompanied by the Shah.
