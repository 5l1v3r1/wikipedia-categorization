Walter of Aquitaine is a legendary king of the Visigoths. Walter figures in several epic poems and narratives in medieval languages: The most complete poem specifically about Walther is Waltharius, in which Walter fights single-handedly against the Burgundian king Gunther and his retinue, killing all attackers except for Gunther and Hagen. In later literature, Walter figures in Scheffel's novel Ekkehard (1887). Walter is not a historical king, but the historical nucleus of his legend lies in the 5th century (the reign of the  Balti dynasty), after king Wallia established a Visigothic kingdom in Aquitaine in 417, clashing with the Vandals under king Gunderic. The Burgundians became neighbours of the Visigoths after being resettled to Savoy by Flavius AÃ«tius in 443 during the rule of Gunderic of Burgundy.
