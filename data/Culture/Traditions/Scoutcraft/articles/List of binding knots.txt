A binding knot is a knot that may be used to keep an object or multiple loose objects together, using a string or a rope that passes at least once around them.  There are various binding knots, divided into two types.  Friction knots are held in place by the friction between the windings of line.  Knotted-ends knots are held in place by the two ends of the line being knotted together. Stopping may be either a temporary whipping or seizing, the commonest variety consisting of a few round turns finished off with a reef knot. The purpose of a whipping is to prevent the end of a rope from fraying. A seizing holds several objects together.Whipping and seizing are binding knots, but are more complex since they contain many turns, like a lashing. This is a list of binding knots.
