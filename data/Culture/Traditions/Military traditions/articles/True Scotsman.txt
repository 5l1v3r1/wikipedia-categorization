"True Scotsman" is a humorous term used in Scotland for a man wearing a kilt without undergarments.  Though the tradition originated in the military, it has entered Scottish lore as a rite, an expression of light-hearted curiosity about the custom, and even as a subversive gesture.  However, in 2010, the Director of the Scottish Tartans Authority, Brian Wilton, described the tradition of not wearing undergarments as "childish and unhygienic".  In response, racing driver David Coulthard and some kilt manufacturers spoke in favour of the tradition, while MSP Jamie McGrigor and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray admitted to wearing underwear under their kilts. Kilts have been traditionally worn without undergarments since their use as part of Scottish military uniform,  leading to the invention of such expressions as "go regimental" or "military practice" for wearing no underwear.   On the  Western Front during the First World War, some sergeant majors reportedly had mirrors tied to the end of golf clubs or walking sticks to inspect up and under the kilt at parade inspection. However, in 1940 the kilt was retired from combat because of the vulnerability of bare skin to chemical agents,  although it was retained as the formal dress uniform of the regiments.  In the 1950s, kilted soldiers on parade would be checked by the Sergeant Major using a mirror on the barracks floor.  In 1997, a Black Watch soldier received wide press exposure, because of windy conditions during a military ceremony in Hong Kong.  As of  2008[update], Highland dancers and athletes have been bound by the nature of their competitions to appropriately and modestly clothe themselves. In Highland Dance competitions and exhibitions, the regulations of the Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing (SOBHD) have stated regarding underwear: "Dark or toning with the kilt should be worn, but not white."  Highland athletes are also required to wear shorts of some type during competitions.
