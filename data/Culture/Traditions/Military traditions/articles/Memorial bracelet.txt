A memorial bracelet is a cuff style bracelet worn around the wrist. The term memorial bracelet was coined by Rob Tacy in October, 2001 when he launched the MemorialBracelets.com website.  The bracelet is made of either aluminum, stainless steel, or leather and engraved with the name of a person who died or an event.  These bracelets are worn as a way to show support, to remember a victim or hero of terrorism or war, to make people aware of a person that has died and the reason for the death, to commemorate an event such as the September 11 attacks on the United States, or to support and remember American servicepeople who were POWs or MIA. Also known as KIA bracelets, they are commonly worn by combat veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars to honor comrades who have been killed in action.  A common three line format is as follows: Line 1 – deceased service member's rank and name. Line 2 – unit, date of death, and branch of service. Line 3 – Location of death, usually Village/City/Province and Country. Other engravings on the bracelet can include unit patches, religious and patriotic symbols, and flags. A memorial bracelet with embedded RFID chip was created for an interactive exhibit at In Flanders Fields Museum in Belgium.   In 2014, a story about a memorial bracelet found on a beach in Florida went viral with c. 100,000 Facebook "shares" and coverage in traditional media in multiple states.
