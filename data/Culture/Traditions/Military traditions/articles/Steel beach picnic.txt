A steel beach picnic is a tradition in the United States Navy.  Such events are often department-sponsored barbecues held on the deck of the ship, hence the name "steel beach".  They are often held on the flight deck or in a large hangar bay for carriers, much like a day at the beach with volleyball and other sporting events.
