The first ceremony including performance of <a href=\"/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky\" title=\"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\">Tchaikovsky's</a> \"<a href=\"/wiki/1812_Overture\" title=\"1812 Overture\">1812 Overture</a>\" was held at the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Military_College,_Duntroon\" title=\"Royal Military College, Duntroon\">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> in 1968. Although this inaugural performance was a relatively low-key affair, the ceremony has since become an annual event at RMC and is well supported by the service community and the general public. The modern ceremony is thought to have its origins in the 16th century and combines three customs.\n</p><p>The first custom was originally performed by drummers only, marching on the ramparts to warn the soldiers that evening guard duties would soon commence. It also signalled soldiers outside the fortifications and labourers in the fields that the gates were about to be closed and they should retire within the walls for the night.\n</p><p>The second custom was practised on battlefields in past times when the fighting ceased at sunset. Following the Beating Retreat, many of the old regiments would say a prayer or sing a hymn in honour of their fallen, and the evening guard would fire three <a href=\"/wiki/Musket\" title=\"Musket\">musket</a> volleys \"to put flight to the evil spirits of the enemy dead\".\n</p><p>The final custom derives from the practice of lodging the Regimental Colour in the Colour Ensign's quarter when the evening guard was mounted. In modern times, that custom was replaced by the lowering of the national flag.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2007_ceremony\">2007 ceremony</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Beating_Retreat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: 2007 ceremony\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The 2007 ceremony was conducted on the nights of 27 &amp; 28 September.

Army, air force and navy bands consisting of pipes, drums, buglers and trumpeters from various regiments took part. This legacy was a handover of British influence. However, when British Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were visiting India for the first time after independence, the then Prime minister Mr. Jawahar Lal Nehru summoned Maj G A Roberts asking him to do something spectular creative, and eventful for the Queens visit. That is when The Beating Retreat was officially conceived in Honour of the visit.Thereafter it became official ceremony to have a Head of State of country as the chief guest and that year the Beating Retreat was in their honour<sup id=\"cite_ref-pib_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-pib-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ceremony\">Ceremony</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Beating_Retreat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Ceremony\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath,_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background,_New_Delhi.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath%2C_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background%2C_New_Delhi.jpg/250px-Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath%2C_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background%2C_New_Delhi.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath%2C_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background%2C_New_Delhi.jpg/375px-Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath%2C_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background%2C_New_Delhi.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath%2C_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background%2C_New_Delhi.jpg/500px-Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath%2C_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background%2C_New_Delhi.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3872\" data-file-height=\"2592\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Vijay_Chowk_at_Rajpath,_with_Secretariat_Buildings_in_the_background,_New_Delhi.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Vijay Chowk (Victory Square) at <a href=\"/wiki/Rajpath\" title=\"Rajpath\">Rajpath</a>, with <a href=\"/wiki/Secretariat_Building,_New_Delhi\" title=\"Secretariat Building, New Delhi\">Secretariat Buildings</a> in the background, New Delhi, the venue of the Beat Retreat ceremony</div></div></div>\n<p>The ceremony starts by the massed bands of the three services marching in unison, playing popular marching tunes like <a href=\"/wiki/Colonel_Bogey_March\" title=\"Colonel Bogey March\">Colonel Bogey March</a>, Sons of the Brave and <a href=\"/wiki/Qadam_Qadam_Badaye_Ja\" title=\"Qadam Qadam Badaye Ja\">Qadam Qadam Badaye Ja</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Fanfare\" title=\"Fanfare\">Fanfare</a> by buglers then is followed by the bands of the Indian Army marching forward in quick time, then breaking into slow time, then by the '<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Compound_march&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Compound march (page does not exist)\">compound march</a>' involving movements to form intricate and beautiful patterns. The massed military bands, again, breaks into quick time and goes back to the farthest end of Raisina Hills.

This band also does a compound march and formation numbers. The last bands to perform are the combined bands of the Navy and the Air Force. This part of the ceremony ends with their compound march. One such beating retreat ceremony by the Armed Forces bands was during the <a href=\"/wiki/1982_Asian_Games\" title=\"1982 Asian Games\">1982 Asian Games</a> New Delhi closing ceremony for which the credit goes to retired Indian Army's Music Director Late Harold Joseph, Indian Navy's Jerome Rogrigues and Indian Navy's M S Neer, one of the greatest musicians, conductors, composers and instrumentalists of the Indian Armed Forces bands, who had led the massed bands at the ASIAD 82 closing ceremony.\n</p><p>Aside from these, the 2016 retreat saw the first appearance of marching bands from Central Armed Police Forces and the Delhi Police, plus performances by the Army Symphony Orchestra and Traditional Ensemble, the latter using a mix of traditional European and Indian instruments. The use of certain Indian instruments which require the musician to sit down while playing are a departure from the concept of the ceremony being one that is usually executed by musicians while marching. The appearance of Police Forces was a recognition of their role being as vital as that of the Indian Armed Forces.\n</p><p>All four band contingents march forward and take position close to the President's seat. The drummers, mostly from the Army's pipe bands, give a solo performance, known as the Drummer's Call. A regular feature of this pageant is the last tune played before the Retreat, when the National Flag is lowered. It is the famous Christian Hymn written by <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Francis_Lyte\" title=\"Henry Francis Lyte\">Henry Francis Lyte</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Abide_With_Me_(hymn)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abide With Me (hymn)\">Abide With Me</a></i> set to music by <a href=\"/wiki/William_Henry_Monk\" title=\"William Henry Monk\">W. M. Monk</a> and one of <a href=\"/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi\" title=\"Mahatma Gandhi\">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s personal favorite hymns, and has remained part of the ceremony over the years when many other foreign tunes were phased out to make way for Indian tunes, especially during the 2011 ceremony.<sup id=\"cite_ref-tt_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tt-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The chimes made by the tubular bells, placed quite at a distance, creates a mesmerising ambiance.\n</p><p>This is followed by the bugle call for <a href=\"/wiki/Sunset_(bugle_call)\" title=\"Sunset (bugle call)\">Sunset</a> by the buglers, and all the flags are slowly brought down. The band master then marches to the President and requests permission to take the bands away, and informs that the closing ceremony is now complete. The bands march back playing a popular martial tune and the official march of the Armed Forces, <a href=\"/wiki/Sare_Jahan_se_Accha\" title=\"Sare Jahan se Accha\">Sare Jahan se Accha</a>. As soon as the bands cross Raisina Hills a spectacular illumination display is set up on the North and South Blocks of the Parliament building. As the PBG's horse mounted troops arrive back in after the bands leave, the band stops as another band from the Army is stationed to play the National Anthem again as the President receives the final National Salute for the day by the PBG, before the President and the PBG depart with the bands leading the way<sup id=\"cite_ref-tt_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tt-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-toi_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-toi-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> by then now dispersed on Rajpath leading to the Presidential residence and the Secretariat Buildings.\n</p><p>In the past, this finale was also followed up by a short fireworks display.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"India.2FPakistan\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"India/Pakistan\">India/Pakistan</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Beating_Retreat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: India/Pakistan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Wagah_border_ceremony\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wagah border ceremony\">Wagah border ceremony</a></div>\n<p>The Wagah border closing 'lowering of the flags' ceremony is a daily military practice that the security forces of India (<a href=\"/wiki/Border_Security_Force\" title=\"Border Security Force\">Border Security Force</a>) and Pakistan (<a href=\"/wiki/Pakistan_Rangers\" title=\"Pakistan Rangers\">Pakistan Rangers</a>) have jointly followed since 1959.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guardian_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guardian-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The ceremony has been filmed and broadcast by <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Palin\" title=\"Michael Palin\">Michael Palin</a> for one of his television around-the-world travel programs; he described it as a display of \"carefully choreographed contempt.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYT_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYT-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Beating_Retreat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Republic_Day_of_India\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Republic Day of India\">Republic Day of India</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Republic_Day_Parade\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Republic Day Parade\">Republic Day Parade</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour\" title=\"Trooping the Colour\">Trooping the Colour</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Changing_the_Guard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Changing the Guard\">Changing the Guard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fer_Zapfenstreich\" title=\"Gro\u00dfer Zapfenstreich\">Gro\u00dfer Zapfenstreich</a></li></ul>\n<p>List of Foot Guards Bands:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Coldstream_Guards_Band\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coldstream Guards Band\">Coldstream Guards Band</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Grenadier_Guards_Band\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grenadier Guards Band\">Grenadier Guards Band</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Irish_Guards_Band\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Irish Guards Band\">Irish Guards Band</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Band_of_the_Scots_Guards\" title=\"Band of the Scots Guards\">Scots Guards Band</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Welsh_Guards_Band\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Welsh Guards Band\">Welsh Guards Band</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Beating_Retreat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-changes-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-changes_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-changes_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081014113515/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/cerem_guard_change.pdf\">\"Guard changes for May 2008\"</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span>.
