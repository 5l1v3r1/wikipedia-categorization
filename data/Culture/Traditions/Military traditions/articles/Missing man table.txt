The Missing Man Table, also known as the Fallen Comrade Table,  is a place of honor, set up in military dining facilities of the U.S. armed forces and during occasions such as service branch birthday balls, in memory of fallen, missing, or imprisoned military service-members.   The table serves as the focal point of ceremonial remembrance, originally growing out of US concern of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue.   Beyond permanent displays in dining facilities, the missing man table is traditionally part of military dining-in ceremonies and service balls. In recent years, the ceremony has been frequently performed in conjunction with Veterans Day and Memorial Day services.    When presented in a dining-in or service ball, a narration given to the audience explains the symbolism of each item.  The practice of the missing man table has evolved over time and is not currently governed by any US Department of Defense or service-specific guidance. The listed items are considered traditional.  Some commands and units may place headcovers or other items at the place setting as well.
