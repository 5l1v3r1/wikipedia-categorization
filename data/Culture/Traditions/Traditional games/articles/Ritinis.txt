Ritinis (also ritinys, rypka, rifle, katilka) is a team sport originating in Lithuania. It is included in the World Lithuanian Games.  Ritinis was also represented in the TAFISA World Games.  Ritinis is often played on a football field. Games last 40 minutes, with a half-time interval after 20 minutes. Two teams of seven players each (six strikers and one goal keeper) compete to throw the Rypka, a hard rubber discus, either behind their opponents' back line for 1 point, or in their opponents' goal for 3 points. Players can only throw the discus with their hands, while they can only block the discus with their bats, which are curved and are called Ritmu≈°a. It is common for teams to have five reserve players on hand. Ritinis originated from the Lithuanian ethnic game that was played on an open field. The first rule book of stadium ritinis game was written by Karolis Dineika in Vilniaus rypka (the rypka of Vilnius) in 1923.  In 1958 the Lithuanian Ethnic Games Federation was created and included ritinis. In 1973 a separate Lithuanian Ritinis Federation was established. The first Lithuanian National Championships were held in 1961.
