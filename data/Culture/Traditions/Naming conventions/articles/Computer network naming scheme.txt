In computing, naming schemes are often used for objects connected into computer networks. Server naming is a common tradition. It makes it more convenient to refer to a machine by name than by its IP address. CIA named their servers after states.  Server names may be named by their role or follow a common theme such as colors, countries, cities, planets, chemical element, scientists, etc. If servers are in multiple different geographical locations they may be named by closest airport code. Such as web-01, web-02, web-03, mail-01, db-01, db-02. Airport code example: City-State-Nation example: Thus, a production server in Minneapolis, Minnesota would be nnn.ps.min.mn.us.example.com, or a development server in Vancouver, BC, would be nnn.ds.van.bc.ca.example.com. Large networks often use a systematic naming scheme, such as using a location (e.g. a department) plus a purpose to generate a name for a computer. For example, a web server in NY may be called "nyc-www-04.xyz.net". Common network naming convention: (city-function-number.domain.name) City Code IATA link  If you have many offices in a city distinguish the offices designate ... RFC 1178 link However, smaller networks will frequently use a more personalized naming scheme to keep track of the many hosts. Popular naming schemes include trees, planets, rocks, etc. Network naming can be hierarchical in nature, such as the Internet's Domain Name System. Indeed, the Internet employs several universally applicable naming methods: uniform resource name (URN), uniform resource locator (URL), and uniform resource identifier (URI).
