The Biikebrennen (meaning "bonfires" in Northern Low Saxon), Biikebr√•nen (in North Frisian) or Pers Awten (meaning "Saint Peter's Eve" in South Jutish) is an annual celebration held on 21 February in North Frisia, in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein and in Southern Jutland in Denmark. At Biikebrennen, nearly all North Frisian towns, and many isolated farmhouses as well, light their own bonfires, known locally as biike, at or shortly after sunset to bid winter farewell. The origin of Biikebrennen is unclear. The meaning has changed over time. The ritual varies a little from island to island. But the tradition lives on.
