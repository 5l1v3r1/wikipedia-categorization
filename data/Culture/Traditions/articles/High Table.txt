The High Table is a table for the use of fellows (members of the Senior Common Room) and their guests at Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin and Durham colleges. Other academic institutions (such as University of London; University of St Andrews;  University of Manchester and University of Bristol in the UK, Queen's University, and The University of Trinity College and Massey College at the University of Toronto, and the University of Hong Kong) also have high tables. The table is normally at the end of the dining hall on a raised platform, although this is not always the case. On more formal evening occasions, dinner jackets are worn. It is also normal to wear academic gowns.
