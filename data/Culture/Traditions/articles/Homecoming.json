People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Banquet\" title=\"Banquet\">banquet</a> or dance and, most often, a game of <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">American football</a>, or, on occasion, <a href=\"/wiki/Basketball\" title=\"Basketball\">basketball</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ice_hockey\" title=\"Ice hockey\">ice hockey</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Soccer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soccer\">soccer</a>. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a <a href=\"/wiki/Parade\" title=\"Parade\">parade</a> featuring the school's <a href=\"/wiki/Choir\" title=\"Choir\">choir</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Marching_band\" title=\"Marching band\">marching band</a>, and sports teams, and the coronation of a homecoming queen (and at many schools, a homecoming king). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season. The game itself, whether it be football or another sport, will typically feature the home team playing a considerably weaker opponent. The game is supposed to be an \"easy win\" and thus weaker schools will sometimes play lower division schools.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins\">Origins</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homecoming&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Origins\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Homecoming1911.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Homecoming1911.jpg/220px-Homecoming1911.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"83\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Homecoming1911.jpg/330px-Homecoming1911.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Homecoming1911.jpg/440px-Homecoming1911.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1472\" data-file-height=\"558\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Homecoming1911.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The <a href=\"/wiki/1911_Kansas_vs._Missouri_football_game\" title=\"1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game\">1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game</a> is one of several claimed to be the first college football homecoming game.</div></div></div>\n<p>The tradition of homecoming has its origin in alumni football games held at colleges and universities since the 19th century.

The intense rivalry originally took place at neutral sites, usually in <a href=\"/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri\" title=\"Kansas City, Missouri\">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, until a new conference regulation was announced that required intercollegiate football games to be played on collegiate campuses.  To renew excitement in the rivalry, ensure adequate attendance at the new location, and celebrate the first meeting of the two teams on the Mizzou campus in <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia,_Missouri\" title=\"Columbia, Missouri\">Columbia, Missouri</a>, Mizzou Athletic Director <a href=\"/wiki/Chester_Brewer\" title=\"Chester Brewer\">Chester Brewer</a> invited all alumni to \"come home\" for the game in 1911.  Along with the football game, the celebration included a parade and spirit rally with bonfire. The event was a success, with nearly 10,000 alumni coming home to take part in the celebration and watch the Tigers and Jayhawks play to a 3\u20133 tie. The Missouri annual homecoming, with its parade and spirit rally centered on a large football game is the model that has gone on to take hold at colleges and high schools across the United States.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At least two collegiate homecoming celebrations predate the University of Missouri football game homecoming event: <a href=\"/wiki/Southwestern_University\" title=\"Southwestern University\">Southwestern University</a>, in Georgetown, TX and <a href=\"/wiki/Baylor_University\" title=\"Baylor University\">Baylor University</a>, in Waco, TX.

In a single-sex institution, the homecoming court will usually consist of only a king and a prince (for an all-male school) or a queen and a princess (for an all-female school), although some schools may choose to join with single-gender schools of the other gender to elect the homecoming court jointly.\n</p><p>Generally, the king and queen are students completing their final years of study at their school (also called \u201cseniors\u201d), while the prince and princess are underclassmen, often with a prince/princess for each grade. Recently, some high schools have chosen to add categories, such as duke and duchess, to extend the representation of students to include a category in which students with special needs are elected. In high school, 17- or 18-year-old students in their final year are represented by a king or queen; in college, students who are completing their final year of study, usually between 21 and 23 years old.\n</p><p>Local rules determine when the homecoming king and queen are crowned. Sometimes, the big announcement comes at a <a href=\"/wiki/Pep_rally\" title=\"Pep rally\">pep rally</a>, school assembly, or public ceremony one or more days before the football game. Other schools crown their royalty at the homecoming football game, a dance, or other school event.\n</p><p>Often, the previous year's king and queen are invited back to crown their successors. If they are absent for whatever reason, someone else\u2014usually, another previous king or queen, a popular teacher, or other designated person\u2014will perform those duties. Usually, the queen is crowned first, followed by the king. The crowning method also varies by school.\n</p><p>Homecoming court members who are not crowned king or queen are often called escorts or royalty. They are often expected to participate in the week's activities as well.

The parade includes the school's marching band and different school organizations\u2019 floats created by the classes and organizations and most of the sports get a chance to be in the parade.

Alumni gather from all around the world to return to their alma mater, reconnect with one another, and take part in the festivities. Students, alumni, businesses, and members of the community set up tents in parking lots, fields, and streets near the stadium to cook food, play games, socialize, binge drink, and even enjoy live music in many instances. These celebrations often last straight through the game for those who do not have tickets but still come to take part in the socializing and excitement of the homecoming atmosphere.

Many colleges and high schools no longer hold bonfires because of accidents that have occurred surrounding these events in the past.

Mums usually consist of artificial <a href=\"/wiki/Chrysanthemum\" title=\"Chrysanthemum\">chrysanthemums</a> (real chrysanthemums were originally used) surrounded by decorated floor-length ribbon and little trinkets. The tradition is that the boys create a personalized mum in their school colors, making white and silver for seniors only, for their date. Girls make garters for their date which are similar to mums but shorter and worn on the boy's arm. The size of the mums and garters tend to grow in proportion to the grade that the receiver is in. In the 1980s, mums were usually a maximum of three chrysanthemums and a few ribbons and only worn by those on the homecoming court (i.e., the prince or princess), but, as the years have gone by, the size and expectation of mums have increased, and have become more elaborate, being worn by almost all of the students. Depending on the school, mums can get quite competitive, expensive, and drastically bigger than they previously were intended to be. Different items are also placed on mums than there previously were, such as LEDs, bubble containers, cow bells, feather boas, stuffed animals of all sizes, etc. They now sometimes act like scrapbooks made of ribbon and even contain passages and photos of the mum/garter receiver and their date. The detail, size, and price usually varies depending on the school, town, and couple. The tradition is to make the mum and garter after the couple is asked to homecoming, and exchange them on the night of the homecoming game and wear it throughout tailgating and the game. Couples often take group pictures with their mums and garters the evening of or the evening before the homecoming game to showcase them. In cases where students go to separate schools, the students present their date with a mum/garter that represents the school that their date attends. It is common to incorporate their date's home school in some way, e.g. a single ribbon with the other school\u2019s emblem and the date's initials.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Homecoming_dance\">Homecoming dance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homecoming&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Homecoming dance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Unreferenced\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>does not <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\">cite</a> any <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">sources</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homecoming&amp;action=edit\">improve this section</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.

The venue is decorated, and either a disc jockey or band is hired to play music. In many ways, it is a fall <a href=\"/wiki/Prom\" title=\"Prom\">prom</a>. Homecoming dances could be informal as well just like standard school dances. At high schools, the homecoming dances are sometimes held in the high school gymnasium or outside in a large field. Homecoming dance attire is less formal than prom. Females generally wear knee length dresses with their hair down, and males generally wear a tucked in dress shirt with pants. At prom, females generally wear a more formal gown that goes to the ground with hair up, and males wear suits and tuxedos.\n</p><p>Since most colleges are too large to facilitate a campus-wide dance, these events are usually handled instead by student organizations such as fraternities, sororities, and residential colleges. Because football and alumni events are the focal points of collegiate homecoming, dances often take place during a different week when schedules are more permitting, or not at all.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Competitions\">Competitions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homecoming&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Competitions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At the high school level, students generally compete by grade level in events such as the spirit days, parade floats, and <a href=\"/wiki/Powder_puff_football\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Powder puff football\">powder puff football</a>. The competition at the collegiate level is mainly between Greek-letter organizations and, to a lesser degree, residence halls. At most larger schools, fraternities and sororities compete on parade floats, house decorations, skits, talent competitions, and even service events such as blood drives or food drives. Sometimes on coronation night, some schools have games that they play between classes. Such events include the pyramid, the 3 legged race, the pop chug, and tug of war.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Smaller_school_homecomings\">Smaller school homecomings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homecoming&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Smaller school homecomings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While most schools schedule their homecoming activities around football, smaller schools that do not field a football team may plan the annual event at another time of the year. In these instances, basketball, ice hockey or soccer serves as the \"big game\" for students and alumni. Often in smaller towns with smaller populations, the parade is omitted.\n</p><p>At schools without athletic programs, the centerpiece event is usually a banquet, where alumni are recognized. This format is also used for alumni events of high schools that have either closed or consolidated with other high schools; the high school classes continue to meet and celebrate their years at their now-defunct <a href=\"/wiki/Alma_mater\" title=\"Alma mater\">alma mater</a>. In other cases, alumni of closed schools will participate with the consolidated school's homecoming, where special recognition is often given for alumni of the once-separate schools.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Courtwarming\">Courtwarming</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Homecoming&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Courtwarming\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In some parts of the country, high school basketball has gained a homecoming celebration of its own.
