"Godiva's Hymn", "Engineer's Hymn" or "Engineers' Drinking Song" is a traditional drinking song for engineers.  Versions of it have been associated with the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as MIT and various universities,  and is now often performed by the MIT a cappella group The Chorallaries.  In many university engineering faculties, military engineering corps and other engineering organizations and societies, Lady Godiva is a school icon or mascot. Godiva's Hymn is sung either to the tune of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" or "The Son of a Gambolier". Near Christmas, it is a tradition of the Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad (sic) of the University of Toronto to sing Godiva's Hymn to the tune of Good King Wenceslaus. One Version of the Chorus is as follows:  We are We are We are We are-- We are the engineers-- We can We can We can We can-- Demolish forty beers-- Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum all day-- and come along with us for-- We don't give a damn for any old man-- Who don't give a damn for us-- One of Godiva's Verses:  Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride-- To show to all the villagers her fine and lily-white hide-- The most observant villager, an engineer of course-- Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse-- A bawdy parody of the engineer's song, known as Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel, was famously recorded during the 1940s by Oscar Brand.  It later served as the inspiration for an episode of Dad's Army.    Â An engineer told me before he died And I have no reason to say he lied That though he tried throughout his life He could never satisfy his wife  Round and round went the great big wheel In and out went the rod of steel I'll lay you money on a surefire bet That the great big wheel is a-turning yet  So he mounted up a great big wheel  And there upon set a rod of steel Two brass balls were filled with cream And the whole darn thing was run by steam  Round and round went the great big wheel In and out went the rod of steel I'll lay you money on a surefire bet That the great big wheel is a-turning yet  Then he rolled it up to the bedroom door And the wheel started up with a mighty roar It rolled to the bedpost and rolled on top And pumped his wife til she hollered stop  Round and round went the great big wheel In and out went the rod of steel I'll lay you money on a surefire bet That the great big wheel is a-turning yet  But the great big wheel went right on through Til the engineer's wife was split in two Then as if possessed by a monstrous whim It turned around and mounted him  Round and round went the great big wheel In and out went the rod of steel I'll lay you money on a surefire bet That the great big wheel is a-turning yet  Then it rolled through the streets and into town Mounting people up and down Covered them all with grease and cream And disappeared in a cloud of steam  Round and round went the great big wheel In and out went the rod of steel I'll lay you money on a surefire bet That the great big wheel is a-turning yet  So if some day you should see a wheel With two brass balls and a rod of steel Run to the prairie, run to the hill Unless you're looking for a longtime thrill  Round and round went the great big wheel In and out went the rod of steel I'll lay you money on a surefire bet That the great big wheel is a-turning yet
