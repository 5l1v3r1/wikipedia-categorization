They are used for the upper and medium resonators, laryngeal cartilage, bones and air cavities in the head and throat. A characteristic feature of this kind of voice is its brightness and intensity, more important than the smooth running and control of breathing. Most of the traditional songs feature the modal voice register. It had been practiced since ancient times among the rural population in Central and Eastern Europe.
