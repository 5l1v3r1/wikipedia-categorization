Belo platno (White Linen) is a music ensemble from Belgrade, Serbia, which plays traditional music of Serbia, mostly from Kosovo and Metohia  but also from Macedonia in wider sense. The group was founded in 1997  and it became "among most successful ensembles" in Serbia.  One of its founders is its leader Vladimir Simić. Belo platno is one of the first vocal-instrumental ensembles in Serbia that has chosen modal approach to music for its expression, belonging to the older tradition of the Balkans and Serbia. It is characterized by the special way of forming harmony, through the relationship with the basic melody, the supporting flat tone – bordun (the absence of major-minor harmony). Belo platno uses traditional musical instruments – kaval, tambura, lute, dvoyanka flute, def, goc, tarabuka – or those which eventually became part of the traditional orchestras, such as the violin and cello. Part of the ensemble instrumentarium Vladimir Simić crafts himself in a family workshop.
