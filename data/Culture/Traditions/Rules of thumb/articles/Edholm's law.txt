Edholm's law, named for Phil Edholm, says the wireless, nomadic and wired network capabilities will converge. Soon, even slower communications channels like cellphones and radio modems will eclipse the capacity of early Ethernet, thanks to upcoming standards known as UMTS and MIMO, which will boost bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage. Extrapolating forward indicates a convergence between the rates of nomadic and wireless technologies around 2030.
