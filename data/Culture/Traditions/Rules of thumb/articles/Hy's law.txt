Hy's law is a rule of thumb that a patient is at high risk of a fatal drug-induced liver injury (DILI) if given a medication that causes hepatocellular injury (not cholestatic injury) with jaundice.   The law is based on observations by Hy Zimmerman, a major scholar of drug-induced liver injury.    Some have suggested the principle be called a hypothesis or observation.  Hy's Law cases have three components:  In Zimmerman's analysis of 116 patients with hepatocellular injury and jaundice due to drug exposure, 76% went on to either require a liver transplant or died.  Other studies have reported a lower but still significant mortality of 10%.
