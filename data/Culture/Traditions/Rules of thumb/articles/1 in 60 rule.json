The rule is used by single pilots with many other tasks to perform, often in a basic aircraft without the aid of an <a href=\"/wiki/Autopilot\" title=\"Autopilot\">autopilot</a>, who need a simple process that can be performed in their heads. This rule is also used by <a href=\"/wiki/Air_traffic_controller\" title=\"Air traffic controller\">air traffic controllers</a> to quickly determine how much to turn an aircraft for separation purposes.\n</p><p>The rule is based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Small-angle_approximation\" title=\"Small-angle approximation\">small-angle approximation</a> (which states that, for small angles, <a href=\"/wiki/Sine\" title=\"Sine\">sin</a> <i>\u03b8</i> \u2248 <i>\u03b8</i>, where <i>\u03b8</i> is in <a href=\"/wiki/Radian\" title=\"Radian\">radians</a>), along with the fact that one radian (which is about 57.3\u00b0) is close to 60\u00b0. In reality a 1 mile in 60 error is 0.96\u00b0, and the rule becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger errors. But since even a skilled pilot cannot manually fly with better than about 2\u00b0 accuracy, and winds are constantly varying, the rule remains useful for most realistic situations.\n</p><p>This rule of thumb is incredibly powerful in the aviation environment. It states that for each degree off (or displacement) over a distance of 60 <a href=\"/wiki/Nautical_mile\" title=\"Nautical mile\">nautical miles</a> (NM), it will result in 1 NM off course. It can be applied in various areas of interest when flying, and is easily remembered. This proves to be valuable in many different scenarios, en route navigation, approach, and even on vertical profiles.\n</p><p>The math behind this shows that this method is not entirely accurate, with roughly a 5% error, but the rule's objective is to get workable numbers in a dynamic environment, and it fits this purpose quite well.\nHere is the breakdown:\n</p><p>A circle of 60 NM radius has a circumference of:\n</p><p>2x60x\u03c0 = 376.99 NM\n</p><p>If we divide 376.99 by 360\u00b0 we get:\n</p><p>376.99/360 = 1.047 NM (off by 4.7%)\n</p><p>We can consider this rule a very good approximation.\n</p><p>As a coincidence, 1 NM is about 6,000 feet (6,076.1 feet) so we can use the 60:1 rule for this too. For a 1 degree shift at 1 NM, there are about 100 feet of offset.\n</p><p>This becomes very useful for estimating or correcting vertical speed settings and flight path angles (FPA) during climb, descent, or approaches.\n</p><p>If a gradient in&#160;% is required, the numbers work out with the same rule:\n</p><p>1% over 1 NM \u2248 60'\n</p><p>It is also useful to find out the lateral deviation from a given <a href=\"/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range\" title=\"VHF omnidirectional range\">VOR</a> course or radial: Each dot on a VOR indicator represents 2\u00b0 of deviation, or 200' per dot per <a href=\"/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment\" title=\"Distance measuring equipment\">DME</a>.\n</p><p>There are other applications to this rule. One such application is time drift.\n</p><p>An hour is equal to 60 minutes, and a minute is equal to 60 seconds, so some other relationships between angle and time can be observed.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examples\">Examples</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1_in_60_rule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Examples\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>If a pilot is flying a leg of 120 miles and finds after traveling 60 miles that he is two miles to the right of track, then a correction of 4\u00b0 to the left (2\u00b0 to fly parallel to the intended track and another 2\u00b0 to bring him to his target) will bring him to his destination.\n</p><p>If a pilot is flying a 120-mile leg and finds after 30 miles that he is two miles left of track, then he has flown 4\u00b0 left of his intended track, i.e.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>2 &#215; 60/30</dd></dl>\n<p>left of track. Changing the heading four degrees right will now bring him to parallel the intended track. At that point he still has 90 miles to his next waypoint. He is thus two miles to the left of that and thus the waypoint is 4/3 of a degree (2 &#215; 60/90) to the right, or approximately 1\u00b0 right. The pilot then adds these two to get 5\u00b0 and flies 5\u00b0 right of t his previous heading.\n</p><p>One can also use the 1 in 60 rule to approximate distance from a <a href=\"/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range\" title=\"VHF omnidirectional range\">VOR</a>, by flying 90 degrees to a radial and timing how long it takes to fly 10 degrees (the limit of the <a href=\"/wiki/Course_deviation_indicator\" title=\"Course deviation indicator\">course deviation indicator</a>). The time in seconds divided by 10 is roughly equal to the time in minutes from the station, at the current <a href=\"/wiki/Ground_speed\" title=\"Ground speed\">ground speed</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1_in_60_rule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.recreationalflying.com/tutorials/navigation/enroute.html\">Recreational Flying Enroute</a></li>\n<li>Taylor, Richard L., <i>Fair Weather Flying</i>, MacMillan 1981, p.&#160;193, <a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-02-616730-1\" title=\"Special:BookSources/0-02-616730-1\">0-02-616730-1</a></li>\n<li>Mike Roumens, \"M3: The Mile, The Mach, The Minute, Mental Math For Aviators\", pages 2\u20135, Copyright 2013, <a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/1484846427\" title=\"Special:BookSources/1484846427\">1484846427</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1255\nCached time: 20180909200315\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.040 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.064 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 469/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 2029/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 771/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 15/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.004/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 712 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   46.295      1 -total\n 99.87%   46.236      2 Template:ISBN\n 30.63%   14.181      2 Template:Catalog_lookup_link\n 15.64%    7.241      2 Template:Error-small\n 10.77%    4.988      6 Template:Yesno-no\n  6.53%    3.023      6 Template:Yesno\n  6.03%    2.794     12 Template:Trim\n  4.84%    2.241      2 Template:Main_other\n  3.33%    1.542      2 Template:Tl\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:980813-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909200315 and revision id 816435015\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Air_navigation"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Rules_of_thumb"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Air navigation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Air traffic controller"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Autopilot"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Course deviation indicator"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Distance measuring equipment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ground speed"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"International Standard Book Number"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nautical mile"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Radian"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rule of thumb"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sine"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Small-angle approximation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"VHF omnidirectional range"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:ISBN"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Catalog lookup link"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Trim"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Yesno-no"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Yesno"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Error-small"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Tl"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check isxn"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Error"}],"images":["Fan_lines_and_correction_angle.png"],"externallinks":["http://www.recreationalflying.com/tutorials/navigation/enroute.html"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Examples","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"1_in_60_rule","byteoffset":2921,"anchor":"Examples"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"1_in_60_rule","byteoffset":4131,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"1 in 60 rule","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4596037"}]}}
