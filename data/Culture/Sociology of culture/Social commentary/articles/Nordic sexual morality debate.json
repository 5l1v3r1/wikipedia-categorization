The radical one, where <a href=\"/wiki/Edvard_Brandes\" title=\"Edvard Brandes\">Edvard Brandes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Georg_Brandes\" title=\"Georg Brandes\">Georg Brandes</a> were the most known representatives, demanded that women be free to enjoy a sexual life prior to marriage, as men were.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Getting_Married_(collection)\" title=\"Getting Married (collection)\"><i>Getting Married</i> (collection)</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/August_Strindberg\" title=\"August Strindberg\">August Strindberg</a> and the legal court case that surrounded it was one of the perhaps most known incidents during the debate. It also caused a debate within the literary world whether literature should touch these questions at all. Other well-known works in the debate are <a href=\"/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen\" title=\"Henrik Ibsen\">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s play <i>A Doll's House</i> (Et Dukkehjem), the novel <i>Money</i> (Pengar) by <a href=\"/wiki/Viktoria_Benedictsson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Viktoria Benedictsson\">Viktoria Benedictsson</a>, and the novel <i>Pyrhussegrar</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Stella_Kleve\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stella Kleve\">Stella Kleve</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_sexual_morality_debate&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Modern_Breakthrough\" title=\"Modern Breakthrough\">Modern Breakthrough</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sexual_liberation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sexual liberation\">Sexual liberation</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nordic_sexual_morality_debate&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Franka Gebert, Den stora nordiska sedlighetsdebatten, Riksteatern, 2008. pdf</li>\n<li>Nationalencyklopedin: Sedlighetsdebatten</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1250\nCached time: 20180905080236\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.010 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 19/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:48653586-0!canonical and timestamp 20180905080236 and revision id 851500571\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"da","url":"https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den_nordiske_s%C3%A6delighedsfejde","langname":"Danish","autonym":"dansk","*":"Den nordiske s\u00e6delighedsfejde"},{"lang":"no","url":"https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedelighetsdebatten","langname":"Norwegian","autonym":"norsk","*":"Sedelighetsdebatten"},{"lang":"sv","url":"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedlighetsdebatten","langname":"Swedish","autonym":"svenska","*":"Sedlighetsdebatten"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"1880s_in_Denmark"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1880s_in_Norway"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1880s_in_Sweden"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Criticisms_by_ideology"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Cultural_history_of_Denmark"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Cultural_history_of_Norway"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Cultural_history_of_Sweden"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Morality"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Political_debates"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Scandals_in_Denmark"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Scandals_in_Norway"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Scandals_in_Sweden"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Sexual_ethics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_commentary"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_ethics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_history_of_Denmark"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_history_of_Norway"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Social_history_of_Sweden"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"August Strindberg"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Double standard"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Edvard Brandes"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Georg Brandes"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Getting Married (collection)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Henrik Ibsen"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Modern Breakthrough"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scandinavia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sexual liberation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Stella Kleve"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Svenska Federationen"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Viktoria Benedictsson"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Nordic_sexual_morality_debate","byteoffset":1634,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Nordic_sexual_morality_debate","byteoffset":1698,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Nordic sexual morality debate","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q10665022"}]}}
