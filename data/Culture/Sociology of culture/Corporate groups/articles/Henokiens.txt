The Henokiens is an association of companies who have been continuously operating and remain family-owned for 200 years or more, and whose descendants still operate at management level.  It derives its name from the biblical patriarch Enoch (Hénoch in French), who lived for 365 years before he was taken by God instead of dying.  Founded in 1981 by the then-chairman of Marie Brizard, the association started with 4 French members  and now counts 47.  Its stated objective and raison d'être is to promote long-term decision making, notably through its Da Vinci Prize.  Its oldest member is the Japanese Hōshi ryokan (founded 717), and the most recent the Austrian jewellery firm A. E. Köchert (founded 1814). The association includes forty-four members. Marie Brizard, having been bought by an investment fund in 2000, is not a member anymore.
