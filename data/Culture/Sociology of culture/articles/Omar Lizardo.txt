In 2008, he won the Clifford Geertz Prize for Best Article in Cultural Sociology for How cultural tastes shape social networks.  In this article, Lizardo confronts the "traditional network model" in which cultural taste formation and transmission is shaped and determined by social networks, and instead asks "whether cultural tastes and practices themselves have an independent effect on social structure (conceived as patterns of network relations)."  He concludes that "popular culture" is characterized wide appeal and ease of incorporation and is therefore associated with more weak ties (i.e. used to bridge), while "highbrow culture" is more exclusive and serves to strengthen close ties (i.e. used to fence). In 2013, Lizardo won the Lewis Coser Award for Theoretical Agenda Setting, which is "intended to recognize a mid-career sociologist whose work holds great promise for setting the agenda in the field of sociology.‚Äù  In 2014, with co-author Robert Fishman, Lizardo won the Charles Tilly Best Article Award for Comparative and Historical Sociology for his publication How macro-historical change shapes cultural taste: Legacies of democratization in Spain and Portugal.  In 2014, along with co-author Melissa Fletcher Pirkey, Lizardo wrote the lead article for Volume 40 of Contemporary Perspectives on Organizational Social Networks entitled How organizational theory can help network theorizing: Linking structure and dynamics via cross-level analogies.
