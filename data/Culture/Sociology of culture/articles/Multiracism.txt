Multiracism is the conflict between the various ethnic communities that conform a state, based on the belief that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race. The term focuses upon the social and economic life of the ethnicities, demonstrating that while some have found economic success, others have remained underprivileged. Many ethnic groups have tried to maintain a unity especially through language, religion, politics and culture. Similarly, many ethnic groups have faced varying types of hostility from both the state and other ethnic groups.
