The scene subculture is a subculture that was common during the late 2000s and early–mid 2010s. Members of this subculture are called scene kids, scene people, or scenesters. Scene people are known for their fashion consisting of skinny jeans, bright colored clothing, and straight, flat hair with long bangs covering the forehead, sometimes with the hair being dyed colors like blond, pink, red, green, or bright blue. Scene people are known for listening to multiple types of music artists, specifically artists like crunkcore and electropop artists such as Brokencyde and Blood on the Dance Floor and deathcore, electronicore and metalcore bands such as Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence and Asking Alexandria. The scene subculture began in the mid 2000s and became common during the late 2000s and early–mid 2010s. During the late 2000s and early–mid 2010s, scene fashion became common and music that scene people listen to achieved underground, moderate or mainstream success. Music artists like Bring Me the Horizon, Asking Alexandria, and Blood on the Dance Floor achieved moderate success while music artists like 3OH!3, Metro Station, Cobra Starship, and Owl City became extremely mainstream. In the late 2010s, the scene subculture declined. The scene subculture has been confused a lot with the emo subculture. Scene fashion consists of skinny jeans, bright colored clothing, ear gauges, sunglasses, piercings, shirts with neon colors, and straight, flat hair with long bangs covering the forehead and sometimes one of both eyes, with the hair sometimes being dyed colors like blond, pink, red, green, or bright blue.    According to The Guardian, a scene girl named Eve O'Brien described scene people as "happy emos".  Scene kids' hairstyles have caused scene fashion to be confused with emo fashion.  Scene people are known for listening to multiple kinds of music artists, specifically artists like Falling in Reverse, Brokencyde, Blood on the Dance Floor, Owl City, Mayday Parade, Jeffree Star, All Time Low, Bring Me the Horizon, Hit the Lights, Suicide Silence, Black Veil Brides, Job for a Cowboy, I See Stars, Hollywood Undead, I Set My Friends on Fire, Enter Shikari, Family Force 5, Breathe Carolina, Restart, Attack Attack!, Abandon All Ships, The Devil Wears Prada, 3OH!3, Paramore, Asking Alexandria, Hellogoodbye, Cute Is What We Aim For, Millionaires, Boys Like Girls, Motion City Soundtrack, Head Automatica, Metro Station, Cobra Starship, and Design the Skyline.           The scene subculture began in the mid-2000s after the emo subculture became mainstream. During the mid-2000s, scene people were in the early deathcore music scene. In a 2005 article by Phoenix New Times, writer Chelsea Mueller described the appearance of the band Job for a Cowboy (a band that was deathcore at the time) by writing that the band "may look like scenesters with shaggy emo haircuts and tight pants, and may mock metal greats, but this death-metal band is for real."  Mueller described Job for a Cowboy as "five guys in girls' jeans and tight band tee shirts".  Another deathcore band, Bring Me the Horizon, was also involved in the early deathcore scene. Bring Me the Horizon is known for being listened to by scene people.  According to an article by The Sydney Morning Herald from March 30, 2008, emo people have criticized the scene subculture with emo people accusing scene people of "ripping off their style".  During the late 2000s and early–mid 2010s, the scene subculture became a big subculture, with many music artists listened to by scene people achieving underground, moderate or mainstream success. When the scene subculture became a very known subculture, the subculture was extremely hated by metalheads, who would refer to scene people's favorite music artists as "shitcore", "emocore", or "mallcore". These metalheads were known for hating genres of heavy metal music that had names ending with "core".
