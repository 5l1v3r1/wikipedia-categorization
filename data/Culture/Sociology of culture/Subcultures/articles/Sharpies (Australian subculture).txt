Sharpies, or Sharps, were members of suburban youth gangs in Australia, most significantly from the 1960s and 1970s.  They were particularly prominent in Melbourne, but were also found in Sydney and Perth to lesser extents. Sharpies were known for being violent, although a strict moral code was also evident. The name comes from their focus on looking and dressing "sharp".  Sharpies would often congregate in large numbers, regularly attending live bands at town hall and high school dances   Common clothing items included Lee or Levi jeans, cardigans, jumpers, and T-shirts—often individually designed by group members.  Mods were an enemy of sharpies, and their gang brawls were reported in the newspapers during 1966.  In a 2002 interview, a former sharpie stated that despite the sharpie culture being quite violent — especially as they crossed other gangs' territories on the public transport network — the altercations were restricted to inter-gang rivalries.
