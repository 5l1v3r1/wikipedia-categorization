Tarring and feathering is a physical punishment, used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in feudal Europe and its colonies in the early modern period, as well as the early American frontier, mostly as a type of mob vengeance (compare Lynch law). It is also used in modern popular culture. The image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a metaphor for public humiliation many years after the practice became uncommon.  To tar and feather someone can mean to punish or severely criticize that person.    This example comes from Dark Summer by Iris Johansen: "But you'd tar and feather me if I made the wrong decision for these guys."
