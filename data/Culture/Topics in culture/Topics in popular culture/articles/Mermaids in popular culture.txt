Mermaids, like many other creatures of mythology and folklore, are regularly depicted in literature, film, music, and beauty. Mermaids have long been associated with music , and much like that of Orpheus, the power of their singing voices is said to have had the ability to enthrall. Along with their legendary vanity, the hair-combing and mirrors, the association of mermaids with music is coupled with another association of a vocal nature: they are said to be able to confer verbal eloquence , much like the Muses of the ancient Greek myths.
