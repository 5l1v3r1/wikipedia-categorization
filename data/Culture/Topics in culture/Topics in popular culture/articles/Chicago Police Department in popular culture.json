In the film, the corpse of the [fictional] <a href=\"/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois\" title=\"Cook County, Illinois\">Cook County</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Cook_County_Sheriff%27s_Office\" title=\"Cook County Sheriff&#39;s Office\">Sheriff</a> had been disposed of by his killers by secretly entombing him within the cornerstone.</li>\n<li>Two notable exceptions to Daley's ban were made in for films released in 1975.  In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Brannigan_(film)\" title=\"Brannigan (film)\">Brannigan</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Wayne\" title=\"John Wayne\">John Wayne</a> portrays Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan.
