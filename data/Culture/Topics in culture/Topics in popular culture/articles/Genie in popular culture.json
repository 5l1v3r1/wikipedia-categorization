The once-genie vows to lead a good life, unlike his former master trapped in the bottle. As told in a previous comic \"I Am the Genie\" (<i>Astonishing Tales</i> #3), this is a brief retelling of that story. Months later, a wandering man comes across the bottle and opens it, but seeing nothing but an old, muddy relic discards it, without releasing the emerald genie inside. Now masterless, the green genie begins to plague humanity, first by repelling the law of gravity, transforming cats and dogs into huge monsters and bringing the Moon closer to Earth. The evil green genie then conjures up an army of giant soldiers to conquer Earth. Still wanting more, he decides to conquer all of space, by leading an invasion force of ships across the stars. In the end, it is his undoing, as once in deep space, beyond Earthly influences, his powers fade, undoing all his magic.

He appears whenever the two halves of a magic ring are put together.</li>\n<li>The 1987 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Outing_(film)\" title=\"The Outing (film)\">The Outing</a></i> featured an evil jinni who is unleashed in a museum and hunts down the teens who let it out.</li>\n<li>The horror film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wishmaster_(film)\" title=\"Wishmaster (film)\">Wishmaster</a></i> features an evil djinn as its villain, the Djinn attempting to trick people into making wishes so that it can gain power in the real world to unleash the forces of the Djinn upon the world and from the void where they have been trapped at the moment God created the world. Although the Djinn can grant wishes to others, these wishes involve the wish-maker sacrificing their souls for what they asked- and the Djinn can even twist their words and taunts around into actual wishes to be used against them if it is phrased properly-, and only the person who released it from the gem can ask for and receive the necessary wishes to release the Jinn's full power without losing their soul (The Djinn even granted its 'master' a test wish that would not count towards the original three which resulted in it being ordered to shoot itself in the head, albeit to prove that it couldn't die). The Jinn was defeated in the first film when the Jinn's master used her third wish to undo the chain of events that led to the Jinn escaping in the first place. The film has spawned three sequels, the first sequel featuring the Djinn being once again defeated by a wish that negated the circumstances of its escape, while the other two featured its victims wishing for the aid of an angel to kill the Djinn.</li>\n<li>In the animated series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Mystery_(animated_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Martin Mystery (animated series)\">Martin Mystery</a></i>, episodes called \"Curse of the Djini\" and \"Return of the Djini\" featured an evil jinni trapped in a skull who could read peoples' mind\u2019s and make them state their wishes. If the jinni died, the wishes would be undone.</li>\n<li>In the episode \"The Wish\" of the UPN horror/comedy series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Special_Unit_2\" title=\"Special Unit 2\">Special Unit 2</a></i>, Special Unit 2 encountered an evil genie-like link who needed to grant 3,000 wishes in order to gain free will. Unlike traditional jinn, this genie did not have supernatural powers other than the ability to transform between gas and solid states. As a result, the genie had to carry out wishes physically; for example, if someone wished for a million dollars the genie had to break into a bank and steal a million dollars for them, or if someone wished for a relationship with a beautiful model the genie would have to kidnap the model. These wishes almost always ended in disaster for the genie's masters. After 3,000 wishes had been granted the genie would no longer have to live in bottles or grant wishes.</li>\n<li>Two episodes of the TV series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Charmed\" title=\"Charmed\">Charmed</a></i> featured different types of genie; the first episode, \"Be Careful What You Witch For\", featured a genie whose wishes unintentionally caused disaster for the sisters despite his efforts to help, while the second episode, \"I Dream of Phoebe\" featured them facing a demon who had been trapped in a bottle and turned into a genie as a punishment, the genie nearly escaping when she tricks one of the sisters into wishing her free at the cost of her taking the genie's place, but they eventually manage to trap her back in the bottle by possessing the demon and making her wish them free.</li>\n<li>An episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Supernatural_(U.S._TV_series)\" title=\"Supernatural (U.S. TV series)\">Supernatural</a></i>, \"<a href=\"/wiki/What_Is_and_What_Should_Never_Be_(Supernatural)\" title=\"What Is and What Should Never Be (Supernatural)\">What Is And What Should Never Be</a>\", featured protagonist <a href=\"/wiki/Dean_Winchester\" title=\"Dean Winchester\">Dean</a> hunting a Djinn who did not actually grant wishes; the Djinn instead caused the victim to enter a dream in which their greatest wish was granted, allowing the Djinn to drain and feed on their blood-in Dean's case, that his mother had never been killed-although Dean was able to escape the dream when he confronted the Djinn after realizing the consequences of his wish (believing that he was still in a real world where those he and his family had saved as hunters died without them there to save them). A \"bastard offshoot\" of Djinn induce a similar type of dream, but instead of a person's wishes, it shows them their greatest fears, scaring them to death while allowing the Djinn to feed off the fear.</li>\n<li>Some episodes of the TV series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i> featured vengeance demons, a race of demons who granted wishes for humans seeking revenge for various wrongs; like malevolent genies, these wishes commonly featured the exact wording of the wish being obeyed while not giving the wishmaker what they fundamentally wanted. For instance, <a href=\"/wiki/Cordelia_Chase\" title=\"Cordelia Chase\">Cordelia Chase</a>'s wish that <a href=\"/wiki/Buffy_Summers\" title=\"Buffy Summers\">Buffy Summers</a> never came to <a href=\"/wiki/Sunnydale\" title=\"Sunnydale\">Sunnydale</a>-believing that she would thus escape the loss of social status that she had suffered due to her association with Buffy-created a world where vampires were in control without the Slayer to aid the humans, and <a href=\"/wiki/Dawn_Summers\" title=\"Dawn Summers\">Dawn Summers</a>'s wish that nobody would leave her resulted in the guests at Buffy's 21st birthday party being unable to leave her house.</li>\n<li>In a season 7 episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_X-Files\" title=\"The X-Files\">The X-Files</a></i> titled \"<a href=\"/wiki/Je_Souhaite\" title=\"Je Souhaite\">Je Souhaite</a>\", a man awakens a genie who grants him three wishes, but always uses loopholes, resulting in often disastrous outcomes for the person.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Desiree_(Danny_Phantom)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Desiree (Danny Phantom)\">Desiree</a> from the animated series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Danny_Phantom\" title=\"Danny Phantom\">Danny Phantom</a></i> is a genie-like ghost who grants any wishes she hears, gaining power by doing so. Her wishes, though, can carry disastrous consequences, like when Sam Manson wished she never met Danny Fenton, it resulted in him remaining fully human. In her former life, she was the favorite <a href=\"/wiki/Harem\" title=\"Harem\">harem</a> girl of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sultan\" title=\"Sultan\">sultan</a>, who fell in love with her and gave her a kingdom of her own.

Although the series' main character <a href=\"/wiki/Timmy_Turner\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Timmy Turner\">Timmy Turner</a> initially attempted to use Norm for three rule-free wishes in his first appearance-his fairies being restricted to rules such as not being able to make anyone fall in love or help the wisher win contests-he subsequently realized his mistake and, having gained three more wishes by trapping Norm in a vacuum, subsequently wished for a lawyer to help him draw up another wish to ensure that there would be no way for Norm to \"cheat\" his way out of the wish. Norm has appeared as a recurring adversary in subsequent stories. One occasion saw him teaming up with Timmy's teacher/enemy Denzel Crocker-Norm revealing that Crocker could actually wish for more wishes to help him against Timmy, claiming that genies have been \"bluffing for centuries\" about only being able to grant three wishes and no more-but Crocker's incompetence, as he makes various inappropriate and useless wishes, drove Norm to give the lamp back to Timmy just to get away from him. On another occasion, Norm manipulated events so that Timmy would drive Cosmo and Wanda away so that he could become a fairy godparent himself and no longer be bound to his bottle, but his ignorance of 'magical backup'-where a godparent <i>has</i> to grant wishes or explode-prompted him to undo his actions and allow Cosmo and Wanda to return to Timmy.</li>\n<li>In the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wizards_of_Waverly_Place\" title=\"Wizards of Waverly Place\">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></i> episode \"Justin's Little Sister\" on <a href=\"/wiki/Disney_Channel\" title=\"Disney Channel\">Disney Channel</a>, Alex calls upon a genie for wishes, which the genie twists.</li>\n<li>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/DuckTales\" title=\"DuckTales\">DuckTales</a></i>, Scrooge and Flintheart Glomgold gain a lamp containing a genie when they fall into a cave system and they compete to determine which of them will be the genie's master as they both rubbed it simultaneously. Having won the race, Flintheart's first wish is that the genie leave Scrooge on a desert island, but when he remarks that he wants to see the look on Scrooge's face, which the genie takes as his second wish, sending him to the island with Scrooge. On the island, Flintheart comments, \"I wish we'd never found this blasted lamp!\", causing the genie to reset history so that the lamp fell into the rubble when Scrooge and Flintheart fell into the cavern and both of them thus missed it.</li>\n<li>An episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chip_%27n_Dale:_Rescue_Rangers\" title=\"Chip &#39;n Dale: Rescue Rangers\">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></i> featured the main character Montery Jack finding a lamp with a genie, only to turn into the genie himself when he uses a wish to free the genie, resulting in him being used by the Rangers' enemy Fat Cat to destroy his friends. Fortunately, Fat Cat is forced to pass the lamp on to his henchmen after he exhausts his own three wishes, allowing Monterey to trick the henchmen into making wishes that will actually benefit his friends until Chip and Dale can get their hands on the lamp. The chipmunks subsequently wish that the previous events never happened, undoing the events that led to Montery finding the lamp.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_and_the_Genie\" title=\"Bernard and the Genie\">Bernard and the Genie</a></i> is a 1991 BBC comedy about a hapless art dealer who discovers himself to be in possession of a real life genie imprisoned in a lamp.</li>\n<li>In the 1992 <a href=\"/wiki/Disney\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disney\">Disney</a> film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)\" title=\"Aladdin (1992 Disney film)\">Aladdin</a></i>, the title hero becomes the master of a benevolent and comical genie, voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Robin_Williams\" title=\"Robin Williams\">Robin Williams</a>, after rubbing the side of a magical lamp. <a href=\"/wiki/Genie_(Disney_character)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Genie (Disney character)\">Genie</a> offers Aladdin three wishes on anything he wished, with explicitly only three limitations: Genie could not kill anyone, make anyone fall in love, or bring people back from the dead (although his words implied that he <i>could</i> bring people back from the dead, but it is so horrifying that he <i>will</i> not do it) - and also underscoring that he grants only \"three wishes\", so one cannot \"wish for more wishes\". He is also required to obey the specific wishes of whoever holds the lamp, thus forcing him to work for Aladdin's enemy Jafar when Jafar steals the lamp, although he was also able to assist Aladdin without Aladdin explicitly making a wish, even if he appeared to disapprove of the concept. In the spin-off TV series, Genie was freed from his lamp, now able to come and go from the lamp as he wished, which apparently resulted in his powers being 'downgraded' so that he had less power than demonstrated in the film (now describing himself as possessing 'semi-phenomenal nearly-cosmic power' as opposed to his previous description of himself as possessing 'phenomenal cosmic power'). The <a href=\"/wiki/Aladdin_(TV_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aladdin (TV series)\">TV series spin-off</a> features an additional genie named <a href=\"/wiki/Eden_(Aladdin)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eden (Aladdin)\">Eden</a>, originally a Genie of the Bottle, who becomes the girlfriend of Aladdin's Genie, although her master's third wish that they could always be together puts Genie's relationship with Eden on hold until her master dies.</li>\n<li>In the 1996 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Kazaam\" title=\"Kazaam\">Kazaam</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal\" title=\"Shaquille O&#39;Neal\">Shaquille O'Neal</a> played a rapping genie who lived in a boombox.</li>\n<li>In the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Timon_%26_Pumbaa_(TV_series)\" title=\"Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)\">Timon &amp; Pumbaa</a></i> TV series, two episodes saw the characters deal with wishes. \"Wishy Washy\" sees the two characters find a lamp and wish for a million wishes, only to wish they never found the lamp after their impulsive wishes prove too troublesome, such as Pumbaa being sent to the Arctic. \"Be More Pacific\" sees Pumbaa get three wishes from a wishing whale, but after his first two wishes fail-the wish for something big and expensive just gives them the <a href=\"/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty\" title=\"Statue of Liberty\">Statue of Liberty</a>, and the wish for Timon to be a king makes him the size of <a href=\"/wiki/King_Kong\" title=\"King Kong\">King Kong</a>-his third wish sees him misremember a key detail, resulting in them being pursued through a castle by a giant fire-breathing chicken that they cannot defeat (Timon having requested a '<a href=\"/wiki/Dragon\" title=\"Dragon\">fire-breathing monster with claws and wings</a>' that he <i>can</i> defeat).</li>\n<li>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pee_Wee%27s_Playhouse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pee Wee&#39;s Playhouse\">Pee Wee's Playhouse</a></i>, Jambi was a blue-faced genie who lived in a jeweled box.
