They live among humans, and only need to eat human flesh once a month. If a Ghoul consumes human food, not only does it taste horrible, but if it is not <a href=\"/wiki/Vomiting\" title=\"Vomiting\">thrown back up</a>, makes them ill. Human/Ghoul hybrids are rare, but are said to possess much greater strength than ordinary ghouls. Hybrids were believed to only appear on the rare occasion that a human and a Ghoul successfully mated, until the advent of protagonist Kaneki Ken, a regular human until ghoul organs are transplanted into his body.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hellsing\" title=\"Hellsing\">Hellsing</a></i>, ghouls are zombie-like creatures that are created when a \"chipped\" (technological) vampire drains a victim to death, or, in the manga, where a vampire drains the blood of someone who is not a virgin. If fatally wounded, they instantly crumble to dust. They are under the control of the vampire who bites them, eat human flesh, and are intelligent enough to use firearms. It is not rare to see a vampire amass a small army of Ghouls for offence and defence.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In the manga <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rosario_%2B_Vampire\" title=\"Rosario + Vampire\">Rosario + Vampire</a></i>, ghouls are a type of mindless, cannibalistic monster that are created in two manners. Ordinary ghouls are created when an evil spirit possesses a corpse. Rarely, ghouls are created when a human repeatedly has monster blood injected into their veins. The monster blood grants the ghoul supernatural power but at the same time destroys the psyche, leaving them a mindless killing machine. They resemble vampires but are easily identified by the web-like marking surrounding the bite mark where the monster blood was injected and their complete lack of self-control. The lead male character, <a href=\"/wiki/Tsukune_Aono\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tsukune Aono\">Tsukune Aono</a>, eventually becomes one such ghoul due to the continuous intake of vampiric blood from <a href=\"/wiki/Moka_Akashiya\" title=\"Moka Akashiya\">Moka Akashiya</a>. Although thanks to some intervention he was able to regain almost all of his humanity and senses by having the vampire blood sealed through a Holy Lock. Although, for a time, there's still a danger he'll revert to a ghoul again. Eventually, Tsukune overcomes the vampire blood and becomes a full-fledged vampire himself.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Literature\">Literature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ghouls_in_popular_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Literature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg/220px-Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"319\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg/330px-Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg/440px-Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"712\" data-file-height=\"1031\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Amine_Discovered_with_the_Goule.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"Amine Discovered with the Goule\", from the story of Sidi Nouman, of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights\" title=\"One Thousand and One Nights\">One Thousand and One Nights</a></i>.</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights\" title=\"One Thousand and One Nights\">One Thousand and One Nights</a></i> is the earliest surviving literature that mentions ghouls,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and many of the stories in that collection involve or reference ghouls.

The only reason Zach's ghouls stayed and worked together was because Zach was controlling them. They will only attack if a person is vulnerable. A ghoul will run from a healthy, strong human being, and is afraid of fire. Like zombies, ghouls have human strength, but seem stronger because the sensations of pain and the 'governors' that keep people from ripping their bodies apart died with them.

Ghouls usually live underground, but sometimes venture outside in small groups to scavenge for <a href=\"/wiki/Carrion\" title=\"Carrion\">carrion</a>. The vomit of the Ghoul is highly poisonous, but can be dispelled using Light Magic. They are first encountered in the Wygol Village cemetery. Gabriel Belmont and his ally Zobek must work together to plug up holes the Ghoul crawl out of. Ghouls that have just fed on a corpse glow yellow and their vomit is highly poisonous. Ghouls also inhabit the Wygol Abbey Catacombs and Bernard Castle. The Vampire Dark Lord, Carmilla uses the ghouls to clean up the remains of her victims, which are prepared by the Evil Butcher. The Ghouls live in cells and are released into the castle's dining room via special hatches, and can be summoned by ringing a bell in the Dining hall near the Kitchen's main entrance. Gabriel must put a piece of meat (most likely human) on a large plate in the dining hall and ring the dinner bell, luring the Ghouls out and allowing him to sneak up into their cell in order to enter the Castle's Kitchen where he must fight the Butcher for a key, that will allow him access to other parts of the castle. The ghouls in <i>Lords of Shadow</i> were heavily inspired by ghouls which appear in various stories by H. P. Lovecraft, being humans mutated from centuries of subterranean living and the consumption of carrion, while their appearance is similar to the genetically engineered Reapers that appeared in the second film of the Blade franchise. Ghouls also appear in <i>Lord of Shadow</i> DLC <i>Reverie</i>, where they attack both Gabriel and his ally high-born vampire Laura who seeks Gabriel's assistance in preventing the escape of the ancient demon, The Forgotten One who had been sealed by the Founders of the Order of Light before they became the Lords of Shadow. In one section, Laura (who briefly acts as a playable character) must fill an altar with blood and must drink blood from the ghouls to restore her life meter (as it is drained when she fills the altar with blood), however she must be careful how much of their blood she drinks from them. The ghouls will continue to spawn until the altar is completely filled with blood.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Ghouls make an appearance in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Middle-earth:_Shadow_of_Mordor\" title=\"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor\">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a></i> and quite possibly <i><a href=\"/wiki/Middle-earth:_Shadow_of_War\" title=\"Middle-earth: Shadow of War\">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a></i> where they are shown to travel and attack in swarms, are led by a <a href=\"/wiki/Matron\" title=\"Matron\">Matron</a>, and choose to live in <a href=\"/wiki/Caves\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Caves\">Caves</a>, Underground Lairs, <a href=\"/wiki/Tombs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tombs\">Tombs</a>, and fetid nests, also in the game the word Ghoul is spelled as Gh\u016bl.
