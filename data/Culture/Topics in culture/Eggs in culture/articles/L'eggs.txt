L'eggs is a brand of pantyhose introduced in 1969 by Hanes. The hosiery placed its product in white plastic oversized chicken-egg-shaped containers. In a time when hosiery products were sold primarily in department and women's clothing stores, L'eggs garnered shelf space in supermarkets and drugstores, often on revolving carousel L'eggs displays called the "L'eggs Boutique". The product's slogan, "Our L'eggs fit your legs", appeared in print and TV ads. Though the L'eggs egg became integral to the brand and their marketing and advertising, in 1991 Hanes ceased packaging the hosiery in the hard plastic containers, as the plastic eggs were seen as an example of wastefulness.
