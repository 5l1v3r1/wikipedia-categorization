A "curate's egg" is something that is described – truthfully or not – as partly bad, but also partly good. In its original usage, it referred to something that is obviously and entirely bad, but is described out of politeness as nonetheless having good features that redeem it.  This meaning has been largely supplanted by its modern usage, which refers to something that is an indeterminate mix of good and bad,   possibly with a preponderance of bad qualities.  The term derives from a cartoon published in the humorous British magazine Punch on 9 November 1895. Drawn by George du Maurier and titled True Humility, it pictures a timid-looking curate eating breakfast in his bishop's house.  The bishop says: "I'm afraid you've got a bad egg, Mr Jones." The curate, desperate not to offend his eminent host and ultimate employer, replies: "Oh no, my Lord, I assure you that parts of it are excellent!" The final issue of Punch, published in 1992, reprinted the cartoon with the caption: Curate: This f***ing egg's off!  Thus Punch drew a contrast with the modern era, implying that younger people have little concern for the niceties of Victorian good manners towards those once considered their social superiors. The following are some examples of actual usage of the term "curate's egg":
