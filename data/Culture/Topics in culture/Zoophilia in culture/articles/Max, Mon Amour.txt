Max, Mon Amour a.k.a. Max, My Love is a 1986 film directed by Nagisa Oshima, starring Charlotte Rampling, Anthony Higgins, Victoria Abril, Pierre Étaix and Milena Vukotic. The screenplay was written by Oshima and Jean-Claude Carrière, and the film was produced by Serge Silberman. Billed on the DVD cover as "the greatest ape romance since King Kong", Max, My Love is the story of a British diplomat in France, Peter Jones (Anthony Higgins), whose wife Margaret (Charlotte Rampling) takes a chimpanzee, Max, for her lover. Co-writer Carriere, producer Silberman and actor Vukotic were all frequent collaborators with Luis Buñuel, and the film resembles his work in its understated, unsensational treatment of frequently outrageous events. The film was entered into the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.
