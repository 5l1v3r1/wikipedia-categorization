Bad Dragon Enterprises, Inc. is an American manufacturer of fantasy-themed sex toys. Products are sold online and at conventions. Bad Dragon was founded in June 2008.   Jan "Varka" Mulders, one of the four co-founders (the others being "Athus", "Narse", and "Raith"), started making sex toys in his college dormitory in Scotland the previous year.   The company is now based in Phoenix, Arizona.  As of  November 2017[update], Bad Dragon offers 61 dildos, 20 penetrable toys, 4 "wearables" (essentially a penis extension), 5 packers, 5 Lil' Vibes (smaller dildos that accompany a small bullet vibrator), 5 Lil' Squirts (very small dildos meant for testing the "Cumtube" feature), and various accessories and merchandise. All of their dildos are made of platinum-cured  silicone.  The company's products are aimed at fantasy fans, including dragons,  horses, orcas, chimeras, and werewolves.     The website formerly gave a biography and picture for each character.    As of  August 15, 2017[update], the website now has only picture of the sex toy in question and details about its physical attributes, although registered users can activate "Fantasy Mode", which replaces standard product descriptions and photos with stories, descriptions, and images that include references to fantasy or anthropomorphic themes. Bad Dragon also offers a 3-D interactive model to view certain areas of each toy. Products are cast by hand and can be extensively customized, with a choice of colors including special requests of firmness, and of dildo  length;  customers can also submit their own designs, some of which are chosen for special production.  Dildos can be ordered with a suction cup that is actually a concave area on the bottom of the dildo, and a "Cumtube" to simulate ejaculation;  the company sells "Cum Lube".    Bad Dragon is featured in the nerd culture documentary Traceroute.
