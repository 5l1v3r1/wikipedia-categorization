Emanuelle Around the World (Emanuelle – Perché violenza alle donne?), also known as The Degradation of Emanuelle and  Confessions of Emanuelle, is a 1977 sexploitation film by Italian director Joe D'Amato, starring Laura Gemser and George Eastman.  The film was one of the most expensive films ever made in Italy at that time, not just in cast but in locations. The filming was done in many countries; Hong Kong, Iran, Nepal (though it is billed as being shot in India), America and in a studio in Italy. It features a notable cast, including Gemser, Karin Schubert,  Ivan Rassimov and Eastman. Emanuelle is invited to India to write a report on Guru Shanti, a man who claims to have achieved the ultimate orgasm. Once there she engages in a variety of sex acts, including one with the Guru; she disproves his theory. She then heads to Hong Kong to investigate trafficked women. Once she then arrives back in America, she teams up with fellow reporter Cora Norman and both of them snoop out a trail of men smuggling women to the Middle East. This film has been subject to much censorship in various territories. The version screened in France and some other European territories contains hardcore footage not found in the original cut. One scene is particularly controversial, as it depicts sexual torture involving a woman, a German Shepherd dog, and a snake. It is not clear whether these were merely inserts or filmed at the time of principal shooting.
