Where the Dead Go to Die was panned by many viewers and Internet animation critics, criticizing its three stories, animation, characters, voice acting, writing, use of music, and incredibly dark content, such as eating fetuses, genital mutilation, bestiality, and necrophilia. It was however reviewed well in many horror publications, such as Rue Morgue,  DVDtalk,  and horrornews.
