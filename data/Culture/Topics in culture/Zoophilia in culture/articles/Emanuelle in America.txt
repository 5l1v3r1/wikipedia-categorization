Emanuelle in America is a 1977 Italian sexploitation film, the third in a series starring Laura Gemser,  made to cash in on the success of the French film Emmanuelle and its sequels.  It was the second in the series to be directed by Joe D'Amato. It is infamous for its "hardcore footage of unsimulated fellatio, penetration, ejaculation and unconventional horse husbandry" . A fearless American journalist and fashion photographer Emanuelle (Laura Gemser) travels throughout the world  in search of a good story for her editor. Emanuelle is actually a globe-trotting reporter who is not afraid to disrobe in the name of investigative journalism.  On her journey, she goes to Europe looking to investigate the private harem of a wealthy tycoon, Eric Van Darren (Lars Bloch) where she watches a naked woman masturbate a horse named Pedro before having a sapphic encounter in a steam room. There she meets an Italian Duke, Alfredo Elvize (Gabriele Tinti) and travels to his house in Venice where she ends up in a threesome with him and his wife before taking part in an orgy at a party they throw. She likes to see for herself what really goes on at diplomatic parties. Later, she is sent out to a private holiday resort island where women pay for men to fulfill their ultimate carnal desires. Here she sees a couple watching a disturbing snuff film and becomes determined to find out who made it. Emanuelle stumbles upon a group that uses kidnapped girls to make and sell snuff films.  She has been taking several pictures with a small spy camera installed in her necklace. Eventually, she gets caught in the act and this follows with a brush with death which leaves Emanuelle wondering if it is perhaps time to hang up her camera for good. Loaded with plenty of photos with her story, on her return to New York City, she meets her editor but he refuses to print the story and the images. She feels disgusted and quits her job and goes on a long vacation with her boyfriend.
