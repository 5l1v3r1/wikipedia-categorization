At the school, the young magician befriends a number of other magicians already attending the school and learning magic from Tenko. The new magician begins her training and quickly becomes the best magician at the school.\n</p><p>Impressed by her abilities, the master names the young magician \"Princess Tenko\" in recognition as his successor as the next Tenko and the Master Guardian of the Tenko Box, a magical wardrobe that contains many magic gems known as the Starfire Gems. Two of the most senior students, the twins Jana and Jason watch on. Jana become jealous of the newcomer when she is chosen to become Tenko's successor and conspires for rebellion. Jason tries to talk some sense stating that unlike Jana who had slacked off during training, Mariko is more responsible and therefore Tenko could trust her. She convinces him to help her and succeed at stealing two of the Starfire Gems for their own use.\n</p><p>When Jana and Jason are discovered, Master Tenko is overcome by their magic. In the scuffle, the Tenko Box is damaged, and the remaining Starfire gems are scattered all over the world and some through time. The twins escape as the new Tenko arrives in an attempt to stop them. Pleased with the young magician's abilities, Master Tenko entrusts Princess Tenko and his remaining students with Starfire Gems he had hidden away and the duty of recovering and protecting the other Starfire Gems from the forces of evil.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Characters\">Characters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tenko_and_the_Guardians_of_the_Magic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Characters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Tenkogaurdians.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Tenkogaurdians.jpg/220px-Tenkogaurdians.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Tenkogaurdians.jpg/330px-Tenkogaurdians.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/Tenkogaurdians.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"365\" data-file-height=\"273\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Tenkogaurdians.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The main protagonists of the series from left to right: Bolt, Steel, Tenko, and Hawk.</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><b>Princess Tenko</b> (voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Cree_Summer\" title=\"Cree Summer\">Cree Summer</a>): As the Master Guardian, the Japanese Tenko is the leader of the show's heroes. She performs a traveling magic show while searching for the displaced Starfire Gems. The ones she personally uses each allow her to summon a ghostly animal companion to help her battle.</li>\n<li><b>Bolt</b> (voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Neal_McDonough\" title=\"Neal McDonough\">Neal McDonough</a>): Bolt is a <a href=\"/wiki/White_people\" title=\"White people\">white</a> Guardian from Chicago who is the team's joker. His Starfire Gem uses the power to wield a magic sword.</li>\n<li><b>Hawk</b>: Hawk is a <a href=\"/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Native Americans in the United States\">Native American</a> Guardian with a somewhat stereotypical connection to nature. His Starfire Gem uses the power to wield a magical shield which can block most other gems' powers.</li>\n<li><b>Steel</b> (voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Sorich\" title=\"Michael Sorich\">Michael Sorich</a>): Steel is an <a href=\"/wiki/African-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"African-American\">African-American</a> Guardian who is a scholar of history. His Starfire Gem uses the power to fire magical rings which he can throw to capture enemies or create ladders.</li>\n<li><b>Ali</b> (voiced by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Amy_Danles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Amy Danles (page does not exist)\">Amy Danles</a>): Ali is a hot-headed teenage <a href=\"/wiki/White_people\" title=\"White people\">white</a> girl who feels distant from everyone in her life. After helping Tenko in one adventure, she becomes her apprentice and trains constantly to be a Guardian. In the twelfth episode she does become a Guardian and earns her own Starfire Gem, but her power is never put to use.</li>\n<li><b>Shonti</b>: Shonti is an animal trainer hired by Hikita prior to the show. She is technically not a Guardian and does not acquire a gem within the series, but she can perform magic and is part of the team. She is from Africa, though which country is not specified. Like Hawk, she has a connection to nature.</li>\n<li><b>Jana</b> (voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Cree_Summer\" title=\"Cree Summer\">Cree Summer</a>): Granddaughter of the Master Guardian who came before Hikita, the short-tempered Jana tried to steal the Starfire Gems when Tenko became the new Master Guardian instead of her. It is also presumed that Jana is manipulating Jason into being loyal to her. And yet, after Vell tried to take her life away, Jana helped Tenko to seal the demon away, which means there's still a chance that she might become a guardian with her brother just like she always wanted.</li>\n<li><b>Jason</b> (voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Sorich\" title=\"Michael Sorich\">Michael Sorich</a>): Jana's twin brother. He and Tenko have shown signs of being attracted to each other, but his loyalty to his sister is greater and so he follows her orders. Unbeknownst to Jason, Jana is actually manipulating his loyalty by using their close bond to get what she wants.</li>\n<li><b>Hikita Tenko</b>: The former leader of the Guardians. After he was injured by Jana and Jason he was placed in the Tenko Box and disappeared, but occasionally his spirit appears to Princess Tenko to give her advice.</li>\n<li><b>Travis Cage</b>: An endangered-species <a href=\"/wiki/Poaching\" title=\"Poaching\">poacher</a> who is interested in money with each endangered animal he captures and trades. He finds the diamond Starfire Gem after failing to bag a gorilla. With the help of Jana and Jason, he kidnaps Ninjara, seeing her as a rare prey, and sets traps for Tenko and the Guardians.</li>\n<li><b>Vell</b>: An evil industrialist who was logging a <a href=\"/wiki/Rainforest\" title=\"Rainforest\">rainforest</a> to try to find the emerald Starfire Gem, which would allow him to free a <a href=\"/wiki/Demonic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Demonic\">demonic</a> entity imprisoned long ago in another dimension.

She returns home and meets with an old friend who convinces her to buy a pair of skates. Little does Ali know, now that she has left Tenko's protection, Jana and Jason will do anything to get her skates, which each have half of the morganite Starfire gem. After proving herself to be responsible and capable of using the magic she has learned, Tenko presents Ali with the morganite gem and deems her worthy of becoming a Guardian.</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"vevent\" style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" id=\"ep13\" style=\"text-align:center\">13</th><td class=\"summary\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Cry Havoc\"</td><td><small><span style=\"color: #2C2C2C\" title=\"To be announced\">TBA</span></small></td></tr><tr><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #CCCCFF\">\nVell joins forces with Jana to steal Tenko's piece of the emerald Starfire Gem, and takes it from her after trapping her in a volcano.

Jana combines her power with Tenko's to seal the demon away, but doesn't know when to stop and tries to take the emerald even when the cave starts to collapse, burying her.
