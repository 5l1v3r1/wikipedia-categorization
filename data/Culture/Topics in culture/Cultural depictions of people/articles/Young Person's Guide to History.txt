Young Person's Guide to History is a two-part television special produced by Funny Garbage, the creators of Saul of the Mole Men, and features most of the same actors and creative team. It was originally titled Thomas Jefferson American Phantasm. In the United States, the first part aired on October 27, 2008 and the second part aired on November 3, 2008 on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. On November 4, 2008 Young Person's Guide to History first aired in its entirety, in honor of election night. It was originally produced in three parts but was edited down to two. Young Person's Guide to History is a warped and absurd retelling of historical events that led to the creation of America such as the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the choosing of the Great Seal of America using fantastical and anachronistic modern elements (Thomas Jefferson tattoos the Constitution onto his chest and then tears it off). Young Person's Guide to History is an offshoot/spinoff of the Saul of the Mole Men episode "Poor Clancy's Almanack", a wordplay on Poor Richard's Almanack. Another reference is made when the song "Mustache Ride" is played in Jefferson's car during part one. Directed by Peter Girardi and Dave Willis, both parts of Young Person's Guide to History were rated TV-MA in the United States. Part One originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's late night programing block, Adult Swim, on April 1, 2008, as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools' Day stunt. Part one officially premiered on October 27, 2008, and the second part aired one week later on November 3, 2008. Young Person's Guide to History was originally produced in three parts but was edited down to two; and was originally going to be entitled Thomas Jefferson American Phantasm.
