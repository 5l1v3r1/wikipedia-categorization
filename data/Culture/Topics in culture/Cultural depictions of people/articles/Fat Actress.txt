Fat Actress is an American comedy television series starring Kirstie Alley. In the United States, it aired on Showtime from March 7 to April 18, 2005. The series was created and written by Alley and Brenda Hampton. Alley gave a glimpse of the humor and the irony in her battle to lose weight and get back on television in a tough business that prefers the svelte figures seen on the most successful actresses of today. The series was generally unscripted, with each episode emanating from a story outline and the actors largely improvising the dialogue. The storylines were drawn from a heightened perception of Alley's real-life experiences, and some of Alley's friends appeared as themselves in cameos to further blur the lines between truth and fiction. Several Hollywood celebrities appeared in the series as themselves: Fat Actress was announced in July 2004, with plans to produce six episodes beginning in the fall.  Harris and Callen were cast in September 2004.  Filming took place in Los Angeles, California.  Seven episodes were produced.  In the United States, Fat Actress premiered on Showtime on March 7, 2005.   The series premiere gave the network its highest series ratings, a record that was not beaten until October 2006.   Viewership dropped dramatically after the first two episodes aired.  The series aired on Movie Central in Western Canada, The Movie Network in Eastern Canada, FX in the UK, Network Ten in Australia and VOX, and Das Vierte in Germany.  Fat Actress received mixed reviews.  Brian Lowry of Variety wrote a negative review,  while Entertainment Weekly gave the series a "C-".  A week after its premiere, Showtime announced plans to rush the series' DVD release in order to capitalize on an unusually high awareness of the program. The DVD was scheduled for release on May 24, 2005, rather than the usual six-to-nine-month waiting period for most Showtime shows.  The series was added to iTunes in February 2006.
