The fictional Creed is partially based on the experiences and former <a href=\"/wiki/Flower_child\" title=\"Flower child\">flower child</a> lifestyle of the real one; however, the character is an embellished version of the real person.

Creed is a mysterious figure who is prone to making bizarre or confusing statements on a regular basis. As a result of drug use during his career as a rock musician in the 1960s, combined with signs of apparent mental illness, Creed has a phenomenally poor memory. In \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Convention_(The_Office)\" title=\"The Convention (The Office)\">The Convention</a>\", he introduces himself to Meredith, (after calling Angela \"Andrea\") implying that he thinks she just started working at Dunder Mifflin, despite her having worked there several years. When seen at his office computer, he is usually playing <a href=\"/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)\" title=\"Spider (solitaire)\">spider solitaire</a>. He is never shown to have been doing any actual work at the office, though occasionally takes extreme measures to ensure his job security. Because he is typically very quiet, most of his coworkers aren't even sure what it is that he does there\u2014something which Creed himself is apparently unsure of.\n</p><p>Little is known about Creed's life outside the office;  The scattered details that emerge (as well as his behavior in the office) are invariably bizarre and it is unknown how much of what he says is true. In fact, much of what he does say is either unsettling or downright disturbing, sometimes even describing violent crimes he claims to have committed, or plans to commit. Despite all of this, Creed is outwardly quite cheery most of the time, and is tolerated (or simply ignored) by his fellow employees.\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Injury\" title=\"The Injury\">The Injury</a>\", he claims to have been in an <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_lung\" title=\"Iron lung\">iron lung</a> when he was a child.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TheInjury_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TheInjury-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In a deleted scene from \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Convict\" title=\"The Convict\">The Convict</a>\", Creed states that he has been <a href=\"/wiki/Incarcerated\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Incarcerated\">incarcerated</a> before, and that <a href=\"/wiki/Prison\" title=\"Prison\">prison</a> is where he obtained the name \"Creed\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>, though he later changes his story, implying that he had previously killed a man named Creed Bratton and assumed his identity. Several episodes have shown him to be either <a href=\"/wiki/Senile\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Senile\">senile</a> or extremely absent-minded. In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Casual_Friday_(The_Office)\" title=\"Casual Friday (The Office)\">Casual Friday</a>\" he reveals he has a daughter and tries to hook Jim up with her. When Jim says he already has a fianc\u00e9e, Creed says, \"I thought you were gay\". When Jim questions why Creed would want to set him up with his daughter if Creed thought he was gay, Creed simply responds, \"I don't know\".\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Conflict_Resolution_(The_Office_episode)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conflict Resolution (The Office episode)\">Conflict Resolution</a>\", he submits a formal complaint to Toby that says that he is sick of looking at \"the redhead\" all day (Meredith), and wants a seat facing the receptionist (Pam).<sup id=\"cite_ref-ConflictResolution_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ConflictResolution-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In the season 2 episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Carpet\" title=\"The Carpet\">The Carpet</a>\", when Creed smells human feces in Michael's office he says, \"Is someone making soup?\" In another episode, when Oscar returns from vacation to find Dwight no longer working at Dunder-Mifflin, Creed tells him that Dwight was decapitated. When Jim states that wasn't real, Creed angrily replies \"you're not real, man!\"\n</p><p>He is also extremely dishonest, with details emerging of his many scams, including faking his own death, and in the Season 4 episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Fun_Run\" title=\"Fun Run\">Fun Run</a>\" he admits to being involved in many religious cults, saying, \"You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader\". He is a kleptomaniac and regularly steals items from coworkers and charity drives, and he even tears off a card from a gift at Phyllis's wedding in order to pretend that it's his. When asked his age, the reply varies wildly depending upon what suits him at the time. In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Fun_Run\" title=\"Fun Run\">Fun Run</a>\", Creed states that he will soon be 82. In the next episode (\"<a href=\"/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity\" title=\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\">Dunder Mifflin Infinity</a>\"), attempting to look young, he dyes his hair black (with ink from a printer cartridge from a printer in the office) and says that he is 30 years old. He then corrects himself, saying that he'll be 30 in November. He even goes so far as to recruit a very elderly couple to pose as his parents for a family portrait, when it is unlikely that his actual parents could still be alive, given his own age. In the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Frame_Toby\" title=\"Frame Toby\">Frame Toby</a>\", when police enter the office on a drug investigation, he stands up and nervously puts his hands on his head, then hides in the conference room with the camera crew pretending to talk to them until the cops leave. In one episode when the entire office is role-playing a murder mystery, he walks into the conference room, and when Michael says that this is a murder investigation and that Creed is a prime suspect he says, \"Let me get settled in,\" at which point he runs outside to his car and quickly drives away.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Money_(The_Office)\" title=\"Money (The Office)\">Money</a>\", when explaining how he never goes bankrupt, he holds up his passport issued in the name William Charles Schneider (actor Creed Bratton's actual birth name). The passport indicates that he was born on February 8, 1943, the real Creed Bratton's birthdate. The real Creed Bratton was 64 at the time the episodes were filmed and aired.\n</p><p>Creed is working towards <a href=\"/wiki/Scuba_diving\" title=\"Scuba diving\">scuba diving</a>, stating, \"If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What have I been working towards?\" Creed's favorite thing to eat on his birthday is peach cobbler. Creed drives an '80s <a href=\"/wiki/Lincoln_Town_Car\" title=\"Lincoln Town Car\">Lincoln Town Car</a>, a car that Michael believes was named after the first president in \"<a href=\"/wiki/New_Leads\" title=\"New Leads\">New Leads</a>\" (Michael erroneously believes <a href=\"/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\" title=\"Abraham Lincoln\">Abraham Lincoln</a> was the first president of the United States).\n</p><p>In the final episode of season 7, Dwight is made temporary regional manager but is quickly fired when the company's new owner, Jo Bennett, discovers that he negligently fired a gun in the office. She then decides to put the person who has been with the company the longest in charge while a search committee interviews candidates for a permanent replacement. This turns out to be Creed, and he is still in charge as of the end of the season, thus making him the regional manager of the Sabre-Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch. Between the events of the <a href=\"/wiki/Search_Committee\" title=\"Search Committee\">season 7 finale</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._season_8)\" title=\"The Office (U.S. season 8)\">season 8</a> <a href=\"/wiki/The_List_(The_Office)\" title=\"The List (The Office)\">premiere</a>, he was replaced by <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_California\" title=\"Robert California\">Robert California</a>. After Robert drove down to Sabre headquarters in  <a href=\"/wiki/Tallahassee\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tallahassee\">Tallahassee</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a>, and convinced Jo to give him her job as CEO, he was replaced as manager by Andy.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/Finale_(The_Office)\" title=\"Finale (The Office)\">season 9 finale</a> as well as series finale, he is arrested for past crimes. He is seen being removed from <a href=\"/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin\" title=\"Dunder Mifflin\">Dunder Mifflin</a> by police,  after hiding from them for about a year, as revealed by Dwight, while giving his final interview.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character_history\">Character history</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creed_Bratton_(character)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Character history\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A product of the '60s, Creed is older than all of the other employees at the office. Prior to joining Dunder Mifflin, he was most notably a member of the rock band <a href=\"/wiki/The_Grass_Roots\" title=\"The Grass Roots\">The Grass Roots</a> in the late '60s (as was the real-life <a href=\"/wiki/Creed_Bratton\" title=\"Creed Bratton\">Creed Bratton</a>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-BoozeCruise_deletedscene_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BoozeCruise_deletedscene-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Still an apparent drug user<sup id=\"cite_ref-BoozeCruise_deletedscene_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BoozeCruise_deletedscene-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> (primarily marijuana<sup id=\"cite_ref-DrugTesting_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DrugTesting-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-BackFromVacation_deletedscene_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BackFromVacation_deletedscene-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>), he strongly implies that he has done many types of drugs and knows where to obtain them at any time, often stating that he \"knows a guy\" from which he can buy everything from cannabis to tapeworm eggs smuggled into the country from Mexico. He correctly identifies the strain of <a href=\"/wiki/Marijuana\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marijuana\">marijuana</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Lights_(Cannabis)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Northern Lights (Cannabis)\">\"Northern Lights\" <i>Cannabis indica</i></a>) in a picture Dwight shows him.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DrugTesting_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DrugTesting-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  He also showed a detailed knowledge of different types of pain medications when he sees Meredith in the hospital, naming several different brands (<a href=\"/wiki/Codeine\" title=\"Codeine\">Codeine</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Vicodin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vicodin\">Vicodin</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Percocet\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Percocet\">Percocet</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fentanyl\" title=\"Fentanyl\">Fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Oxycontin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oxycontin\">Oxycontin</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Palladone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Palladone\">Palladone</a>).\n</p><p>Creed was never actually hired, but walked in one day, and acted like he worked there and has been going in every day since then. He now serves as the quality assurance manager. Creed can be counted on to shirk nearly all responsibility, ranging from informal office duties such as spring cleaning<sup id=\"cite_ref-TheSecret_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TheSecret-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> to his primary job responsibilities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ProductRecall_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ProductRecall-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Outside of work, Creed teeters on the edge of homelessness and has professed his willingness to do whatever it takes to avoid becoming homeless again.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ProductRecall_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ProductRecall-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> He lives in <a href=\"/wiki/Toronto\" title=\"Toronto\">Toronto</a>, spending three nights a week there in order to milk the <a href=\"/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Welfare (financial aid)\">welfare state</a>, and surreptitiously sleeps under his desk the remainder of the week.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TheCoup_deletedscene_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TheCoup_deletedscene-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> In another episode, he reveals to Jim that he lives in Scranton near \"the quarry\" and invites Jim to \"throw things down there\" with him, to which Jim answers, in a somewhat sarcastic way, \"Definitely we should\".\n</p><p>Creed appears not to be bound by moral guidelines, exhibited most notably by his <a href=\"/wiki/Kleptomania\" title=\"Kleptomania\">kleptomania</a>. The episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Casino_Night\" title=\"Casino Night\">Casino Night</a>\" provides the first glimpse into this side of Creed's personality. He steals gambling chips in order to win the evening's prize and admits in a talking head interview, \"I love stealing things\" and \"Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago.\" Once revealed, his kleptomania returns in subsequent episodes, either explicitly or implicitly. For example, he takes a toy from a toy drive drop box<sup id=\"cite_ref-ABenihanaChristmas_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ABenihanaChristmas-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and returns $40 to Michael; when Michael says that he didn't give Creed the money, Creed tells him, \"In a way, you did,\" implying that he stole it from Michael.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TheNegotiation_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TheNegotiation-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> He has been caught stealing at least twice by Jim. In the episode titled \"<a href=\"/wiki/Local_Ad_(The_Office_episode)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Local Ad (The Office episode)\">Local Ad</a>,\" Jim buys breakfast for Pam because she slept at her desk all night. When she wakes, Jim explains that Creed snatched her hash browns while she was asleep on her keyboard.\n</p><p>Creed's lack of shame or morals extends beyond mere kleptomania. He places his wedding card on another guest's gift,<sup id=\"cite_ref-PhyllisWedding_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PhyllisWedding-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> and blatantly stares at Pam's chest when she wears a low-cut sweater. When she asks him to stop, he serenely says, \"In a minute.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-TheCoup_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TheCoup-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In a deleted scene, Creed says that he has a friend named Jorge who will hook Toby up with anything he wants, including \"<a href=\"/wiki/Cocaine\" title=\"Cocaine\">this amazing coffee that you snort</a>\". Creed also was seen searching through Pam's desk in Season 4 episode 2.\n</p><p>When it appears that the branch will be closing in \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Merger_(The_Office)\" title=\"The Merger (The Office)\">The Merger</a>,\" Creed lists all of the office equipment on Craigslist and can be seen throughout the episode selling printers and computers illegally. Upon learning that the branch will not be closing, he uses the money to buy the staff drinks.\n</p><p>In \"Product Recall,\" he not only engineers the firing of a blameless employee to cover for his mistake, but he sends around a sympathy card for her and then pockets all of the cash in it, throwing the card in the trash.\n</p><p>Creed has likely been arrested multiple times, as he assumed he needed a profile shot for his ID photo.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ConflictResolution_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ConflictResolution-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Creed believes that his <a href=\"/wiki/Blog\" title=\"Blog\">blog</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Uniform Resource Locator\">URL</a> is www.creedthoughts.gov.www\\creedthoughts, but his \"blog\" is actually a <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Word\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Microsoft Office Word\">Word</a> document with the title expressly chosen to look like a <a href=\"/wiki/URL\" title=\"URL\">URL</a>, set up by Ryan Howard, wanting to \"protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain\".

Later in the season, it is revealed that Creed has four toes on his right foot (because his adoptive Chinese parents bound his feet as a young child) and enjoys arcade-style shooting games. In \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Injury\" title=\"The Injury\">The Injury</a>\" he reveals to Michael that he spent some time in an <a href=\"/wiki/Negative_pressure_ventilator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Negative pressure ventilator\">iron lung</a> when he was a teenager. In a deleted scene from \"<a href=\"/wiki/Christmas_Party_(The_Office)\" title=\"Christmas Party (The Office)\">Christmas Party</a>,\" Creed reveals to <a href=\"/wiki/Oscar_Martinez_(The_Office)\" title=\"Oscar Martinez (The Office)\">Oscar Martinez</a> that he was \"Wacky Weed Creed,\" a radio DJ, during the 1970s.

He then reveals that he was once a member of The Grass Roots and, as a result of drug abuse, cannot concentrate for longer than 90 seconds. He speaks simple Cantonese and has friends in China, possibly <a href=\"/wiki/Guangzhou\" title=\"Guangzhou\">Huadu</a>. He can identify <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Lights_(strain)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Northern Lights (strain)\">strains</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)\" title=\"Cannabis (drug)\">cannabis</a> in high-resolution <a href=\"/wiki/Photograph\" title=\"Photograph\">photographs</a>. He snacks on nutritious <a href=\"/wiki/Mung_bean\" title=\"Mung bean\">mung bean</a> sprouts, which he keeps stashed in his desk on a damp paper towel, though he admits that \"they smell like death\".

Creed also readily enters into \"an alliance\" with Dwight to, if necessary, take violent action against Jim\u2014Dwight fears Jim was bitten by the bat and may turn into a vampire, or perhaps merely carry the \"vampiric germ\".

He then does everything he can to keep his job and survive, like \"I did when I was a homeless man\". Creed engineers the transfer of blame from himself to a paper mill manager, for whom he procures a card and farewell money collected from all the workers; on his way out, he pockets the money and tosses the card.  In a deleted scene, after a newspaper reporter recognizes him and claims to have written his obituary\u2014and he thanks the man for such a complimentary portrait\u2014it was revealed that Creed faked his own death 10 years ago \"for tax reasons\", and admits that he draws benefits as his own widow.\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Women%27s_Appreciation\" title=\"Women&#39;s Appreciation\">Women's Appreciation</a>\", Creed is shown using the women's bathroom.

Ryan describes the things Creed writes about as shocking, \"even for the Internet.\" In a deleted scene, Creed is seen counterfeiting Dwight's motivational \"Schrute Bucks\" and takes several 50-pound boxes of them to Dwight demanding payment.  After Dwight uses an invisible ink marker to determine that they are fakes Creed tells him \"Listen, Schrutey\" and threatens to flood the market with the fake Schrute bucks to render them worthless.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In a preview for Season 4, Creed states that \"it turns out\" he has grandchildren <b>and</b> children, presumably from his many relationships in 1960s (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCDXIyRdwG0\">\"The Office Summer Vacation\"</a> NBC promotional video).

At the end of the episode, when Michael is taking his last look at the Dunder Mifflin staff, Creed lifts up Michael's \"World's Best Boss\" coffee mug (which Michael had thrown out earlier in the episode) and says \"See ya tomorrow, boss,\" making him the last person to talk to him in the actual office (Pam says goodbye to Michael at the airport, shortly before he takes off.)\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Inner_Circle_(The_Office)\" title=\"The Inner Circle (The Office)\">The Inner Circle</a>\", Creed watches Deangelo's mime juggling act in amazement.\n</p><p>In a deleted scene of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_K._Schrute,_(Acting)_Manager\" title=\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\">Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager</a>\", Creed confirms to the camera that there is a real possibility he will murder Oscar. In the end of the episode, he's promoted to acting manager of the office after Jo requests that the position be filled by the employee that has worked there the longest.\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Search_Committee\" title=\"Search Committee\">Search Committee</a>\", Creed's antics as acting manager are revealed. He has a team building meeting despite not calling for one (with dismal attendance from the office), makes an acronym chart up as he goes along, and starts calling a number of Dunder-Mifflin's clients (actually Pam disguising her voice), informing clients of various derogatory things about the company. When Creed actually does get through to a client, to distract him Pam quickly gives him two identical pictures and informs him that corporate has asked that he find at least seven differences between them (to which Creed immediately replies \"I can see three already.\")\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_List_(The_Office)\" title=\"The List (The Office)\">The List</a>\", he is on the \"Losers\" side of new CEO Robert California's list (on which he is listed as \"old man\"). Creed is also seen \"<a href=\"/wiki/Planking_(fad)\" title=\"Planking (fad)\">planking</a>\" in the episode.\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Lotto_(The_Office)\" title=\"Lotto (The Office)\">Lotto</a>\", Creed says that by being born in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, he has already \"won the lottery\". But, he says as backup he has a <a href=\"/wiki/Swiss\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Swiss\">Swiss</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Passport\" title=\"Passport\">passport</a>.\n</p><p>It is revealed in the season 8 episode, \"<a href=\"/wiki/Spooked_(The_Office)\" title=\"Spooked (The Office)\">Spooked</a>\", that one of Creed's biggest fears is snakes.\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Mrs._California\" title=\"Mrs. California\">Mrs. California</a>\", it is implied that Creed may have been a member of a suicide cult.  This is perhaps a reference to the Creedish Death Cult, a fictional religious organization in <a href=\"/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk\" title=\"Chuck Palahniuk\">Chuck Palahniuk</a>'s novel \"<a href=\"/wiki/Survivor_(Chuck_Palahniuk_novel)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Survivor (Chuck Palahniuk novel)\">Survivor</a>\". He is also found by Jim on the roof of the Dunder Mifflin office building calmly flying a remote control helicopter, as though doing so in the middle of the workday were a perfectly normal, ordinary event. He also asks Jim about his \"friend,\" even though there's no one else but Jim present.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Season_9\">Season 9</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creed_Bratton_(character)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Season 9\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the Halloween episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Here_Comes_Treble\" title=\"Here Comes Treble\">Here Comes Treble</a>\", Creed has bloodstains all over his face and shirt.

That is really, really good timing\".\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Work_Bus\" title=\"Work Bus\">Work Bus</a>\", Creed boards the bus not knowing that inside are his coworkers, to his apparent horror.\n</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/wiki/Finale_(The_Office)\" title=\"Finale (The Office)\">Finale</a>\", Dwight reveals in a talking head that after the airing of the documentary, Creed attempted to disappear by faking his own death after the police learned of his past as a member of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Grass_Roots\" title=\"The Grass Roots\">The Grass Roots</a> and sought him in connection with dealing drugs, trafficking endangered animal meats, and stealing <a href=\"/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide\" title=\"Lysergic acid diethylamide\">LSD</a> from the military in his time with the band.
