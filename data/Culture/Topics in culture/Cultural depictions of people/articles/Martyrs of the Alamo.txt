Martyrs of the Alamo (also known as The Birth of Texas) is a 1915 American historical war drama film written and directed by Christy Cabanne. The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including Sam De Grasse, Douglas Fairbanks, Walter Long and Alfred Paget.  Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in The Lamb, was released prior to this picture.  The film features the Siege of BÃ©xar, Battle of the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto. While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in San Antonio in 1836 as a group of ill-mannered drunks.  One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her.  The white woman reports the incident to her husband, Almeron Dickinson who in turn shoots the Mexican officer.  In his book Remembering the Alamo, author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced.  A copy of the film is preserved at the Library of Congress.
