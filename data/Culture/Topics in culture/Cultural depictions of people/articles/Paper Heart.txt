Paper Heart is a 2009 American romantic comedy film starring Charlyne Yi and Michael Cera as fictionalized versions of themselves based on their rumored relationship, though Yi has said they never dated.    The plot for the film is based on Charlyne Yi's original idea of a documentary, which Nick Jasenovec suggested would be accentuated with a fictional storyline.   The film follows Charlyne as she embarks on a quest across America to make a documentary about a subject she does not understand: love. As she and her good friend (and director) Nick search for answers and advice about love, Charlyne talks with friends, strangers, scientists, bikers, romance novelists, and children. They each offer diverse views on modern romance, as well as various answers to the age-old question: does true love really exist? Shortly after filming begins, Charlyne meets a boy after her own heart: Michael Cera. As their relationship develops on camera, her pursuit to discover the nature of love takes on a fresh new urgency. Paper Heart received mixed reviews by critics and currently holds a 57% "Rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Paper Heart received a limited release on August 7, 2009, in the United States and Canada, making $1,286,744. The soundtrack of Paper Heart was released on August 4, 2009 by Lakeshore Records and contains music composed primarily by Michael Cera and Charlyne Yi. Alden Penner was the producer.
