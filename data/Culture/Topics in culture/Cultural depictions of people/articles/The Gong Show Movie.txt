The Gong Show Movie is a 1980 American comedy film starring, written and directed by Chuck Barris.  The film shows a fictional week in the life of Chuck Barris as the host and creator of The Gong Show, through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown (which compels him to run away and hide in the desert) and other comic hijinks in his life and work on the TV show. Among the highlights included a group of men dressed as a Roman Catholic priest and three nuns lip-synching Tom Lehrer's song "The Vatican Rag", a man blowing out a candle with flatulence, and the uncensored version of Jaye P. Morgan's infamous breast-baring incident. The film opened against The Empire Strikes Back and The Shining, beating the latter at the box office in its opening weekend but losing to the former.  Among the bad reviews at the time was one from George Burns, who, after seeing the movie, went on the record and said, "For the first time in 65 years, I wanted to get out of show business."  Although the movie has been shown on a few movie channels on occasion, the film had never been issued on home video  until a Blu-ray release from Shout! Factory on March 29, 2016.
