The SafeHouse Restaurant opened in 1966 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Filled wall-to-wall with spy memorabilia collected by founder/owner David J. Baldwin, it has been used as a backdrop in movies shot in Milwaukee such as Major League, and has been featured on the History Channel as one of the best secret locations to visit in the United States. The restaurant has been in featured articles in Time, the Chicago Tribune, People Magazine, and the London Daily Express for its food, spy drinks and espionage-theme. Mascot: Yugyps (spyguy spelled backwards).  According to Rachael Ray in her $40 a Day series, "you would have to be a CIA agent to figure this place out in one trip". Per Wired Magazine, the Safe House is "the Hippest Place on the Planet." Connects to The Newsroom Pub, also designed by David Baldwin, where autographs of celebrities who have spoken to the Milwaukee Press Club are displayed. The ornate banquet rooms have booths with secret entrances into the Safe House. On June 16, 2015 David Baldwin retired, selling the Safe House to the Marcus Corporation.  In 2016, Safehouse Milwaukee was reopened after renovation. The 50th Anniversary of the restaurant was marked with an award from Historic Milwaukee.  In April 2017, Marcus Corporation opened a second location in Chicago, IL, carrying Baldwin's legacy forward.
