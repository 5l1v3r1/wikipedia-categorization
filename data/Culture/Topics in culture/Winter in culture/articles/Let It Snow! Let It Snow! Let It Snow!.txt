"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!", also known as "Let It Snow", is a song written by lyricist Sammy Cahn and composer Jule Styne in July 1945. It was written in Hollywood, California during a heat wave as Cahn and Styne imagined cooler conditions.  Although the song's lyrics make no mention of Christmas, it is played on radio stations during the Christmas season and is often covered by various artists on Christmas-themed albums. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, it can be played during winter (June, July, August) and in New Zealand, some play it at Matariki. First recorded for RCA Victor in 1945 by Vaughn Monroe,  it became a popular hit, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Best Sellers music chart in late January and through February, 1946.  Woody Herman's competing recording, featuring himself on vocals and a notable trumpet solo by Sonny Berman, peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard chart, while Connee Boswell reached No. 9 with her rendition.
