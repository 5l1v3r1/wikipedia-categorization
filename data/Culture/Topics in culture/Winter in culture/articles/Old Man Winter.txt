Old Man Winter is a personification of winter.    The name is a colloquialism for the winter season derived from ancient Greek mythology and Old World pagan beliefs evolving into modern characters in both literature and popular culture.   Humans have associated the winter season with deities since the ancient Greece god of winter Boreas, the Norse mythology god of winter Ullr and continuing on in other cultures including Celtic mythology with the god Cailleach and goddess Beira.  Over time the old gods of winter changed to new humanizations of the seasons including Old Man Winter.
