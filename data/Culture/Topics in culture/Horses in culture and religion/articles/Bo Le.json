Owing to the importance of <a href=\"/wiki/Horses_in_East_Asian_warfare#China\" title=\"Horses in East Asian warfare\">horse warfare</a> in ancient China, equestrian experts were highly valued. The <i>L\u00fcshi Chunqiu</i> listed ten specialized horse physiognomers, and <a href=\"/wiki/Herrlee_Glessner_Creel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Herrlee Glessner Creel\">Herrlee Glessner Creel</a> (1965:654) said the \"judging of horses was early recognized as a special art\".\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/wiki/Shang_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shang Dynasty\">Shang Dynasty</a> (c. 1600-1046 BCE), Chinese armies first battled <a href=\"/wiki/Eurasian_nomads\" title=\"Eurasian nomads\">Eurasian nomadic</a> warriors on horseback. As Creel (1965:670) explained, \"The riding horse was forced upon the Chinese. It was first thrust upon their attention as a new and deadly weapon that their nomadic enemies had acquired, and it seems always to have been regarded primarily as an instrument for fighting the nomads.\" The earliest archaeologically discovered <a href=\"/wiki/Chariot_(China)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chariot (China)\">Chinese chariot</a> dated circa 1200 BCE during the reign of King <a href=\"/wiki/Wu_Ding\" title=\"Wu Ding\">Wu Ding</a> (Shaughnessy 1998). During the <a href=\"/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zhou Dynasty\">Zhou Dynasty</a> (1046-256 BCE), horse-drawn chariots were increasingly used both for warfare and <a href=\"/wiki/Four_occupations#The_shi_.28.E5.A3.AB.29\" title=\"Four occupations\">aristocratic</a> transportation.  The first clear evidence of horse riding in China comes from the late 4th century BCE (Goodrich 1984). <a href=\"/wiki/King_Wuling_of_Zhao\" title=\"King Wuling of Zhao\">King Wuling of Zhao</a> (r. 325-298 BCE) initiated the military reform of <i>hufu qishe</i> \u80e1\u670d\u9a0e\u5c04 \"<a href=\"/wiki/Donghu_people\" title=\"Donghu people\">barbarian</a> clothing [i.e., belted pants] and <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_archery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horse archery\">horse archery</a>\", which replaced <a href=\"/wiki/Chariot_tactics\" title=\"Chariot tactics\">chariot tactics</a> with superior <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalry_tactics\" title=\"Cavalry tactics\">cavalry tactics</a>. \n</p><p>When the Chinese imported military horses and chariots from foreign \"horse riders\", they concurrently introduced a complex equestrian culture, which resulted in new professions in fields such as <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_domestication\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horse domestication\">horse domestication</a>, selective <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_breeding\" title=\"Horse breeding\">horse breeding</a> (as early as the 14th century BCE, Creel 1965:654), <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_training\" title=\"Horse training\">horse training</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_riding\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horse riding\">horse riding</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_tack\" title=\"Horse tack\">horse tack</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_care\" title=\"Horse care\">horse care</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Veterinary_medicine\" title=\"Veterinary medicine\">veterinary medicine</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Wu_(shaman)#Meanings\" title=\"Wu (shaman)\">horse shamanism</a>. \n</p><p>The Chinese have traditionally believed the best horses and horse specialists came from foreign sources. While some individuals became outstanding equestrians, for Chinese people in general, Creel (1965:670) says, \"the riding horse remained something strange, almost foreign in nature.

They included a fragmentary text about judging horses, which scholars tentatively call the <i>Xiangmajing</i> \u76f8\u99ac\u7d93 \"Classic of Horse Physiognomy\" (also used for a 5th-century text). This manuscript mentions Bole himself (tr.

The eyes are the prime ministers; they should be radiant. The spine is the general; it should be strong. The belly and chest are the city walls; they should be extended. The four legs are the local officials; they should be long. \u2026 In judging a horse one begins with the head. The head should be high and erect; it should look as if it were shaved. The head should be heavy, and it is good that there be little flesh, like the skinned head of a rabbit. (56, tr.

All ten of these men were the most skilled of their age. How they examined horses was not the same, but each looked for characteristics that confirmed a horse's qualities. From this they could know whether the horse had superior or inferior joints, whether it would be clumsy or fleet of foot, whether it was made of sturdy or inferior stuff, and whether it was highly talented or not. It is not only the judging of horses that is like this. There are also confirming characteristics for people, as well as for deeds and states. (20, tr.

Later, he went with them to Viscount Chien's stable to inspect the horses. One of the men pulled out a kicking horse. The other man went near behind the horse and patted its flank three times, but the horse never kicked. Therefore, the man who had pulled out the horse thought he had been wrong in the way of selection. Yet the other man said: \"You were not wrong in the way of selection. The shoulders of this horse are short but its laps are swollen. The horse that kicks habitually has to raise the hindlegs and lay its whole weight upon the forelegs. Yet swollen laps are not dependable. So the hind legs cannot be raised. You were skilful in selecting kicking horses but not in observing the swollen laps.\" Verily, everything has the supporter of its weight. However, that the forelegs have swollen laps and therefore cannot support its whole weight, is known only by intelligent men. \u2026 Pai-lo taught men whom he disliked how to select swift race-horses and taught men whom he liked how to select inferior horses, because swift race-horses being few and far between would yield slow profits while inferior horses being sold every day would bring about quick profits.

But then came Poleh, who said, \"I am skilled at training horses.\" And men began to singe them, clip their hair, trim their hooves, and brand them. They led them with bridles and hobbles, lined them up in stable and stall, resulting in the deaths of two or three out of ten. They made the horses go hungry and thirsty, raced them, and galloped them, arrayed them in rows and columns. In front were the tribulations of the bit and the ornamental halter, behind were the threats of the whip and the crop, resulting in the deaths of over half the horses. \u2026 Returning to the subject of horses, if they are allowed to live on the open land, they eat the grass and drink the water. When they are happy, they cross necks and rub against each other. When they are angry, they turn back to back and kick each other. The knowledge of horses amounts to this and no more. But you put a yoke upon them and array them evenly with moon-mirrors on their foreheads, all they know is to try to break the cross-bar, twist out of the yoke, smash the chariot cover, expel the bit, and bite through the reins. Therefore, to take the knowledge of a horse and make it behave like a brigand is the crime of Poleh. (tr.

The first one (2, tr. Major et al. 2010:94) mentions him with the charioteer Zaofu: \"Zaofu could not be Bo Le. Each had articulated a single corner but did not comprehend the full domain of the myriad techniques.\" The second (9, tr. Major et al. 2010:324) mentions another famous charioteer Wang Liang \u738b\u826f: \"Thus is Bo Le selects the steeds and Wang Liang drives them, and enlightened ruler can ride without the trouble of selecting horses or driving and can undertake a journey of a thousand <i>li</i>. He is carried by the capabilities of others as if they were his feathers and wings.\" The third context (11, tr. Major et al. 2010:414, 416) lists the swordsmith Ouye with three above horse physiognomers: \"Thus it is said, 'Obtaining ten sharp swords is not as good as attaining the skill of Ou Ye; obtaining one hundred fleet horses is not as good as attaining the arts of Bo Le \u2026 The assessment methods of Bo Le, Han Feng, Qin Ya, and Guan Qing were all different, but their understanding of horses was as one.\"\n</p><p>The final <i>Huainanzi</i> context is a well-known story about Duke Mu of Qin, Bole, Bole's sons, and Jiufang Gao \u4e5d\u65b9\u768b.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Duke Mu of Qin addressed Bo Le saying: \"You are getting on in years. Is anyone in your family who can take over for you and find me a good steed?\" Bo Le replied; \"A good horse may be judged by his physique, countenance, sinews, and bones. But in judging the best horse in the world, it seems as if it is not there at all, as if it has disappeared, as if it had lost its singular identity. A horse like that raises no dust and leaves no tracks. All my sons are lesser talents. They can judge a good horse, but they lack the talent to judge the best horse in the world. However, there is a man who is my porter and firewood gatherer who is called Nine-Cornered Hillock. In judging horses, he is not inferior to my abilities. I respectfully request that you grant him an audience.\"\nDuke Mu granted him an audience and commanded him to search out a fine steed. After three months Nine-Cornered Hillock returned and reported: \"The horse has been located. It is in Shaqiu.\" Duke Mu replied: \"What kind of horse is it?\" \"It is a yellow mare,\" answered Nine-Cornered Hillock. Thereupon Duke Mu sent men to Shaqiu to obtain the horse. The horse, however, turned out to be a black stallion. Duke Mu was quite displeased. Summoning Bo Le, he inquired of him saying: \"What a loss! The man you sent to find me a good steed cannot distinguish the color of one coat from another nor a female from a male, what could he possibly know about horses?\" Bo Le let out a long sigh and replied: \"It always comes to this! This is precisely why he surpasses me by a thousand or ten thousand fold and is infinite in his capabilities. What Hillock observes is dynamism of Heaven. He recognizes the refined essence and discards the dross. He focuses on the internal and disregards the external. He looks at what is to be seen and does not look at what is not to be seen. He scrutinizes what is to be scrutinized and disregards what is not to be scrutinized. It appears that what he has judged is [a quality] more precious than just a horse.\" The horse arrived and ultimately proved to be an excellent horse. Therefore the <i>Laozi</i> says: \"Great straightness is as if bent; great skill is as clumsy.\" (12, tr. Major et al. 2010:458)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The (c. 3rd-4th century CE) Daoist <i><a href=\"/wiki/Liezi\" title=\"Liezi\">Liezi</a></i> (tr. Giles 1912:66) repeats this story about Bole recommending Jiufang Gao to Duke Mu. For comparison, \"A good horse can be picked out by its general build and appearance.

Thousand-<i>li</i> horses at times consume a whole <i><a href=\"/wiki/Picul\" title=\"Picul\">dan</a></i> [approximately 60 kg] of grain in one feeding. If the one who feeds them does so without knowing they are capable of a thousand-<i>li</i>, then even though they may have the ability to go so far, they, having not eaten their fill, are lacking in strength, and their talent and beauty are not apparent. Moreover, if one wanted to rank them with regular horses, they would not make the grade. How then could they be asked to have the ability of going a thousand <i>li</i>? They are whipped inappropriately and fed in such a way that they cannot fulfil their innate talents. Yet when they cry out, they cannot be understood. With whip in hand the man approaches them and says, \"There are not any good horses in the empire.\" Alas!
