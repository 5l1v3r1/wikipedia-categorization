Horses are not bathed or fed special foods like grain or hay.  Rather, they are simply allowed to graze freely on the steppe, digging through the snow to find forage in the winter.  Because nature provides so well for the Mongol horse, they cost little to nothing to raise.  As such, horses are not an expensive luxury item as in Western culture, but a practical necessity of everyday life.  Herdsmen regard their horses as both a form of wealth and a source of the daily necessities: transportation, food and drink.  Mongol riders have individual favorite horses. Each family member has his or her own horse, which may receive special treatment.\n</p><p>In Mongolia, barns, pastures and stables are the exception, not the rule.  Horses are generally allowed to roam free; if they are needed, they may be tied up temporarily.  The hitching post used for this purpose differs from the usual Western conception of a bar placed across two posts.  Such creations are wood intensive, and on the steppe trees are rare.  Instead, the horses may be tied to a single wooden pole or a large boulder.   Because the horses are allowed to live much the same as wild horses, they require little in the way of hoof care.  The hooves are left untrimmed and unshod and farriers are basically nonexistent.  Despite the lack of attention, Mongol horses have hard, strong hooves and seldom experience foot problems.  During the summer, Mongolian horses will often stand in a river, if available, in order to keep insects off.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruun,_Ole._Precious_Steppe_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruun,_Ole._Precious_Steppe-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mongolians say that fat horses have \"grass in their belly\" while lean horses have \"water in their belly.\"  Herdsman prefer to make long journeys during seasons when horses are well fed so as to spare tired or thin animals from exertion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Digital1_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Digital1-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  Particularly in the spring, horses are vulnerable to exhaustion: \"By the end of winter, the animals are a dreadful sight. &#8230; The horses are too frail to be ridden and some can barely walk. &#8230;  When the new grass appears, however, native Mongolian breeds of animals tend to recover very quickly.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruun,_Ole_p._53_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruun,_Ole_p._53-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Horses, along with sheep and goats, have a better chance of surviving difficult winter conditions than cattle and sheep because they are able to separate snow from grass with their dextrous lips.  When a <a href=\"/wiki/Zud\" title=\"Zud\">zud</a> hits, the typical pattern is for cattle to die first, then sheep, horses, and lastly goats.  Thus, horses are the second most winter-resilient animals raised by Mongolians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mares begin foaling in May and continue throughout the summer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruun,_Ole_p._53_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruun,_Ole_p._53-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Sick or cold foals will sometimes be taken into the ger, wrapped in skins or felts, and placed next to fire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruun,_Ole_p._53_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruun,_Ole_p._53-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A typical Mongolian herd consists of 15 - 50 mares and geldings under one stallion.  Some stallions are allowed to manage herds of up to 70 animals, though these are considered exceptional individuals.  The stallion is tasked with leading the herd, siring foals, and defending the herd against wolves.  The herd stallion, rather than the human owner, is entrusted with the day to day management of the herd.  Elizabeth Kendall observed in 1911 that, \"Each drove of horses is in the charge of a stallion which looks sharply after the mares, fighting savagely with any other stallion which attempts to join the herd. I am told that the owner only needs to count his stallions to be sure that all the mares have come home.\" (see also <i><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Wayfarer_in_China\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"s:A Wayfarer in China\">A Wayfarer in China</a></i>)\n</p><p>Since the mares are used for foals and milking, they are not often used for work; this is the job of the geldings.  Geldings rather than stallions are the preferred work animals.  Members of the <a href=\"/wiki/Darkhad\" title=\"Darkhad\">Darkhad</a> ethnic group ride their stallions only once a year, on three special days during the winter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SIT_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SIT-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> There are special horses within each herd used for roping, racing, beauty, or distance riding.  A herdsman may own one or several herds of horses, each headed by its own stallion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SIT_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SIT-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  A newly wedded couple will be given a gift of horses by the parents on both the husband and wife's sides.  Each family will give the couple 10 - 15 horses apiece and two stallions so that they can start up their own herd.  The extra stallion is sold or traded away.\n</p><p>Mane trimming varies by region.  Stallions are always left untrimmed; a long, thick mane is considered a sign of strength.  Geldings, however, are clipped.  Among the Darkhad ethnic group, the forelock is cut short and the bridle path is left unclipped.  Sometimes the mane of a horse will be clipped short except for one patch near the withers.  Mongolians save the cut off mane of the horse for spiritual reasons.  Both tail and mane hair can also be made into various spiritual and utilitarian products, i.e. spirit banners or rope.  Manes are always left long in the winter to keep the horse warm.  The sole grooming tool used is a brush.  The tail is generally left unclipped.  When a horse is gelded in the spring, the very tip of the tail may be cut off.  Branding may or may not be done; if it is, it is done in the fall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SIT_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SIT-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During races, the forelock is put in a topknot that stands up from the horse's head.  The hairy part of the tail may also have a tie placed around it midway down.<sup id=\"cite_ref-New_Atlantis_Full_Documentaries_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-New_Atlantis_Full_Documentaries-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> For race horses, the owner will also have a wooden <a href=\"/wiki/Sweat_scraper\" title=\"Sweat scraper\">sweat scraper</a> to clean off the horse after a race.  After the Naadam, spectators will come up to touch the winning horses' mane and sweat as both a sign of respect and a way to imbibe good fortune.<sup id=\"cite_ref-New_Atlantis_Full_Documentaries_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-New_Atlantis_Full_Documentaries-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  The winning horse is also sprinkled with airag.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Gelding is done when a colt is 2 \u2013 3 years old.  The date chosen for the event may be set by a lama so as to ensure good fortune.  The colts to be castrated are caught and their legs are tied.  The animals are then pushed on their side.  The horse's topmost hindleg is tied to its neck, exposing its testicles.  The genitals are washed, then cut off with a knife that has been cleaned in boiling water.  Afterwards, the wound is rinsed with mare's milk, a practice intended to encourage healing.  An observer reported, \"The animal does not appear to experience much pain during the operation, but tends to be in a state of confusion when let loose on the steppe.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>  An entire family will typically join in the castration process; depending on the number of colts to be castrated, several households may participate so that the castration may be completed in one day.\n</p><p>When the work of castration is completed, the testicles are used for ritual purposes.  One of the amputated testicles is punctured with a knife so as to permit the insertion of a rope; the rope is then fastened to the new gelding's tail with the assumption that once the testicle has dried, the wound will have finished healing.  The remaining testicle is cooked in the hearth ashes and eaten by the head of the household to acquire the strength of the stallion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Riding_and_Training\">Riding and Training</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Horse_culture_in_Mongolia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Riding and Training\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Mongolian nomads have long been considered to be some of the best horsemen in the world.  During the time of Genghis Khan, Mongol horse archers were capable of feats such as sliding down the side of their horse to shield their body from enemy arrows, while simultaneously holding their bow under the horse's chin and returning fire, all at full gallop.  In 1934, Haslund described how a herdsman breaking in a semi-wild horse was able to ungirth and unsaddle his horse as it bucked underneath him.  He wrote, \"It is a pleasure to see the Mongols in association with their horses, and to see them on horseback is a joy. ...[T]he strength, swiftness and elegance of a Mongol surpass that of any ballet dancer.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Haslund,_Henning_p._111_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Haslund,_Henning_p._111-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>  This same skill in horsemanship held true in antiquity.  Giovanni de Carpini, a Franciscan monk who visited Mongolia during the 1240s, observed that \"their children begin as soon as they are two or three years old to ride and manage horses and to gallop on them, and they are given bows to suit their stature and are taught to shoot; they are extremely agile and also intrepid.  Young girls and women ride and gallop on horseback with agility like men.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>  Today as in the Middle Ages, the education of a modern Mongolian horseman begins in childhood.  Parents will place their child on a horse and hold them there before the child can even hang on without assistance.  By the age of 4, children are riding horses with their parents.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  By age 6, children can ride in races;<sup id=\"cite_ref-New_Atlantis_Full_Documentaries_8-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-New_Atlantis_Full_Documentaries-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> by age 10, they are learning to make their own tack.\n</p><p>Carpini noted that the Mongols did not use spurs (these were unknown in Central Asia at that time); they did, however use a short whip.  This whip had a leather loop at the end; when the rider was not using it, he would let it hang from his wrist so that he could have his hands free to perform tasks, e.g. archery.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  It was taboo to use the whip as a prop or to touch an arrow to the whip; such crimes were punishable by death.  It was also punishable by death to strike a horse with a bridle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hoang1991_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hoang1991-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Haslund noted that as of 1934, it was considered a crime to strike a horse with a whip in areas in front of the stirrup.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mongolian cultural norms encourage the humane treatment of horses.  After spending years in the country, Haslund could not recall even one instance of seeing a horse mistreated.  Indeed, he found that Mongols who had been to China and observed their use of horses typically came back \"filled with righteous wrath and indignation over the heavy loads and cruel treatment that human beings there deal out to their animals.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>  In Genghis Khan's time, there were strict rules dictating the way horses were to be used on campaign.  The Khan instructed his general Subutai, \"See to it that your men keep their crupper hanging loose on their mounts and the bit of their bridle out of the mouth, except when you allow them to hunt.  That way they won't be able to gallop off at their whim [tiring out the horses unnecessarily].  Having established these rules--see to it you seize and beat any man who breaks them.  ...  Any man...who ignores this decree, cut off his head where he stands.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mongolian tack differs from Western tack in being made almost completely of raw hide<sup id=\"cite_ref-Thelongridersguild.com_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Thelongridersguild.com-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> and using knots<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> instead of metal connectors. Tack design follows a \"one size fits all\" approach, with saddles, halters and bits all produced in a single size.  Mongolian tack is very light compared to western tack; hobbles in particular are about half the weight of their Western counterparts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Thelongridersguild.com_19-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Thelongridersguild.com-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>  The Mongol pack saddle can be adjusted to fit yaks and bactrian camels.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Thelongridersguild.com_19-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Thelongridersguild.com-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The modern Mongolian riding saddle is very tall, with a wooden frame and several decorated metal disks that stand out from the sides.  It has a high pommel and cantle, and is placed upon a felt saddlecloth to protect the horse's back. The horse's thick coat also provides a barrier that helps prevent saddle sores. In the Middle Ages, the Mongols used a different style of saddle, the chief difference being that the cantle flattened out in the rear rather than rising to a peak like the cantle of a modern Mongolian saddle.  This allowed the rider greater freedom of movement; with a minimal saddle, a mounted archer could more readily swivel his torso to shoot arrows towards the rear.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:MongolianSaddle.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/MongolianSaddle.jpg/220px-MongolianSaddle.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/MongolianSaddle.jpg/330px-MongolianSaddle.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/MongolianSaddle.jpg/440px-MongolianSaddle.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2112\" data-file-height=\"2816\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:MongolianSaddle.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Mongolian saddle, showing short stirrups, high pommel and cantle, and distinctive metal discs.</div></div></div><p>The Mongolian saddle, both medieval and modern, has short stirrups rather like those used by modern race horses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_15-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  The design of the stirrups makes it possible for the rider to control the horse with his legs, leaving his hands free for tasks like archery or holding a catch-pole.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated2_15-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated2-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  Riders will frequently stand in the stirrups while riding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hoang1991_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hoang1991-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The design of the Mongolian saddle allows only marginal control of the gait. In most situations, the horse will decide the gait on its own, while the rider is occupied with other tasks such as herding cattle. Very often, a Mongol horse will choose to <a href=\"/wiki/Canter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Canter\">canter</a>.  The occasional Mongol horse will have an <a href=\"/wiki/Ambling\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ambling\">ambling</a> gait, which is to say that it will lift both its left hooves at one time, then both its right hooves at one time, etc.  Such horses are called <i>joroo,</i> and is said that they \"glide as if though on ice, so smoothly that one can trot along on one holding a full cup and not spill any of the contents.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hoang1991_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hoang1991-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  The Mongols, who ride hundreds of miles on horseback across the roadless steppe, place a very high value on horses with a smooth gait.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SIT_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SIT-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mongolian horsemen are required to learn everything necessary to care for a horse.  This is because they do not typically employ outside experts such as trainers, farriers or veterinarians and must do everything themselves.  For particularly difficult problems, the local elders may be called in or even an outside vet if one can be found.  Materials such as books on horse training or medical care are uncommon and seldom used.  Informally knowledge is passed down orally from parent to child.\n</p><p>Though <a href=\"/wiki/Mongolian_horse\" title=\"Mongolian horse\">Mongolian horses</a> are small, they are used to carry quite large, heavy riders.  This ability is due in part to the riders' habit of frequently switching off horses so as not to overtax any particular animal.  However, Mongol horses are also very strong.  A Darkhad horse weighing only 250&#160;kg. can carry a load of 300&#160;kg\u2014the equivalent of carrying another horse on its back.  When pulling a cart, a team of four Mongol horses can draw a load of 4400&#160;lbs for 50\u201360&#160;km a day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cheng1984_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cheng1984-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Horses are usually not ridden until they are three years old; a two-year-old horse may be broken with a particularly light rider so as to avoid back problems.  The breaking process is quite simple: the rider simply gets on and lets the horse run until it is exhausted.  Then the horse is taught to respond to the pull of the reins.  In <a href=\"/wiki/Kh%C3%B6vsg%C3%B6l_Province\" title=\"Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province\">Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province</a>, the horses may be worked in round pens.

A herdsman must first catch the horse he wants; to do this, he mounts a special catch-horse which has been trained for the purpose.  Carrying an <i>urga,</i> a lasso attached to a long pole, he chases after the horse he wants and loops the <i>urga</i> around its neck.  The catch-horse helps the herdsmen pull back on the looped horse until it grows tired and stops running.  At this point another rider will come up and put a saddle on it and mount.  The horse will run and buck until it recalls its earlier training and allows itself to be ridden.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Haslund,_Henning_p._111_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Haslund,_Henning_p._111-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>  The catching part may take up to several hours, depending on the terrain, the catcher's skill, and the equipment used.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bruun,_Ole._Precious_Steppe_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bruun,_Ole._Precious_Steppe-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"As_warhorses\">As warhorses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Horse_culture_in_Mongolia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: As warhorses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg/220px-Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"124\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg/330px-Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg/440px-Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"760\" data-file-height=\"430\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Mongol_warrior_of_Genghis_Khan.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mongol warrior on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot.</div></div></div>\n<p>Mongol horses are best known for their role as the war steeds of <a href=\"/wiki/Genghis_Khan\" title=\"Genghis Khan\">Genghis Khan</a>, who is reputed to have said: \"It is easy to conquer the world from the back of a horse.\"  The Mongol soldier relied on his horses to provide him with food, drink, transportation, armor, shoes, ornamentation, bowstring, rope, fire, sport, music, hunting, entertainment, spiritual power, and in case of his death, a mount to ride in the afterlife.  The Khan's army, weapons, war tack and military tactics were built around the idea of mounted cavalry archers, and to a lesser extent light and heavy cavalry.  In the Secret History of the Mongols, Genghis Khan is recorded as urging his general <a href=\"/wiki/Subutai\" title=\"Subutai\">Subutai</a> to pursue his enemies as though they were wild horses with a catch-pole loop around their neck.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cleaves133_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cleaves133-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Captured enemy rulers were sometimes trampled to death by horses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-factsanddetails1_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-factsanddetails1-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As a war vehicle, the Mongol horse compared favorably with other breeds in use at the time.  Mongol horses needed little water<sup id=\"cite_ref-Thelongridersguild.com_19-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Thelongridersguild.com-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> and did not need to be fed daily rations of grain, as many European breeds did.  Their ability to forage beneath the snow and find their own fodder allowed the Mongols freedom to operate without long supply trains, a factor which was key to their military success.  Mongol horses were bred to survive in harsh conditions, making it possible for the Mongols to mount successful winter campaigns against Russia.  The excellent long distance endurance of the Mongol horse allowed warriors to outlast enemy cavalry during battle; the same endurance granted the Mongols a communications advantage across their widely spread out fronts, since messages had to be conveyed by horse.  The main disadvantage of the Mongol horse as a war steed was that it was slower than some of the other breeds it faced on the battlefield.  However, this drawback was compensated for by the fact that it was typically required to carry less weight than other cavalry horses.  Although the Mongol horse is almost a pony, it acquired a fearsome reputation among the Mongols' enemies.  Matthew Paris, an English writer in the 1200s, described the small steeds as, \"big, strong horses, which eat branches and even trees, and which they [the Mongols] have to mount by the help of three steps on account of the shortness of their thighs.\"  (Though short, the Mongols did not actually use steps to mount.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-archive.org_24-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-archive.org-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It is said that a Mongol warrior's horse would come at his whistle and follow him around, doglike.

Armies would also hunt for food while on the march, an activity which could wear out the horses.  Genghis Khan, concerned that his soldiers would use up the strength of their horses before reaching the battlefield, instructed general <a href=\"/wiki/Subutai\" title=\"Subutai\">Subutai</a> that he should set limits on the amount of hunting his men did.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cleaves134_29-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cleaves134-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>  As of 1911, horsemen still hunted wolves from horseback.  Elizabeth Kendall observed, \"These Mongolian wolves are big and savage, often attacking the herds, and one alone will pull down a good horse or steer. The people wage more or less unsuccessful war upon them and at times they organize a sort of battue. Men, armed with lassoes, are stationed at strategic points, while others, routing the wolves from their lair, drive them within reach.\" (see also <i><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Wayfarer_in_China/Chapter_13\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"s:A Wayfarer in China/Chapter 13\">A Wayfarer in China</a></i>).\n</p><p>The Mongols used many tools meant specifically to attack mounted riders.  The spear used by warriors had a hook at the end which was used for dehorsing opponents and snagging the legs of enemies' horses.  They also used whistling arrows to frighten opposing horses.  Mongols had no qualms about shooting the mounts out from under other cavalrymen; there was even a particular type of arrow especially designed for the purpose.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated4_30-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated4-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>  For this reason, horses of well-to-do individuals wore armored with iron or hardened leather plates called lamellae.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated4_30-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated4-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>  The armor was a full body covering with five distinct pieces that shielded the head, neck, body and hindquarters.  The Mongols preferred to use a whip to urge their horses on during battle, while their European opponents preferred spurs.  The whip provided them with a tactical advantage because it was more safe and effective than spurs: a whip can be felt through armor and does not harm the horse, whereas spurs cannot be felt through armor and injure the horse.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated4_30-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated4-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>  When the Mongols wished to conceal their movements or make themselves appear more numerous, they would sometimes tie a tree branch to their horse's tail to raise dust, obscuring their position and creating the illusion of a larger group of horsemen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A story goes that Jebe shot the horse out from under Genghis Khan during a battle.  The animal in question had had a white-speckled muzzle.  When Jebe was captured later, he admitted flat out to the Khan's face that he had fired the arrow in question.  Genghis Khan admired the man's courage, and instead of killing Jebe, he took him into his own army.  Many years later, when Jebe had become a general, Genghis Khan became concerned that his subordinate had ambitions to replace him.  To allay the Khan's suspicions, Jebe sent him a gift of 1,000 horses with white speckled muzzles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hoang1991_2-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hoang1991-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Horses were used to guide the Mongols' makeshift boats across rivers.  Pian de Carpine described the procedure as follows: \"When they come to a river, they cross it in the following way, even if it is a large one: the chiefs have a round, light skin, around the top of which they have loopholes very close together through which they pass a cord, and they stretch it so that it bellies out, and this they fill with clothes and other things, and then they bind it down very tightly. After that they put their saddles and other hard things on it, and the men likewise sit on it. Then they tie the boat thus made to the tail of a horse, and a man swims along ahead leading it; or they sometimes have two oars, and with them they row across the water, thus crossing the river. Some of the poorer people have a leather pouch, well sewn, each man having one; and in this pouch or sack they put their clothing and all their things, and they tie the mouth of the bag tightly, and tie it to the tail of a horse, then they cross as stated above.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-archive.org_24-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-archive.org-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Mongols covered continental distances on horseback.  In particular, general Subetei's European army was fighting a full 5,000&#160;km distant from their homeland in Mongolia.  Since his forces did not travel on a direct beeline but made various diversions en route, the 5,000 kilometers actually translates to a horseback ride that has been estimated at 8,000&#160;km in total length.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Messages were carried rapidly throughout the Mongol empire by a pony-express style relay system in which riders would pass messages from station to station, switching to a fresh horse each time.  A similar system of horse-expedited mail was still practiced in Mongolia as of 1911.  Elizabeth Kendall described it as follows: \"Under the treaties of 1858 and 1860 a post-route between the Russian frontier and Kalgan was established, and in spite of the competing railway through Manchuria, a horse-post still crosses the desert three times a month each way. The Mongols who are employed for the work go through from city to city in seven days, galloping all the way, with frequent changes of horses and, less frequent, of men.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spiritual_beliefs\">Spiritual beliefs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Horse_culture_in_Mongolia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Spiritual beliefs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is believed that the spirit of a stallion resides within his mane; thus, a long, thick mane is considered a mark of a strong animal.

We have not yet found any epic in this nomadic tradition that is without a steed and the assistance it provides.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_Jangar_Epic\">In the Jangar Epic</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Horse_culture_in_Mongolia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: In the Jangar Epic\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>One of the three traditional Mongolian oral epics is the Jangar, in which horses play roles almost as important as those of the heroes. The most famous horse from the epic is <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aranjagaan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Aranjagaan (page does not exist)\">Aranjagaan</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_of_Jangar\" title=\"Epic of Jangar\">Jangar</a>'s mount.  Aranjagaan was sired by a seven-year-old Heavenly Horse who came down to mate with a mortal mare by a lake. (There is intertextual conflict about this later in the epic, where Aranjagaan's father is described as an ordinary horse who was ridden by Jangar's father.)  Aranjagaan's capabilities are described in epic style: \"He was red all over and had a body the size of a hill.  He had a huge tail and ears.  He had hooves the size of a sheep pen and a butt as hard as cast iron.  As soon as he was born, he hissed and frightened away wolves, which had stalked near the stall.  At the age of one, he joined a war.  At two, he fought wars north and south.  He was in his prime at the age of seven.  Aranjagaan hissed excitedly, making tree leaves, grasses and stones thunder and even frightening boars dozens of baraa away.  His power seemed to radiate from within him.  One leap forward would bring his rider hundreds of meters away.  His power would hold anyone in great awe.  His red brilliance was fiery and dazzled everyone who saw him. ...  Even Aranjagaan's roaring shook enemies and weakened their knees.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  Nor are these epic descriptions limited to Aranjagaan.  Even the nameless horses like Altan Gheej's crimson mount have poetically glorified capabilities.  The crimson horse is described as having a tail 80 feet long and ears like pestles.  It can run at a full gallop for two months straight and swim across a sea for 25 days.  Moligen Tabuga's scarlet horse is described as being as large as forty-nine seas.  Sanale's red horse has ears like iron bars.  These sizes and abilities are typical for all epic steeds in the Jangar.  In particular, the size of the tail, ears, and hooves are praised, though occasionally one will find the horse's legs described as tree trunks, etc.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It is the horses, not the heroes, that claim divine ancestry.  Indeed, the motif of the divinely born horse is repeated in the epic, as when the history of Aletan Kale's wondrous buff and white horse is given: \"The horse's father was from heaven.  The heavenly horse met and mated with a beautiful female horse at the bank of Kas Lake.  Then the heavenly horse licked her face and flew away, leaving a heartbroken companion.  The female horse gave birth to the buff and white horse with endless expectations.\"  Horses like the buff and white and Aranjagaan are themselves considered divine on account of their parentage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In Mongolian epics, horses save their riders in battle and even fight alongside of them.  When Jangar is struck with a <a href=\"/wiki/Poisoned_arrow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Poisoned arrow\">poisoned arrow</a>, Aranjagaan realizes what has happened and carefully carries Jangar to safety.  To keep his swaying master from toppling off, the horse skillfully leans back and forth, even going so far as to crouching down his forelegs or hindlegs when ascending and descending hills to keep his back level.  When they arrive at a house, he lays down to let his rider gently fall off.  On another occasion, Aranjagaan runs to a place where a battle is occurring and begins to fight, riderless, alongside the hero.  During fights, the epic narrative typically switches back and forth between describing the combat of riders and the actions of their horses, i.e. the hero throws a spear, then the hero's horse lunges forward to pursue an enemy.  In battles, the poets describe the horse as a self-willed actor.  There are few descriptions of rein-pulling or leg guidance; rather, the impression is that the horse chooses how best to carry on the fight as it works in concert with its rider.  The horses bite and kick enemies, and will even bite enemy horses.  During a battle, Sanale's red horse \"provided him with inexhaustible power.  It kicked the enemies eighteen thousand times from the left and then eighteen thousand times from the right so that the spears, broadswords, and arrows were broken.  It fought like a huge eagle extending its wings.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  Horses can be wounded.  In a long-running battle, Altan Gheej's crimson horse is \"beaten black and blue and scabbed all over.  With eyes covered by blood, the horse was nearly trapped by the enemy several times.  Seeing the situation was urgent, Altan Gheej whipped the horse to the sea and swam for awhile.  The blood was cleaned and the wounds healed up magically.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  The horses are eager for battle.  When Hongor's livid horse sees Hongor equipped for war, it kicks and snorts with excitement.\n</p><p>The horses often have adventures of their own, like getting caught in a whirlpool and escaping by grabbing a branch in their teeth and hauling themselves onto shore.  The poet does not fail to describe the horse's exhausted collapse on the bank, the rider's concern, and the horse's subsequent recovery as it stands up, joyfully shakes its mane, and begins cropping grass.  Mongolian poets consider it important to describe a horse's feelings and actions as well as those of the human characters.  For example, when Jangar stops to drink at a cool stream and delights in the beauty of nature, the poet also notes that Aranjagaan grazes and enjoys a roll in the grass.  On another pleasant excursion, Aranjagaan's rider begins to sing, and Aranjagaan moves his hooves in time with the song.\n</p><p>Heroes and horses converse with one another on a regular basis.  The hero will urge and rebuke his horse, demanding more speed, as when Altan Gheej says to his crimson horse after 50 days and nights of running, \"Aren't you known as a 'flying arrow' or a 'blue eagle'?  Why haven't you crossed over your enclosure after so many days?  If so, when can we arrive at our destination?\" or when swimming a sea, \"A hero in need is a hero indeed.  Where is your mighty power?  How can you get adrift like this?\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  The horses will also tell their riders when they can't give anymore.  For example, when Sanale is fleeing a devil, his sweating, exhausted horse says, \"My master, I have tried my best and cannot run faster.  Please get rid of the devil, or else we will both have trouble.\"  On another occasion, Sanale's red horse neighs loudly to wake his master from a deep, drunken slumber, then rebukes him for sleeping when he should be killing devils.  Sanale, ashamed, apologizes to the horse.  The red horse replies impassively, \"Drinking delays and drinking hard kills.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Heroes in the Jangar show great affection for their horses.  They will rub their horse's nose affectionately and care for them in times of hardship.  When Sanale was forced to flee into the Gobi desert, he and his horse became exhausted with hunger and thirst.  The horse saw a plant that it recognized as poisonous, but couldn't resist eating it.  Immediately it collapsed in agony.  Weeping, Sanale grasped the horse's neck and told it that he had nothing to give it but his own flesh, but that they must go on or their enemies would kill them.  The horse was deeply moved at his master's concern and cried.  It heroically managed to rise and bear Sanale away.  When the horse later collapses, Sanale tries to help it stand.  Eventually, afraid that his pursuers will harm the weakened horse, Sanale hides it in a cave while he fights them off.  During an exhausting battle, Sabar's maroon horse gasps, \"Master, we have fought for seven days, and I feel dizzy and giddy due to lack of food and water.  Can we just rush out and find something to eat?\"  Sabar leaves the battlefield, finds fodder for his horse, takes a nap while it eats its fill, then returns to the battle and continues fighting.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The epic horses are considered precious possessions, and the quality of a man's horse reveals his status and wealth.  When introducing a new hero, the poets inevitably include a description of the hero's prized steed.  One of the descriptions of Sanale, for instance, is that \"he rides a crimson horse rarely seen on the steppes.\"  Sabar is introduced by describing that he has \"an unparalleled sorrel steed worth 100,000 slaves.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  The horse's fittings are also important.  The poet describes Jangar's beautiful clothes, then adds that Aranjagaan was fitted with a golden halter and long silver reins.  Because of their value, horses are also important in peace negotiations; for example, Jangar seeks to buy peace from Sanale by offering him the twelve best horses in his herd.  The horses, Aranjagaan in particular, are also subject to ransom demands by covetous enemy Khans.  On various occasions, hostile Khans demand Aranjagaan as tribute to avoid war.  One of the threatened consequences for a defeated enemy is to have all his horses driven off by the victor.\n</p><p>The horses play key roles throughout the story, providing information and assisting the heroes against enemies against enemies.  Sanale is almost seduced by a hungry devil disguised as a beautiful temptress, but his horse snorts and blows up her skirt, revealing shaggy legs.  Altan Gheej's crimson horse is hitched to the eaves of an enemy Khan's palace and pulls until the entire palace collapses.  Sabar's maroon horse magically finds out that Sabar's homeland is being attacked and conveys a message from Jangar to Sabar, asking him to return and save him.\n</p><p>The fact that horses serve as meat animals in Mongolian culture is not ignored in the epic.  Sanale warns his red horse that if their enemies catch them, they will eat him and make his equine skin into boots.  The heroes carry dry horse meat as provisions as they ride off.  During a critical moment in a battle, Hongor says to his horse, \"You are my dearest brother, a rare horse.  You have never been beaten.  If you fail today, I will skin you and eat your meat!\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pan_Zhongming_2011_48-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Pan_Zhongming_2011-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  The horse finds fresh strength and fights on.  On another occasion, a different hero warns Aranjagaan that the horse will suffer a similar fate if he doesn't arrive in time to help in a critical battle.  Aranjagaan replies that he will make it in time, but that if the hero does not win the battle when they arrive, Aranjagaan will buck him off and break his neck.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Catalogue_of_Horses\">A Catalogue of Horses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Horse_culture_in_Mongolia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: A Catalogue of Horses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>In keeping with the Mongolian tradition of not giving horses names, most of the horses in the Jangar do not have names, but are instead identified by their physical traits.

Then the mothers stand near their foal, and allow themselves to be quietly milked; and if one is too wild, then a man takes the colt and brings it to her, allowing it to suck a little; then he takes it away and the milker takes its place.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-washington1_35-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-washington1-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>  Much the same procedure is still used today.  In the summer, mares are milked six times a day, once every two hours.  A mare produces an average of 0.11&#160;lbs of milk each time, with a yearly production of 662&#160;lbs total.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cheng1984_21-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cheng1984-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>  The milk is used to make the ubiquitous fermented drinks of Mongolia, <a href=\"/wiki/Kumis\" title=\"Kumis\">airag</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Kumis\" title=\"Kumis\">kumis</a>.  One particular variety of \"black\" kumis, <i>caracosmos,</i> was made entirely from the milk of black mares; this was reserved for the aristocracy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-washington1_35-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-washington1-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> William of Rubruck reported that <a href=\"/wiki/Batu_Khan\" title=\"Batu Khan\">Batu Khan</a> had the milk of three thousand mares collected and sent to his court on a daily basis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-washington1_35-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-washington1-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>  In large herds, the gentlest animals are the preferred milk horses.  Milk is also boiled and dried into hard white chunks that can be stored and eaten on journeys.  During the communist era, Mongolian factories and mines continued to maintain herds of horses specifically for the purposes of providing airag for their workers, which was considered necessary for health and productivity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-marines.mil_49-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-marines.mil-49\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The milking of horses begins midway through July and lasts till late November, sometimes going as long as early December.  Of the various animals milked by Mongolians, horses give milk for the second longest period of time (cattle give milk for a longer period).

As one Mongolian explained, \"Because the horse does not get diseases that other livestock become sick of, [sic] such as tuberculosis and other inflammation diseases, its meat and milk are considered to be clean.\"  William of Rubruck reported that the Mongols used the intestines of the horses to make sausages.  Horses are considered to have the fourth most desirable kind of meat, after sheep, cattle and goats.  Mature animals are preferred to young ones, as the taste is considered better.  Horses are slaughtered in late November when the animals are at their fattest; it is considered bad practice to slaughter them in the summer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>They would also use the leather from the rear part of the horse's hide to make shoes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-washington1_35-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-washington1-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>  Horse skin was one of the materials used for making the bowstring of the Mongols' infamous composite bow.
