A victory pose is a pose assumed by a person to celebrate victory, particularly by athletes and other sportspeople. Victory poses often involve raising the arms in the air. Pre-programmed victory poses by fictional characters in video games have been the subject of controversy, particularly where the victory pose has been regarded as overly sexualized.  Strategy First-Person Shooter Overwatch (video game) was particularly by press for it's overly sexualized victory poses,  leading to certain animations being removed from the game by developers Blizzard.  Role Playing Games such as Final Fantasy often have accompanying victory poses after encounters. These snippets of animation are usually played alongside a short music clip (Known as the "fanfare"), with characters celebrating their win.
