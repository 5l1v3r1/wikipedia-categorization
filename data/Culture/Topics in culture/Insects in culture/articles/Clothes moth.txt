Clothes moth or clothing moth is the common name for several species of moth considered to be pests, whose larvae eat animal fibres (hairs), including clothing and other fabrics. These include: The larvae of clothes moths eat animal fibres, which are not removed by other scavengers. In human societies, garments and textiles are made of animal fibres; several moth species eat them, creating holes and damage, and are consequently considered a pest, deriving their generic common name from their diet. Various means are used to repel or kill moths. Pheromone traps are also used both to count and to destroy clothes moths. Among other methods, recommendations to protect heritage collections of textiles include checking the undersides of chairs, moving and vacuum-cleaning all furniture once a month and sealing the discarded vacuum cleaner bag, checking and shaking textiles every month, and regularly checking attics and chimneys. If textiles do become infested, adults, eggs and larvae can be killed by freezing garments in sealed bags for a fortnight.
