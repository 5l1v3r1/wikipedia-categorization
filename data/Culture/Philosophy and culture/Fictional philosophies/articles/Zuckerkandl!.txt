Zuckerkandl! is a comic book published in 1968.  It was written by Robert Maynard Hutchins and animated by John Hubley.   The book profiles the philosophy of the fictitious Austrian thinker Dr. Alexander Zuckerkandl and satirizes his philosophy of disentanglement. Resembling a fairy tale in form, Zuckerkandl! has been interpreted as a parody of Freud.  As such, it blames Zuckerkandl and by extension Freud for the ills of modern society.   The comic book also has an animated film version,  directed by John Hubley.
