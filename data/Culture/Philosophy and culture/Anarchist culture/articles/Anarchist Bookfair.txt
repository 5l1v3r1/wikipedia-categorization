 The Anarchist Bookfair is the name of several annual anarchist book fairs. The British Bookfair started in 1983, and it has become the largest anarchist event in the British calendar,  and is a combination of stalls, talks and workshops by anarchist groups and campaigns. Most British anarchist groups attend such as Freedom Press, Anarchist Federation, Kate Sharpley Library, Class War, Solidarity Federation and the WOMBLES. The 2005 event ended with riot police  while the 2006 event was attended by the Libertarian Alliance group who were thrown out.

Responding to many years of censorship, some Leipzig authors and graphic designers, often limited to publication via samizdat, teamed up and sent invitations to  dpa and  ADN to an alternate Book Fair; 40 publishers registered to take part.  The initiative group included Dieter Kalka, Benjamin Weinkauf,  Jayne-Ann Igel, Rosemarie Heinze, Sebastian Kleindienst, Matthias Seydewitz, Hermut Geppert, Peter Hinze and Katharina Luft. They aimed to give newly-established publishers in  the GDR and small publishers an opportunity to present,  to make offers and to meet each other, publishers and authors. Accordingly, there was a caf√© for meetings, and readings distributed throughout the day.  Frau Renker adopted the idea for the Leipzig Book Fair and the concept later became Leipzig liest ("Leipzig Reads"). A continuation of the alternative Book Fair with the support of officials, as proposed by Ms. Renker,  was rejected by most publishers and by the initiative group.  Special guests included:
