 The girl next door is a young female stock character who is described as "sweet, ordinary and caring" and lives right next door. They are often used in romantic stories, where the hero is caught in a love triangle between two women and will usually choose the "girl next door" he grew up with, rather than a more well-off or beautiful woman with less morals.  Other times, this character ignores the hero for another male character, despite being the object of his affections. [better source needed] The masculine counterpart is boy next door, who is also described as "wholesome, sweet and shy".
