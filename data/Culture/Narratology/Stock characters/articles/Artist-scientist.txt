The Artist-scientist is one of the Jungian archetypes in mythology.  Like all of these archetypes, the artist-scientist is an abstraction of life and the human mind.  While never as common as archetypes like the child or the Hero, the artist-scientist is immediately recognizable.  They are a builder, an inventor, a seeker, a dreamer, and a thinker.  Distracted by their own thoughts, they frequently have to be pulled in out of the rain.  They are simultaneously vastly knowledgeable and yet innocent, impulsive yet cautious.  They represent the wonder to be found in curiosity, and the dangers.  The name references the idea that they are both a creator and a discoverer, and that they are not a fount of information like the Bard or an adviser like the wise old man, but a source of change.  The frequent obliviousness of the Artist-scientist to the aspects of reality that do not fit with their plans (the stereotype being that they devise an elaborate plan to scale the walls of a fortress as the hero opens the back door and walks in) symbolizes the occasionally underwhelming nature of reality as opposed to our idealized vision of it.
