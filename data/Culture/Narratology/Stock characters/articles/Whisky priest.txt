Whisky priest (sometimes Whiskey priest) is a priest or ordained minister who shows clear signs of moral weakness, while at the same time teaching a higher standard.  A whisky priest's shortcomings may include many vices, but usually include alcoholism. Graham Greene cites another person using the term in his travel book, Lawless Road, published in 1939. Greene also used "whisky priest" to refer to the unnamed main character in his 1940 novel The Power and the Glory.  Season 3 (Episode 6) of Yes Minister was called "The Whisky Priest". In the episode, Jim Hacker's wife tells him that, unlike Sir Humphrey Appleby, he at least has enough moral sense to know when he's done the wrong thing.
