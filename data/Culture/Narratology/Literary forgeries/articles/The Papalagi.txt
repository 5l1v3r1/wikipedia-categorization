The Papalagi (Der Papalagi) is a book by Erich Scheurmann (de) published in Germany in 1920, which contains descriptions of European life,  supposedly as seen through the eyes of a Samoan chief named Tuiavii. It is now regarded as fictional; see Gunter Senft's Weird Papalagi and a fake Samoan chief — A footnote to the Noble Savage Myth. It has been published in English by Legacy Editions in 1997, under the title Tuiavii's Way (ISBN 978-0-9682469-0-0). A 1975 edition was illustrated by Joost Swarte.
