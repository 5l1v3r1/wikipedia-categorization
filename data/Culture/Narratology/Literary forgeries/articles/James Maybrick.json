He was christened on 12 November 1838, at St Peter's Church in the city. He was named after a brother who had died the year before and was the Maybricks' third of seven sons.\n</p><p>Maybrick's cotton trading business required him to travel regularly to the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> and in 1871 he settled in <a href=\"/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia\" title=\"Norfolk, Virginia\">Norfolk</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a>, to establish a branch office of his company. While there in 1874 he contracted <a href=\"/wiki/Malaria\" title=\"Malaria\">malaria</a>, which was then treated with a medication containing arsenic; he became addicted to the drug for the rest of his life.\nIn 1880, Maybrick returned to the company's offices in Britain. Sailing from <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York</a> on 12 March 1880, he arrived in Liverpool six days later. During the journey he was introduced to Florence (Florie) Elizabeth Chandler, the daughter of a banker from <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama\" title=\"Mobile, Alabama\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Alabama\" title=\"Alabama\">Alabama</a>, and their relationship quickly blossomed. Despite the difference in their ages&#160;&#8211;&#32;he was 42 to her 18&#160;&#8211;&#32;they began to plan their wedding immediately.\n</p><p>The wedding was delayed until 27 July 1881, when it took place at St James' Church, <a href=\"/wiki/Piccadilly\" title=\"Piccadilly\">Piccadilly</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>.

He also resumed his relationships with his many mistresses, while his wife conducted an affair with an Alfred Brierley, a cotton broker. It is possible Florence embarked upon this on learning of her husband's infidelity.\n</p><p>In Maybrick's case a common-law wife, Sarah Ann Robertson, was identified. Sarah Ann is mentioned in her stepfather's <a href=\"/wiki/Will_(law)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Will (law)\">will</a> as \"Sarah Ann Maybrick, wife of James\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Death\">Death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=James_Maybrick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Maybrick's health deteriorated suddenly on 27 April 1889, and he died fifteen days later at his home in <a href=\"/wiki/Aigburth\" title=\"Aigburth\">Aigburth</a>. The circumstances of his death were deemed suspicious by his brothers and an inquest, held in a local hotel, came to the verdict that arsenic poisoning was the most likely cause, administered by persons unknown.\n</p><p>Suspicion immediately fell on Florence and she was arrested some days later. She stood trial at <a href=\"/wiki/Liverpool_Crown_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Liverpool Crown Court\">Liverpool Crown Court</a> and, after lengthy proceedings, the fairness of which was the subject of some debate in later years, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.

The diary's author does not mention his own name, but offers enough hints and references consistent with Maybrick's established life and habits that it is obvious readers are expected to believe it is him. The author of the document details alleged actions and crimes over a period of several months, taking credit for slaying the five victims most commonly credited to Jack the Ripper as well as for two other murders which have to date not been historically identified.\n</p><p>The diary was  first introduced to the world by Michael Barrett, an unemployed former Liverpool scrap metal dealer, who claimed at the time that it had been given to him by a friend, Tony Devereux, in a <a href=\"/wiki/Public_house\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Public house\">pub</a>. When this was queried, the story changed.   Barrett's wife Ann, formerly Graham, said that the diary had been in her family for as long as she could remember. She had asked Devereux to give it to her husband because he had literary aspirations and she thought he might write a book about it. She had not wanted to tell him her family owned it because she thought he would ask her father about it and relations between the two men were strained. It was published as <i>The Diary of Jack the Ripper</i> in 1993 to great controversy. Few experts gave it any credence from the outset, and most immediately dismissed it as a hoax, though some were open to the possibility it might be genuine. Debate was often heated, and one writer notes that the \"saga of the Maybrick diary is confusing, complicated and inescapably tortuous.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tests carried out on the ink used in the diary produced contradictory findings. The first test, using <a href=\"/wiki/Thin_layer_chromatography\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thin layer chromatography\">thin layer chromatography</a> (TLC) revealed the ink contained no iron, and was based on a synthetic dye called <a href=\"/wiki/Nigrosine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nigrosine\">nigrosine</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> patented and commercially available in 1867, and in general use in writing inks by the 1870s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The second TLC test found nothing in the ink inconsistent with the date of 1888, and that the ink contained iron and sodium, but no nigrosine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The third TLC test found nothing inconsistent with the Victorian period.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated341_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated341-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> A fourth TLC test was attempted, but could not be carried out.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated341_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated341-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Several tests were carried out to find out whether the ink contained <a href=\"/wiki/Chloroacetamide\" title=\"Chloroacetamide\">chloroacetamide</a>, a preservative, in an effort to definitively date the ink. According to one source, chloroacetamide was introduced into the <a href=\"/wiki/Merck_Index\" title=\"Merck Index\">Merck Index</a> in 1857, but not used commercially in ink until 1972.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> In 1995, Dr Earl Morris of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dow_Chemical_Company\" title=\"Dow Chemical Company\">Dow Chemical Company</a> stated that chloroacetamide has been found in preparations as early as 1857.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> A fourth test, this time using <a href=\"/wiki/Gas_chromatography\" title=\"Gas chromatography\">gas chromatography</a>, found chloroacetamide present, at 6.5 <a href=\"/wiki/Parts_per_million\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Parts per million\">parts per million</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> A fifth TLC test found traces of chloroacetamide, but this was attributed to contamination from the <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_control\" title=\"Scientific control\">control</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  The test was carried out again, and no chloroacetamide was found.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Among the investigators were sceptic <a href=\"/wiki/Joe_Nickell\" title=\"Joe Nickell\">Joe Nickell</a> and document expert <a href=\"/wiki/Kenneth_W._Rendell\" title=\"Kenneth W.

He also noted factual contradictions and handwriting inconsistencies. Written in a genuine Victorian scrapbook, but with 20 pages at the front end torn out, he also found this suspect as there was no logical explanation for the purported author to use such a book.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate <a href=\"/wiki/Affidavit\" title=\"Affidavit\">affidavits</a> that he was \"the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett's solicitor's subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett's withdrawal of the repudiation.\n</p><p>Some people, including Robert Smith, the present owner of the diary and original publisher of the associated book by Shirley Harrison, insist it may be genuine. They argue that scientific dating methods have established that the book and ink used to write in it are from the 19th century; that the symptoms of arsenic addiction, claimed to be described accurately in the book, are known to very few persons; that some details of the murders provided in it were known only to police and the Ripper himself before the book's publication; and that one of the original crime scene photographs shows the initials \"F. M.\" written on a wall behind the victim's body in what appears to be blood. These, they claim, refer to Florence Maybrick, James's wife, whose possible infidelities were the purported motivation for the murders.

He stated:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"On the basis of the evidence...especially the order in which the markings were made, it is clear that the engravings pre-date the vast majority of superficial surface scratch marks...the wear apparent on the engravings, evidenced by the rounded edges of the markings and 'polishing out' in places, would indicate a substantial age...whilst there is no evidence which would indicate a recent (last few years) origin...it must be emphasised that there are no features observed which conclusively prove the age of the engravings. They could have been produced recently, and deliberately artificially aged by polishing, but this would have been a complex multi-stage process...many of the features are only resolved by the scanning electron microscope, not being readily apparent in optical microscopy, and so, if they were of recent origin, the engraver would have to be aware of the potential evidence available from this technique, indicating a considerable skill and scientific awareness\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>In 1994, the watch was taken to the Interface Analysis Centre at <a href=\"/wiki/Bristol_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bristol University\">Bristol University</a> and studied by Dr Robert Wild using an electron microscope and <a href=\"/wiki/Auger_electron_spectroscopy\" title=\"Auger electron spectroscopy\">Auger electron spectroscopy</a>.
