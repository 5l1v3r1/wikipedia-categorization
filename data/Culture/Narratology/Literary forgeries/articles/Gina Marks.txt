Haunted locations: Gina Marie Marks (born January 25, 1973) is an American "psychic" and convicted fraudster.  Using the pseudonym of Regina Milbourne,  she co-authored Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante, a memoir published by HarperCollins in 2006.      In 2018 Marks pleaded guilty to defrauding five victims out of more than $340,000, but blamed her prosecution on racism against people she referred to as "gypsies".  In August 2018, Marks' career as a psychic con-artist, and the decade-long pursuit by detective Bob Nygaard to bring her to justice, were portrayed on an episode of the CBS series Pink Collar Crimes titled "The Psychic Didn't See Him Coming".    Marks has had numerous arrests and convictions in Florida for defrauding clients out of large sums of money while claiming to use "psychic" powers to help them: Investigating a psychic fraud case involving Marks in 2008 marked the beginning of South Florida private investigator Bob Nygaard's  "psychic hunting" career. Nygaard also brought Marks to justice in 2010 and 2016, culminating in her 2018 conviction for the theft of over $340,000.     On August 11, 2018, CBS broadcast an episode of its true crime TV show, Pink Collar Crimes, titled "The Psychic Didn't See Him Coming". The episode recounts the story of private eye Bob Nygaard and his numerous pursuits of Marks to obtain justice for his clients between 2008 and 2018.    Marks is the co-author of Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante, published by HarperCollins in 2006. The book purports to be a true memoir about a psychic named Regina Milbourne, who used her supposed paranormal "gifts" to help many of Miami's least desirable element: drug dealers, thieves, murderers and pedophiles. Regina claims that she "comes clean" in the book, "divulging the unimaginable horrors and shocking confessions that she witnessed throughout her career".  Marks is married to Sunny Miller,  and has a daughter, Hillarie Miller.
