In the piece, Solway claimed that he had hunted the reclusive fisherman-poet for years until he had finally met him in 1991, and that he had begun to translate his poems in 1993.\n</p><p>Solway claimed that Karavis had been born in 1932 in <a href=\"/wiki/Chania\" title=\"Chania\">Chania</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Crete\" title=\"Crete\">Crete</a>, and that he lived on the <a href=\"/wiki/Dodecanese\" title=\"Dodecanese\">Dodecanese</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Island\" title=\"Island\">island</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Lipsi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lipsi\">Lipsi</a>. After Karavis' education on <a href=\"/wiki/Serifos\" title=\"Serifos\">Serifos</a>, disrupted by <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_war\" title=\"Civil war\">civil war</a>, he became a <a href=\"/wiki/Fisherman\" title=\"Fisherman\">fisherman</a> and settled on <a href=\"/wiki/Amorgos\" title=\"Amorgos\">Amorgos</a>, selling his books of poetry in local harbors. Amongst his supposed collections was <i>White Poems</i> (1965). After having laboured in obscurity for the greater part of his life, he had become one of the country's most acclaimed and admired writers with the 1989 publication of <i>The Dream Masters</i>.\n</p><p>In reality, Karavis was the creation of Solway. However, other people joined the joke. In the next issue there was a letter from a self-declared expert on Greek poetry, \"Fred Reed\". He did not dispute Karavis' existence, but claimed that Karavis was in fact a <a href=\"/wiki/Smuggler\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Smuggler\">smuggler</a>, not a fisherman, and that the first poems were nothing else that pirated translations from a group of expatriate Canadians.\n</p><p>Later, press attach\u00e9 Yiorgos Chouliaris of the Greek embassy, wrote to Solway to congratulate him for \"imaginative effort\". Solway convinced him to join the hoax.\n</p><p>The fame of Karavis spread. There were reports of international conferences about his poetry in <a href=\"/wiki/Thessaloniki\" title=\"Thessaloniki\">Thessaloniki</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Coimbra\" title=\"Coimbra\">Coimbra</a>. Solway met a writer who claimed that he had admired Karavis for many years, and someone who said that Karavis was more worthy of the <a href=\"/wiki/Nobel_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Prize\">Nobel Prize</a> than more famous Greek poets. He even received two postcards signed with Karavis' name.\n</p><p>In 2000, Chouliaris was one of the hosts at the launch of a translation of Karavis' poems, <i>Saracen Island: The Poetry of Andreas Karavis</i>. Although Solway claimed to be the translator, the work was entirely his creation. A man who claimed to be Karavis appeared, wearing a fisherman's cap and speaking something that at least sounded like Greek.\n</p><p>Soon afterward Matthew Hayes, a columnist of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail\" title=\"The Globe and Mail\">The Globe and Mail</a></i> in <a href=\"/wiki/Toronto\" title=\"Toronto\">Toronto</a>, wrote an article entitled <i>Karavis: Greek god of poetry or literary hoax?</i>. In a 2001 issue of <i>Lingua Franca</i> magazine, Solway finally confessed in public that he had invented the poet, and that the man who had appeared at the book launch, purporting to be Karavis,  was actually Solway's <a href=\"/wiki/Dentist\" title=\"Dentist\">dentist</a>.\n</p><p>Solway has said that he had created Karavis as an \"<a href=\"/wiki/Alter_ego\" title=\"Alter ego\">alter ego</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Heteronym_(literature)\" title=\"Heteronym (literature)\">heteronym</a>\" to gain new inspiration for his poetry.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
