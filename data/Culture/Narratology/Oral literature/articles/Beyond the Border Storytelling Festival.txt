Beyond The Border Wales International Storytelling Festival is a Wales-based international arts festival dedicated to celebrating the retelling of the world’s traditional stories. Begun in 1993, the festival is held every other year over the first weekend in July in the grounds of St Donat's Castle, on the Heritage Coast of the Vale of Glamorgan.   Along with performances of world myth, legend and folktale, the festival features music, poetry, cinema, dance, theatre and puppetry, together with world food stalls, workshops, Craft Market, bookshops and the Beyond The Border Real Ale Bar. The 2014 festival involved over 100 different performances taking place in 9 different venues throughout the gardens of St Donat's Castle, including the Tythe Barn Theatre and the 14th Century Bradenstoke Hall of St Donat's Castle, and attracted over 2000 people of all ages, drawn from across the UK and abroad. The festival is supported among others by Arts Council of Wales,  and has been awarded Major Events Status by the Welsh Government. In addition to the biennial festival weekend, Beyond The Border runs an active year-round programme of storytelling events and community activities, aimed at raising awareness of the art of performance storytelling and the world’s common heritage of traditional stories.
