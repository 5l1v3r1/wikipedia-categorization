The Griffin and Sabine Saga is a series of bestselling    epistolary novels written by Nick Bantock.  The first three novels in the series, Griffin and Sabine, Sabine's Notebook and The Golden Mean, form the original Griffin and Sabine Trilogy and were first published in 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively. Each story is told through a series of letters and postcards between the two main characters, Griffin Moss and Sabine Strohem.  Every page features a facsimile of a postcard or a letter actually enclosed in an envelope.  The initial Griffin and Sabine Trilogy was followed up with another trilogy, the Morning Star Trilogy, consisting of The Gryphon, Alexandria, and The Morning Star.  The second trilogy begins an unspecified number of years after The Golden Mean and introduces two new correspondents, Matthew Sedon (the recipient of the last postcard in The Golden Mean) and Isabella de Reims.  The final book in the series, The Pharos Gate, was published in 2016, the 25th anniversary of the first publication of Griffin and Sabine. Contemporary Authors Online has a lengthy entry on Nick Bantock and The Griffin and Sabine Trilogy. The books of the trilogy have been reviewed in Los Angeles Times Book Review, Maclean's, Newsweek, The Observer, and Quill & Quire.  The books were adapted into a 1997 CD-ROM game Ceremony of Innocence by Peter Gabriel's company RealWorld. Bantock also adapted the story into a play. In January 2015, it was announced that Bantock and Bound Press would collaborate on a new interactive version of the trilogy. The apps would be developed for iOS and Android. A kickstarter campaign was launched to support the development of three new interactive apps based on Griffin and Sabine for iOS and Android.
