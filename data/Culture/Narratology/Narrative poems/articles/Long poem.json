this: a long poem is long enough that its bulk carries meaning.  Susan Stanford Friedman describes the long poem as a genre in which all poems that are not considered to be short can be a considered a part. These overly inclusive definitions, though problematic, serve the breadth of the long poem, and have fueled its adaptation as a voice for <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_identity\" title=\"Cultural identity\">cultural identity</a> among <a href=\"/wiki/Marginalization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marginalization\">marginalized persons</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_poetry#Modern_developments\" title=\"History of poetry\">Modern</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Contemporary_poetry&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Contemporary poetry (page does not exist)\">Contemporary poetry</a>.  Only a broad definition can apply to the genre as a whole. In general, a poem is a \"long poem\" when its length enhances and expands upon the thematic, creative, and formal weight of the poem.\n</p><p>Though the term \"long poem\" may be elusive to define, the term is now finally getting the attention it deserves.  The genre has gained importance both as a <a href=\"/wiki/Literary_form\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Literary form\">literary form</a>, and as a means of collective expression. Lynn Keller solidifies the genre's importance in her essay, \"Pushing the Limits,\" by stating that the long poem will always be recognized as a notable genre of importance in early twentieth-century <a href=\"/wiki/American_literature\" title=\"American literature\">American literature</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Purposes\">Purposes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Purposes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tale_of_the_tribe\">Tale of the tribe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Tale of the tribe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A long poem often functions to tell a \"tale of the tribe,\" or a story that encompasses a whole culture's values and history.  Ezra Pound coined the phrase, referring to his own long poem <i>The Cantos.</i>  The long poem's length and scope can contain concerns of a magnitude that a shorter poem cannot address. The poet may see himself or herself as the \"bearer of the light,\" to use Langston Hughes' term, who leads the journey through a culture's story, or as the one who makes known the light already within the tribe. The poet may also serve as a poet-prophet with special insight for their own tribe.\n</p><p>In Modern and Contemporary long poems the \"tale of the tribe\" has frequently been retold by culturally, economically, and socially marginalized persons.  Thus, pseudo-epic narratives, such as Derek Walcott's \"Omeros,\" have emerged to occupy voids where post colonial persons, racially oppressed persons, women, and other people who have been ignored by classic epics, and denied a voice in the prestigious genre.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Revisionary_mythopoesis\">Revisionary mythopoesis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Revisionary mythopoesis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Various poets have undertaken a \"revisionary mythopoesis\" in the long poem genre.  Since the genre has roots in forms that traditionally exclude poets who have minimal cultural authority, the long poem can be a \"fundamental re-vision,\" and function as a discourse for those poets (Friedman).  These \"re-visions\" may include neglected characters, deflation of traditionally celebrated characters, and a general reworking of standards set by the literary tradition. This revision is noted especially by feminist critical work that analyzes how women are given a new voice and story through the transformation of a previously \"masculine\" form.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultural_commentary\">Cultural commentary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Cultural commentary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Lynn Keller notes that the long poem enabled modernists to include sociological, anthropological, and historical material.  Many long poems deal with history not in the revisionary sense but as a simple re-telling in order to prove a point.  Then there are those who go a step further and recite a place's or people's history in order to teach.  Like revisionary mythopoesis, they may attempt to make a point or demonstrate a new perspective by exaggerating or editing certain parts of a history.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Concerns_and_controversies\">Concerns and controversies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Concerns and controversies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fears_of_the_writer\">Fears of the writer</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Fears of the writer\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Long poem authors sometimes find great difficulty in making the entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. <a href=\"/wiki/Ezra_Pound\" title=\"Ezra Pound\">Ezra Pound</a> is an example of this dilemma, with his poem <i>The Cantos</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Keller_1993_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Keller_1993-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. <a href=\"/wiki/Walt_Whitman\" title=\"Walt Whitman\">Walt Whitman</a> tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Song_of_Myself\" title=\"Song of Myself\">Song of Myself</a></i>. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.\n</p><p>Poets attempting to write a long poem often struggle to find the right form or combination of forms to use. Since the long poem itself cannot be strictly defined by one certain form, a challenge lies in choosing the most effective form.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Generic_conundrums\">Generic conundrums</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Generic conundrums\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Inclusivity</b>\n</p><p>The long poem has been considered a problematic genre for women writers. Its roots in epic make the genre appear to be non-inclusive of female writers. This is due to the epic's long history of being primarily a realm of writing for men.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Friedman_1990_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Friedman_1990-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>Lyric intensity</b>\n</p><p>Some critics, most emphatically <a href=\"/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" title=\"Edgar Allan Poe\">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, consider poetry as a whole to be more closely tied to the lyric.

L. Rozenthal and Sally M. Gall's \"The Modern Poetic Sequence\" inspired by Poe's sentiments, \"What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones.... It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal-necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose\u2014a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably,with corresponding depressions\u2014the whole being deprived, through the extremities of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of effect.

Therefore, this causes the other equally important subgenres to be subject to criticism for not adhering to the more \"authentic\" form of long poem.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Keller_1997_p_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Keller_1997_p-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Other critics of the long poem sometimes hold the belief that with long poems, there is no \"middle ground.\"  They view long poems as ultimately being either epics or lyrics.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The most obvious difference between the long poem and other literary genres is the sheer difficulty of composing a long work entirely in verse.  Poets who undertake the long poem face the serious problem of creating a work that is consistently poetic, sometimes taking strict forms and carrying them through the whole poem.  However, the poets who do choose the long poem turn this liability into an advantage\u2014if a poet can write a long poem, they prove themselves to be worthy.  The very difficulty gives the genre an implicit prestige.  Long poems have been among the most influential texts in the world since Homer.  By writing a long poem, a poet participates in this tradition and must prove their virtuosity by living up to the tradition. As discussed below, the traditionally difficult long poem's prestige can be revised to serve radical purposes.\n</p><p>Additional benefits of the long poem:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The long poem provides the artist with a greater space to create great meaning.</li>\n<li>A long poem allows the author to be encyclopedic in their treatment of the world, as opposed to the potentially narrow focus of the lyric.</li>\n<li>A long poem poet can work on a long poem their entire life, weaving in their impressions gleaned from the span of several generations (and historical events); it can be an ongoing work.</li>\n<li>A long poem can encapsulate not just traditional poetry, but incorporate dialogue, prose passages, and even scripting.</li>\n<li>A reader can absorb an entire world view from a long poem.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Female_authors_in_the_genre\">Female authors in the genre</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Female authors in the genre\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Critic Lynn Keller voices the concerns of female poets writing within the genre of the long poem.  In her essay \"Pushing the Limits\", she discusses the long poem in regards to its female contributors, a group often forgotten or marginalized in favor of the more privileged white male author. Not only does Keller discuss women and their place in the authorship of the long poem, but she also talks about the tendency of the genre to forget authors who are not white and male, therefore leaving out minority writers, foreign writers, and writers of different sexual orientation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Keller_1997_p_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Keller_1997_p-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Keller explains the long poem as being a \"generic hybrid\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> By this, Keller means that the form, in large part because of its indefinable nature, gives authors creative leeway to mold and form the genre of long poem to fit their creative needs. The long poem's flexibility should not only be open to include women and minority writers, but should be a haven in which these writers can use their writing to voice their identity, a primary topic for the long poem genre.\n</p><p>As stated above in \"Concerns and Controversies\", many female writers have felt that they have no place within the long poem genre because of its epic roots. The epic is a historically masculine genre and has not welcomed female writers or other authors who are not male and white. The long poem is often understood as the epic reborn, making it seem like a genre inaccessible to women. Women who did participate within the long poem and epic forms were often highly criticized or overlooked until recently, as there has been increasing interest in such authors as H.D.\n</p><p>Keller also discusses a primary critic of the long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally important to say that one type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual \"betweeness\", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms.  This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all.  Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced by the presence of women and other writers.\n</p><p>Keller states that this new perspective on long poem and reexamination of forgotten long poems has revived the form as a realm of possibilities for upcoming female writers. Female writers are seeing the long poem as a genre that should not only be open and inclusive to them, but also as a genre that theoretically could benefit the female writer as much if not more than the male writers the form previously favored. Women writers are now able to combat the \"dominant traditions\" at play within the long poem genre to mold the genre into their own, creating what critic Susan Friedman terms a \"re-vision\" of the form.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning\" title=\"Elizabeth Barrett Browning\">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> was one of the first female authors to attempt an epic poem.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Taylor posits that Browning began this process with the structure of her poem, \"While earlier epics like the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Aeneid\" title=\"Aeneid\">Aeneid</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Paradise_Lost\" title=\"Paradise Lost\">Paradise Lost</a></i> have twelve books, <a href=\"/wiki/Aurora_Leigh\" title=\"Aurora Leigh\">Aurora Leigh</a> was conceived as a nine-book epic; thus, the very structure of the work reveals its gestational nature. According to Sandra Donaldson, Barrett Browning's own experience at age forty-three of \"giving birth and nurturing a child\" greatly influenced her poetry \"for the better\", deepening her \"sensitivity\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Genealogy\">Genealogy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Genealogy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The most important \"parent genre\" to the long poem is the <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_poetry#cite_note-0\" title=\"Epic poetry\">epic</a>.  As stated on the page of the main article on the epic, \"An epic is a lengthy, revered narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation.\"  The term \"long poem\" includes all the generic expectations of epic and the reactions against those expectations.  Many long poem subgenres share characteristics with the epic, including: telling the tale of a tribe or a nation, quests, history (either recitation or re-telling in order to learn from the past), a hero figure, or prophecies.\n</p><p>Other subgenres of the long poem include lyric sequence, series, collage, and verse-novel.  What unites each of these subgenres under the heading of long poem is that their length has importance in their meaning. Each subgenre, however, is unique in its style, manner of composition, voice, narration, and proximity to outside genres.\n</p><p>Sequence poetry uses the chronological linking of poems to construct meaning, as each lyric builds on the poems previous to it.  Examples include <a href=\"/wiki/Louise_Gl%C3%BCck\" title=\"Louise Gl\u00fcck\">Louise Gl\u00fcck</a>'s <i>The Wild Iris</i>, and older sonnet cycles, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Philip_Sidney\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Philip Sidney\">Sir Philip Sidney</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Astrophel_and_Stella\" title=\"Astrophel and Stella\">Astrophel and Stella</a></i> or <a href=\"/wiki/Dante\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dante\">Dante</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Vita_Nuova\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vita Nuova\">Vita Nuova</a></i>.  Serial lyrics similarly depend on the juxtaposition and dialogue between individual lyrics to build a greater depth of meaning. Narrative poems rely heavily on\n</p><p>Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or overlapped to create second-generation subgenres. The blurring between the lines of the subgenres is what makes the long poem so hard to define, but it also marks the growing creativity in the use of the form.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subgenres\">Subgenres</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Subgenres\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Epic\">Epic</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Epic\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg/220px-Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg\" width=\"220\" height=\"349\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg/330px-Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"363\" data-file-height=\"576\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The first page of the Beowulf manuscript.

Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a \"specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed,\" unlike a more traditional long poem.  Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic.  A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in <i>Helen In Egypt</i> by H.D.  Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, <i>Helen In Egypt</i> is about the psychological journey of Helen.\n</p><p>Other characteristics of the epic include a hero figure, myths, and quests for the characters. Many such characteristics are seen in various long poems, but with some changes.  For example, <i>Helen In Egypt</i> brings mythic revision, or revisionary mythopoesis, into play. Even though it includes the myth from the epic, the revised telling of the myth makes the long poem stand out as its own form.  Additionally, one cannot look at the epic as a single, unified form of inspiration for long poems.  As Keller points out, certain long poems can have roots in very specific epics instead of the overall epic category.\n</p><p>The long poem <i>Omeros</i> by Derek Walcott has drawn mixed criticism on whether it should or should not be tied to the traditional epic form.  Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics.  <i>Omeros</i> tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests.  On the other side of the argument lies the point that it is important to keep in mind that <i>Omeros</i> has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast.  By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off <i>Omeros</i> from any ties to the epic whatsoever.  Furthermore, these critics say that one cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer.  In <i>Omeros</i> there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc.\n</p><p>In interviews, Walcott has both affirmed and denied that <i>Omeros</i> is tied to the epic form.  In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem.  In <i>Omeros</i> Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that people might only think of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre.\n</p><p>Based on this criticism of <i>Omeros</i> it is clear that the generic identity of a long poem greatly contributes to its meaning.  Because long poems are influenced by many more strictly defined genres, a long poem revising strict generic rules creates striking contrast with epic-genre expectations.\n</p><p>Keller also notes that she agrees with critic Susan Friedman when Friedman expresses her concern that the long poem associated with the epic has been \"the quintessential male territory whose boundaries enforce women's status as outsiders on the landscape of poetry.\"  Considering that there are many long poem authors that are women, one cannot fully associate the long poem with the epic genre.\n</p><p>However, the typical exclusion of women in the epic tradition is for many female authors what makes the long poem an appealing form for laying cultural claim to the epic.\n</p><p>Control of or at least inclusion in the creation of a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like <i>The Odyssey</i> or Virgil\u2019s <i>Aeneid</i> is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines the good and the bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.\n</p><p>If the long poem is considered an epic or invokes an epic in its length as many critics and readers aver then breaching its traditional exclusivity by using the epic to tell the story of marginalized peoples such as women rather than the victors is essentially an opportunity for the poet to rewrite history. Walcott\u2019s <i>Omeros</i> is an excellent example of a long poem recording the untold history of a marginalized people.\n</p><p>Likewise H.D.\u2019s revision of the story of Helen of Troy in <i>Helen</i> is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lyric_sequence\">Lyric sequence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Lyric sequence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A lyric sequence is a collection of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre is that each lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics.\n</p><p>Critic Lynn Keller lends some insight to the lyric sequence by placing it in opposition to the epic: \u201cAt the opposite end of the critical spectrum are the treatments of the long poem that do not consider issues of quest, hero, community, nation, history and the like, and instead regard the form as essentially lyric.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lyric_series\">Lyric series</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Lyric series\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The lyric series is a genre of poetry in which the seriality of short (but connective) lyric poems enhances the long poem's meaning. Seriality may contribute narrative coherence or thematic development, and it is often read in terms of the poem's productive process, i.e. how the poem \"produces its own experience\"(Shoptaw). Each lyric poem is distinct and has meaning in itself, yet it functions as an integral part of the series, giving it a greater meaning as within the long poem as well.\n</p><p>Deborah Sinnreich-Levi and Ian Laurie examine the work of Oton de Grandson in the lyric series, or \"ballad series\" form.  Grandson wrote several sets of short love lyrics, using the series form for narrative coherence and thematic construction, as well as to examine different aspects of a single narrative.  George Oppen's <i>Discrete Series</i> relates its poetic seriality to the mathematic concept of a discrete series.  Langston Hughes' <i>Montage of a Dream Deferred</i> qualifies as a serial lyric as well as a montage.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Collage.2FMontage\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Collage/Montage\">Collage/Montage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Collage/Montage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The best-known and most highly regarded example of a collage long poem is <a href=\"/wiki/T._S._Eliot\" title=\"T.

What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to its place in the flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to <i>Gilgamesh</i>, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.\n</p><p>As one of the main subgenres, Verse-Narrative gets the least attention because it so effortlessly overlaps the other subgenres. It does not necessarily have the components of an Epic, nor the lyricism and shifting scope of a Lyric Sequence or a Lyric Series, nor the close relation to narrative of Verse Novel. It exists for critics generally as an accepted part of the long poem Tradition.\n</p><p>The Greek poet Vasileios Vasileiadis(1958-) with his two long poems &lt;Blind to see the Darkness&gt; and &lt;Point Zero&gt; is an example for the Verse-Narrative long poetry.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Romantic_long_poem\">Romantic long poem</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Long_poem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Romantic long poem\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The critic Lilach Lachman describes the Romantic long poem as one that, \"questioned the coherence of the conventional epic's plot, its logic of time and space, and its laws of interconnecting the narrative through action.\"  Examples of the Romantic long poem is Keats' long poem <a href=\"/wiki/Hyperion_(poem)\" title=\"Hyperion (poem)\">Hyperion: A Fragment</a> (1820), William Wordsworth's <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Recluse_(Wordsworth)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Recluse (Wordsworth) (page does not exist)\">Recluse</a> (Including the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Prelude\" title=\"The Prelude\">Prelude</a> (1850), and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Excursion_(poem)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Excursion (poem) (page does not exist)\">The Excursion</a>), and Percy Bysshe Shelley's <a href=\"/wiki/Prometheus_Unbound_(Shelley)\" title=\"Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)\">Prometheus Unbound</a>.\n</p><p>The Romance long poem contains many of the same components of the Romance Lyric.
