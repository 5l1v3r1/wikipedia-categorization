Zaratosht-nama  (Persian: زراتشت‌نامه‎) is a religious epic poem in Persian language composed in 7th century AH. The poem is about the life of Zoroaster, the prophet of Zoroastianism. The author of the poem is Kay Kavus pur-i Khosrow. The poem is erroneously attributed to Zartosht Bahram-e Pazhdo who is actually the copier of the first surviving manuscript of the work. The poem contains nearly 1,533 couplets and is composed in the same meter as Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. The work is based on the oral narratives of Zoroastrians and has a lot of similarities with Middle Persian religious books such as Denkard. Arabic loanwords are not common in the work. It also contains some rare Pahlavi words.
