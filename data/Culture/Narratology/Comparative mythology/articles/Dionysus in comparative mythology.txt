Dionysus, the god of wine, theatre, and ecstasy in ancient Greek religion, has been compared to many other deities, both by his classical worshippers and later scholars. These deities include figures outside of ancient Greek religion, such as Jesus,  Osiris,  Shiva,  and Tammuz,  as well as figures inside of ancient Greek religion, such as Hades.  In Plutarch's symposiacs, it is stated that there are those who believe Adonis to be the same as Dionysus, however, Plutarch acknowledges that there are others who hold them to be lovers.  Comparisons have been made between Jesus Christ and Dionysus since ancient times. Justin the Martyr, in his First Apology, states that the cult of Dionysus was mimicking the cult of Christ, through its use of wine, donkeys, death and resurrection  In his Histories, Herodotus says that many believe that Osiris is the Egyptian form of Dionysus.
