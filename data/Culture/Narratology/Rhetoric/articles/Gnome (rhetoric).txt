A gnome (Greek: γνώμη gnome, from γιγνώσκειν gignoskein "to know") is a type of saying, especially an aphorism or a maxim designed to provide instruction in a compact form (usually in the form of hexameter). The term gnome was introduced by Klaus Berger in the Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments. He used this traditional term from the antique rhetoric and attempted to identify this rhetorical method in the New Testament.
