Epanalepsis (from the Greek ἐπανάληψις, epanálēpsis "repetition, resumption, taking up again" ) is the repetition of the initial part of a clause or sentence at the end of that same clause or sentence.  The beginning and the end of a sentence are two positions of emphasis, so special attention is placed on the phrase by repeating it in both places. Nested double-epanalepses are antimetaboles.
