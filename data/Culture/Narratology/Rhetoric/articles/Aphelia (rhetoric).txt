Aphelia (Greek, "plainness") is a rhetorical term that refers to the plainness of writing or speech.  It is used to explain or teach rather than to entertain or elicit an emotional response.  The sentence structure is typically both short in length and lacks "poetic and rhetorical adornment."   Parataxis and asyndeton are also expected within the plain style. Writing or speech using aphelia may display a "right-branching" sentence structure for the most part; that is, the sentence will begin with an independent clause that will be followed by at least one dependent clause.
