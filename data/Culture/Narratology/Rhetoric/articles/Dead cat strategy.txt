Dead cat strategy, or Deadcatting, refers to the introduction of a dramatic, shocking, or sensationalist topic in order to divert discourse away from a more damaging topic.   Identification of examples may be considered subjective; some articles citing the technique are listed for illustration: There is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table – and I don’t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant. The key point is that everyone will shout, ‘Jeez, mate, there’s a dead cat on the table!’ In other words, they will be talking about the dead cat – the thing you want them to talk about – and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.
