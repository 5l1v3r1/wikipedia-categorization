 Politicards are a deck of playing cards produced each election year in the United States featuring 54 caricatures depicting political candidates and prominent political figures. The first Politicards deck was produced in 1971 for the 1972 election by artist Peter Green, writer Lee Livingston, businessman Mike Killeen and designer Norman Friant.  By 2016 about 200,000 packs of cards were being sold during each election cycle.  Decks were said to have been used at the time by then New York Senator James Buckley and by the ladies of Mamie Eisenhowerâ€™s bridge club.  Decks of "Politicards" have been produced for election years 1971, 1980, 1984    and 1996 onwards.   The 1980 and 1984 edition decks were produced by Washington, D.C. lobbyist Victor Kamber, who purchased the Politicards name in 1979.  In 1996 the name expired and was reclaimed by the original artist Peter Green,  who has since produced decks for every election through to 2016.  Green's 2016 edition was titled "Politikids" and depicted political figures as children.
