An evil corporation is a trope in popular culture that portrays a corporation as ignoring social responsibility in order to make money for its shareholders.  According to Angela Allan writing in The Atlantic, the notion is "deeply embedded in the landscape of contemporary cultureâ€”populating films, novels, videogames, and more." The science fiction genre served as the initial background to portray corporations in this dystopian light.  Evil corporations can be seen to represent the danger of combining capitalism with larger hubris.  In real life, too, corporations have been accused of being evil. To guard against such accusations, Google adopted the official motto "Don't be evil",  which it later silently abandoned following an employee exodus in protest of a military drone AI program.   The New Yorker wrote that "many food activists consider Monsanto to be the definitively evil corporation".  The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility wrote, "For many consumers, Wal-Mart serves as the evil corporation prototype, but record numbers shop at the stores for low prices."  In Japan, a committee of journalists and rights activists issues an annual "corporate raspberry award" known as Most Evil Corporation of the Year Award (also called the Black Company Award) to a company "with a culture of overwork, discrimination and harassment".
