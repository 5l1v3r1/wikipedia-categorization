Most clip shows feature the format of a <a href=\"/wiki/Frame_story\" title=\"Frame story\">frame story</a> in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a <a href=\"/wiki/Flashback_(literary_technique)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flashback (literary technique)\">flashback</a>.  Clip shows are also known as <b>cheaters</b>, particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before <a href=\"/wiki/Series_finale\" title=\"Series finale\">series finales</a>, or once <a href=\"/wiki/100_episodes\" title=\"100 episodes\">syndication becomes highly likely</a>. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Origin\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Origin</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Variations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Variations</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Rationale\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rationale</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin\">Origin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clip_show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Origin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Clip shows have their origin in theatrical <a href=\"/wiki/Short_film\" title=\"Short film\">short films</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Serial_(film)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serial (film)\">serials</a>. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these <b>recap chapters</b> (also called \"economy chapters\"),\nprevious chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_Pictures\" title=\"Republic Pictures\">Republic Pictures</a> serial <i><a href=\"/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe_of_Clipper_Island\" title=\"Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island\">Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island</a></i>. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and <a href=\"/wiki/Stock_footage\" title=\"Stock footage\">stock footage</a> from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.\n</p><p>Movie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Three_Stooges\" title=\"The Three Stooges\">The Three Stooges</a> which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was  adopted because the studios could charge more money for \"new\" films than for old ones.\n</p><p>Animation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as \"cheaters\" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include <i><a href=\"/wiki/Betty_Boop%27s_Rise_to_Fame\" title=\"Betty Boop&#39;s Rise to Fame\">Betty Boop's Rise to Fame</a></i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Fleischer_Studios\" title=\"Fleischer Studios\">Fleischer</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Paramount_Pictures\" title=\"Paramount Pictures\">Paramount</a>, 1934), <i><a href=\"/wiki/What%27s_Cookin%27_Doc%3F\" title=\"What&#39;s Cookin&#39; Doc?\">What's Cookin' Doc?</a></i> (1944, <a href=\"/wiki/Warner_Bros._Cartoons\" title=\"Warner Bros. Cartoons\">Schlesinger</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Warner_Bros.\" title=\"Warner Bros.\">Warner Bros.</a>) and a regular yearly series of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tom &amp; Jerry\">Tom &amp; Jerry</a></i> \"cheaters\" such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Smitten_Kitten\" title=\"Smitten Kitten\">Smitten Kitten</a></i> (1952, <a href=\"/wiki/MGM_cartoon_studio\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MGM cartoon studio\">MGM</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variations\">Variations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clip_show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Variations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>One variant of the modern clip show is the <b>compilation episode</b>, using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.\n</p><p>Another format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/All_in_the_Family\" title=\"All in the Family\">All in the Family</a></i> featured actor <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Fonda\" title=\"Henry Fonda\">Henry Fonda</a> discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Three%27s_Company\" title=\"Three&#39;s Company\">Three's Company</a></i>, hosted by <a href=\"/wiki/Lucille_Ball\" title=\"Lucille Ball\">Lucille Ball</a>. This format was parodied in a clip show for <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Simpsons\" title=\"The Simpsons\">The Simpsons</a></i> (\"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Simpsons_138th_Episode_Spectacular\" title=\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\">The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular</a>\"), in which fictional actor <a href=\"/wiki/Troy_McClure\" title=\"Troy McClure\">Troy McClure</a>&#8212;a recurring <i>Simpsons</i> character&#8212;introduced the clips.\n</p><p>A third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Cheers\" title=\"Cheers\">Cheers</a></i> featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host <a href=\"/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(host)\" title=\"John McLaughlin (host)\">John McLaughlin</a> about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Barney_Miller\" title=\"Barney Miller\">Barney Miller</a></i> aired after the death of cast member <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Soo\" title=\"Jack Soo\">Jack Soo</a>, with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character <a href=\"/wiki/Detective_Sergeant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Detective Sergeant\">Detective Sergeant</a> Nick Yamana.\n</p><p><i><a href=\"/wiki/Clerks:_The_Animated_Series\" title=\"Clerks: The Animated Series\">Clerks: The Animated Series</a></i> had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender\" title=\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></i> episode \"The Ember Island Players\", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. \"The Ember Island Players\" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/NBC\" title=\"NBC\">NBC</a> sitcom <a href=\"/wiki/Community_(TV_series)\" title=\"Community (TV series)\"><i>Community</i></a> used the clip show format with the episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/Paradigms_of_Human_Memory\" title=\"Paradigms of Human Memory\">Paradigms of Human Memory</a>\", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of <i>Community</i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dan_Harmon\" title=\"Dan Harmon\">Dan Harmon</a>, used the same format in another one of his shows, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rick_and_Morty\" title=\"Rick and Morty\">Rick and Morty</a></i>, where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a>, a common type of episode is the <b>Recap episode</b>, which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rationale\">Rationale</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clip_show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Rationale\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong <a href=\"/wiki/Nielsen_ratings\" title=\"Nielsen ratings\">ratings</a>, and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or \"corny\" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent \"remembering\").<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2009)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>\n</p><p>Daytime <a href=\"/wiki/Soap_operas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soap operas\">soap operas</a> frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/As_the_World_Turns\" title=\"As the World Turns\">As the World Turns</a></i> in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of <i>AtWT</i>'s 50th anniversary.\n</p><p>Another common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Roughnecks:_Starship_Troopers_Chronicles\" title=\"Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles\">Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles</a></i> used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)\" title=\"Moonlighting (TV series)\">Moonlighting</a></i> season 3 episode \"The Straight Poop\" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the \"weekly\" series had been broadcast. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chappelle%27s_Show\" title=\"Chappelle&#39;s Show\">Chappelle's Show</a></i> resorted to producing <i>five</i> clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.\n</p><p>Other times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\" title=\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> had one more episode to shoot. However, <a href=\"/wiki/Paramount_Television\" title=\"Paramount Television\">Paramount</a> cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget\u2014and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for <a href=\"/wiki/Principal_photography\" title=\"Principal photography\">principal photography</a>. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a <a href=\"/wiki/1988_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike\" title=\"1988 Writers Guild of America strike\">writers' strike</a>, the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ST:TNG_365_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ST:TNG_365-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The result was \"<a href=\"/wiki/Shades_of_Gray_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)\" title=\"Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\">Shades of Gray</a>\", in which the \"clips\" were the induced dreams of a comatose <a href=\"/wiki/William_T._Riker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"William T. Riker\">William T. Riker</a>. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any <i>Star Trek</i> series.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ST:TNG_companion_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ST:TNG_companion-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Clip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in <a href=\"/wiki/Self-parody\" title=\"Self-parody\">self-parody</a>, explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using \"clips\" from episodes which never happened.  The <i><a href=\"/wiki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">South Park</a></i> episode \"<a href=\"/wiki/City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever_(South_Park)\" title=\"City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)\">City on the Edge of Forever</a>\" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream.  As another example, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Clerks:_The_Animated_Series\" title=\"Clerks: The Animated Series\">Clerks: The Animated Series</a></i> ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material.  The aforementioned <i>Moonlighting</i> clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourth_wall\" title=\"Fourth wall\">fourth wall</a> to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a \"new episode next week!\".\n</p><p>The clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)\" title=\"Lost (TV series)\">Lost</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_(TV_series)\" title=\"Once Upon a Time (TV series)\">Once Upon a Time</a></i> and <a href=\"/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)\" title=\"Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)\">the reimagined <i>Battlestar Galactica</i></a>. Many <a href=\"/wiki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing\" title=\"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></i> running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).\n</p><p>Sometimes clip shows air before or during a <a href=\"/wiki/Series_finale\" title=\"Series finale\">series finale</a> as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: <i><a href=\"/wiki/Animaniacs\" title=\"Animaniacs\">Animaniacs</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Frasier\" title=\"Frasier\">Frasier</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Golden_Girls\" title=\"The Golden Girls\">The Golden Girls</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Seinfeld\" title=\"Seinfeld\">Seinfeld</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Friends\" title=\"Friends\">Friends</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Thunderbirds_(TV_series)\" title=\"Thunderbirds (TV series)\">Thunderbirds</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Everybody_Loves_Raymond\" title=\"Everybody Loves Raymond\">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Outer_Limits_(1995_TV_series)\" title=\"The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)\">The Outer Limits</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\" title=\"Stargate SG-1\">Stargate SG-1</a></i>/<i><a href=\"/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis\" title=\"Stargate Atlantis\">Atlantis</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Cheers\" title=\"Cheers\">Cheers</a></i>.\n</p><p>Clip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special <i><a href=\"/wiki/Scotch_and_Wry\" title=\"Scotch and Wry\">Scotch and Wry</a></i> was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Carson%27s_Comedy_Classics\" title=\"Carson&#39;s Comedy Classics\">Carson's Comedy Classics</a></i> compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson\" title=\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a></i> for airing in syndication. Surviving content from <a href=\"/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown\" title=\"Bozo the Clown\">Bozo the Clown</a> and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bozo,_Gar_and_Ray:_WGN_TV_Classics\" title=\"Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics\">Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics</a></i>, an annual holiday special.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clip_show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Compilation_movie\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Compilation movie\">Compilation movie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Fix-up\" title=\"Fix-up\">Fix-up</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Bottle_episode\" title=\"Bottle episode\">Bottle episode</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clip_show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005244/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html\">\"98, Clerks: The Animated Series\"</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/IGN\" title=\"IGN\">IGN</a>. 2009-01-23.
