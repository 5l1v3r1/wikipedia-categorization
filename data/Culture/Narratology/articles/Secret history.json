In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando <i>nearly</i> carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not <a href=\"/wiki/Alternate_history\" title=\"Alternate history\">alternate history</a> but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.\n</p><p>Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Eye_of_the_Needle_(novel)\" title=\"Eye of the Needle (novel)\">Eye of the Needle</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Ken_Follett\" title=\"Ken Follett\">Ken Follett</a>: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling <a href=\"/wiki/D-Day\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"D-Day\">D-Day</a>;</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Jackal\" title=\"The Day of the Jackal\">The Day of the Jackal</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_Forsyth\" title=\"Frederick Forsyth\">Frederick Forsyth</a>: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_De_Gaulle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charles De Gaulle\">Charles De Gaulle</a>, president of France, in 1963.</li></ul>\n<p>These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures \u2013 including very famous ones \u2013 appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.\n</p><p>Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> backgrounds.

Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Who%27s_on_First_(novel)\" title=\"Who&#39;s on First (novel)\">Who's on First</a></i>, Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching <a href=\"/wiki/Sputnik\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sputnik\">Sputnik</a> ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Marco_Polo,_if_You_Can\" title=\"Marco Polo, if You Can\">Marco Polo, if You Can</a></i>, Oakes is the real-life <a href=\"/wiki/U2\" title=\"U2\">U2</a> pilot <a href=\"/wiki/Gary_Powers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gary Powers\">Gary Powers</a>, and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the <a href=\"/wiki/U2_incident\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U2 incident\">U2 incident</a> was actually planned from the start, <a href=\"/wiki/Gary_Powers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gary Powers\">Gary Powers</a> was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President <a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" title=\"Dwight D.

On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping.</li>\n<li>Another example of a science-fiction secret history is <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Proteus_Operation\" title=\"The Proteus Operation\">The Proteus Operation</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/James_P._Hogan_(writer)\" title=\"James P.

Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard.</li>\n<li>The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed\" title=\"Assassin&#39;s Creed\">Assassin's Creed</a></i> video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a \"<a href=\"/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)\" title=\"New World Order (conspiracy theory)\">New World Order</a>\" organization that originated with the <a href=\"/wiki/Knights_Templar\" title=\"Knights Templar\">Knights Templar</a>. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_II\" title=\"Assassin&#39;s Creed II\">Assassin's Creed II</a></i>, that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret \"First Civilization\", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars.</li>\n<li>The background of <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Aaronovitch\" title=\"Ben Aaronovitch\">Ben Aaronovitch</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rivers_of_London_(novel)\" title=\"Rivers of London (novel)\">Rivers of London</a></i> series of <a href=\"/wiki/Contemporary_fantasy\" title=\"Contemporary fantasy\">contemporary fantasy</a> detective thrillers includes the assertion that <a href=\"/wiki/Isaac_Newton\" title=\"Isaac Newton\">Isaac Newton</a>, in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)\" title=\"Magician (fantasy)\">wizard</a> who codified the basic principles of <a href=\"/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Magic (paranormal)\">magic</a>. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis</i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a> for \"Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts\") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the <a href=\"/wiki/Bodleian_Library\" title=\"Bodleian Library\">Bodleian Library</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Oxford\" title=\"University of Oxford\">University of Oxford</a>, and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> had also been fought by magical means, with <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi_Germany\" title=\"Nazi Germany\">Nazi Germany</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_World_War_II\" title=\"Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II\">Britain</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a> each raising its own secret corps of warrior-wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany \u2013 where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash <a href=\"/wiki/Vampire\" title=\"Vampire\">vampires</a> and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of <a href=\"/wiki/Caroline_of_Ansbach\" title=\"Caroline of Ansbach\">Caroline of Ansbach</a>; during the <a href=\"/wiki/War_of_1812\" title=\"War of 1812\">War of 1812</a> British wizards trained <a href=\"/wiki/Tecumseh\" title=\"Tecumseh\">Tecumseh</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Medicine_men\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medicine men\">medicine men</a> in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; <a href=\"/wiki/Maynard_Keynes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Maynard Keynes\">Maynard Keynes</a>, though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq_War\" title=\"Iraq War\">Iraq War</a> suffered a major fiasco at <a href=\"/wiki/Falluja\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Falluja\">Falluja</a> which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Umberto_Eco\" title=\"Umberto Eco\">Umberto Eco</a>'s novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baudolino\" title=\"Baudolino\">Baudolino</a></i> suggests that Emperor <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\" title=\"Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor\">Frederick I</a>, who died while on the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Crusade\" title=\"Second Crusade\">Second Crusade</a>, had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task.</li>\n<li>The books of <a href=\"/wiki/Steve_Berry_(novelist)\" title=\"Steve Berry (novelist)\">Steve Berry</a> often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, <i>The Jefferson Key</i>, part of Berry's <a href=\"/wiki/Cotton_Malone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cotton Malone\">Cotton Malone</a> series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President (<a href=\"/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\" title=\"Abraham Lincoln\">Abraham Lincoln</a> in 1865, <a href=\"/wiki/James_A._Garfield\" title=\"James A. Garfield\">James A. Garfield</a> in 1881,<a href=\"/wiki/William_McKinley\" title=\"William McKinley\">William McKinley</a> in 1901 and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Kennedy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John Kennedy\">John Kennedy</a> in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret \"Commonwealth\" of pirates (or \"privateers\"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like <a href=\"/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson\" title=\"Woodrow Wilson\">Woodrow Wilson</a> during WWI and <a href=\"/wiki/Franklin_Roosevelt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Franklin Roosevelt\">Franklin Roosevelt</a> in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give  this Commonwealth \"a perpetual authorization\" to act as <a href=\"/wiki/Privateer\" title=\"Privateer\">privateers</a>. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as Treasure hidden by <a href=\"/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Napoleon Bonaparte\">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, secret survivals of the <a href=\"/wiki/Knights_Templar\" title=\"Knights Templar\">Knights Templar</a> and the fate of the books of the <a href=\"/wiki/Alexandrine_Library\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alexandrine Library\">Alexandrine Library</a>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Secret_histories_of_fictional_worlds\">Secret histories of fictional worlds</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Secret_history&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Secret histories of fictional worlds\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/wiki/Retcon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Retcon\">Retcon</a>\", alteration of the <a href=\"/wiki/Canon_(fiction)\" title=\"Canon (fiction)\">canonical</a> account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history.

What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any ways, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place&#160;: the \"death\" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death.</li>\n<li>The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Doctor_Who\" title=\"Doctor Who\">Doctor Who</a></i> serial <i><a href=\"/wiki/Remembrance_of_the_Daleks\" title=\"Remembrance of the Daleks\">Remembrance of the Daleks</a></i> also alludes to hidden <i>fictional</i> history, establishing that during the events of the serial <i><a href=\"/wiki/An_Unearthly_Child\" title=\"An Unearthly Child\">An Unearthly Child</a></i>, the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Doctor\" title=\"First Doctor\">First Doctor</a> had in his possession a super-weapon, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hand_of_Omega\" title=\"Hand of Omega\">Hand of Omega</a> stolen from his own people, the <a href=\"/wiki/Time_Lord\" title=\"Time Lord\">Time Lords</a>.

(However, this is \"cancelled out\" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, \"The Sorrow of Odin the Goth\", asserts that also the Nordic god <a href=\"/wiki/Odin\" title=\"Odin\">Odin</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Wodan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wodan\">Wodan</a> was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient <a href=\"/wiki/Goths\" title=\"Goths\">Goths</a> and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Levinson\" title=\"Paul Levinson\">Paul Levinson</a>'s \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Plot_to_Save_Socrates\" title=\"The Plot to Save Socrates\">The Plot to Save Socrates</a>\" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/Socrates\" title=\"Socrates\">Socrates</a> did not drink hemlock, as history tells.

Also according to the same book, the politician and general <a href=\"/wiki/Alcibiades\" title=\"Alcibiades\">Alcibiades</a> had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous  fourth-century  mathematician <a href=\"/wiki/Hypatia\" title=\"Hypatia\">Hypatia</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_Alexandria#Late_Roman_and_Byzantine_period\" title=\"History of Alexandria\">Alexandria</a> were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor <a href=\"/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria\" title=\"Hero of Alexandria\">Hero of Alexandria</a> was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the  nineteenth-century publisher <a href=\"/wiki/William_Henry_Appleton\" title=\"William Henry Appleton\">William Henry Appleton</a> had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_Greece\" title=\"Classical Greece\">Classical Greece</a> and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century \u2013 but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.\n</p><p>According to <a href=\"/wiki/David_Drake\" title=\"David Drake\">David Drake</a>'s novel \"<a href=\"/wiki/Birds_of_Prey_(Drake_novel)\" title=\"Birds of Prey (Drake novel)\">Birds of Prey</a>\", the <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Empire\" title=\"Roman Empire\">Roman Empire</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Third_Century_Crisis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Third Century Crisis\">Third Century Crisis</a> was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then.
