A tetralogy (from Greek τετρα- tetra-, "four" and -λογία -logia, "discourse") is a compound work that is made up of four distinct works. The name comes from the Attic theater, in which a tetralogy was a group of three tragedies followed by a satyr play, all by one author, to be played in one sitting at the Dionysia as part of a competition.  In the early modern period of literature, Shakespeare drafted a pair of tetralogies, the first consisting of the three Henry VI plays and Richard III, and the second, what we now call a prequel because it is set earlier, consisting of Richard II, the two Henry IV plays, and Henry V.  As an alternative to "tetralogy", "quartet" is sometimes used, particularly for series of four books.  The term "quadrilogy", using the Latin prefix quadri- instead of the Greek, and first recorded in 1865,  has also been used for marketing cinematic series, such as the Alien movies.
