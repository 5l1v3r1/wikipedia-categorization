A standalone film is a film that does not have any relation with other films.  In the late 1900s, it was typical to create standalone films with no plans for sequels. The term "standalone film" appeared when sequels, spin-offs, and franchises became normal.[when?]  In a canonical meaning, a standalone film is a film that is not part of any franchise. The Sixth Sense, The Shawshank Redemption, and Inception are examples of standalone films.   When a film is set in either the same universe or one very similar to that of its predecessors, yet has very little if any narrative connection to its predecessors and can be appreciated on its own without a thorough understanding of the backstory, then the work can be referred to as a standalone sequel.  The Mad Max sequels, The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, and Mad Max: Fury Road, are examples of standalone sequels. A standalone spin-off is a film that expands some fictional universe. The Star Wars Anthology series is an example of standalone spin-offs.   Standalone spin-offs may also be centered on a minor character from an existing fictional universe.
