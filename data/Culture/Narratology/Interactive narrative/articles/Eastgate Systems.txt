Eastgate Systems is a publisher and software company headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, which publishes hypertext.  Eastgate is a pioneer in hypertext publishing and electronic literature     and one of the best known publishers of hypertext fiction.  It publishes fiction, non-fiction, and poetry hypertexts by established authors with careers in print, as well as new authors. Its software tools include Storyspace, a hypertext system created by Jay David Bolter, Michael Joyce, and John B. Smith  in which much early hypertext fiction was written,  and Tinderbox,  a tool for managing notes and information. Storyspace was used in a project in Michigan to put judicial "bench books" into electronic form.  Eastgate's chief scientist, Mark Bernstein, is a well-known figure in hypertext research,  and has improved and extended Storyspace as well as developing new hypertext software.
