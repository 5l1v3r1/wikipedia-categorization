The Contortionist's Handbook is the debut novel by novelist Craig Clevenger. John Dolan Vincent is a talented young forger with a proclivity for mathematics and drug addiction. In the face of his impending institutionalization, he continually reinvents himself to escape the legal and mental health authorities and to save himself from a life of incarceration. But running turns out to be costly. Vincent's clients in the L.A. underworld lose patience, the hospital evaluator may not be fooled by his story, and the only person in as much danger as himself is the woman who knows his real name. The novel's film rights were optioned by Greenestreet Films in 2007. Currently British filmmaker Miguel Sapochnik has been hired to direct the film based on a screenplay by Robin Shushan.  Clevenger has expressed his disapproval for the screenplay and the changes made to the plot of this novel with a posting on his website in September 2010.
