 The Interview is a 1998 Australian thriller film from writer-director Craig Monahan, and is the first of two films directed by Monahan. Almost the entire film takes place in a police interrogation room, with some  short flashback sequences, and the cast consists primarily of three key actorsâ€”Hugo Weaving, Tony Martin, and Aaron Jeffery.  Eddie Rodney Fleming (Weaving) is a quiet, nervous man who recently lost his job and family. One morning, Eddie is seized from his apartment for unknown reasons by two cops. They take him to headquarters and question him about a stolen car. But as tempers rise and the truth is slowly unraveled, it is revealed there is more to this interview than meets the eye. An alternate ending of the film was featured on the DVD release. In this version, Eddie Rodney Fleming is seen hitchhiking along a desolate road. A car stops and Barry Walls (Caton) offers him a ride. Fleming accepts and they drive away, followed at a distance by Steele (Martin) on his motorcycle, no doubt intending to enforce some vigilante justice. The Interview grossed $556,263 at the box office in Australia.  The Interview was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in July 2011. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as audio commentary by Craig Monahan, deleted scenes, the alternate ending and cast and crew interviews.
