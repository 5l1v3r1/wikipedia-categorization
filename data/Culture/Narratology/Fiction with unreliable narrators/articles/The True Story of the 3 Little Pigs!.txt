The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs! is a children's book by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith. Released in a number of editions since its first release by Harper & Row Publishers in 1989, and re-published the name of Viking in 1993, it is a parody of The Three Little Pigs as told by the Big Bad Wolf, known in the book as "A. Wolf," short for "Alexander T. Wolf." The book was honored by the American Library Association as an ALA Notable Book.  This is the story of the 3 little pigs from the perspective of Alexander T. Wolf. The wolf is trying to set the story straight of how he came to be "big and bad". At the beginning of the book, he is cooking a cake for his grandmother's birthday, but he has run out of sugar. He goes to ask his neighbors, the pigs, for some sugar. They all say no to him, and as a result of a sneeze (due to a cold that he was suffering from), he 'accidentally' blows the first two pigs' houses down. Since they were already dead, he eats them, saying that it would be terrible to let a "perfectly good pork dinner go to waste". The third pig's house (made of bricks) does not suffer the same fate, but the third pig provokes Mr. Wolf into a fit of sneezing rage because of his insults to the wolf's grandmother. When the police arrive to see Mr. Wolf yelling, sneezing and huffing at the brick house,  and the third pig survives.   And his poor sweet granny gets no birthday cake. He then tells the reader, "But maybe you could loan me a cup of sugar". Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children."  It was one of the "Top 100 Picture Books" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal.  This was later adapted into a Weston Woods Studios animated short in 2008 with Paul Giamatti as the wolf.
