  Gypo /ˈdʒɪpoʊ/ is a 2005 independent film written and directed by Jan Dunn. Its story details the breakdown of a family in a small town in Britain, told in three narratives. Within a structured screenplay the dialogue throughout was improvised, and the film made in the Dogme style. It was the first British film to be registered as such (as Dogme #37).  The film is shown through the eyes of the three main characters; Paul and Helen, a married couple, and Tasha, a teenage refugee. It shows how the family falls apart under the strain of unexpected emotions.  The production filmed entirely in Thanet in Kent at a variety of locations including East Kent College, Kingsgate Bay, Margate, Pegwell Bay, Port of Ramsgate, Ramsgate, Royal Harbour Hotel and the Wig & Pen pub.
