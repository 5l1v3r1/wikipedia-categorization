The Earthquake Bird is the debut novel by British author Susanna Jones published in 2001. It won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize a Betty Trask Award and the Crime Writers' Association John Creasy Dagger.  The story opens in a Tokyo police station where 34-year-old Lucy Fly is being questioned over the murder of her friend Lily Bridges. Lucy has been in Tokyo for 10 years, is fluent in Japanese, and employed in translating manuals into English. She is evasive in her answers to the police but recounts to the readers what led to her current situation; her estrangement from her family in England, her relationship with Teiji an enigmatic photographer, and the recent arrival of Lily, who like Lucy comes from East Yorkshire. On a trip to Sado Island, jealousy appears, and relationships break down. Reviews were generally positiveÂ : Official website
