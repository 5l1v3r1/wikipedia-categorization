A liminal deity is a god or goddess in mythology who presides over thresholds, gates, or doorways; "a crosser of boundaries".  The word "liminal", first attested to in English in 1884, comes from the Latin word "limen", meaning "threshold".  "Liminality" is a term given currency in twentieth century anthropology by Victor Turner of the University of Chicago.
