Winter-Telling Stories is a collection of Kiowa tales written by Alice Marriott and illustrated by Roland Whitehorse. Marriott relates a number of stories told her by George Hunt. The stories all relate to Saynday, the main character in the book, and his involvement with natural events on the southern plains. The title comes from Hunt's admonition to "always tell my stories in the winter, when the outdoors work is finished."
