Words and Sins (Greek: Λόγοι και Αμαρτήματα)  is a 2004 Greek film by the Greek director writer and producer Vassilis Mazomenos.  The film was first presented in 2004 at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival. As Vrasidas Karalis wrote in the History of Greek cinema:  His later films Remembrance (2002) Words and Sins (2004)  and Guilt (2010) received many positive reviews and international recognition; especially the last in which Mazomenos explored narrative cinema through a nightmarish and confronting story.
