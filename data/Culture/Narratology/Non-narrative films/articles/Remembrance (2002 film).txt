Remembrance (Greek: Η μνήμη, 2002) is a feature Greek film, directed by the Greek director - writer and producer Vassilis Mazomenos.  It was awarded in 2002 with the Greek Ministry of Culture National Cinema Award. As Vrasidas Karalis wrote in the History of Greek cinema:  His later films Remembrance (2002), Words and Sins (2004) and Guilt (2010) received many positive reviews and international recognition; especially the last in which Mazomenos explored narrative cinema through a nightmarish and confronting story.
