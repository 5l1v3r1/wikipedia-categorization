Anima Mundi is a 1992 short documentary film directed by Godfrey Reggio. The film focuses on the world of nature and wildlife, particularly jungles, sealife, and insects. The movie was commissioned by Italian jewellers Bulgari for use by the World Wide Fund for Nature in their Biological Diversity Program. The film was scored by Philip Glass, who also worked with Reggio on Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, and Naqoyqatsi. Anima Mundi features many of the techniques from the Qatsi trilogy, and was produced in between the release of Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi, but is not considered to be directly related to the series.
