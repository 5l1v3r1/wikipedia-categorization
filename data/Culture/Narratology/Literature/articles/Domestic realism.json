{"parse":{"title":"Domestic realism","pageid":19284595,"revid":791618730,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Domestic realism</b> normally refers to the genre of 19th-century novels popular with women readers. This body of writing is also known as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Sentimental_novel\" title=\"Sentimental novel\">sentimental fiction</a>\" or \"woman's fiction\". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as <a href=\"/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe\" title=\"Harriet Beecher Stowe\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s \"Our Country Neighbors\" and <i>The New Housekeeper's Manual</i> written by Stowe and her sister-in-law <a href=\"/wiki/Catharine_Beecher\" title=\"Catharine Beecher\">Catharine Beecher</a> are works of domestic realism.  The style's particular characteristics are:\n</p><p>\"1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the \"belle,\" who is deprived of a proper education.\n</p><p>2. The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).\n</p><p>3. The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.\n</p><p>4. She suffers at the hands of <a href=\"/wiki/Abuse_of_power\" title=\"Abuse of power\">abusers of power</a> before establishing a network of surrogate kin.\n</p><p>5. The plots \"repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . \" (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).\n</p><p>6. The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:\n</p><p>A. Reforming the bad or \"wild\" male, as in <a href=\"/wiki/Augusta_Jane_Evans\" title=\"Augusta Jane Evans\">Augusta Evans</a>'s <i>St. Elmo</i> (1867)\n</p><p>B. Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications.\nExamples: <a href=\"/wiki/Maria_Susanna_Cummins\" title=\"Maria Susanna Cummins\">Maria Cummins</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Lamplighter\" title=\"The Lamplighter\">The Lamplighter</a></i> (1854) and <a href=\"/wiki/Susan_Warner\" title=\"Susan Warner\">Susan Warner</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Wide,_Wide_World\" title=\"The Wide, Wide World\">The Wide, Wide World</a></i> (1850) \n</p><p>7. The novels may use a \"language of tears\" that evokes sympathy from the readers.\n</p><p>8. <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_H._Brodhead\" title=\"Richard H. Brodhead\">Richard Brodhead</a> (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94).\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An example of this style of novel is <a href=\"/wiki/Jane_Smiley\" title=\"Jane Smiley\">Jane Smiley</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Thousand_Acres\" title=\"A Thousand Acres\">A Thousand Acres</a></i> in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.\n</p><p>Some early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were <a href=\"/wiki/Jane_Austen\" title=\"Jane Austen\">Jane Austen</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning\" title=\"Elizabeth Barrett Browning\">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Domestic_realism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Campbell, Donna M. <i>Domestic or Sentimental Fiction, 1820-1865</i> 21 May 2007. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/domestic.htm\">[1]</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2239\nCached time: 20180918170559\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.032 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.040 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 92/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 332/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 80/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 478/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.004/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   26.075      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   26.075      1 -total\n 12.17%    3.174      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:19284595-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918170559 and revision id 791618730\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Domestic Realism","*":"Genres"},{"sortkey":"Domestic Realism","*":"Literature"},{"sortkey":"Domestic Realism","*":"Sentimental_novels"},{"sortkey":"Domestic Realism","*":"Literary_realism"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"A Thousand Acres"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Abuse of power"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Augusta Jane Evans"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Catharine Beecher"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Elizabeth Barrett Browning"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Harriet Beecher Stowe"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jane Austen"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jane Smiley"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Maria Susanna Cummins"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Richard H.
