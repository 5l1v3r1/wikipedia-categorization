Multiperspectivity (sometimes polyperspectivity) is a characteristic of narration or representation, where more than one perspective is represented to the audience.   Most frequently the term is applied to fiction which employs multiple narrators, often in opposition to each-other or to illuminate different elements of a plot,  creating what is sometimes called a multiple narrative,   or multi-narrative.   However, a similar concept is applied to historical process, in which multiple different perspectives are used to evaluate events.  Educators have extended the concept and term to apply to techniques used to teach multiple disciplines, including social sciences, like economics and civics,  and physical education.
