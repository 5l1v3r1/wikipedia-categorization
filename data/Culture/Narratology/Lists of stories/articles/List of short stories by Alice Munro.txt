This is a list of short stories written by Alice Munro. It includes stories that were published in single-author collections (books), the first story ever published, "The Dimensions of a Shadow" (1950), and other stories having appeared elsewhere. Some of the data in the list below are still needed in this spreadsheet, e.g., which journal a story was published in. Compilations a = in an anthology at about this time  f = first published in a collection (most likely a journal publication came later)  s = selected again for the compilation of the year given This list contains some extra information compared with the table above. Works by Munro that appeared in anthologies may be more difficult to locate than those that were published in journals or in Munro's original collections but they are likely to be numerous.
