This index is based on Macaulayâ€™s marginal notations, which are a running analysis of the contents of the Confessio Amantis, a 33,000-line Middle English poem by John Gower. These have been used for subdivisions of the work in order to break it into smaller, more usable units and to serve as a very rough index of contents.  Some changes from the Harvard version have been made for Wikipedia purposes.
