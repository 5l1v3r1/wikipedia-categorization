This is a list of the stories in Richard Francis Burton's translation of One Thousand and One Nights. Burton's first ten volumes—which he called The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night—were published in 1885.  His Supplemental Nights were published between 1886 and 1888 as six volumes.  Later pirate copies split the very large third volume into two volumes. The nights are in the style of stories within stories, and the frame story is The Story Of King Shahryar of Persia and His Brother or The Story Of King Shahryar and Queen Shahrazad, in which Shahrazad tells tales to her husband Shahryar. Also included in this volume The material in the first two of the six supplemental volumes are the Arabic tales originally included in the John Payne translation. They are mostly taken from the Breslau edition and the Calcutta fragment. In the remainder of this volume W. A. Clouston presents "variants and analogues" of the supplemental nights. This volume is based primarily on tales found in a Bibliothèque nationale manuscript (Supplement Arab. No.2523) which was used by Antoine Galland.  The nights indicated overlap with those given in Burton's main series.  The Table of Contents in this covers this and the following volume. Appendix The stories in this volume are based on the Wortley Montague Codex in the Bodleian Library, originally used for the Jonathan Scott translation.  No explanation has been found regarding the nights that do not appear. This volume continues material from the Wortley Montague Codex
