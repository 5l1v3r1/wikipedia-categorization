This is a list of short stories by Isaac Asimov. Asimov is mainly famous for his science-fiction, but he also wrote mystery and fantasy stories. This list includes Asimov's Foundation short stories, which were later collected into three novels known as the Foundation Trilogy. In this table, "year" refers to the year of publication, and in the case of magazines means the cover date (which is not always the year when the magazine actually appeared on sale). Alternative titles appear in brackets. (383 stories appear on this list.) The collection I, Robot also contains a linking text at the beginning and end of the book, and in between some (but not all) of the stories, which form a framing story not found anywhere else.  A play by Asimov called The Story Machine, which is an adaptation of his short story "Someday", was published in the February 1958 issue of Plays.  In 1950 Asimov wrote a comic strip called "Star Empire" (art by Charles Schneeman). The first page appeared in the May 1990 issue of Argosy.     Five published stories were never included in Asimov's own books. They were however included in other anthologies.  Nine science fiction stories have never been collected in any book: 20 mystery stories have also never been anthologised.   Of these, all but one are Union Club mystery stories  (for a list, see The Union Club Mysteries). "Zip Code" (1986) is a mystery story featuring the boy detective character Larry.  Nine stories which Asimov wrote early in his career were never published anywhere, and are now lost: In the 1972 anthology The Early Asimov, Asimov listed two other stories which he thought had also been lost:  "The Weapon" (1938) and "Big Game" (1941). However, they were subsequently found and collected in In Memory Yet Green (1979) and Before the Golden Age (1974), respectively.   (They are included in the above list of published stories.)
