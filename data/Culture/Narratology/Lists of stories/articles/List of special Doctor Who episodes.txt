Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The show has been a large influence in the media since its inception in 1963. Running parallel to its parenting seasons and series' lie miscellaneous television broadcasts, several episodes into home video "exclusive" releases and many video games. There have been several special Doctor Who episodes and serials that are produced by the BBC. They usually consist of spoofs and crossovers with other TV shows, and stories produced for special occasions. There have been several special Doctor Who internet broadcasts. Throughout the sixth and seventh series' beginning with "The Impossible Astronaut", several "prequels" were released online, which acted as openers for its accompanying episode. All "prequels" were released ahead of the accompanying episode, with the exception of "Battle of Demons Run - Two Days Later" which was released after "The Snowmen". The concept is similar to that of the second series, in which each episode had an accompanying Tardisode. Two prequels to the ninth series premiere, "The Magician's Apprentice", were released in September 2015. Two Doctor Who documentaries have featured cutaway mini scenes. In 1983 Doctor Who: The First Adventure was released for the BBC Micro.  followed by Doctor Who and the Warlord in 1985  and Doctor Who and the Mines of Terror also in 1985.  Later several other games were released. On 7 April 2010, the BBC announced that the fifth series would be supplemented with four "interactive episodes",  released online for free in the UK. They are described as "part of the Doctor Who universe", and will "go on to define the look and feel of future TV episodes." Executively produced by Moffat, Wenger and Willis with Anwen Aspden and Charles Cecil, the games are developed by Sumo Digital and written by Phil Ford and James Moran. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan provide full voiceovers for the digitised Doctor and Amy, both of whom are playable characters. Each episode offers around two hours of gameplay.  The Adventure Games were recommissioned by the BBC for a second series in 2011,  but after the release of The Gunpowder Plot, they were cancelled so the BBC could focus more on console games such as Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock. There have been several special Doctor Who parodic sketches either on television, online or on DVD.
