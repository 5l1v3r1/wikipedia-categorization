Hypertime is a fictional concept in DC Comics which first appeared in the 1999 The Kingdom limited series. It is a variation of the Multiverse concept that existed in DC Comics before Crisis on Infinite Earths.  Hypertime is a network of alternate timelines that branch off from the DC Universe. These timelines sometimes overlap with each other, causing alterations in reality. Characters can cross from one timeline to another if needed.  Mister Mind, disguised as Skeets, refers to Waverider as "the seer of Hypertime".  An older Booster Gold, while explaining his duties to his son Rip Hunter, mentions the concept of Hypertime.  Hypertime is used to explain the formation and alteration of the 52 universes formed at the end of 52.  Hypertime has been mentioned several times in the Prime Earth continuity.
