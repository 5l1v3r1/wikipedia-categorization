Fabrics in this list include fabrics that are woven, non-woven, as well as knitted fabrics and netting fabrics, and technical fabrics (such as Gore-Tex and Gannex). A fabric may share the name of the fibre from which it is made if its content is derived entirely from the fibre (such as angora fabric made of 100% angora fibre).
