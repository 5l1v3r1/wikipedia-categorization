A clothes steamer, also called a garment steamer or simply a steamer, is a device used for quickly removing wrinkles from garments and fabrics with the use of high temperature steam.   Working principle of clothes steamer is very simple. Hot steam penetrates deep into fabrics and while doing so, it relaxes inner fibers. This way it removes wrinkles faster than ironing. Since it penetrates deep inside fibers, your clothes are left fresh in just a matter of seconds. Fabric steamer works gently on most of the fabrics and is also equally best for other heavier materials.  There are three basic sizes of clothes steamers: commercial floor models used in large manufacturing plants and dry cleaners, mid-sized models for small businesses such as tailors or seamstresses, and the most recent evolution in the steamer industry the handheld mini steamers typically for household use or traveling.  Steamers relax fibers rather than flattening like traditional ironing, this process is gentler on clothing and eliminates scorching. This means a clothes steamer can also be used to remove wrinkles from delicate fabrics such as silk.  The most popular steamers are handheld and easy to use, simply hang garment, fill the steamer's water reservoir, wait a few minutes for it to heat and proceed to go over the article with a sweeping motion.  Many of these features are typically only found on the more expensive vertical valet clothes steamer models. Handheld, or travel, clothes steamers don't often include these additional features and are usually less powerful than their vertical valet steamers counterparts.
