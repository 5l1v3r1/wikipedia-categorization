"Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!" is a widely quoted paraphrase of a line of dialogue from the 1948 film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  That line was in turn derived from dialogue in the 1927 novel, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which was the basis for the film. In 2005, the full quote from the film was chosen as #36 on the American Film Institute list, AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.  The shorter, better-known version of the quote was first  heard in the 1967 episode of the TV series The Monkees, "It's a Nice Place to Visit". It was also included in the 1974 Mel Brooks film Blazing Saddles, and has since been included in many other films and television shows. The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven's novel The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927): "All right," Curtin shouted back. "If you are the police, where are your badges? Let's see them." "Badges, to god-damned hell with badges! We have no badges. In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges, you god-damned cabr√≥n and chinga tu madre!" The line was popularized by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of the novel, which was altered from its content in the novel to meet the Motion Picture Production Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film.  In one scene, a Mexican bandit leader named "Gold Hat"  (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart)  that he and his company are Federales: Dobbs: "If you're the police, where are your badges?" Gold Hat: "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges! The phrase has often been quoted, paraphrased, and parodied in a variety of media.
