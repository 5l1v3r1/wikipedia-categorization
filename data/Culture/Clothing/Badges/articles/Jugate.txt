A jugate consists of two portraits side by side to suggest, to the viewer, the closeness of each to the other. Often this would be a presidential and vice presidential candidates although sometimes a state or local candidate is included with a presidential candidate.  Jugates may be seen on medals, pinbacks, buttons, posters or other campaign items.  If a third figure appears on the item, it is called a trigate.
