Cosmetic textiles are the functional textiles, including garments, underwear which come in direct contact with the skin through the process of microencapsulation. They concern the treatment of the skin for a cosmetic approach (for example, the orange peel effect), but can also be a vehicle for other active functions, such as slimming and body shaping. Cosmetic textiles currently offered on the market claim to be moisturizing, perfumed, cellulite reducing and body slimming.
