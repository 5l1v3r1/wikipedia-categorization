Trademark look   or signature look  is the characteristic clothes or other distinguishing signs used by a certain character or performer, making the person more recognizable by the audience. Politicians may also have trademark signs, such as the suit of American President Barack Obama  or the Merkel-Raute of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.   It can also refer to the clothes of a certain subculture.  Sometimes, when a celebrity stops using a trademark look, people might even find it hard to recognise them.  The term is not used in trademark law and a trademark look is not necessarily trademark protected in itself.
