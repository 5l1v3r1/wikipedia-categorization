A pelerine  (from French "p√®lerine" (pilgrim), is a cape-collar covering the shoulders.  Layered muslin pelerines were popular in the 1830s as an option to drape over the top of the large sleeves fashionable at that period.  Along with tippets, they helped emphasise the fashionable width of the sleeves and the shoulderline of the decade.  1815. Cream silk pelerine 1825-30. Cream silk pelerine c.1830.
