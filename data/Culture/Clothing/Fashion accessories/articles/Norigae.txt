Norigae (hangul: 노리개) is a typical, traditional Korean accessory that is hung from a woman's jeogori goreum (coat strings) or hanbok chima (skirt) and so on.  A norigae can be divided into 4 parts: the ddidon (hangul : 띠돈; hanja: 帶金) (a hook (either a separate accessory or additional knots) to attach the norigae/s to the hanbok), the paemul (hangul : 패물) (the main ornament of the norigae), the maedeup (hangul : 매듭) (the knot/s of the norigae), and the sul (hangul : 술) (the tassels).  The norigae's function is both a good-luck charm hoped to bring something such as eternal youth, wealth or many sons (depending on its shape), as well as a fashion accessory.  Usually, the norigae from the parents' or in-laws' home was passed down to descendants.  Norigaes have various shapes derived from nature or from everyday life. They are divided into samjaks (hangul : 삼작; hanja: 三作) and danjaks (hangul : 단작; hanja: 單作), and samjaks can then be divided again into daesamjaks and sosamjaks. Daesamjaks and sosamjaks have the same form, but each one's paemul is different.
