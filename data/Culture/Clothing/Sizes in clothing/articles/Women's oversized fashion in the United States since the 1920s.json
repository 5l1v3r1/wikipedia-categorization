After World War I, the fashion world experienced a great switch: from tight corsets and hobble skirts\u2014to shapeless, oversized, and sparsely decorated garments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Women began to wear more comfortable fashions, including blousy skirts and trousers. Further, this era gave birth to sportswear fashion. Sportswear, previously recognized as America\u2019s main contribution to fashion, consisted of a casual more relaxed style.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Coco_Chanel\" title=\"Coco Chanel\">Coco Chanel</a>, known as the first modern dressmaker, made one of the greatest contributions to style in the 1920s: the two-piece dress. She created two-piece dresses out of <a href=\"/wiki/Jersey_(fabric)\" title=\"Jersey (fabric)\">jersey (fabric)</a>, a comfortable stretchy fabric.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The American public was receptive, embracing this relaxed style, which was perfect for the active woman on the go. The combination of these new ideas yielded this loosely fitted, modernized style.\n</p><p>The \"boyish figure\", moreover, became a prevalent trends of the era, with shapeless silhouettes and dropped <a href=\"/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)\" title=\"Waistline (clothing)\">waistlines</a> giving a more masculine look to the female figure. The emphasis on a flattened chest revolutionized the construction of undergarments. Along with this new silhouette, 1920s fashions were further modernized by the coming of a new generation of sewing-machines, each with an individual electric motor, enabling designers to create more oversized fashions, while saving time and resources.\n</p><p>In contrast to the \"boyish figure\" were the types of hats and accessories women wore in \"the roaring twenties\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Flapper_dress\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flapper dress\">Flapper dresses</a> were juxtaposed with oversized hats, often trimmed with large bows, feathers, ribbons, or sequins. Furthermore, bold headbands were often worn to compliment women's customarily shorter hair lengths. Since a lot of women's fashion from this decade were quite masculine in style, many women adorned them with accessories that were rather feminine.\n</p><p>Music also had an influence in the ways in which fashions evolved.

With rising unemployment and despair, no industry was left unaffected. In the fashion industry, designers cut their prices and produced new lines of ready-to-wear clothes, along with clothing made of more economical and washable fabrics, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Rayon\" title=\"Rayon\">rayon</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Nylon\" title=\"Nylon\">nylon</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> For example, <a href=\"/wiki/Coco_Chanel\" title=\"Coco Chanel\">Coco Chanel</a> showed a collection of evening dresses made of cotton and sold dresses reduced by 50%. The fashions of the 1930s were stylish and elegant, with flowing lines and Paris-based coutures.\n</p><p>Since many women could not afford to update their wardrobes, women changed their look by resorting to alterations to exemplify the oversized fashion of the 1930s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Peacock2007_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Peacock2007-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> They used lengthening bands of contrasting fabric and added fur to their hems. This inventive way to put together new articles of clothing gave birth to the \"Feedsack Dress\"; constructed from the material of a sack of animal feed, these frocks were typically cut similarly to shift dresses. This <a href=\"/wiki/A-line_(clothing)\" title=\"A-line (clothing)\">A-line</a> cuts were boxy and contrasted the slinky and sensual <a href=\"/wiki/Bias_(textile)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bias (textile)\">bias</a>-cut dresses that became famous during the same era for their ability to cover the woman's body while clinging to each curve. Furthermore, material was added to collars and sleeves. Another trend rising from the 1930s was the \"Banjo Sleeve\", created by sewing two rectangular pieces of fabric with the top seam only sewn halfway to allow the arm to flow out. The boxy shape was oversized and blousy. As the era progressed, skirts that flared out fell to the bottom of the calf and sleeves were loosely tied as they fell from the elbow to wrist.\n</p><p>From the harsh economic conditions of the time came about the glamorous <a href=\"/wiki/1930s_in_film\" title=\"1930s in film\">1930s in film</a>, and the glamorous clothing worn seen on the screen grew in popularity.

The look of the 1960s reflected the main issue of that time: Civil Rights. The 1960s woman \u201cdemanded equal rights and equal pay, wanted to be free, to look young and to have fun\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Oversized fashions were utilized in more subtle ways in this decade, giving rise to trends that revolutionized the working woman and gave a voice to more conservative feminines.\n</p><p>To achieve this youthful and flirty look, skirts were shortened, creating a look reminiscent of the 1920s. During this era, in 1965, the <a href=\"/wiki/Miniskirt\" title=\"Miniskirt\">miniskirt</a> was developed. An alternative to this exposed look was in high demand, thus leading to the creation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Midi_skirt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Midi skirt\">midi skirt</a>. This new \"midi\" mainly featured a pleated A-line bodice, which allowed it to flow away from the body. This oversized fashion began to make its way to the workplace as it provided both femininity and formality. Evening wear was also affected, and both long and short dresses could be seen at engagements. Designs embraced the oversized look through more elegant silhouettes, specially in evening wear, which boasted loose forms and fluid fabrics. The change in fashion during this period was also due to international influences such as from London and France, where designers were young. A notable point about this period is that women also began to wear pants-suits and jeans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The materials used for both clothing and accessories changed during this era. Increasingly used were easy-care synthetic fabrics such as <a href=\"/wiki/Crimplene\" title=\"Crimplene\">Crimplene</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dacron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dacron\">Dacron</a> and Terylene. The benefits of such synthetic fabrics were that they were crease-resistant, easy to wash, and required little to no ironing. Designers such as <a href=\"/wiki/Crist%C3%B3bal_Balenciaga\" title=\"Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga\">Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga</a> embraced these new types of materials, using them in oversized dolman-sleeve jackets. The pattern for this piece was cut in a rectangular shape forming a boxy blousy look.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During this period, synthetic yarns that took dyes easily were used. Leather-look plastic also helped to create a vibrant feel to accessories such as shoes, umbrellas and additional clothing items such as mini-skirts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> While in this era, clothing became split along lines of age, there were overriding oversized trends including: midi skirts, <a href=\"/wiki/Dolman_sleeve\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dolman sleeve\">Dolman sleeves</a>, loose jackets and shapeless frocks. Another factor contributing to the trends of this period was the \u201cpost-industrial boom\u201d that helped to generate wealth in the United States. <a href=\"/wiki/Jackie_Kennedy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jackie Kennedy\">Jackie Kennedy</a>, wife of President John F. Kennedy, became a model of French fashions and helped to spur the spread of the miniskirt, along with <a href=\"/wiki/Twiggy\" title=\"Twiggy\">Twiggy</a>, who gained iconic status as the face and body of the era wearing the shapeless mod dresses that were a huge trend. Jackie Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbeehive\u201d hairstyle also highlighted oversized fashion.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_1970s\">The 1970s</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Women%27s_oversized_fashion_in_the_United_States_since_the_1920s&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: The 1970s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:1970sgirl2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/1970sgirl2.jpg/220px-1970sgirl2.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"309\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/1970sgirl2.jpg/330px-1970sgirl2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/1970sgirl2.jpg/440px-1970sgirl2.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1924\" data-file-height=\"2704\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:1970sgirl2.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Fashion circa 1973</div></div></div>\n<p>The 1970s is often referred to as the \u201cMe Decade\u201d,<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> a term originally coined by writer <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Wolfe\" title=\"Tom Wolfe\">Tom Wolfe</a>. There were many groups, such as political and extremist groups, wanting a piece of the action. With respect to dress, it was an \u201canything goes\u201d era, without rules. This manifested in some ways via the production of oversized fashion.\n</p><p>Fashion styles were inspired by previous decades, hinting at both nostalgia and an interest in other cultures. The current political and economic situation of the United States, including the civil rights, <a href=\"/wiki/Unemployment\" title=\"Unemployment\">unemployment levels</a>, war and terrorism, were reflected in the manner in which individuals dressed. With the women\u2019s movement of the 1970s, radical feminists could be stereotyped for their anti-high fashion sentiments; these women required low maintenance and made a statement. With regards to high fashion, established fashion houses produced more ready-to-wear collections and casual attire.\n</p><p>With nostalgia a big theme of this period, secondhand clothes were key. Similar to the 1950s, 1920s clothing also influenced this decade, along with fashions of the '30s, '40s and '50s. Television and movies such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Godfather\" title=\"The Godfather\">The Godfather</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Grease_(film)\" title=\"Grease (film)\">Grease</a></i> also played homage to styles of the past. When not inspired by nostalgia, fashion took another turn whereby \"the idea was to appear as if your body had been spray painted\". To achieve this look, leotards were worn and were accessorized with short frilled skirts, cap sleeves and <a href=\"/wiki/Leg-warmers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leg-warmers\">leg-warmers</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Hot_pants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hot pants\">Hot pants</a>\u201d or skimpy shorts were also popular in the beginning of the '70s.

As the fashion world began to experience technological modernization, along with a widespread support from mainstream consumers, the industry felt the need to appeal to different types of audiences. Some of the women\u2019s fashion trends included neon and pastel colors, legging and exercise wear, the hippie look, and a <a href=\"/wiki/Hip-hop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hip-hop\">hip-hop</a> style.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> The last of those examples, hip-hop style, is identifiable as the oversized fashion of the '90s. The influence of hip-hop on urban fashion was overtly strong. Urban fashion was distinctly designed for African-American youth.\n</p><p>The 1990s urban style heavily influenced by <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Nationalism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Black Nationalism\">Black Nationalism</a> and African trends began with the blousy pant sported by famous figures in the rap world such as <a href=\"/wiki/MC_Hammer\" title=\"MC Hammer\">MC Hammer</a>, who popularized oversized \"<a href=\"/wiki/Hammer_pants\" title=\"Hammer pants\">Hammer pants</a>\", and <a href=\"/wiki/Fez_(hat)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fez (hat)\">fezzes</a>. However, men were not the only ones to embrace this new form of street wear. Women too began to explore the trend. The group <a href=\"/wiki/TLC_(band)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TLC (band)\">TLC (band)</a> and R&amp;B singer <a href=\"/wiki/Aaliyah\" title=\"Aaliyah\">Aaliyah</a> created their own urban fashion for women.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> The trend consisted of wearing oversized pants and big flannel shirts. The hardcore aspect of rap did not fully permit the women to embrace a feminine look that might make them appear weaker.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> However, some femininity was maintained by the wearing of more fitted shirts, bare midsections and sports bras, while still being hard with the blousy pieces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During the upheaval of the streetwear fashion, models of color began to make their mark in the industry.

The death of <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_McQueen\" title=\"Alexander McQueen\">McQueen</a> in February 2010 led to his style of fashion accruing even more attention, which put oversized fashion even more on the map.\n</p><p>Another exhibition of the trend is the oversized handbag.
