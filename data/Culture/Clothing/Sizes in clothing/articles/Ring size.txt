Ring size is a measurement used to denote the circumference of jewellery rings. There are several systems for denoting the sizes of jewellery rings in use around the world: Before accepting the equations and values in the article, consider the multiple dissenting opinions listed in the talk page and other sites.     For the system prevailing the United States, the Circular of the Bureau of Standards   summarizes the situation as: "While there apparently is only one standard in use in the United States, in reality, because of the lack of specific dimensions and because of the errors introduced by the adoption of a common commercial article as a pattern, there are many, although similar, standards."  There does not appear to have been any improvement in the standard since then. To convert from US, Canada and Mexico ring sizes (s) to ISO 8653:2016 circumference:                         c         =         2.55         ×         s         +         36.5                 {\displaystyle c=2.55\times s+36.5}     and for diameter:                         d         =         0.8128         ×         s         +         11.63                 {\displaystyle d=0.8128\times s+11.63}     Ring sizes can be measured physically by a plastic or metal ring sizer, or by measuring the inner diameter of a ring that already fits. There are also online measuring tools available. Online measuring tools vary, but many offer multiple ways to measure the ring size, such as wrapping a paper cutout around the finger, or measuring a current ring according to a chart.
