The clothing culture of Lurs is a very interesting aspect of this ethnic group which has been developed along with their long history of coexistence with surrounding natural elements across the Iranian plateau, and geographical, cultural and religious effects.    This clothing system is a symbol of Lurish people although it varies due to geographical and seasonal conditions and between Lurish subgroups. The colors of Lurish costumes differ by the Lurs location. In a general classification Lurish clothes are in three main subgroups: Feyli (common between Feyli Lurs including Laki, Minjai, Kalhori and Maleki tribes), Bakhtiari (Common between Bakhtiari Charlang and Haftlang clans) and Southern Lurish (common between Southern Lurs).  Shaal (شال): A long white cloth (width: 60–90 cm, length: 6–9 meters) made by chalvar nature which is twisted all round the waist.  Setra (سِتره): A special cassock that its size is below the knees and usually is used for more official ceremonies. This clothes is one of the oldest types of clothing in Iran. Felt hats (کُلأ نِمِدی): A round felt made that has no edges and sometimes is surrounded by Golvani.  Giva(گیوه): A local handmade shoes with sturdy leather or plastic soles and the vamp is woven by spun yarn. Chugha (چوغا):  A masculine wrapper that is used prominently by Bakhtiari Lurs and Feyli Lurs. Chugha is made by sheep wool and usually is woven by Bakhtiari nomads.  Juma (جومه) or Kraas(کراس): A free, tall and without a collar dress which is a common clothing of Lurish women all across Luristan.  Kolonja (کُلُنجه): is a lacing overcoat which in many cases, the surface is embroidered and decorated by coins. Saava (ساوه): A special silk fabric that Lur women tie around the head.  Golvani (گُلوَنی): A colorful and patterned type of Saava that mostly is used for celebration and joy. In recent years, Golvani is mentioned as an ethnic symbol of Lurs and every year is celebrated on a certain day (May 16) during spring season.
