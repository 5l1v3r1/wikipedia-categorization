This table of types of hijab describes terminologically distinguished styles of Islamic clothing commonly associated with the word hijab. The Arabic word hijƒÅb can be translated as "cover, wrap, curtain, veil, screen, partition", among other meanings.  In the Quran it refers to notions of separation, protection and covering in both literal and metaphorical senses.  Subsequently, the word has evolved in meaning and now usually denotes a Muslim woman's veil or the notion of separation between the sexes.  In English, the term refers predominantly to the Islamic head covering for women and its underlying religious precepts.
