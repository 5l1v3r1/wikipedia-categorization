 The casual subculture is a subsection of football culture that is typified by hooliganism and the wearing of expensive designer clothing      (known as "clobber"). The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear such as Stone Island, CP Company, L'alpina, Lacoste, Sergio Tacchini, Fila and Ellesse in order to avoid the attention of police and to intimidate rivals.  They did not wear club colours, so it was allegedly easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter pubs. Some casuals have worn clothing items similar to those worn by mods.  Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as ID, The Firm and The Football Factory.  The designer clothing and fashion aspect of the casual subculture began in the mid-to-late 1970s.  One well documented precursor was the trend of Liverpool youths starting to dress differently from  other football fans â€” in Peter Storm jackets, straight-leg jeans and Adidas trainers.  Liverpool F.C. fans were the first British football fans to wear continental European fashions, which they picked up while following their teams at matches in Europe.  The other documented precursor, according to Colin Blaney, was a subculture known as Perry Boys, which originated in the mid-1970s as a precursor to the casuals. The Perry Boys subculture consisted of Manchester football hooligans styling their hair into a flick and wearing sportswear, Fred Perry shirts and Dunlop Green Flash trainers.
