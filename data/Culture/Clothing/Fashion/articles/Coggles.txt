Coggles is a designer fashion retailer for men and women. The company stocks over 400 brands which specialize in luxury clothing, accessories and footwear. Coggles was established in 1974 when the flagship store was opened in the UK in York by Victoria Bage. Bage supposedly named the store 'Coggles' after she discovered her husband was having an affair with his secretary, named Sarah Coggles.  Bage immediately divorced her husband and decided to name the store Coggles as a permanent reminder of his infidelity. When the store first opened it served coffee, played music and sold fashion. Bage's son, Mark Bage,  modernised the store  and took Coggles online.  In 2013, Coggles entered administration and the online side of the business was bought by multi-online retailer, The Hut Group.  Following the closure of the store in York in 2013,  Coggles now operates entirely online from The Hut Group's headquarters in Cheshire. The Coggles website launched in 2006 taking elements of the store online and still providing designer men’s and women’s fashion.  Coggles.com is known for its 'LIFE' section,  which is a collection of editorial articles covering art, travel, music, food and more. Coggles.com is also home to one of the UK’s largest street style archives.
