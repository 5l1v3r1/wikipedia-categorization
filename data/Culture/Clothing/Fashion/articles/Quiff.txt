The quiff is a hairstyle that combines the 1950s pompadour hairstyle, the 1950s flattop, and sometimes a mohawk.  The hairstyle was a staple in the British 'Teddy Boy' movement, but became popular again in Europe in the early 1980s and faced a resurgence in popularity during the '90s.  The etymology of the word "quiff" is uncertain, and several proposals have been suggested for its origin. The modern-day quiff includes plenty of hair at the front of the top of the head, receding into shorter hair at the back with a trimmed back and sides. The Japanese punch perm, a favorite among yakuza (organized criminals) and bōsōzoku (biker gangs), is similar to the quiff.
