A chifforobe (/ˈʃɪfəˌroʊb/), also chiffarobe or chifferobe, is a closet-like piece of furniture that combines a long space for hanging clothes (that is, a wardrobe or armoire) with a chest of drawers.   Typically the wardrobe section runs down one side of the piece, while the drawers occupy the other side.   It may have two enclosing doors or have the drawer fronts exposed and a separate door for the hanging space.   Chifforobes were first advertised in the 1908 Sears, Roebuck Catalogue, which described them as "a modern invention, having been in use only a short time."   The term itself is a portmanteau of the words chiffonier and wardrobe.  The word is used in the United States, primarily in the southern portion of the country,  in Puerto Rico,  and in Cuba.  Its use has been attested as far apart as Georgia and Vermont.   In those references, it was used as a water closet or potty (or more accurately a commode).   The word has been used in Texas, but is not as common as its synonyms such as bureau or dresser.
