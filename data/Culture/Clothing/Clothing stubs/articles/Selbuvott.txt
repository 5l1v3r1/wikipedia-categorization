Selbuvott is a knitted mitten, with pattern from Selbu in Norway.  The mitten is made to keep your hands warm during winter, and it contains wool. It is made with one huge room for your fingers, and one separate room for the thumb. The pattern is a Selburose which is a traditional rose from the Selbu area. It has the shape of an octagram. Marit Guldsetbrua Emstad (born 1841) is the woman who first made the pattern, and sold it through Husfliden in Trondheim in 1897. Selbuvott is probably the most-worn knitted pattern in Norway.
