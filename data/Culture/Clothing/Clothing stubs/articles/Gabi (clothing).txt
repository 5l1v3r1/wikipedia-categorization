Gabi is a handmade cloth worn by Eritreans and Ethiopians. It is worn over the shoulders and upper body and is made out of chiffon. Unlike the two-layered kuta (worn by men) and netela (worn by women), it consists of four layers.  Both men and women can wear it, but most likely, old people wear it.
