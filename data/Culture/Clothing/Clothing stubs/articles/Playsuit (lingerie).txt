A playsuit is an item of lingerie consisting of an all in one design where the top half, similar to a negligee, is joined to the bottom half, similar to a panty or shorts. The playsuit also exists in mainstream fashion as a type of garment. Typically a shorter version of the jumpsuit, it was popular in the 1970s, and was usually made from silky fabrics for evening wear, or jersey and terry-toweling for casual summer wear. Since 2006, the playsuit, jumpsuit and catsuit has had a resurgence in mainstream fashion.
