A diabetic sock is a non-binding and non-elasticized sock which is designed alleviate pressure of the foot or leg.  Typically sufferers of diabetes are the most common users of this type of sock.  Diabetes raises the blood sugar level, which can increase the risk of foot ulcers. Diabetic socks are made to be unrestrictive of circulation.  Some diabetic socks also control moisture,   a feature which can reduce the risk of infection. Another beneficial feature of diabetic socks is seamless toe-closures to reduce pressure and blistering.  Various sock constructions are available, including cotton blend with stretch tops, non-cotton with antimicrobial properties, compression type, and plain non-binding to allow circulation to flow more freely. Extra wide socks are available for excessive edema. Diabetic socks may appear like regular socks, and are available in both low-cut and mid-calf styles. Although various colors are available, white may be preferable for people with open wounds or sores, as this could alert wearers with compromised sensation to a draining wound. The diabetic socks should fit well, without constricting cuffs, lumps, or uncomfortable seams. The socks are generally made of material that does not wrinkle.  The advice of a podiatrist may be helpful in choosing a diabetic sock.
