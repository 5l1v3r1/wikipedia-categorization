An opera coat is an ankle- or floor-length loose-fitting coat of luxurious fabric such as velvet, brocade or satin, to be worn over an evening gown or a man's tuxedo. It may be described as a fitted cloak with sleeves and is generally not as tailored as a coat. Men's opera coats are frequently worn with a walking stick and top hat. Like cloaks and capes, the opera coat is usually lined in a coloured expensive fabric, such as silk, or a weave like satin, for a more opulent look. An opera coat often has an elegant or dramatic collar, and may have padded sleeves. It may or may not be trimmed in fur. It often has an elaborate braided rope instead of buttons at the neck.
