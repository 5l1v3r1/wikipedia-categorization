Dolphin shorts or Dolfins are a specific style of unisex shorts for athletics. They are typically very short and were originally made from nylon with contrasting binding, side slits, and rounded corners, with a waistband at the top; a style which was popular in the 1980s.   The name is a corruption of Dolfin, the American company that first produced the original running shorts in the 1980s.  Due to their shortness, they are sometimes identified as a form of hotpants.  One high-profile wearer of 'dolphin shorts' is the fitness guru Richard Simmons, who in 2012, boasted of owning 400 pairs of vintage Dolfins.  Orange Dolfin shorts are specified as part of the uniform for waitresses at Hooters.
