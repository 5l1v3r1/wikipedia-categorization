An undershirt is an article of underwear worn underneath a dress shirt intended to protect it from body sweat and odors. Alternatively, it may be worn to protect the body from stiff or otherwise uncomfortable fabric that a person may be required to wear (such as a mandatory work uniform). It can have short sleeves or be sleeveless. The term most commonly refers to upper-body wear worn by males. This article of clothing typically has a low, round neckline that can be worn for athletic purposes. It also makes dress shirts less transparent.  It can also be worn during winter months as an extra layer of warmth.  Factory mass-produced undershirts became common in the West in the early 20th century, with innovations turning the union suit into two pieces, for upper and lower body.
