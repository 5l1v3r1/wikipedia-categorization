A scoop neck shirt is one in which the scoop-shape neckline is dropped significantly below normal limits. Some scoop neck shirts, when worn by women, are cut low enough to display significant amounts of cleavage. These shirts come in a variety of forms, including those with and without buttons. At least one fashion designer has recently produced a line of shirts for men that can be converted to scoop neck shirts by clipping a thread in the collar.
