A printer's (or carpenter's or pressman's) hat is a traditional, box-shaped, folded paper hat, formerly worn by craft tradesmen such as carpenters, masons, painters and printers. In his illustration for Through the Looking-Glass, John Tenniel's carpenter wears a hat of this type. Several self-portraits  of Eric Gill, and a photograph by Howard Coster, in the National Portrait Gallery collection, show him wearing what appears to be a printer's hat.
