Pinstripes are a pattern of very thin stripes of any color running in parallel often found in cloth. The pinstriped suit has become associated with conservative business attire, although many designers now produce the fashionable pinstripe patterns for fashion-conscious consumers.  Pinstripes have been found on suits since the early 19th century. They were used by banks in London to identify their employees. Pinstripes were originally worn only on suit pants but upon being adopted in America during the 20th century they were also used on suit jackets.  The pinstripe is often compared to the similar chalk stripe.  Pinstripes are very thin, often 1/30th of an inch in width, and are created with one single warp yarn. Although found mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pinstriped. The Chicago Cubs' baseball uniforms have had pinstripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to incorporate pinstriping into a baseball uniform.  Many other former and current Major League Baseball teams—including the Florida Marlins,   Minnesota Twins, Montreal Expos, Colorado Rockies, New York Mets, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies—later adopted pinstripes on their own uniforms. The Yankees, in particular, are associated with the pattern.  This was later carried over into the NBA, with teams like the Chicago Bulls, Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic incorporating pinstripes into their uniforms.
