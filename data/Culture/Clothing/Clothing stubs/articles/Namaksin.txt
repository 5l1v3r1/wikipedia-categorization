Namaksin is a kind of traditional Korean clog made of wood for protection against mud and rain. Namaksin are close-toed shoes made of one piece of wood. These traditional clogs came not from Asia but from the Netherlands. The Dutch clogs have dated back to medieval times made totally of wood almost identical to the Namaksin. In 1651, Dutch merchant ships wrecked off the shore of Korea. The sailors that were left there made Dutch clogs to sell to the Koreans and they quickly became traditional footwear. Unlike most clogs, the Namaksin were worn well into the twentieth century. These shoes were worn by Koreans of all ages and social positions, usually in the rainy seasons.
