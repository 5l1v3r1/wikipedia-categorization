A playsuit is a type of garment. Typically a shorter version of the jumpsuit, it was created in the 1930s in New York as a stylish piece of sportswear.  It went in and out of fashion through to the 1970s, and was usually made from silky fabrics for evening wear, or jersey and terry-towelling for casual summer wear. Since 2006, the playsuit has had a resurgence in mainstream fashion.  Taylor Swift is known for her preference for short playsuits.
