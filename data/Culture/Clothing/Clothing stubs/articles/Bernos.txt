Bernos (also transliterated Barnos, Burnos) is a wool cloak-like garment and hood woven in one piece, worn by Ethiopian highlanders. The term seems to be an adaptation of the Maghrebi version of Burnous. Donald N. Levine notes that the wealthier men of Menz "wear the barnos, a tailored cape made of dark wool."   The bernos was frequently worn by the elite highlanders. Today, average citizens sometimes wear it in traditional ceremonies and at special occasions. Social status is indicated by the garment's decorative pattern.
