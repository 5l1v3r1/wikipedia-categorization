The Titovka (Serbian Cyrillic: Титовка) was a famous green side cap characteristic of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II, and later the Yugoslav People's Army (the "JNA", in Serbo-Croatian), hence known as the JNA cap.  It was based on the Russian pilotka, and often had the red star badge on the front, either made out of red felt or an enamelled red star with sickle and hammer.  It was named after the Partisan leader and President of Yugoslavia, Marshal Josip Broz Tito.  It was used by the Union of Pioneers of Yugoslavia, in white or blue colour
