A wedding sari is the traditional wedding dress of Indian women. The sari is traditionally red, with golden embroidery. Saint Thomas Christians from Kerala usually wear golden, white or cream saris with gold embroidery. Red saris are the traditional garment choice for brides in Indian culture. Sari fabric is also traditionally silk. Over time, color options and fabric choices for Indian brides have expanded. Today fabrics like crÃªpe, Georgette, tissue and satin are used, and colors have been expanded to include gold, pink, orange, maroon, brown, and yellow as well. Indian brides in Western countries often wear the sari at the wedding ceremony and change into other traditional Indian wear afterwards (lehenga, choli, etc.). The types of wedding saris include Kanchipuram wedding sari, Banarasi wedding sari, Sambalpuri wedding sari, Assam silk, Gota sari, Resham sari, Zardosi sari, aithani sari, Bandhani sari, Neriyathum sari.
