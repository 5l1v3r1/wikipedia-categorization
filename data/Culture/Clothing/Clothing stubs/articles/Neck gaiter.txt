A neck gaiter (or "buff") is an article of clothing worn about the neck for warmth.  It is a closed tube of fabric, often thick fleece or synthetic, which is slipped on and off over the head.  It can also be pulled up over the mouth to keep out wind and sand. Some balaclavas have a thin hood attached to what is essentially a neck gaiter.
