Kandangi (Tamil: கண்டாங்கி) is a type of saree made from silk threads in Tamil Nadu state of India. Traditionally, Chettinad and Koorainad are two types of Kandangi saree native in Tamil Nadu. However, many new types of Kandangi are now introduced by Tamil Nadu government. Koorai saree (Tamil: கூறைப் புடவை) is a modified version of Kandangi traditionally made from both silk and cotton threads in Koorainad region (currently named as Orur Oranad (also named as Koranad) which is located near Mayavaram) in Tamil Nadu. It weighs around 7-9 kejams (see:Tamil units of measurement). The Chettinadu Kandangi sari, introduced by Nagarathar community, is native to the town Karaikudi of Tamil Nadu state in India.  This style of saree, which has 2 borders and checked at its centre, is existed for more than 250 years old.  It is usually 48 inches wide and 5.5 metres length and usually manufactured in maroon, mustard and black colours. A Kandangi saree, which was made by old variety of thread (i.e, 40s x 40s) in 1920, is being used to research by NIFT scholars and it leads to a finding that says sari manufactured currently in Karaikudi by using 60se x 60se thread is the modified version of Chettinad Kandangi.
