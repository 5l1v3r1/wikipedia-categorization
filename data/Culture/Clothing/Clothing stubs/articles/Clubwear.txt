Clubwear is provocative, revealing, or fetish clothing that is worn to nightclubs featuring a sensual atmosphere with a very relaxed dress code. There are various types of clothing items that could be worn to clubs based on the location of the club, the club's dress code and the weather. Clubwear in the US and UK usually consists of things like tutus, white gloves, boiler suits, rompers, bikini sets, high visibility vests and trousers and fluffy or furry leg warmers. This type of clubwear is usually found at raves, big dance events and nightclubs dedicated to rave/dance music.
