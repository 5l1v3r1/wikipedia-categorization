Feather cloaks have been used by several cultures. Elaborate feather cloaks called ʻahuʻula  were created by early Hawaiians  for the aliʻi (royalty).    Feathers were also used in women's skirts called pāʻū.   The ʻiʻiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and ʻapapane (Himatione sanguinea), which provided red feathers, were killed and skinned due to their abundance. Yellow feathers were obtained from the mostly black and rarer ʻōʻō (Moho nobilis) and mamo (Drepanis pacifica) using a catch and release philosophy to ensure future availability.  In Māori culture feathers are a sign of chiefly rank,  and the kahu huruhuru (feather cloak),  is still used as sign of rank or respect.   The elite class of poets known as the filid wore a feathered cloak, the tuigen.
