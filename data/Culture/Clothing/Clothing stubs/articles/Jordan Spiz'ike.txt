Michael Jordan and Spike Lee released the Jordan Spiz'ike shoes on October 21, 2006,  as a tribute to their historic relationship.  The relationship began when Mars Blackmon (a character from Spike Lee's film, She's Gotta Have It) became the primary pitchman in Nike commercials for Air Jordans. The Spiz'ike is a mash-up of the Jordan III, IV, V, VI, Air Jordan IX and XX shoes. Only 4,567 pairs were made of the original release,  with all of the proceeds going to Morehouse College.  The number 40 represents Spike Leeâ€™s film company, 40 Acres & A Mule Filmworks, and the number 23 represents Michael Jordan's jersey number.  Each future release of the shoes varied the colors used.    The 2008 song 'Its All About The Air Jordans' by synth metal band A Day After Tomorrow was written about a pair of air Jordan Spiz'ikes.
