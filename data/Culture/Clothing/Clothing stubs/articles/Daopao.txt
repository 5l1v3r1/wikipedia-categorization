Daopao (道袍) is the traditional Chinese attire for men. It is a form of formal wear in the Ming Dynasty. It is a full-length robe with side slits beginning below the waist. There are side panels (暗擺) at the slits to conceal the undergarments. It is wide sleeved and has a belt (大帶). The collar can be of the same or different colour as the clothing, but has to be of the same colour as the edges of the clothing. An optional detachable protective huling (護領, lit. "protect collar") can be sewn to the collar. The huling can be of white or any other dark colours. Chinese sources indicate it has been worn since the Song Dynasty.  However, other sources states that it evolved from a military-styled tunic, the kuzhe, that was inspired by "nomad warriors from the north".  Despite its name (meaning 'robe of Taoism'), daopao is worn by all men regardless of religious background. Ming Dynasty portrait of men wearing daopao
