A gang patch is a term used in New Zealand to refer to the identifying insignia of a street gang. They have been linked to intimidation of members of the public by gang members. Each of the country's gangs has its own forms of insignia, of which the most prominent is often a large symbol, frequently worn by members on their clothing as a symbol of their gang membership. The patch is often seen as being as important to gang members as a military flag is to members of an army group, and any insult to the patch is taken as being an insult to the gang as a whole.  As such, the term has a more general meaning.  Being a "patched" member of a gang is to be a fully initiated member of the gang and often a ranking member of the gang's structure. The physical patches are highly valued and have been used with some success in negotiations.  Wanganui District Council has banned the wearing of gang patches within parts of their jurisdiction.   The ban was tested by judicial review in a hearing before Clifford J in November 2010. The judge reserved his decision.
