A toego or tego (Dzongkha: སྟོད་གོ་, Wylie: stod go; also romanised tögo) is a long-sleeved, short jacket-like garment worn over a kira by women in Bhutan.     The toego is thus part of the national dress of Bhutan required by the driglam namzha along with the kira and wonju. Both men and women in Bhutan wear the tego under the gho and kira.
