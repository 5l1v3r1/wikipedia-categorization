A crew neck (or crew-neck) is a type of shirt or sweater that has a round neckline and no collar, often worn with other layers.    The T-shirt crew neck was developed in 1932 as an undergarment that would absorb sweat and prevent shoulder pads of American football players from causing chafing.   The U.S. Navy was the first of the U.S. armed forces to adopt the crew-neck T-shirt or "Gob Shirt".  In some German American neighborhoods in the North East parts of the United States, "crew neck" sweat shirts are still referred to by the German word "Schrank". This is especially true for grey crew neck sweatshirts.
