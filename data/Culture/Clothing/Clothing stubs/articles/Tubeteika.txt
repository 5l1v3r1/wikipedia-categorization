A tubeteika (Russian: тюбете́йка) is a Russian word for many varieties of traditional Central Asian caps. Tubeteikas are today worn in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, as well as in Muslim-populated regions of Russia (mainly Tatars) and Azerbaijan. The skullcap worn by Uzbeks and Uyghurs is called a doppa and has a square base. Tubeteikas are worn typically by the Turkic ethnic groups of the region. It bears some superficial resemblance to the yurt, another Central Asian cultural icon. The -ka at the end is a Russian diminutive suffix, as with shapka, ushanka and budenovka. In Turkmen, it is called tahiya ("taqiyah"). The Uzbek doppa or duppi (Uzbek: doʻppi) is considered an applied art form and an important part of the traditional folk costume.
