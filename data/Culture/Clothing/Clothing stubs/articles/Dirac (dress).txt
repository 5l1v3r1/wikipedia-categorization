The dirac is a Somali dress worn by women that is long, usually ankle length, loose-fitting and usually has at least two colors. Its popularity began increasing in the 1970s and 1980s, and during those decades the dirac began replacing the guntiino in terms of popularity among women.  It looks similar to the grand boubou worn by women in French-speaking West Africa. It is usually worn along with a gorgoro, an undergarment.
