Carpenter jeans are jeans with many pockets and loops which can be used to carry objects such as tools and are often loose around the leg to be able to accommodate the affixed items.  They are often worn by construction workers and carpenters, hence the name, to carry their tools so that their hands can be kept free yet the tools are still easily accessible. Carpenter jeans are usually made of blue denim; however, canvas may be the material in more durable styles, and colours may vary; white and beige are other popular colours. A 'hammer loop' is usually located on the left leg; although this was originally designed to be useful, most carpenters do not use the loop, because the hammer often falls out or bangs around the leg. Other features include extra pockets, sometimes located on the outer thighs, and extra rivets for durability. Another feature is wider belt loops, to accommodate a wider, thicker belt.  Because of the weight of the tools carried in the pockets and loops, a tightly cinched, wide 'work belt' must be worn by most men. Most carpenter jeans are made for function, not fashion, and are usually of a softer denim than the original utilitarian jeans, with a looser fit. Despite this feature however, carpenter jeans were quite popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s hip hop scene especially those by the Tommy Hilfiger brand who sported their trademark logo on the hammer loop. Carpenter jeans could also be known as craftsman trousers as manufactured by many Scandinavian workwear companies such as Blaklader and as such can be purchased in the UK by tradesmen and women from Work That Works and Active Workwear.
