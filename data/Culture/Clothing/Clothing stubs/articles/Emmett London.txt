The vast majority of shirts are seasonal designs made in very small quantities (typically 25 shirts are made in each design) from premium fabrics, typically woven in Italy. All of Emmett's off-the-peg shirts have a contrasting fabric on the undercuff.  Alongside shirts, Emmett also sells a selection of accessories, including ties, scarves, socks, boxer shorts, cufflinks, pocket squares and swimwear.  In 2006 Emmett launched a made-to-measure service for shirts and suiting.
