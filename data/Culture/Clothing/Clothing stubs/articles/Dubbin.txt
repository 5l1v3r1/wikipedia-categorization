Dubbin is a wax product used to soften, condition and waterproof leather and other materials. It consists of natural wax, oil and tallow. Dubbin can be made with beeswax, fish oil and lard  and can also include mink oil. It is different from shoe polish, which is used to impart shine and colour to leather. Dubbin has been used since medieval times to waterproof and soften leather boots. The name dubbin is a contraction of the gerund dubbing, describing the action of applying the wax to leather.
