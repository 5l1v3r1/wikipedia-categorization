Miniver is an unspotted white fur derived from the winter coat of the stoat, which is also used to create ermine or, originally, from the winter coat of the red squirrel; frequently used in the robes of British peers. Miniver differs from ordinary ermine fur in that it does not include the distinctive black tails of the stoat.  From a red squirrel, which has a greyish-white winter coat with a white underside, miniver gros is the whole fur, including the grey, and miniver pure retains only the white part.
