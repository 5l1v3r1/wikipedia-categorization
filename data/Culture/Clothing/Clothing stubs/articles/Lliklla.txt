A lliklla (Quechua,  hispanicized spellings liclla, llicla, lliclla) is a rectangular, handwoven shoulder cloth. It is worn by Quechua women of the Andes region in Bolivia and Peru. Traditionally it is fastened at the front using a decorated pin called tupu.  In the Quechua-speaking community of Chinchero, men and women wear distinctive garments that identify them by gender and their community. These garments are woven in two partsâ€”symmetrical opposites that are sewn together. Wide blue bands called pampakuna, or fields, are set apart by multi-striped panels filled with colorful geometric designs. Typically, indigo-blue fields are characteristic of Chinchero women's garments.  A q'ipirina is similar to a lliklla but larger, worn over the back to carry small children or all sorts of products and knotted at the front.
