 Angels So Sweet Jeanswear (often simply called Angels Jeanswear or just Angels) is a brand of jeans made especially for girls and women.  Introduced in 1997 by Carl and Elyse Eckhaus, Angels jeans can be identified by its embellished beads and embroidery, along with its tags which are stitched on the back right pocket (or just the right side if the jeans have no back pockets) that read Angels, which are either in the shape of a rectangle or diamond.  Besides jeans, Angels also produce other denim products, including jackets, skirts and shorts. This brand is not to be confused with another company based in Germany called Angels.
