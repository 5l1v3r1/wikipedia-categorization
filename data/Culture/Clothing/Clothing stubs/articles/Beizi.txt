A beizi (褙子) is an item of traditional Chinese attire common to both men and women, a large loose coat. It was most popular during the Song Dynasty and Ming Dynasty. The origin date of beizi is unknown, and someone believed that beizi and banbi had been adopted from Central Asia during the Tang Dynasty through the Silk Road when cultural exchanges were frequent.  [verification needed] However, it is also believed to have been derived from banbi during the Song Dynasty, where the sleeves and the garment lengthened.  The gender difference is that while wide-sleeved beizi were considered formal wear for women (narrow-sleeved beizi were casual wear for women), both wide and narrow-sleeved beizi were only used as casual wear for men. It has a parallel/straight-collar (對襟) with side slits beginning at the armpit or at the waist. It can be secured at the front either with ties or a metal button.[verification needed] Court Ladies of the Former Shu wearing post-Tang Style beizi. A man wearing a "Song Styled" beizi.
