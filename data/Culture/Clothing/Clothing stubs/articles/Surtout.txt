A surtout coat is a man's frock coat, of the kind worn by cavalry officers over their uniforms in the 18th and early 19th centuries.  It was occasionally worn by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War (American War of Independence). Surtout is also a French word meaning "above all" or "especially".
