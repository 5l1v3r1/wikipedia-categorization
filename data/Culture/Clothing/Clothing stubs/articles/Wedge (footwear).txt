Wedge boots, wedgies, or lifties are shoes and boots with a sole in the form of a wedge, such that one piece of material, normally rubber, serves as both the sole and the heel. This design dates back to ancient Greece.  Wedgies for women are more common and often have a sole that is much thicker at the back than at the front, making them high-heeled boots or shoes. Wedgies for women were popularized by Salvatore Ferragamo, who introduced the design to the Italian market in the late 1930s.  Men's wedge boots, usually called "wedgies," typically have low heels. Men's boots of this kind became popular during the 1970s. They are making a comeback in 2010s. . Some forms of wedge boots, called platform boots, have thick soles throughout. There are many styles available under the wedges footwear category; the most common styles are low wedge, t-straps wedge, ankle straps wedge, platform wedge, and closed-toe wedge.
