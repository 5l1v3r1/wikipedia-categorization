The headwear of a Han Chinese official during Ming dynasty China consisted of a black hat with two wing-like flaps of thin, oval shaped boards on each side called the wushamao (烏紗帽，formally known as futou 襆頭). According to the Da Ming Hui Dian (大明會典), ordinary citizens are not allowed to wear this headdress unless attending wedding ceremonies or events involving any noble families/officials.
