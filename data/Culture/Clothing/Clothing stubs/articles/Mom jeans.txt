Mom jeans is a slang term for high-waisted women's jeans that were originally fashionable in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In the late 1990s and 2000s they were mainly worn by middle-aged American women and considered unhip by trendy younger women.   Mom jeans then came back in style amongst hipsters and fashionably aware young women in the 2010s.  Originally a pejorative and derogatory term, mom jeans gained  prominence from a May 2003 Saturday Night Live skit written by Tina Fey for a fake brand of jeans called Mom Jeans, which used the tagline "For this Mother's Day, don't give Mom that bottle of perfume. Give her something that says, 'I'm not a woman anymore...I'm a mom!' "  This style usually consists of a high waist rising above the belly button, making the buttocks appear disproportionately longer, larger, and flatter. Mom jeans  have excess space in the zipper/crotch and leg areas. The jeans are usually in a solid, light-blue color, with no form of stone washing or fading.  Other attributes of the style often seen are pleats, tapered legs, and elastic waistbands. The style is often accompanied by a blouse or shirt that is tucked into the jeans. This style of jeans was popular with trendy young women in the United States until the mid '90s, when lower rise jeans started to become fashionable.  Mom jeans came  back into fashion in the 2010s.  A corresponding term, dad jeans, has been coined in popular media to refer to an unflattering, high-waisted and shapeless style of jeans often worn by middle-aged American men. The term gained popularity in 2009 when President Barack Obama wore dad  jeans during the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.     In March 2015, Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the "Mean Tweets" segment, in which he read a tweet mocking him over the jeans. Jimmy Kimmel then appeared on stage wearing high-waisted jeans, and attempted to defend them.
