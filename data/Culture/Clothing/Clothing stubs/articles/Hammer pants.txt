Hammer pants are customized/modified baggy pants tapered at the ankle with a sagging rise made suitable for hip-hop dancing.  They were inspired by harem pants which originated in the Arabian Peninsula and introduced to Western fashion by Paul Poiret around 1910. They are frequently and mistakenly referred to as "parachute pants", which are tight-fitting, usually made of ripstop nylon, and have a multitude of zippers and pockets. Hammer pants were popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by rapper MC Hammer who would entertain/dance in them during live concerts and music videos.  Hammer's specialized clothing line would come in a variety of colors and were usually shiny and flashy-styled, as seen throughout his hip-hop career during talk show appearances, concerts, music videos and again on his own TV reality show in 2009 called Hammertime.
