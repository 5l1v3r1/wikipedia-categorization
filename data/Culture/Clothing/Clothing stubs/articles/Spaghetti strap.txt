A spaghetti strap (also called noodle strap) is a very thin shoulder strap used to support  clothing, while providing minimal shoulder straps over otherwise bare shoulders. It is commonly used in garments such as swimwear, camisoles, crop tops, bras, cocktail dresses, and evening gowns, so-named for its resemblance to the thin pasta strings called spaghetti.
