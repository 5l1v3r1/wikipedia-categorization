Pra Jiad (Thai: ประเจียด, RTGS: prachiat, pronounced [prā.t͡ɕìa̯t]) is a type of armband worn by Muay Thai athletes. In the past, their use was to give confidence and luck to the athletes, and was usually made by the fighter's close family member (mother, father, etc.).  Some fighters wear one Pra Jiad, some wear two.  Some schools also use color-coded pra jiads to show rank, similar to belts in karate.  Today, some gyms will give Pra Jiad to their athletes to boost their confidence.   Traditionally, pra jiads were kept in high or well reverend places, as it was thought that if someone stepped over it, or dropped it, it would lose its mystical power.
