The baguette is a small, compact handbag designed by Fendi in 1997. Made popular by its exposure on Sex and the City, the designer handbag was very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, often cited as the first "It" bag.  The Baguette concept was for a small, streamlined bag, carried on a short strap, that could be adapted for different looks, colors and textures while still having a consistent aesthetic.  It marked a contrast from many popular women's purses at the time, which were often large totes. Still relatively small and little-known, the Fendi Italian fashion brand agreed to lend the Baguette to HBO's Sex and the City, which was still a relatively new show that was fast growing in popularity. Sarah Jessica Parker has credited Fendi's loan of the bag with being central in establishing the show and her character Carrie Bradshaw, saying "Having Carrie wear the Baguette was a defining moment for us, and marked the beginning of everything. The timing was perfect for the story we were telling and the character I was playing; the Baguette was the perfect embellishment. Once Fendi loaned us items, everyone was more willing to do so, which helped us dramatically in conveying Carrieâ€™s decadence."  While the bag was already growing in popularity, its prominence on the show led to the bag's extreme popularity, as well as helping to establish SATC as a fashion-oriented show.
