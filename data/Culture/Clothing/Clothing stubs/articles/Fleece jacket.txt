A fleece jacket or simply a fleece is a lightweight casual jacket made of a polyester synthetic wool such as polar fleece. A fleece jacket will typically have a zipper up the middle, rather than buttons or other fasteners.  It will provide thermal insulation but is not normally weatherproof and so it will not effectively keep out wind and rain.
