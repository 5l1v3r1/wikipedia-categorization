Bahag is a loincloth that was commonly used throughout the Philippines before the arrival of European colonizers, and which is used by some indigenous tribes of the Philippines today - most notably the Cordillerans in Northern Luzon. It is basically a hand-loomed piece of long cloth that is wrapped around a man's middle. The design of the weave is often unique to the tribe of the person wearing the Bahag, much like the Celtic Tartans were. Modern bahags have since found their way to the lowlands as table runners, serviettes, and other decor and fashion accoutrements.
