Träskor are Swedish clogs. Swedish clogs are usually made from alder, but some times birch or pine is used.   Clogs are mainly manufactured in the southern part of the country, both as handicrafts and in factories.  In 1905 there were 22 factories employing 241 people.   One manufacturer is based in Vollsjö in Skåne, clogs for business use are therefore branded "Vollsjö slippers".  The most common model in Sweden is one with soles made of wood and uppers of leather.  Older models are usually entirely of wood, painted to mimic leather or are sometimes richly painted with floral motifs. Citations Bibliography
