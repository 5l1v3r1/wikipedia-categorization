Maciejówka (literally "Maciej's cap") is a type of headgear popular in late 19th and early 20th century Poland. It is a round, soft cap made of cloth, with a short hardened peak, usually made of black or brown leather, often adorned with a decorative rope or braid. Originally part of traditional folk attire in many regions of Poland, during World War I it became part of military uniform of Riflemen's Association and the Polish Legions.  After Poland regained her independence in 1918 it was proposed that maciejówkas become standard headgear of the Polish Army. However, it was argued that maciejówka resembles German World War I garrison caps too closely and eventually rogatywka was adopted instead.
