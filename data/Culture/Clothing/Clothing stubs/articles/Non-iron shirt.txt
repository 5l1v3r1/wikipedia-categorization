A non-iron shirt is a shirt which doesn't need ironing.  Typically, these are made from a fabric which has been treated with a resin to prevent creasing.  This treatment may release an irritant, formaldehyde, which can cause dermatitis.    To avoid this issue and improve the feel, gentler treatments have been developed using long-staple cotton to make a lighter and softer fabric.
