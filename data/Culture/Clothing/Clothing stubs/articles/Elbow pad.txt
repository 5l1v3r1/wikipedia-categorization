Elbow pads are protective padded gear worn on the elbows to protect them against injury during a fall or a strike. Elbow pads are worn by many athletes, especially hockey players, cyclists, roller skaters, skateboarders, volleyball players, skiers  and wrestlers.  Wrestlers sometimes use elbow pads as weapons by slapping their opponents, or take it off for an Atomic Elbow. Soldiers also often wear elbow pads.
