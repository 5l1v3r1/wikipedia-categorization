A godet (/ɡoʊˈdeɪ/ or /ɡoʊˈdɛt/)  is an extra piece of fabric in the shape of a circular sector which is set into a garment, usually a dress or skirt.  The addition of a godet causes the article of clothing in question to flare, thus adding width and volume.  Adding a godet to a piece of clothing also gives the wearer a wider range of motion.
