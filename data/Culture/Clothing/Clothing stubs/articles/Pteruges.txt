Pteruges (also spelled pteryges, from Greek, meaning feathers) refers to the decorative skirt of leather or fabric strips worn around the waists of Roman and Greek warriors and soldiers, as well as the similarly-fashioned epaulette-like strips worn on the shoulders or later, especially in the Middle East during the Middle Ages, the back of the helmets, in order to protect the neck while leaving it reasonably free to move.
