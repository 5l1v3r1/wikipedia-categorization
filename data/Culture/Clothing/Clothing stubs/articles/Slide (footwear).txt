A slide is a form of footwear different from shoes and similar to flip-flops. They are backless and open-toed, essentially an open-toed mule.  Generally, all slides are sandals.  Thongs and flip flops are normally classified separately.   Slides can be high-heeled, flat-heeled or somewhere in between, and may cover nearly the entire foot from ankle to toe, or may have only one or two narrow straps.  They usually include a single strap or a sequence of straps across the toes and the lower half of the foot to hold the shoe on the foot.  The term is descriptive in that this shoe is easy to 'slide' on and off the foot when the wearer wants to do so. Slides are currently trending because of the desire for a more comfortable shoe that still allows participation in activities and sports.
