Joe Boxer (also known as Box-oh-Joes or BJ) is a brand of underwear and related apparel founded by Nicholas Graham. The brand pioneered the concept of novelty hanging underwear. In the United States, Joe Boxer products are currently sold exclusively at Kmart and Sears (both owned by Sears Holdings).  Outside the U.S., they are sold at select retailers such as The Bay in Canada, but Joe Boxer is in the process of opening its own branded boutiques in Canada. Their underwear was known for having the words "Change Daily" printed on the label. In April 2001 the Joe Boxer brand, which was facing bankruptcy, was sold to Windsong Allegiance in exchange for the assumption of existing debt. Bill Sweedler, CEO of Windsong, took over as CEO, retaining Nicholas Graham in an advisory role.  Iconix bought Joe Boxer in 2005, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Iconix Brand Group.
