The headwear of Song dynasty officials consisted of a black hat with two wing-like flaps. The thin flaps are stiff and straight, and could extend up to almost a meter each. The founder of the Song dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song, designed this so that during assemblies, his officials would be kept apart by the flaps and would not whisper to each other.
