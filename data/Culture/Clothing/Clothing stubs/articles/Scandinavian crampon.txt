A Scandinavian crampon is a rubber contraption with small spikes underneath it. They are used to avoid sliding on slippery surfaces such as ice and snow. The crampons are attached to footwear with either rubber straps on the heel or on the toes that covers the whole sole. Not to be mistaken for crampons used for ice climbing. Crampons of this sort are commonly used in Scandinavia. These crampons are much smaller and are used in winter. Crampons are specially made for jogging and hiking. Shoes are available with spikes already fastened to the soles that serve the same function as crampons.  Crampons date back to the Vikings, from around 800AD till 1100AD. The crampons were found in the town of Ã–de in Medelpad, Sweden. It was examined in 1939. The crampon is located in the Government History Museum in Sweden.
