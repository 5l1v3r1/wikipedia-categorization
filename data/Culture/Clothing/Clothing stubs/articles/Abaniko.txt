An abaniko (from the Spanish word abanico, meaning fan) is a type of hand-held fan that originated from the Philippines. The abaniko, together with the baro't saya, is a part of a lady's attire. Various ways of using and holding the abaniko may convey different meanings. For example, an open abaniko that covers the chest area is a sign of modesty while rapid fan movements express the lady's displeasure.  Abaniko is also the name given to a striking blow, resembling a fanning motion, that is used in the martial art of Eskrima.  The word abaniko is from the Spanish abanico (a fan), a diminutive form of the Portuguese abano, and deriving ultimately from the Latin vannus (a winnowing fan), a word related to ventus (the wind).
