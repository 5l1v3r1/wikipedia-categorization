A selburose (Norwegian: [ˈseːlbʉˌruːsə]) is a knitted rose pattern from Selbu in Norway in the shape of a regular octagram. It is a traditional pattern used for winter clothing. Perhaps the most typical garment is the Selbu mitten, selbuvott. It may also be used as a design on lusekofte (sweaters). Marit Guldsetbrua Emstad (born 1841) from Selbu has been nicknamed "the mother of Selbustrikk" because she may have been the first who provided mitten Selburoses to Husfliden in Trondheim in 1897. She may have taken inspiration from old knitting patterns, wood carving and other crafts. Similar patterns are also found in older knitting pattern books from Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany in the 16th-18th century.  The municipal coat of arms of Selbu municipality, which was approved in 1991, shows three Selbu roses, defined as 24 sharp, black diamond collected in three rosettes, two of one against a silver background. Selburoses is probably the most commonly used knitting pattern in Norway, and is also used outside the country as a symbol of Norway and Norwegian folk art. The selburose can also be found in English knitting terms, where it can be known as a Selbu star or Norwegian star. Oil and gas company Statoil's new star logo from 2009 is reminiscent of a Selbu rose.  Also the Norwegian Husfliden has a colorful Selbu rose as their brand.
