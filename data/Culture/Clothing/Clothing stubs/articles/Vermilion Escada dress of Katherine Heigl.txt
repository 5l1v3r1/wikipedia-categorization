The vermilion Escada dress of Katherine Heigl refers to the vermilion red dress worn by Katherine Heigl at the 80th Academy Awards on February 24, 2008. Cosmopolitan magazine cited the dress as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time, saying, "From the blond curls and red lips down to the train of her Escada goddess gown, Katherine’s Old Hollywood style finalized her reputation as a sex bomb. We love the way she looked totally relaxed in the dress, as if she’d been wearing it to lounge around in all day and just happened to show up at the Academy Awards."
