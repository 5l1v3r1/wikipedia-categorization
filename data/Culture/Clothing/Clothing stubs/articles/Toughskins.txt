Toughskins are a line of clothing sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. which were primarily marketed for their durability. When launched, the line only consisted of children's jeans which were sold with the guarantee that children would grow out of them before the pants wore out. Toughskins had reinforced knees for longer wear; came in slim and regular sizes; and were a blend of Dacron Type 59 polyester, DuPont 420 nylon, and cotton. Sears eventually expanded the line to include corduroy jeans, denim jackets, and men's work clothes. Also mentioned in the song "Cool Kids" on the Chicago band Screeching Weasel's album Bark Like a Dog.
