Figaro is a popular gold or silver link chain design that incorporates a pattern of 2 or 3 small circular links with 1 elongated oval link.  The most notable figaro chains are manufactured in Italy. They are usually worn by men and are often adorned with pendants such as crosses and medallions. The name of the chain was widely used by Italian chainmakers inspired by the operas The Barber of Seville (by Gioachino Rossini) and The Marriage of Figaro (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). These operas were based on the plays The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro by Pierre Beaumarchais.
