Garanimals is an American line of children's related clothing separates, created by Seymour Lichtenstein in 1972 for Garan Incorporated. Each item of clothing features a hang-tag depicting one of several animal characters called Garanimals.  In February 2008 the brand was relaunched in the US, and is sold exclusively by Walmart, in its stores and online.  Garan is currently owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which also owns Fruit of the Loom.
