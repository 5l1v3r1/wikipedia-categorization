The Chesterfield is a long, tailored overcoat named after George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield, a leader of British fashion in the 1830s and 1840s.    The Chesterfield coat arose around 1840,  along with the lounge suit, as an alternative to the highly shaped coats it replaced, such as the frock overcoat with its heavy waist suppression using a waist seam. The Chesterfield has no horizontal seam or sidebodies, but can still be somewhat shaped using the side seams and darts. It can be single- or double-breasted, and has been popular in a wide variety of fabrics, typically heavier weight tweeds, or charcoal and navy, and even the camel hair classic. It has often been made with a velvet collar.  These variations make it extremely versatile, so it can be worn with a city suit or even semi-formal dress, as well as casual sports jackets.  It was a staple of smartly dressed men's wardrobes from the 1920s to 1960s, and has become a classic style for both men and women.
