A herigaut is a gown-like garment worn in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries.  Alternative spellings include herigald, heregaud, gerygoud and herigans.  It was three-quarters to full length with hanging sleeves.  Sometimes the sleeves were tucked at the top to increase fullness below.  Although it was primarily a men's garment, women occasionally wore it as well.  Along with the garnache, it is a variant of the garde-corps,  and it is also related to the houppelande.
