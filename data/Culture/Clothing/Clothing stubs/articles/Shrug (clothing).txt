A shrug is a cropped, cardigan-like garment with short or long sleeves cut in one with the body, typically knitted, usually for women.  Generally, a shrug covers less of the body than a vest would, but it is more tailored than a shawl.  Shrugs are typically worn as the outermost layer of an outfit, with a full shirt, tank top, or dress beneath. A shrug covers a small portion of the upper body.  Some shrugs are tied together just below the bustline.  Another style is cut off at the sides and thus little more than a pair of sleeves joined at the back. A bolero jacket or bolero (pronounced /bollero/) is a more formal garment of similar construction but made of stiffer fabric, essentially a short tailored jacket, inspired by the matador's chaquetilla. Like the shrug, the sides of the bolero only meet at one point.
