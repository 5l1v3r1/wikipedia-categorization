Clothes valet, also called men's valet, valet stand and suit stand, is an item of furniture on which clothes, particularly men's suits, may be hung.  Typical features of valets include trouser hangers, jacket hangers, shoe bars, and a tray organizer for miscellaneous, day-to-day objects like wallets and keys.  Some also feature jewelry boxes. An electric clothes valet is used to warm clothes before dressing; it includes a timer to prevent overheating. In the United States, the term is frequently used to refer to a non-freestanding cabinet or tray for holding small personal items such as watches, cuff links, keys, or a cell phone. In this sense, it is a men's jewelry box.
