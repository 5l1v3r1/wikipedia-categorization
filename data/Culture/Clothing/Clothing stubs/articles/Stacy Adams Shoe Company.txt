Morris Day, front man of the Minneapolis-based funk and soul band The Time, is known for his large collection of Stacy Adams shoes. He mentions the brand by name in The Time's 1982 song The Walk, from the album What Time Is It? (album): "I'm about to walk a hole in my Stacy Adams."  It was also used as a reference in Snoop Dogg's song " Stacy Adams " featuring Kokane in the album " The Last Meal " in 1999.  Tom Waits also references "my Stacy's are soaking wet" in his song Tom Traubert's Blues/Waltzing Matilda, from the album Small Change, released in 1976 by Asylum Records. Also on the album Nighthawks at the Diner, in the track Spare Parts, he has the lyrics " I wiped my Stacy Adams, and I jacknifed my legs".  The shoes are also mentioned in the AC Transit Bus fight. In the 2011 film Drive, the character played by Ryan Gosling is seen wearing what appear to be taupe-colored Stacy Adams Madison cap toe boots.
