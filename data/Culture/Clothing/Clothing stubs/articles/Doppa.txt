The Doppa ((in Uzbek)), a square or round skullcap originating in the Caucasus and worn by Kazan Tatars, Uyghurs, Tajiks, Uzbeks. The Doppa means hat in Uzbek but however a baseball hat is not called a "Doppa" normally.  The doppa is derived from a Turkic, more pointed, ancestral cap, which can be seen in some of the portraits of Jalaleddin Mingburnu.
