A Pashteen hat (Pashto: د پښتين خولۍ‎), Pashtun hat, or Mazari hat is a traditional hat originating from the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, worn in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  It typically has a red, black, and white design. It gained widespread popularity among the Pashtun people in 2018 during the rise to prominence of Manzoor Pashteen, the leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (Pashtun Protection Movement), who usually wears it at public rallies. It has traditionally been called a "Mazari cap" due to its origins in Mazar-i-Sharif, but since 2018 is more commony referred to as a "Pashteen cap". The hat has become the most iconic symbol of the Pashtun Protection Movement and Pashtun nationalism.
