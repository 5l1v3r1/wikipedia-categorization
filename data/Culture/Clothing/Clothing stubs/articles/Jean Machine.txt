   Jean Machine was a chain of British retail stores selling jeans. It was founded in 1971 by Tony Lonsdale, nicknamed the 'Blue Jean King'. He brought jeans over from California and, after initial resistance from wholesalers, set up shop on the King's Road. Lonsdale opened The Pant House in Hornton Street, Kensington, then The Rag Machine and The Jean Machine next door to each other at 161 and 163 King's Road, Chelsea, and another Pant House nearby. Jean Machine became successful across the UK,  where it  had more than 100 stores,.  Jean Machine was relaunched in London in December 2011 as a brand of men's jeans.
