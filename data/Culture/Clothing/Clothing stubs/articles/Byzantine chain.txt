A Byzantine chain is a metal link chain design used in jewellery that incorporates a rope-like texture and intriguing textural design. The chains are supple and flexible, draping gracefully about the neck. The origin of the name Byzantine is not known. The chain is a 4 in 1 chain meaning that each link passes through four others. It is a variation on the Box chain whose links point in a constant direction, unlike Byzantine whose links alternate in direction.  Aspect ratio is found by taking the inner diameter of the jump ring and dividing it by the diameter of the wire used to make the jump ring.   The pattern has also been called 'Etruscan', 'Birdcage', 'Fool's Dilemma', 'Idiot's Trap', 'Idiot's Delight', and 'Bird's Nest' but Byzantine is the most common name.
