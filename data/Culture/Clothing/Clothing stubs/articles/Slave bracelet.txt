Slave bracelet may refer to: Slave bracelets are a piece of jewelry associated with several cultures. As it refers to the hand adornment often worn by belly dancers or associated with harem jewelry, the slave bracelet or "hand chain" consists of a bracelet that attaches to a ring via a chain, bejeweled links, or other ornate hand connector along the back of the hand. They have been a popular accessory worn by members of the  Gothic subculture as well as those of the BDSM community, specifically Dom/Sub couples as a symbol of ownership between Master (BDSM) and Slave (BDSM).    Slave bracelets, or hand flowers, had been long popular before making their debut in the Western world. As it turns out, India is where the term “hand flower” originated: kamal is the Hindi word for the Lotus flower and refers to this hand ornament. It is literally translated from the Indian word “Hathphool”. The Hath phool originated as an ornamental piece of bridal jewellery, with five rings attaching to a bangle bracelet. The five rings each represented goddesses which would protect the bride’s family in times of need. Later, this changed to anywhere from one to three rings attached to a bracelet, and believed to represent the bonds of matrimony.
