Giveh or Givah (Persian: گیوه‎)(Kurdish:کڵاش)is a kind of soft, comfortable, durable and handwoven-top shoe common in several parts of Iran especially in rural and mountainous areas of Kermanshah Province. The production centers of Giveh are the two provinces of Yazd and Kermanshah in Iran.   Giveh is made up of two parts: sole and upper. The sole is usually rubber or leather the upper is woven thread. Before the arrival of rubber industry to the area, Giveh-makers would use a kind of wild-bull leather to make giveh and the upper was of wool or cotton thread. Most rich people would wear them. With the arrival of rubber industry, lower-class people have used rubber in the sole of their givehs.
