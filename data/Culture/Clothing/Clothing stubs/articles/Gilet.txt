A gilet (/dʒɪˈleɪ/) is a sleeveless jacket resembling a waistcoat or blouse.  Currently, a gilet is a sleeveless jacket or vest. They may be waist- to knee-length and are typically straight-sided rather than fitted. However, historically, they were fitted and embroidered.  In a further derivation, in 19th-century dressmaking a gilet was a dress bodice shaped like a man's waistcoat.  Today, gilets are often worn as an outer layer, for extra warmth outdoors. Fashion gilets may be made of cloth or fake fur, or knitted. Sports gilets are often windproof and/or made of fleece. High-end hiking jackets often have an integral gilet inside them, that can be zipped on and off. Racing cyclists use thin light gilets with a windproof front and mesh back. Shooting gilets are rugged and made of leather. Short, overwear gilets are called bodywarmers in the United Kingdom.
