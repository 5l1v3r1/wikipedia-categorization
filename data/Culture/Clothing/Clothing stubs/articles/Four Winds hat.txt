The Four Winds hat (in Northern Sami ƒçiehgahpir) is one version of traditional man's hat of the Sami. The basis is a simple blue cylinder, decorated with a red band with braid patterns, but the top is a large, four-cornered star, colored bright blue with parts bright red and yellow. The decoration in an actual Sami hat is, like the rest of the Sami costume, indicative of the person's place of origin or even his clan, much like the Scottish tartan. The hat was originally based on a Russian pattern learned in contact with Russians on the coast of the Barents Sea, but the top was exaggerated and the hat decorated with the traditional bright-colored embroidery to produce the Four Winds hat.
