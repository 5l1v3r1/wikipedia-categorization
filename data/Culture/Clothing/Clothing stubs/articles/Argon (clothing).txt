An Argon (also called Agon, Agrun or Parsa) is a traditional shawl-like garment worn by Hajong women in the Indian subcontinent, in modern-day India and Bangladesh.  It was a form of festive wear, worn during special occasions. Argons are shuttle-woven and characterized by large-scale, symmetrical patterns, featuring geometrical shapes and stylized leaves and flowers in colored silks and with or without gold and silver threads. Traditionally argons used to be very large in size and would have birds like herons, ducks and peacocks; and trees like kadamba tree brocaded on them. It can be worn by men during weddings or when attending religious ceremonies. Details of brocaded patterns on an argon. Women traditionally use the Argon to cover their left shoulder.
