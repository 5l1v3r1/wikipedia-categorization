Kate Winslet wore a red one-shoulder flower strap dress designed by Ben de Lisi at the 74th Academy Awards on March 24, 2002. The shoulder strap, composed of a garland of silk roses, was evocative of Spanish flamenco dancers.  In a poll by Debenhams published in The Daily Telegraph the dress was voted the 7th greatest red carpet gown of all time.  Cosmopolitan magazine cited the dress as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time, saying, "This dress is ultra-flattering on Kate, and it's a great color for her very fair skin and strawberry blond hair. The flowery, embroidered strap is a pretty detail that makes this simple gown fit for the red carpet".
