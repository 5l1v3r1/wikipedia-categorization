A gammura, (or sometimes a camora or camorra) was an Italian (particularly Florence) style of women's dress popular in the 15th and early 16th centuries. It consisted of a fitted bodice and full skirt worn over a camicia (a type of chemise). Early styles were front-laced, but the fashion later changed to side-laced styles.
