A kabney (Dzongkha: བཀབ་ནེ་; Wylie: bkab-ne) is a silk scarf worn as a part of the gho, the traditional male costume in Bhutan.  It is raw silk, normally 90 by 300 centimetres (35 in × 118 in) with fringes. Kabney is worn over the traditional coat gho; it runs from the left shoulder to the right hip, and are worn at special occasions or when visiting a dzong. Kabney is also referred as Bura which means silk. The use of gho and kabney is encouraged in Bhutan as a part of driglam namzha (or driklam namzhak), the official behaviour and dress code of Bhutan. Gho is thus compulsory for schoolboys and government officials.   The female traditional dress is called kira. A rachu is worn over the traditional dress kira.
