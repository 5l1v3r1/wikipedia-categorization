A ball dress is a uniform worn to balls. They often come in various colors. The top is generally a jacket with epaulettes and the trousers are formal trousers in a solid color. Shoes are often dress boots. Short evening gloves may or may not be worn. The length of the jacket may be thigh-length or have tapering tails at the back. White tie is generally worn to the most formal occasions, but there are times when males attending such occasions opt for ball dress.
