Battoulah (Arabic: البطولة; al-baṭṭūlah) is a mask traditionally worn by Muslim    Arab women in Arab states of the Persian Gulf, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar, as well as in southern Iran.  Origin of battoulah is unknown,  but its thought to have entered Eastern Arabian Peninsula from Gujarat in late 18th century.  The tradition is less popular with the newer generations, but is still used by women in their 50s and above 50, and by those living in rural areas.
