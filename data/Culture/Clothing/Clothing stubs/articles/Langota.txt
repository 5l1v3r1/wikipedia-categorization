Langota or Langoti is a traditional style of Indian loincloth for men. It was worn as underwear in dangal held in akharas. It is now mainly used by men when exercising and other intense physical games especially wrestling, to prevent hernias and hydrocele.  It is also called Kaupinam in sanskrit or kaupin in Hindi. The loincloth is about 3" wide and 24" long single piece of cotton cloth. It is first put between the legs and then wrapped around the waist very tightly.
