A Teba jacket is a soft, single-breasted jacket, unpadded throughout the chest and shoulders, and featuring shirt-like sleeves, ventless backs, and notchless lapels.  It was originally designed as a shooting blazer that would not make it difficult to raise the elbow when firing.  It was first tailored in Zarautz (Spain), and was named after the 22nd Earl of Teba, Carlos Alfonso Mitjans y Fitz-James Stuart, who was given a similar garment as a gift by Alfonso XIII during a Big-game driven hunt in Spain.  The Teba jacket has since been used not only as the utmost iconic piece of spanish countrywear  but also as a city outfit due to its popularity throughout the world.  The Earl of Teba, who was nicknamed "Bunting", was considered one of the finest shots in the World during his lifetime, and was a grand-nephew of the Empress of France, Eugenia de Montijo, as well as a direct descendant of James II via his maternal line, the Spanish House of FitzJames.
