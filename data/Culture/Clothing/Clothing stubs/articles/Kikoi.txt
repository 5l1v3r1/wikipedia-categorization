A kikoi is a traditional rectangle of woven cloth originating from Africa, particularly along the east coast as far south as the Horn of Africa. It is most commonly viewed a type of sarong.  As with all sarongs it is a single piece of cloth which is wrapped around the waist, and rolled over outwards a couple of times.  However, to the people native to that part of Africa, they are much more versatile and ubiquitous.  They can be used as a sling to hold a baby, towel, head wrap, etc.
