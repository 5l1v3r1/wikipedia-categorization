Xero Shoes are a type and brand of lightweight minimalist footwear manufactured by Feel the World Inc. in Boulder, Colorado.  Designed for walking , running and athletics , the footwear has thin and flexible soles that are contoured to the shape of the human foot.  A high-school sprinter, Steven Sashen got back into the sport after a 30-year break.  However, after two years of injury-prone competition, he joined a local barefoot running club in Boulder, CO at the suggestion of a friend who gave him a copy of Born To Run by Christopher McDougall.   As a result of running barefoot, his gait changed and injuries abated,  Sashen wanted to continue the barefoot experience in areas which required foot covering. So he developed his own modern huarache-style sandal similar to those worn by the Tarahumara Indians in Mexicoâ€™s Copper Canyon,  consisting of a thin rubber sole sourced from Vibram in Italy and nylon-polypropylene laces (this original style is now sold as the Xero Shoes "Cherry" in the classic kit).  After making the first pair for his wife Lena Phoenix and a second for himself, Sashen got requests from friends for their own minimalist sandals. Sashen launched a website selling this DIY sandal kit at invisibleshoe.com in late November, 2009. In August 2012, the company engaged Dennis Driscoll who has previously developed products for Avia, Crocs, Dr. Martens and Wilson Sporting Goods as a chief product officer, and renamed the brand Xero Shoes in December 2012.  It has since sold shoes and sandals in various styles and designs to customers in 94 countries.   The company has since moved from online-sales only to also channel marketing via select high street based North American retailers and Amazon.com, priced from $19.95 to $149.99.
