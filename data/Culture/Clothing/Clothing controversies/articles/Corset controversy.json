The controversy was contemporary with the time that corsets were popular in society. Corsets, variously called <i>a pair of bodys </i>or <i>stays</i>, were worn by European women from the late 16th century onward, changing their form as fashions changed. In spite of radical change to fashion geographically and temporally, the corset or some derivative beneath an outer gown would shape the body or provide structure.\n</p><p>\nThere were brief periods in which corsetry was not part of mainstream fashion. In the 1790s, there was an abrupt change to fashion as the <a href=\"/wiki/Empire_silhouette\" title=\"Empire silhouette\">Empire silhouette</a> became fashionable. During the following <a href=\"/wiki/Regency_era\" title=\"Regency era\">Regency era</a> the highly supportive corsets of the early <a href=\"/wiki/Georgian_era\" title=\"Georgian era\">Georgian era</a> were dismissed in favour of short garments worn primarily to support the breast and leave the waist and hips in their natural shape.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></p><div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Tight_lacing.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Tight_lacing.jpg/220px-Tight_lacing.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3d/Tight_lacing.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"409\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Tight_lacing.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"Tight Lacing, or Fashion before Ease\"</div></div></div>\n<p>Beginning in the mid-1820s, women's fashion returned to the full skirts of the prior century.

However, by the 19th century, women were writing letters to publications expressing their views directly and articulately. The one-sided denunciation of the past turned into a dialogue. Women made their voices heard, sharing their experiences and their opinions, some in favor of the corset and even tight lacing, and some in disfavor of the restrictive garment. Newspapers and popular journals became the media for the exchange of hundreds of letters and articles concerning the corset.\n</p><p>\nKnown as the \"corset controversy\" or simply the \"corset question\", the controversy spilled over multiple publications, multiple decades, and multiple countries. Of particular concern was the issue of tight lacing. The flow of articles and letters waxed and waned over time, reaching a crescendo in the late 1860s, which may be taken to be the peak of the frenzy<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

This I did, the firm defraying the cost, and I must confess that, though the waist-forming process was not pleasant at first, I was not a little proud of what was referred to as my beautiful figure. Nearly all the hands in the various ateliers and showrooms tight-laced. One girl, a pretty American who was much admired by customers and their male escorts, measured less than 17in over her dress. Several were barely sixteen, and it was to this latter size that I was told I should ultimately be required to reduce myself. I very soon got accustomed to the tight-lacing, and became as anxious as my employers that I should possess a fine figure, which the beautifully, though plainly, made dresses with which X\u2014et Cie. supplied me showed off to perfection.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Within a year of my coming to Paris I possessed the 16in waist desired by my employers, and was admittedly the finest figure in the showroom, in which I was chief model.

She made me put them on and said that she would lace them in herself. I did as she told me and I had to stand with the other girls employed in the establishment while she laced me in. I did not like it at first, standing in a row with my hair hanging down, waiting for the mistress to come and lace me in, but of course I soon got used to it as all the other girls had to do. I was never allowed to dress myself until the mistress had laced me in ...</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>One morning, I was sent for and found that three other girls besides myself had been called. We learned that we were to wear 16 inch corsets. At first I rebelled, but the mistress coaxed me ... When night came, I was glad, for I though I would be able to take the corsets off. Judge of my dismay when the mistress informed me that I would have to sleep in these corsets. Next morning as we stood in line, she measured our waist and told us we would have to continue sleeping in these corsets. Once a week, she said that we could be allowed to take them off. At last the time came for us to take them off and what a relief that was. In a short time, however, they were put back on again and laced in smaller than ever. ... At last, though, I got so that the sixteen inch corset would lace up tight and I knew I was a successful model.  ...</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Now I am proud of myself.

This is practically a steel corset, with a waist varying from about 14in to 16in. Into this the growing girl is compressed by force, the corset is shut tight and secured by a lock, the key being kept by the mother or whoever is responsible for the proceeding.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>It may be observed here that it is the usual practice for the heads of \"trying on\" departments in large dress-making and mantle-making establishments to require all girls engaged in \"trying on\" to enter one of these corsets, which is locked, and the key kept by the head. In the case of the growing girl, the object is to prevent the waist from growing as the rest of the body develops, and the idea is really only worthy of Chinese cruelty.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>In the case of the shop girl, the object is to \"preserve\" the figure precisely at the exact amount of compression which is supposed to I show off ladies' garments to the best advantage. In any case, the girl is confined in this way by the middle, night and day. She has to sleep in her \"little ease\" if she can, and the torture is such that at first even the shopgirl, worn out with the fatigues of the day, can hardly sleep for the pain.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Probably nothing can be done until all women are sufficiently sensible, to realize that there is no beauty in a wasp's waist, that the majority of men do not really care a bit about it, and that there is real danger in tight-lacing, but surely the dreadful events which have happened lately ought to do something to emancipate schoolgirls and debutantes from their perpetual imprisonment in locked corsets.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Bloomers_(clothing)\" title=\"Bloomers (clothing)\">bloomer dress</a> was a mid-century attempt at rational clothing for women. It attracted considerable ridicule in the press and relatively few adopters. Other attempts at dress reform fared no better.\n</p><p>Various dress reformers turned to the printing press. In 1873, <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_Stuart_Phelps_Ward\" title=\"Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward\">Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward</a> wrote:<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p> Burn up the corsets! ... No, nor do you save the whalebones, you will never need whalebones again. Make a bonfire of the cruel steels that have lorded it over your thorax and abdomens for so many years and heave a sigh of relief, for your emancipation I assure you, from this moment has begun.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Louisa_May_Alcott\" title=\"Louisa May Alcott\">Louisa May Alcott</a> devoted Chapter 18 (\"Fashion and Physiology\") of her 1875 young adult fiction, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Eight_Cousins\" title=\"Eight Cousins\">Eight Cousins</a></i>, to advocating for dress reform in the form of the \"freedom suit,\" which is described as being different from and more socially acceptable than bloomers. The young main character, Rose Campbell, is under the guardianship of her physician uncle Alec. However, her aunt Clara wishes Rose to dress appropriately to her position as an heiress, and one day gives her a fashionable outfit to try. Rose ultimately rejects it in favor of Alec's freedom suit, consisting of close-fitting pantaloons and shirt under a long-skirted petticoat and dress. Earlier in the novel, Rose had been wearing a tight belt to keep her waist small, which Alec insisted she stop doing for the sake of her health (Chapter 5, \"A Belt and a Box\"). When Clara tries to convince her to wear a corset, Alec is furious.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>He closed the door with a shrug, but before anyone could speak, his quick eye fell upon an object which caused him to frown, and demand in an indignant tone, \"After all I have said, were you really going to tempt my girl with those abominable things?\"</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\"I thought we put them away when she wouldn't wear them,\" murmured Mrs. Clara, whisking a little pair of corsets out of sight with guilty haste. \"I only brought them to try, for Rose is growing stout, and will have no figure if it is not attended to soon,\" she added, with an air of calm conviction that roused the Doctor still more, for this was one of his especial abominations.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\"Growing stout! Yes, thank Heaven, she is, and shall continue to do it, for Nature knows how to mold a woman better than any corset-maker, and I won't have her interfered with. My dear Clara, have you lost your senses that you can for a moment dream of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like this?\" and with a sudden gesture he plucked forth the offending corsets from under the sofa cushion, and held them out with the expression one would wear on beholding the thumbscrews or the rack of ancient times.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\"Don't be absurd, Alec. There is no torture about it, for tight lacing is out of fashion, and we have nice, sensible things nowadays. Everyone wears them; even babies have stiffened waists to support their weak little backs,\" began Mrs. Clara, rushing to the defense of the pet delusion of most women.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\"I know it, and so the poor little souls have weak backs all their days, as their mothers had before them. It is vain to argue the matter, and I won't try, but I wish to state, once for all, that if I ever see a pair of corsets near Rose, I'll put them in the fire, and you may send the bill to me.\"</dd></dl>\n<p>But dress reform had little mainstream impact. Fashion continued to emphasize the waist and, so long as it did, the corset continued to be regarded as an indispensable of dress. An unusually perceptive reformer described the situation in an address to the National Christian League in 1895. Her speech was reported in <i>The New York Times</i>:<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>WOMEN'S SLAVERY TO FASHION \u2013 She Admires Ideal Garments but will not Wear Them</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Mrs. Margaret Stanton Lawrence ... told of the artist who spent years in inventing a dress for woman that would be at once comfortable, convenient, and beautiful. Success crowned his efforts, but alas! who would invent the woman to wear this ideal garment! The dress was delightful, all women admitted, and filled every requirement, but \u2013 alas again for them! their husbands would not walk in the streets with the wearers of such a garb, their fashionable friends begged to be spared the visits of such unconventional creatures, and the clergymen in the churches asked that their congregations be not disturbed by thoughts of a woman's dress.</dd></dl>\n<p>It seemed that change would be glacially slow at best. A year later, <i>The New York Times</i> wrote:<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>FOR THE LIBERATED WOMEN; THOSE VALIANT ONES WHO WILL GIVE UP THE BINDING CORSET.

The leaven is working among women: Many have discarded them, many more, mothers, who feel that it is too late for them to change, are persuading their growing daughters to omit their adoption. ... Human nature is weak, very weak, when it comes to the question of personal appearance, and having for generations adopted the standard of a tapering waist as a mark of feminine beauty of figure, it is going to take character, perseverance, religion even to counteract this. ...</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\"One of the most pathetic speeches that I have listened to in a long time\", said a woman recently, \"was that made by a friend to me the other day.  We were discussing hygienic dress and the use of disuse of corsets.  I remarked casually and tritely that it took a good deal of moral courage to give them up. 'Moral courage!' she repeated, 'it takes wrestling with the Lord. There is no plea I have made oftener of my Heavenly Father than that He would give me strength to persevere in this thing'\".</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"End_of_the_controversy\">End of the controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corset_controversy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: End of the controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:HobbleSkirt.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/HobbleSkirt.jpg/220px-HobbleSkirt.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"420\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/HobbleSkirt.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"314\" data-file-height=\"600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:HobbleSkirt.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Hobble_skirt\" title=\"Hobble skirt\">Hobble skirt</a> circa 1912</div></div></div>\n<p>From 1908 to 1914, the fashionable narrow-hipped and narrow-skirted silhouette necessitated the lengthening of the corset at its lower edge. A new type of corset covered the thighs and changed the position of the hip, making the waist appear higher and wider.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Omorfio_49-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Omorfio-49\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> The new fashion was considered uncomfortable, cumbersome, and furthermore required the use of strips of elastic fabric. The development of rubberized elastic materials in 1911 helped the girdle replace the corset. This was the huge turnaround for the history of waist trainer.\n</p><p>The corset controversy changed in the early 20th century when the world of fashion circled back to styles reminiscent of the Empire silhouette. Fashionable dress was fluid and soft, with flowing lines. What rational dress reform was unable to accomplish in decades of rhetoric, the wheel of changing fashion brought about almost overnight. The waist became unimportant and the waist-restricting corset lost its significance.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Poiret\" title=\"Paul Poiret\">Paul Poiret</a> was a leader in this movement. He replaced the corset with the <a href=\"/wiki/Hobble_skirt\" title=\"Hobble skirt\">hobble skirt</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> which, while equally restrictive, was different and thus readily adopted in an era eager for change.<sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>  In his autobiography, Poiret wrote<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd>It was in the name of Liberty that I proclaimed the fall of the corset and the adoption of the brassiere, which since then, has won the day.
