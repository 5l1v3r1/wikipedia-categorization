   Camel toe, or cameltoe, is slang for the outline of a woman's labia majora in tightly fitting clothes.    Owing to a combination of anatomical factors and the tightness of the fabric covering the area, the crotch and mons pubis may display a shape resembling the forefoot of a camel. Camel toe commonly occurs as a result of wearing tight-fitting clothes, such as shorts, hotpants or swimwear.  The display of camel toes in public or in the media has caused controversy on a number of occasions.
