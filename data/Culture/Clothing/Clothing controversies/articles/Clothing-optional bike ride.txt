A clothing-optional bike ride is a cycling event in which nudity is permitted or expected. There are many clothing-optional cycling events around the world.  Some rides are political, recreational, artistic or a unique combination. Some are used to promote topfreedom, a social movement to accord women and girls the right to be topless in public where men and boys have that right. This event takes place around the World on "20th of June" each year. Body art (such as body painting) are common forms of creative expression, as well as costumes, art bikes, portable sound reinforcement systems (such as public address systems/bullhorns, and boomboxes), musical instruments as well as other types of noisemakers. Many of the political rides have their roots from Critical Mass and are often described or categorized as a form of political protest, street theatre, party-on-wheels, streaking, public nudity and clothing-optional recreation and thus attracts a wide range of participants. Full and partial (especially topfree) nudity is encouraged, but not mandatory, on all rides. Some people ride in their underwear. Topfreedom is allowed but full nudity is not allowed, or is discouraged: Known activists include Daniel Lorenz Johnson, Jennifer Moss, Simon Oosterman, Conrad Schmidt (WNBR founder) and Terri Sue Webb.
