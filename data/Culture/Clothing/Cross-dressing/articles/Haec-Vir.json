It appears to have been printed only once during the period. As a polemical riposte to Hic Mulier, it follows the outlines of the earlier pamphlet fairly closely.\n</p><p>The text opens with Haec-Vir, a dandy, mistaking the masculine Hic-Mulier for a knight. They clear up this mistake with a profusion of courtly language. Haec-Vir accuses the mannish woman of baseness, unnaturalness, shamefulness, and foolishness: he grounds his argument in traditional assumptions about social order and gender decorum. She replies, at first, with an argument for her own freedom as a human and for the relativism necessary in judging mutable customs. Her assertions, bolstered by quotations from <a href=\"/wiki/Martial\" title=\"Martial\">Martial</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Virgil\" title=\"Virgil\">Virgil</a>, among others, are not in themselves less traditional than Haec-Vir's; their application to the question of women's freedom, however, may be considered somewhat uncommon for the period. Haec-Vir replies by referring to <a href=\"/wiki/Deuteronomy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deuteronomy\">Deuteronomy</a>'s injunction against <a href=\"/wiki/Transvestism\" title=\"Transvestism\">transvestism</a>. This reference proves decisive as regards Hic-Mulier's early argument; however, she instantly attacks Haec-Vir for his own effeminacy\u2014a charge which, given his earlier attack, he cannot refute. The brief colloquy ends with their mutual resolution to return to normative gender standards for behavior.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Context\">Context</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Haec-Vir&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Context\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the last decade of <a href=\"/wiki/James_I_of_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"James I of England\">James I</a>'s reign, England appears to have witnessed a minor crisis of conscience over the issue of cross-dressing and other activities supposed to violate gender norms. It is possible that this crisis related to actual changes in behavior; <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Frith\" title=\"Mary Frith\">Mary Frith</a>, for instance, had recently achieved notoriety. However, such a trend in society has proven difficult to determine precisely.\n</p><p>What is clear is that a number of social and political developments made transvestism more threatening to . The perception of political corruption and homosexuality at court on the one hand, and the rising intolerance and vehemence of the <a href=\"/wiki/Puritan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puritan\">Puritans</a> on the other, contributed to a heavily polarized social scene in which tolerance or compromise became progressively more difficult. As regards women, scandals such as the murder of <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Overbury\" title=\"Thomas Overbury\">Thomas Overbury</a> revealed some women in a light that was conducive to misogynistic fears. As regards men, the long era of peace enforced by James's foreign policy was assumed to lead to \"soft\" men; there was, for some English people, a noted contrast between the delicate Jacobean courtier and the idealized martial courtier remembered from <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elizabeth I\">Elizabeth I</a>'s day. Finally, the promulgation of the Statutes of Apparel in 1574 may have served to remind some English people of the traditional limits on freedom of dress.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Haec-Vir&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/List_of_transgender-related_topics\" title=\"List of transgender-related topics\">List of transgender-related topics</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Haec-Vir&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://wiki.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/Haec_Vir_(1620)\">[1]</a> the full text of <i>Haec Vir</i></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://wiki.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/Hic_Mulier_(1620)\">[2]</a> the full text of <i>Hic Mulier</i></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1243\nCached time: 20180906014053\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.033 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 42/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.006/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 594 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   19.472      1 Template:Italic_title\n100.00%   19.472      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1459061-0!canonical and timestamp 20180906014053 and revision id 845060478\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"1620_in_England"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1620_books"},{"sortkey":"","*":"17th_century_in_LGBT_history"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Cross-dressing"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Feminism_in_England"},{"sortkey":"","*":"LGBT_history_in_England"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Pamphlets"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Demonstrative"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Deuteronomy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Effeminate"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Elizabeth I"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"England"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Feminism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gender role"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Grammatical gender"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hic Mulier"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ideal (ethics)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"James I of England"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Latin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"List of transgender-related topics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Martial"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mary Frith"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pamphlet"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Puritan"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Renaissance"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Thomas Overbury"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Transvestism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Transvestitism"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Virgil"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Women's rights"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://wiki.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/Haec_Vir_(1620)","http://wiki.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/Hic_Mulier_(1620)"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The work","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Haec-Vir","byteoffset":958,"anchor":"The_work"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Context","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Haec-Vir","byteoffset":2396,"anchor":"Context"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Haec-Vir","byteoffset":3792,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Haec-Vir","byteoffset":3849,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"<i>Haec-Vir</i>","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"displaytitle","*":"<i>Haec-Vir</i>"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5638149"}]}}
