The term en homme [ɑ̃nɔm] is an anglicized adaptation of a French phrase. It is used in the transgender and crossdressing community to describe the act of wearing masculine clothing or expressing a stereotypically masculine personality. The term is derived from the modern colloquial French phrase en tant qu'homme meaning "as a man" and the anglicized adaptation en homme  literally translates as "in man". Most crossdressers also use a homme (male) name whilst en homme.
