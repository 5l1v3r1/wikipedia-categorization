  Naked For A Cause is a charity initiative that aims at helping various causes, most notably cancer research. In 2008, a 19-month, 30-page limited edition wall calendar   was published spanning from October 2007 until April 2009 and includes 26 Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL) players  in nude and semi-nude artistic photographs. Proceeds from the calendar went to the McGrath Foundation, a charity supporting women living with breast cancer.  The artistic director and photographer was Pedro Virgil.  There are preparations underway for an issue for a new 2009-2010.
