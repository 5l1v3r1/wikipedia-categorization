Nude Before a Mirror (originally known as Nu devant la chemin√©e) is a 1955 painting by Polish-French artist Balthus.   The painting depicts a nude woman before a mirror, which is a typical subject for Balthus, a fact that caused controversy in his early career.    It is part of the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and was donated to the museum by art collector and banker Robert Lehman in 1975.
