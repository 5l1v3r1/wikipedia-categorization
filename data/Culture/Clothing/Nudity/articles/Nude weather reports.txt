Nude weather reports are weather reports performed in the nude, either on television or on radio, or in any other context.  Počasíčko (a diminutive of the Czech word for weather) is the name of a late-night weather report that ran on TV Nova in the Czech Republic. In this reverse strip tease, a model would appear in the nude and then gradually put on clothes appropriate for the next day's weather forecast. The programme aired for some time during 2002 and was then discontinued. It has resumed (in a reversed format, i.e., with "regular" strip-tease) on 1 February 2007.  Radio Tango in Norway was the world's first radio channel to broadcast nude weather reports, simultaneously providing a glimpse of the nude reporter on its web site.
