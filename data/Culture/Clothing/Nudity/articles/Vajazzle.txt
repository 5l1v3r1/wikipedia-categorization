A vajazzle (also spelled vagazzle) is a form of genital decoration, formed by the application of crystal ornaments on the shaved mons pubis of a woman. The process is known as vajazzling, a portmanteau of "vagina" and "bedazzle". The phenomenon was popularized by actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, who devoted a chapter in her book The Day I Shot Cupid to vajazzling.  During a promotional interview on a US talk show in January 2010, she encouraged the female members of her audience "to vajazzle their vajayjays".  Vajazzle became the most searched term on Google for the following day.  In the United Kingdom the concept was popularised when beautician Amy Childs appeared in the television show The Only Way Is Essex in 2010.  By 2011 an Internet rating site for vajazzling called Rate My Vajazzle had been set up.   Vajazzling can increase risks of infection if not properly cleaned.
