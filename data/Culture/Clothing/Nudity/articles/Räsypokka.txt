RÃ¤sypokka was a game show broadcast on the SubTV network in Finland from 2001 to 2003.  The show was hosted by Jaajo Linnonmaa. The title (literally "threads poker") stands for strip poker and sums up the content of the show, which often featured full-frontal nudity.  Two males and two females competed on each episode. Several episodes were filmed live at bars and dance clubs.
