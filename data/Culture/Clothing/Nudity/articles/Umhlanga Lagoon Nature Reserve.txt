Umhlanga lagoon is a 26 hectares (64 acres) nature reserve on the shore of the Indian Ocean at Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa.  The reserve encloses the Ohlanga River's lagoon and mouth.  The forest forms a natural extension of the less accessible Hawaan Forest, of which the greater part lies inland of the busy M4 road. The reserve trails start at a car park at the northern end of Lagoon Drive, Umhlanga. The reserve has picnic sites, the remains of a prehistoric shell midden  and walking trails,  with a walkway and pedestrian bridge that span the lagoon. At the mouth of the Ohlanga lagoon there is a popular but unofficial nudist beach.    Increased use of the area by non-nudist walkers and families resulted in complaints about nudism and antisocial behaviour.  The area was at one time a ‘no-go’ area, due to a serious crime problem.  The use of this area by naturists is under threat as the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality is planning a clamp down on nudity in Durban.
