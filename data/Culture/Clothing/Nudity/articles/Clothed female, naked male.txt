Clothed female, naked male (CFNM), or clothed male, naked female, is a genre of erotica based on the real or imagined interaction of one or more nude men and one or more clothed women.  It is sometimes a sexual fantasy of women or men, depicting an  exhibitionist or physique worship scenario. CFNM situations can arise in situations where a male disrobes as part of a male striptease, a medical examination, as a figure model for art students, or is forced to remove clothing as  a punitive measure. In pornography or erotic writing, CFNM depicts a power exchange where the more traditionally dominant male is objectified, debased, or humiliated by a more traditionally submissive female. As a result, CFNM fiction frequently includes the clothed female taking on the role of a dominatrix over the nude male. The opposite of CFNM is clothed male, naked female (CMNF). In classical antiquity, the portrayal of nude male form in art (including the exposure of genitals) was considered to be more acceptable than that of the naked female form. By the renaissance, this view had reversed.  For example, in Titian's treatment of Perseus and Andromeda in the mid-1550s, it is Andromeda who is nude—save for the barest wisp of fabric—while Perseus is clothed in armour. Depictions of nudity were acceptable to the 19th-century French salon culture if the setting was clearly "classical", depicting characters in a culture where nudity was commonplace, as in Combat de coqs (1847) by Jean-Léon Gérôme. Feminist authors Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf have written that women's sexual liberation has led many women to a role reversal, whereby they view men as sex objects,    in a manner similar to what they criticize in men's treatment of women.
