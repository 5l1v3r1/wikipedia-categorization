A search for it began in 2004 by the Academy Archive's Documentary Curator, Ed Carter. After a series of letters and dead ends, Carter received a print from the film's Director of Photography, Michael Elphick, who obtained the print from a television station. The print turned out to be a 35mm Technicolor print in pristine condition. The Academy Film Archive restored the film in 2012.
