This is a list of social nudity places in South America used for recreation. This list includes topfree beaches, clothing-optional beaches (or nude beaches) and some resorts. Topfree beaches allow women to sunbathe without a bikini top or other clothing above the waist. Clothing-optional beaches allow either sex to sunbathe with or without clothing above or below the waist.  A nude beach may also be an obligatory nude area, which means that both sexes are obliged to go without clothing above as well as below the waist. Public nudity is a misdemeanor in Brazil, except in places officially designated by the local authority. Note: Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro is not a nude beach, despite its depiction as such in the 1984 motion picture Blame It on Rio. Unlike public beaches, these are private property which admits the public.
