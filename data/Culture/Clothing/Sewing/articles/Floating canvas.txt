Floating canvas, or full canvas is a term used by tailors to describe the cloth-construction inside a jacket or coat. It typically consists of horsehair, and often combined with cotton, wool or synthetics, which has been woven, which is then sewn together.   . The canvassing is sewn in between the fabric of the jacket and the jacket lining. The purpose of the canvassing is to provide structural support for the jacket to ensure it drapes properly and so that it continues to maintain shape over time.
