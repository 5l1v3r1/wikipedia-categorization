Interfacing is a textile used on the unseen or "wrong" side of fabrics to make an area of a garment more rigid. Interfacings can be used to:   Interfacings come in a variety of weights and stiffnesses to suit different purposes. They are also available in different colours,  although typically interfacing is white. Generally, the heavier weight a fabric is, the heavier weight an interfacing it will use. Interfacing is sold at fabric stores by the yard or metre from bolts, similar to cutting fabric. Sewing patterns specify if interfacing is needed, the weight of interfacing that is required, and the amount. Some patterns use the same fabric as the garment to create an interfacing, as with sheer fabrics.  Most modern interfacings have heat-activated adhesive on one side.  They are affixed to a garment piece using heat and moderate pressure, from a hand iron for example.  This type of interfacing is known as "fusible" interfacing.  Non-fusible interfacings do not have adhesive and must be sewn by hand or machine.
