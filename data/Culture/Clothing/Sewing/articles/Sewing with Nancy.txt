Sewing with Nancy was an American television show about sewing, hosted by Nancy Zieman.  It made its debut on the now-defunct Satellite Program Network (SPN, later Tempo Television) in September 1982.  On September 1, 1982, PBS began airing the series, which was distributed by NETA. As of 2011, the show aired on 89% of Public Television stations in the United States.  It was the longest-running sewing series in the history of North American television.  Sewing with Nancy was co-produced by Wisconsin Public Television  at Vilas Hall on the University of Wisconsin campus in Madison. Zieman had Bell's palsy, a one-sided facial nerve paralysis, and talked about the condition on an episode in 2011.  On September 5, 2017, Zieman announced her retirement due to cancer;  she died just over two months later, the day after the final episode was broadcast.  Older episodes continue to be broadcast on PBS under the name The Best of Sewing with Nancy.
