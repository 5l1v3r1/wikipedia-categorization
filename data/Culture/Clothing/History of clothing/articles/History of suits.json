For some four hundred years, suits of matching coat, trousers, and waistcoat have been in and out of fashion. The modern lounge suit's derivation is visible in the outline of the brightly coloured, elaborately crafted <a href=\"/wiki/Court_uniform_and_dress_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom\">royal court dress</a> of the 17th century (suit, wig, knee breeches), which was shed because of the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Revolution\" title=\"French Revolution\">French Revolution</a>.  This evolution is seen more recently in British tailoring's use of steam and padding in moulding <a href=\"/wiki/Wool\" title=\"Wool\">woolen</a> cloth, the rise and fall in popularity of the <a href=\"/wiki/Necktie\" title=\"Necktie\">necktie</a>, and the gradual disuse of waistcoats and hats in the last fifty years.\n</p><p>The modern lounge suit appeared in the late 19th century, but traces its origins to the simplified, sartorial standard of dress established by the English king <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_II_of_England\" title=\"Charles II of England\">Charles II</a> in the 17th century. In 1666, the restored monarch, Charles II, per the example of King <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France\" title=\"Louis XIV of France\">Louis XIV</a>'s court at <a href=\"/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles\" title=\"Palace of Versailles\">Versailles</a>, decreed that in the English Court men would wear a long coat, a waistcoat (then called a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Petticoat\" title=\"Petticoat\">petticoat</a>\"), a <a href=\"/wiki/Cravat\" title=\"Cravat\">cravat</a> (a precursor of the necktie), a <a href=\"/wiki/Wig_(hair)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wig (hair)\">wig</a>, knee <a href=\"/wiki/Breeches\" title=\"Breeches\">breeches</a> (trousers), and a hat. However, the paintings of <a href=\"/wiki/Jan_Steen\" title=\"Jan Steen\">Jan Steen</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder\" title=\"Pieter Bruegel the Elder\">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a>, and other painters of the Dutch Golden Era reveal that such an arrangement was already used informally in Holland, if not Western Europe as a whole. Many of Steen's genre paintings include men dressed in hip-length or frock coats with shirt and trousers, which in fact more closely resemble modern suit designs than the contemporary British standard.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regency\">Regency</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_suits&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Regency\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the early 19th century, British <a href=\"/wiki/Dandy\" title=\"Dandy\">dandy</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Beau_Brummell\" title=\"Beau Brummell\">Beau Brummell</a> redefined, adapted, and popularized the style of the British court, leading <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">European</a> men to wearing well-cut, tailored clothes, adorned with carefully knotted neckties. The simplicity of the new clothes and their somber colors contrasted strongly with the extravagant, <a href=\"/wiki/Fop\" title=\"Fop\">foppish</a> styles just before. Brummell's influence introduced the modern era of men's clothing which now includes the modern suit and necktie. Moreover, he introduced a whole new era of grooming and style, including regular (daily) bathing as part of a man's toilette. However, paintings of French men from 1794 onwards reveal that Brummel might only have adopted and popularized post-revolutionary French suits, which included tail coat, double-breasted waistcoat and full-length trousers with either <a href=\"/wiki/Hessian_(boot)\" title=\"Hessian (boot)\">Hessian boots</a> or regular-size shoes. There is no 18th-century painting of Brummel to establish his innovation. <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In this <a href=\"/wiki/British_Regency\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British Regency\">regency</a> period, the predominant upper-class clothing introduced by Brummell for day wear was a tightly fitting, dark coloured tailcoat with non-matching (usually pale) trousers, pale waistcoat, white shirt and cravat and tall boots.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Victorian\">Victorian</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_suits&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Victorian\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Towards the start of the <a href=\"/wiki/Victorian_era\" title=\"Victorian era\">Victorian period</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Frock_coat\" title=\"Frock coat\">frock coat</a>, initially not just black, became popular, and quickly became the standard daily clothing for gentlemen.  From the middle of the 19th century, a new (then informal) coat, the <a href=\"/wiki/Morning_coat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Morning coat\">morning coat</a>, became acceptable.  It was a less formal garment, with a cut away front, making it suitable for wearing while riding. Morning dress and the frock coat garments were not suits, because they were worn with trousers that didn't match in color or fabric; a matching waistcoat and trousers were considered informal and could be described using the short-lived term <b>ditto suit</b>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  The frock coat was still the standard garment for all formal or business occasions, and a tailcoat was worn in the evenings.\n</p><p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the modern lounge suit was born as a very informal garment meant only to be worn for sports, in the country, or at the seaside.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Men_in_black_tie.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Men_in_black_tie.jpg/220px-Men_in_black_tie.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Men_in_black_tie.jpg/330px-Men_in_black_tie.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Men_in_black_tie.jpg/440px-Men_in_black_tie.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1152\" data-file-height=\"768\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Men_in_black_tie.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Three men in 2006 wearing black tie variations.</div></div></div>\n<p>Parallel to this, the dinner jacket was invented and came to be worn for informal evening events. It was descended from <a href=\"/wiki/White_tie\" title=\"White tie\">white tie</a> (the dress code associated with the evening tailcoat) but quickly became a full new garment, the dinner jacket, with a new dress code, initially known as 'dress lounge' and later <a href=\"/wiki/Black_tie\" title=\"Black tie\">black tie</a>. When it was imported to the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, it became known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Tuxedo\" title=\"Tuxedo\">tuxedo</a>. The 'dress lounge' was originally worn only for small private gatherings and <a href=\"/wiki/White_tie\" title=\"White tie\">white tie</a> ('White tie and tails') was still worn for large formal events. The 'dress lounge' slowly became more popular for larger events as an alternative to full evening dress in white tie.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edwardian\">Edwardian</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_suits&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Edwardian\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Morning_dress_1901.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Morning_dress_1901.jpg/220px-Morning_dress_1901.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"537\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Morning_dress_1901.jpg/330px-Morning_dress_1901.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Morning_dress_1901.jpg/440px-Morning_dress_1901.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1271\" data-file-height=\"3105\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Morning_dress_1901.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>1901, a man in a morning coat.</div></div></div>\n<p>The beginning of the <a href=\"/wiki/Edwardian_era\" title=\"Edwardian era\">Edwardian era</a> in the early 20th century brought a steady decline in the wearing of <a href=\"/wiki/Frock_coat\" title=\"Frock coat\">frock coats</a> as the morning coat rose in relative formality, first becoming acceptable for businessmen, then becoming standard dress even in town.  The lounge suit was slowly accepted as being correct outside its original settings, and during Edwardian times gradually began to be seen in town.

Long coats quickly went out of fashion for everyday wear and business, and the morning coat gained its current classification of \"formal\". During the 1920s, short suits were always worn except on formal occasions in the daytime, when a morning coat would be worn. Older, more conservative men continued to wear a frock coat, or \"Prince Albert coat\" as it was known. \n</p><p>In North America, for evening occasions, the short dinner jacket virtually replaced the long \"full dress\" tails, which was perceived as \"old hat\" and was only worn by old conservative men.  In Britain, black tie became acceptable as a general informal alternative to white tie, though at the time the style and accessories of black tie were still very fluid.\n</p><p>In the 1920s men began wearing wide, straight-legged trousers with their suits. These trousers normally measured 23&#160;inches around the cuff. Younger men often wore even wider-legged trousers which were known as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_bags\" title=\"Oxford bags\">Oxford bags</a>.\" Trousers also began to be worn cuffed shortly after World War I and this style persisted until World War II. Trousers first began to be worn creased in the 1920s. Trousers were  worn very highly waisted throughout the 1920s and this fashion remained in vogue until the 1940s. Single-breasted suits were in style throughout the 1920s and the <a href=\"/wiki/Double-breasted\" title=\"Double-breasted\">double-breasted</a> suit was mainly worn by older more conservative men. In the 1920s, very fashionable men would often wear double-breasted waistcoats (with four buttons on each side) with single-breasted coats. Lapels on single-breasted suits were fashionably worn peaked and were often wide.  In the early 1930s these styles continued and were often even further exaggerated.\n</p><p>Before 1935 (and again in the 1970s) men preferred snugly tailored coats and waistcoats. In 1935, a complete change in style occurred. Loose fitting coats were introduced, trousers began to be tapered at the bottom and suit coats began to have tapered arms. These new trends were only reluctantly accepted by men at first. At first the waistcoat continued to be made in the traditional fitted and snug style. By 1940, the waistcoat began to be made in a loose style which made it uncomfortable to wear. In fashion magazines of the day, men complained how these new vests continually rode up when they happen to sit down or bend over. Fashionable men changed their preference to the double-breasted suit coat at this time and it would remain in fashion for the next two decades.\n</p><p>By this time, morning dress was being replaced by day time semi-formal, known in North America as the <a href=\"/wiki/Stroller_(style)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stroller (style)\">stroller</a>.  This was quite popular, but has actually been outlived by the morning coat. Since the 1950s it has been used as a black version of the lounge suit as an informal look to the dinner jacket.  In modern times the black lounge suit has become popular to wear during the day.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Post-war\">Post-war</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_suits&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Post-war\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Reflecting the democratization of wealth and larger trend toward simplification in the decades following the <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">Second World War</a>, the suit was standardized and streamlined. Suit coats were cut as straight as possible without any indication of a waistline, and by the 1960s the lapel had become narrower than at any time prior. Cloth rationing during the war had forced significant changes in style, contributing to a large reduction in the popularity of cuts such as the double-breasted suit.\n</p><p>The <i>New York Times Style Magazine</i> explains one iconic suit of the era, the gray flannel suit:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in 1955, when denim was the height of rebelliousness, Sloan Wilson's novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Gray_Flannel_Suit_(novel)\" title=\"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (novel)\">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a></i> turned a men's classic into a synonym for drab, middle-class conformity . . . Flannel had humble beginnings \u2014 the name is reputedly derived from \"gwlanen,\" Welsh for woolen cloth \u2014 and was used for underwear in the 19th century. In the 1880s white flannel was worn for summer sports; by the 1920s the more seasonless gray had become a favorite. When the Prince of Wales wore gray flannel trousers on his 1924 trip to America, they were aped by collegiates on both sides of the Atlantic. Cary Grant and Fred Astaire then carried the trend through to the 1940s. The archetypal square of the postwar era was later described by Esquire's style encyclopedia as <i>a neat, circumspect, conservative man who carried an attach\u00e9 case and regarded a pink button-down shirt as his one sartorial fling.</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s the <a href=\"/wiki/Nehru_jacket\" title=\"Nehru jacket\">Nehru jacket</a>, an Indian style featuring a mandarin collar, was introduced by entertainers such as <a href=\"/wiki/Johnny_Carson\" title=\"Johnny Carson\">Johnny Carson</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"The Beatles\">The Beatles</a>, and saw a brief surge in popularity across Western Europe and the United States.\n</p><p>In the 1970s, a snug-fitting suit coat became popular once again, also encouraging the return of the waistcoat. This new three-piece style became closely associated with <a href=\"/wiki/Nightclub#1970s:_Disco\" title=\"Nightclub\">disco</a> culture, and was specifically popularized by the film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Saturday_Night_Fever\" title=\"Saturday Night Fever\">Saturday Night Fever</a></i>. Fashion brands such Haggar meanwhile started to introduce the concept of \"suit separates\", a production innovation that reduced the need for excessive customization.\n</p><p>The 1980s saw a trend towards the simplification of the suit once again. The jacket became looser and the waistcoat was completely dispensed with. A few suit makers continued to make waistcoats, but these tended to be cut low and often had only four buttons. The waistline on the suit coat moved down again in the 1980s to a position well below the waist. By 1985-1986, three-piece suits were on the way out and making way for cut <a href=\"/wiki/Double-breasted\" title=\"Double-breasted\">double-breasted</a> and two-piece <a href=\"/wiki/Single-breasted\" title=\"Single-breasted\">single-breasted</a> suits.\n</p><p>The late 1990s saw the return to popularity of the three-button two-piece suit, which then went back out of fashion some time in the first decade of the twenty-first century.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Women.27s_suits\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Women's_suits\">Women's suits</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_suits&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Women&#039;s suits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Walking_suites_1894_Delineator.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Walking_suites_1894_Delineator.jpg/220px-Walking_suites_1894_Delineator.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"291\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Walking_suites_1894_Delineator.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"228\" data-file-height=\"302\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Walking_suites_1894_Delineator.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Women's walking suits, 1894, from the <a href=\"/wiki/Ebenezer_Butterick\" title=\"Ebenezer Butterick\">Butterick</a> pattern company's <i>Delineator</i></div></div></div> \t\n<p>The earliest women's suits were <a href=\"/wiki/Riding_habit\" title=\"Riding habit\">riding habits</a>, which consisted of a tailored coat or jacket and matching <a href=\"/wiki/Skirt\" title=\"Skirt\">skirt</a> from the 1660s.
