Frock Me! is an exhibition that specialises in vintage fashion. Frock Me! was created in 2004 and takes place in Chelsea, London and in Brighton, East Sussex. Frock Me! has been influential on modern fashion trends with many buyers from High Street fashion stores sourcing inspiration for their designs and patterns from this event. The name Frock Me! was coined by founder Matthew Adams who studied theatrical costume design at Central School of Art.
