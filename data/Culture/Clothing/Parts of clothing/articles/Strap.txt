A strap, sometimes also called strop, is an elongated flap or ribbon, usually of fabric or leather. Thin straps are used as part of clothing or baggage, or bedding such as a sleeping bag. See for example spaghetti strap, shoulder strap. A strap differs from a belt mainly in that a strap is usually integral to the item of clothing; either can be used in combination with buckles. Straps are also used as fasteners to attach and bind items, to objects, animals (for example a saddle on a horse) and people (for example a watch on a wrist), or even to tie down people and animals, as on an apparatus for corporal punishment. Occasionally a strap is specified after what it binds or holds, e.g. chin strap.   Mere two-inch-wide nylon vehicle tow/recovery straps are commonly rated at 20,000 lbs. break strength.   Webbing is a particular type of strap that is a strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube that is also often used in place of rope. Modern webbing is typically made from exceptionally high-strength material, and is used in automobile seat belts, furniture manufacturing, transportation, towing, military apparel, cargo fasteners, and many other fields.  Strap is commonly used in the packaging industry to secure or fasten items. It may be made from a wide range of materials, such as plastic, steel, paper, or fabric. Usually the strap is secured to itself through various means, but it may also be secured to other items, such as pallets.
