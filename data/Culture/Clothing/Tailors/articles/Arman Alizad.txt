Arman Alizad (born 12 January 1971) is an Iranian-Finnish master tailor, fashion columnist and a TV-personality. He is best known for the martial arts series Kill Arman, which is currently airing in over 100 countries around the world. Alizad has also hosted several other Finnish TV-series, such as Dresscode, Unisex, Loman Tarpeessa and Arman Reilaa. Alizad was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1971. When the Islamic revolution started in 1979, his family first escaped to United States and eventually Finland where his grandparents had been living and he has lived there ever since. He was active as a child and enjoyed such activities as Skateboarding and Football. Alizad graduated from a basic tailoring school in 1992, and became an apprentice to master tailor Jouni Korhonen. Alizad passed the master tailor's test in 1997. Alizad co-owns the Finnish Pukustudio clothing company with Sonja Raassina, who is also one of the last remaining master tailors in Finland. Alizad started his TV-career with the fashion show Dresscode in 2001. Since then he has done another fashion show (Unisex), two travel shows (Loman Tarpeessa, Arman Reilaa), and one martial arts TV-series, Kill Arman. His more recent series are Arman ja viimeinen ristiretki and Arman pohjantähden alla. In Viimeinen ristiretki (lit. Last crusade), Arman visits people and places that are completely outside western culture. In Pohjantähden alla (lit. Under the pole star) he travels inside Finland to show things that others close their eyes from. In 2009, Kill Arman made a distribution deal with the British TV-distribution company DRG.
