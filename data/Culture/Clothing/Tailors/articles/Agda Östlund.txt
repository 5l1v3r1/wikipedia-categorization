Agda Östlund, née Lundgren (3 April 1870 – 26 June 1942) was a Swedish Politician of the Social Democrats. She was among the first women to be elected to the Swedish parliament. Agda Östlund was born in a working class home in Köping. Her family was politically aware and encouraged her to be so as well, and her mother made sure that her brothers took as much part in the household chores as Agda. She trained and supported herself as a seamstress, and eventually founded her own studio with several employees. She married Anders Östlund and moved to Stockholm in 1896. Östlund was active in the Stockholms allmänna kvinnoklubb (The Stockholm Public Women's Society) from 1903, where she became chairman. She was also active within Social Democratic Women in Sweden, where she served as chairman in its executive committee in 1911-1917. Östlund was active in the struggle for women suffrage and made many nationwide journeys to speak in its favour. In 1921, Agda Östlund became one of the five first women to be elected to the Swedish Parliament after women suffrage alongside Nelly Thüring (Social Democrat), Bertha Wellin (Conservative) and Elisabeth Tamm (liberal) in the Lower chamber, and Kerstin Hesselgren in the Upper chamber. Östlund remained in the Parliament until 1940. In parliament, Agda Östlund became the first woman to speak in the Swedish Second Chamber. She was also the first of her gender to be appointed member of the Parliament's Legislative Committee as a representative of her party. Östlund engaged in the question of spousal abuse, women's pension and medical care for women and children. She also raised the question of abortion, during which several MPs left the room in protest. Agda Östlund was regarded as a representative and role model for many working class women. Asked where she was given the courage to involve in politics, she answered: "When you truly want something, you are given courage".
