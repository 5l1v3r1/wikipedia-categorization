Maurice Sedwell is a British clothing company established on Fleet Street in 1938. The company moved to 9 Savile Row in 1963. In 1988, Maurice Sedwell was purchased from the retiring Maurice Sedwell by Andrew Ramroop, a long-standing employee. The business thrived in the 1980s and 1990s with a client list that included Lords, politicians, and even a member of the royal family. In 1994 the business moved again to a larger lot at 19 Savile Row.  In 2008, Andrew Ramroop opened The Savile Row Academy, the only professionally-staffed school on Savile Row.
