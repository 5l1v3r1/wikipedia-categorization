Paul Stuart is a men's and women's clothing brand. It was founded in 1938 in New York City  by haberdasher Ralph Ostrove, who named the company after his son, Paul Stuart Ostrove. Brooks Brothers, J. Press, and Ralph Lauren are competing brands with a similar style. The company was helmed by the legendary merchant and CEO Clifford Grodd from 1958 until his death in 2010. The retailer remained a privately-held family business until December 2012, when it was sold to its long-time Japanese partners, Mitsui. In fall 2007, Paul Stuart launched its Phineas Cole range, and in spring 2009, it opened a 700-square-foot (65 m2) Phineas Cole shop-in-shop at the front corner of the flagship Madison Avenue store. The company operates locations in the United States and Japan. The original New York City store is still located at the corner of Madison Avenue and 45th Street. It has grown to 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) and remains the company's largest store. A store in Washington, D.C. opened in spring 2015. In the fall of 2008, Paul Stuart relocated its Chicago store from the John Hancock Center on Michigan Avenue to Oak Street. In the spring of 2011, Paul Stuart opened a second Chicago location in The Loop, at the corner of LaSalle Street and Adams Street in the historic Continental and Commercial National Bank building.
