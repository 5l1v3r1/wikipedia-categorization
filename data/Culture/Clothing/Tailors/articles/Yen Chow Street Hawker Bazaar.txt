  The Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar (Chinese: 欽州街小販市場), also known as Pang Jai (棚仔), is a covered market located at the intersection of Yen Chow Street and Lai Chi Kok Road in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. The market is known for selling fabrics, textiles, and other fashion-related paraphernalia. The market has been popular with craft enthusiasts, design students, and professionals in the fashion industry for decades.   The market was established in 1978.   In 1981, the government decided to repurpose the site for residential use.  The issue of the rezoning was discussed by the Sham Shui Po District Council in 2005.  In August 2016, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department issued a notice to the tenants of the market that the government intended to close the site to make way for a public housing development.  The government proposed that the current licensed tenants be moved to the Tung Chau Street Temporary Market.  Alternatively, the government would buy back the licence from the licence holders for HK$80000, well below the usual market price of HK$120000.
