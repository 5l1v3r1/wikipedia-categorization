Beno Dorn was a Polish-English master tailor known for providing the Beatles with their first suits out of his shop in Birkenhead, England,    suits that are often mentioned as part of the rebranding that contributed to their breakthrough in 1962.   He received two White Rose Provincial Shields – awarded for excellence in the art of tailoring – and the Tailor & Cutter Award of The Golden Dandy.  His first shop was at 19a Grange Road West in Birkenhead – now on the Beatles Magic Mystery Tour, because it was here that the Beatles had their very first suits made.  In episode one of the Beatles Anthology documentary, Paul McCartney recalls: "We all went quite happily over the water to Wirral, to Beno Dorn, a little tailor who made mohair suits. That started to change the image".  Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager and an old friend of Dorn,  has been credited with replacing the group's leather "teddy boy" outfits with mod, collarless Beno Dorn suits,  as part of an image change that led to their breakthrough.
