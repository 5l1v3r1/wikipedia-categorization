The aguayo (hispanicized spelling of awayu, Aymara for diaper and for a woven blanket to carry things on the back or to cover the back,   ),  q'ipirina or q'ipina (Quechua q'ipi bundle, -na a suffix,    hispanicized spellings quepina, queperina, quepirina, quipirina) is a rectangular carrying cloth used in traditional communities in the Andes region of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Aymara and Quechua people use it to carry small children or all kinds of items in it on their backs. It is similar to a lliklla and sometimes regarded as a synonym  but larger and knotted at the front. The awayus typically feature colorful stripes intercalated with rhombuses and other figures with symbolic values.  The aguayo is mostly associated with Aymara and Quechua culture but is not exclusive to them.
