The llawt'u or llawthu (Quechua,   Hispanicized spellings llauto, llautu) was an outfit of the ruling Sapa Incas. It was a variety of turban with the colours of the Tahuantinsuyo. The llawt'u was traditionally woven from the wool of the vicu√±a with different-colored plaits. On the front was a stripe of wool called the maskapaycha. The symbol of the quriqinqi was displayed on the front. It has been said[by whom?] that small dried frogs were worn under the garment as part of a tradition whose origins have been long lost.
