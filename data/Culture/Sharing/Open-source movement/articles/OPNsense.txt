OPNsense  is open source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing software developed by Deciso, a company in the Netherlands that makes hardware and sells support packages for OPNsense. It is a fork of pfSense, which in turn was forked from m0n0wall, which was built on FreeBSD.  It was launched in January 2015.   When m0n0wall closed down in February 2015 its creator, Manuel Kaspar, referred its developer community to OPNsense.  OPNsense has a web-based interface and can be used on i386 and x86-64 platforms.   Along with acting as a firewall, it has traffic shaping, load balancing, and virtual private network capabilities, and others can be added via plugins.  In November 2017, a World Intellectual Property Organization panel found that Netgate, the copyright holder of pfSense, had been using the domain opnsense.com in bad faith to discredit OPNsense, and obligated Netgate to transfer the domain to Deciso. The Netgate party tried to invoke the fair use clause and claimed that the domain name "has been used for a parody website"; it was rejected on the basis that free speech does not cover registration of domain names.
