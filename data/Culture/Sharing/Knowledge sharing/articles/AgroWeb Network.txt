"AgroWeb Network" was established in 1998 by organizations and individuals involved in agricultural and rural development in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). AgroWeb Network is maintained by institutions and individuals operating in their respective countries.  AgroWeb Network collaborates with the European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture. International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists (IAALD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are initiators of the AgroWeb Network. The AgroWeb Network has introduced national portals of CEE countries. National portals include country-specific information mainly linking agriculture-related institutions - ministries, libraries, information centres, universities, research centres, Non-governmental Organizations (NGO's), agro-marketing organizations, etc. - involved in the European Integration process. AgroWeb Network seeks to fulfill two basic objectives: a) Collection and dissemination of information about the agricultural sector. b) Capacity building and inter-institutional cooperation. AgroWeb Network has twenty seven member countries. The national portals are hosted by the host organizations with support of national authorities and experts. The portals are maintained by national working groups composed of coordinators and authors/editors. The profiles of information management experts, national coordinators and AgroWeb authors/editors are included in the 'Contact Database'.
