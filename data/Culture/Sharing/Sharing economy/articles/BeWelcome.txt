BeWelcome operates a hospitality service and social networking service. Its website is a platform for members to arrange homestays, offer hospitality, meet other members, and join events. The platform is a gift economy; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging. Upon creating an account, members set up an online identity, and after leaving comments on their experiences with other members, develop a reputation.  BeWelcome is operated by BeVolunteer, a nonprofit organization organized as a voluntary association registered in Rennes, France, which is composed solely of volunteers. The software behind the website, the BW-rox platform, is free and open-source software.  The website was launched in February 2007.   After Couchsurfing International Inc., which operates Couchsurfing.com, became a for-profit corporation in 2011, some members urged others to join BeWelcome.
