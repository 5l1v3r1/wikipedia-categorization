Hospitality Club operates a hospitality service and social networking service. Its website is a platform for members to arrange homestays, offer hospitality, join events, and meet other members. The platform is a gift economy; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging. Hospitality Club was founded in July 2000 by 22-year old Veit K端hne with the help of friends and family.   K端hne had been inspired by his experiences with homestays in Mensa International and his student social networks.  In January 2005, K端hne emailed members reiterating his control over decisions regarding the website.  In 2006, K端hne was working full-time on Hospitality Club.
