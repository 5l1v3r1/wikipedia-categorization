The Streetbank website states "Streetbank is a movement of people who share with their neighbours".  The purpose of Streetbank is to boost local communities by encouraging people to get to know their neighbours.  Accounts are free to set up. Once the account is set up the user will receive emails from other users living nearby. Users can offer items for free or to lend, or offer skills. Members can also make requests and provide information ("notices"). User can choose the size of their "neighbourhood" and can opt to receive messages from other users living within one, five or ten miles. In 2012 Streetbank was awarded funding of Â£45,000 by Nesta.   In 2014 Streetbank merged with Freeconomy, a similar organisation set up by "Mark Boyle (the moneyless man)".  Mark continued as part of the Streetbank leadership team.
