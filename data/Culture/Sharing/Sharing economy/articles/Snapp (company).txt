Snapp is a ride-hailing company from Tehran, Iran.  Snapp launched in February 2014 under the name Taxi Yab, but changed its name due to legal issues.  Users can request a ride via the iOS or Android app, by indicating their location and destination. The price of the trip is set beforehand, to eliminate haggling. Snapp commissions drivers upon completing a background check, and showing a valid drivers license and insurance before hiring them. Snapp is the only ride-hailing application in Iran which offers its website in Persian, English and French, becoming one of the most popular apps with foreigners in Iran.  Currently Snapp operates in Arak, Urmia, Isfahan and Suburbs (Najaf Abad, Fuladshahr, Shahin Shahr), Ahwaz, Babol, Bandar Abbas, Tabriz and suburbs, Tehran and suburbs, Rasht and suburbs, Sari and suburbs, Shiraz and suburbs, Qaem Shahr, Qazvin, Qom, Karaj and Suburb, Kerman, Mashhad, Yazd, Neyshaboor, Gorgan, Ardebil, Hamedan & Bushehr. They are looking to expand to new cities, and may even seek to expand internationally.  TechCrunch announced on October 9, 2016 that it had received a $20 million investment in a Series A round led by MTN Group, a South-African multinational.  According to Shahram Shahkar, the CEO of the company,  Snapp now employs more than 300,000 active drivers and more than 500 personnel (2017).
