TRVL is a peer-to-peer travel booking platform that gives travelers access to the commissions and discounts of the travel industry world. It aims to facilitate and reward travelers for helping each other researching and booking trips.  TRVL's slogan is "Power to the traveler".  Co-founded in the Netherlands by entrepreneur Jochem Wijnands and tech specialist Michel Elings, TRVL first started as a digital publication exclusively for iPad in 2010; it was the first iPad-specific magazine in the world.  Out of frustration with Adobe's publishing software, the TRVL team developed Prss, a mobile-first publishing platform. The Prss team was acquired by Apple in 2014 to help create Apple News and the Apple News Format.  In 2015 Wijnands left Apple to turn TRVL into a travel booking platform where anyone can help anyone with travel recommendations while earning money.    The platform takes a sharing-economy approach to booking travel. The traveler does not pay extra to use the service.
