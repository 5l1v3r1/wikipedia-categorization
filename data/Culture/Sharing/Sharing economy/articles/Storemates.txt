Storemates is a web-based service that allows people searching for storage to connect with people who are advertising their spare space (e.g. loft space, spare room, garage, etc.).  It was founded by Shaffique Prabatani, Ben Rogers and Jason Bryan in 2011. Storemates is considered part of the Collaborative Consumption  (Sharing Economy) concept, in a peer-to-peer market, allowing non-utilised assets to be shared for a monetary or non-monetary return.  People with spare space list it on the Storemates website with a location, size guide and weekly renting price;  then someone looking to store items can search in their desired location to find a storage space. An arrangement between the two parties is made.  The Storemates Storage Agreement is signed by both parties and they are covered by the Storemates Protection Guarantee. The concept of Storemates was first thought up by Shaffique Prabatani after a personal experience of lack of space.  Shaff designed a simple flyer  asking neighbours if they had any spare room in their houses, offering to pay a few pounds a month in return for some storage space. He posted the fliers through the letterboxes and within a week he had received 15 phone calls from friendly neighbours offering him space for his stuff in their lofts, garages and spare rooms. Inspired by this local solution, Shaff, Ben and Jason decided to take this idea and create an online service where people can share their space with those in need; appearing on BBC's Dragon's Den  and BBC's Real Storage Wars.  Today Shaff and Ben continue as Managing Partners; Jason stepped down as a director, although remains as a consultant and shareholder.
