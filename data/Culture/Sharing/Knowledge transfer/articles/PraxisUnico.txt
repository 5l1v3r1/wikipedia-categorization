PraxisAuril, formerly known as PraxisUnico, is a UK based non-profit national professional association for Knowledge Exchange & Commercialisation (KEC) practitioners. PraxisAuril has over 170 member organisations across Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Public Sector Research Establishments (PSREs), and a network of over 5000 individuals involved in KEC. PraxisUnico was formed in 2009 from two separate organisations - Praxis (committed to training for technology transfer officers in universities and research centres) and Unico which was a membership organisation including universities and PSRE organisations. In 2017 PraxisUnico joined forces with Auril to form a new organisation under the umbrella of PraxisAuril. Chairs of PraxisAuril have included: PraxisAuril runs training courses for KEC professionals both within the UK and internationally, works to promote best practice within KEC, and runs events and networking activities. It aims to “facilitate interactions between the public sector research base, business and government by bringing together key stakeholders to debate, educate and inform.”  It also works to represent the KEC sector in policy consultations. International activity is led by Nessa Carey. PraxisAuril is a founder member of The Alliance of Technology Transfer Professionals (ATTP).  ATTP confers the world-recognized Registered Technology Transfer Professional (RTTP) designation. RTTP status recognizes the accomplishments, roles, skills, knowledge, and deal-making expertise of technology transfer professionals. There are over 320 RTTPs recognised globally.  The Impact Awards were introduced by PraxisUnico in 2009. In 2015, PraxisUnico partnered with Research Councils UK to deliver the awards jointly. The awards are open to members and non-members. The 2015 categories and winners included: The overall winner in 2015 was the University of Leicester for the ASDEC project. Details of these and previous winners are available on the Impact Awards website. The Impact Awards are not scheduled to run in 2016, with a showcase of past winners taking place at the PraxisUnico Conference instead.
