The Materials Knowledge Transfer Network (Materials KTN) was a UK-based knowledge transfer organisation; as of 2016, it has been superseded by the Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN). The KTN is a network that brings together the views of those in business, design, research and technology organisations, trade associations, the financial market, academia and others across a wide variety of scientific fields. The Materials Knowledge Transfer Network provided a range of activities for members, such as events, webinars, online meeting tools, signposting to funding, assisting with applications for financial support, and helping to set up consortia for R&D projects, to enable the exchange of knowledge and the stimulation of business innovation in the UK, worked with training agencies to develop courses in materials, and helped to broker vocational and other training for people involved in materials.  The Knowledge Transfer Network has continued with all of these functions. Membership of the KTN is free. The Materials KTN was funded by the Technology Strategy Board of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and run by the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining in London. It was one of a number of KTNs funded by the Technology Strategy Board. These separate KTNs have now been combined into one body, the Knowledge Transfer Network.
