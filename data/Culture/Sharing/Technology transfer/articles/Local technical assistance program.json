It transfers knowledge of innovative transportation technology to both urban and rural local communities in the United States and to American Indian tribal governments.\n</p><p>The program is a partnership effort with funding provided from Federal, State, and local agency resources as well as universities and the private sector. Each center is funded by a 50:50 match of state and federal funds, although some states choose to provide more than the minimum required amount. \n</p><p>There are 58 Technology Transfer (T2) Centers established\u2014one in each State, one serving Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and seven serving American Indian tribal governments\u2014to provide training and technical assistance to local governments. Most centers are run by universities, and a few are hosted by their state's department of transportation. Several, like the Cornell Local Roads Program and Texas LTAP, are part of university-based <a href=\"/wiki/Cooperative_extension_service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cooperative extension service\">cooperative extension services</a>. It was founded in 1982, although several centers predate the national program.\n</p><p>LTAP Centers assist nearly 38,000 local government agencies and over 540 federally recognized tribes in maintaining and improving transportation infrastructure and services with the latest technology and information available. Local transportation agencies expend over $30 billion annually to maintain 2.9 million miles of roads [1.3 paved/1.6 unpaved] with over 290,000 bridges.\n</p><p>Many local road departments are managed by individuals who generally have practical experience but little formal technical education or training. LTAP has a variety of tools - training events, technology transfer resources, and personalized assistance - to assist local agencies in improving their transportation operations. Many state transportation departments also benefit from LTAP services. In 2011, LTAP centers trained over 151,000 people in over 5300 sessions.\n</p><p>Common topics for training and assistance include <a href=\"/wiki/Pavement_management\" title=\"Pavement management\">pavement management</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Road#Maintenance\" title=\"Road\">maintenance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Road_works\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Road works\">road works</a> safety, <a href=\"/wiki/Traffic_sign\" title=\"Traffic sign\">traffic signs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Road_surface_marking\" title=\"Road surface marking\">pavement markings</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Public_works\" title=\"Public works\">public works</a> department management, <a href=\"/wiki/Snow_removal\" title=\"Snow removal\">snow and ice control</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Drainage\" title=\"Drainage\">drainage</a>.  \n</p><p>Two important factors in LTAP's success are flexibility and networking. Although certain tasks are mandated, like providing a newsletter and a lending library for local highway officials, each LTAP center has considerable leeway in adapting its programs to address the unique challenges faced by the customers it serves.\n</p><p>Centers also work together on many projects. If one center has a pavement specialist on their staff, they may provide training for another state's center, in exchange for work zone training. Also, should a local highway official ask a question that their center can't answer, it can be forwarded to the 57 other centers, as well as related FHWA and State DOT offices. Usually, an answer is supplied within short order.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Local_technical_assistance_program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Map of LTAP centers: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120708045803/http://www.ltap.org/centers/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20120708045803/http://www.ltap.org/centers/</a>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1238\nCached time: 20180909031045\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 14/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:13988353-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909031045 and revision id 818676929\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Technology_transfer"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Federal_Highway_Administration"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cooperative extension service"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Drainage"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Federal Highway Administration"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pavement management"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Public works"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Road"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Road surface marking"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Road works"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Snow removal"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Technology transfer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Traffic sign"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["https://web.archive.org/web/20120708045803/http://www.ltap.org/centers/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Local_technical_assistance_program","byteoffset":3141,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Local technical assistance program","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6664557"}]}}
