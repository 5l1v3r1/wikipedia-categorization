Technology brokering requires companies to be strong in two areas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>2</span></sup> As Andrew Hargadon, technology brokering\u2019s founder, summarized: \"Firstly, the company must have the ability to bridge distant communities, usually when a company can move easily across a range of different markets they have a better view of how technologies can be used in new ways. Secondly, technology brokering involves creating new markets and industries from innovative combinations of existing technology. These two strengths are difficult to have simultaneously because the strong ties the companies have with customers and supplies in one industry prevent the company from moving easily into other markets and experimenting with new ideas.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>2</span></sup> Yet, when a company is able to combine these two strengths it can result in being the first to experience technological advances.\n</p><p>Technology brokering can teach firms how to effectively shift the focus of traditional R&amp;D teams from trying to invent completely new products to combining previous innovations. New ideas for observation based research pull R&amp;D scientists out of the lab and place them into direct consumer observation to allow them to diagnose problems with products and identify the needs of the customer more accurately.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>7</span></sup> The technology brokering process intertwines with the idea of <a href=\"/wiki/Empathic_design\" title=\"Empathic design\">empathic design</a>, which is basically understanding products from a customers\u2019 point of view and then designing them to fit needs and issues. The advantage of empathic design, especially when combined with technology brokering firms, is that it leads to innovative products that suit the particular problems of the customer. Another perk of empathic design is including marketing and manufacturing people in the product design to get diverse opinions of product success and practicality.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Examples\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Examples</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Firms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Firms</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Products\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Products</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Process_model\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Process model</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Technology_brokering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first examples of technology brokering can be found as early as 1876 with <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Edison\" title=\"Thomas Edison\">Thomas Edison</a> in his <a href=\"/wiki/Menlo_Park,_New_Jersey\" title=\"Menlo Park, New Jersey\">Menlo Park</a> laboratory. In six years, this lab procured over 400 patents.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>2</span></sup> Menlo Park laboratory was such a successful \u2018invention factory\u2019 because Thomas Edison had a firm belief in <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Recombinant_innovation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Recombinant innovation (page does not exist)\">recombinant innovation</a>. There were no inventions from Menlo Park that were truly invented from nothing \u2013 each one had some basis that was pulled from another field of technology. Edison and his team worked in many different fields in conjunction with many different companies, in addition to working on individual experiments. All of these projects enabled the team to use their knowledge of various fields to be innovative in creating new solutions for different organizations. Because knowledge of technology across differing fields was disconnected, Edison was able to exploit this and create new solutions from areas of past projects.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Ford\" title=\"Henry Ford\">Henry Ford</a> is another great inventor in history who understood the power of combining past solutions to create a new one. He is famous for the <a href=\"/wiki/Model_T\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Model T\">model T</a> automobile and the assembly line, but Ford himself stated that:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I invented nothing new. I simply assembled into a car the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work\u2026.Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed. So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>3</span></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The knowledge of recombinant innovation is alive and thriving today. Companies such as IDEO can easily have their processes compared to Edison\u2019s operations of the Menlo Park laboratory. IDEO is arguably one of the largest and most successful design firms of the current times. Since its founding in 1978, it has created 3,000 new products in over 40 industries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>5</span></sup> Working amidst several different industries is a large factor of success in technology brokering. The more industries that firms are involved in, the broader their understanding of different technologies will be. CEO of IDEO David Kelley has this to say about working in many different fields:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Working with companies in such dissimilar industries as medical instruments, furniture, toys and computers has given us a broad view of the latest technologies available and has taught us how to do quality product development and how to do it quickly and efficiently.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>5</span></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many companies today are restructuring their <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=R%26D_departments&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"R&amp;D departments (page does not exist)\">R&amp;D departments</a> and they are finding the structure of technology brokering to be very successful and cost-effective for innovation. Not only is technology brokering a business foundation for design firms, it can also be used inside large corporations in order to achieve inter-departmental innovations. Andrew Hargadon was really the first person to coin the term \u2018technology brokering\u2019 and advocate to industry its advantages. He did this in the late 1980s, early 1990s, now the concept of technology brokering is fairly common.

In 1875 Edison purchased a single model home in New Jersey. This property is referred to as one of his first major innovations; the first industrial research lab, \"Menlo Park.\" This would be the location of over 400 inventions and prove to be a prime example of Thomas Edison using technology brokering to innovate. Edison has stated that he built this laboratory for the; \"Rapid and cheap development of an invention.\" He also promised, \"A minor invention every ten days and a major invention every six months.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>3</span></sup> How could Edison make such bold projections? Edison developed four intertwined work practices that helped him be so innovative. They were: capturing good ideas, keeping these ideas alive, imagining new uses for old ideas, and putting promising concepts to test. Using these concepts, which underline the concepts of technology brokering, Edison is credited with 1,093 U.S. patents as well as patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>3</span></sup>\n</p><p>One of the reasons Edison was so successful was his ability to surround himself with very knowledgeable people. Edison\u2019s team came from all over the world and they were considered experts in various fields. <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Batchelor\" title=\"Charles Batchelor\">Charles Batchelor</a>, from England, was Edison\u2019s chief mechanical assistant and helped Edison with many of his inventions. Edison also hired people from Germany, Switzerland, and a number of other European countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hargadon_Sutton_2-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hargadon_Sutton-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In an article written by Andrew Hargadon, he states, \"Between the years of 1876 to 1881, the lab (Menlo park) produced numerous innovations in high speed, automatic and repeating, telegraphs; telephones; phonographs; generators, voltmeters; light bulbs; and vacuum pumps.\" Edison\u2019s first major financial success was the quadruplex telegraph. After creating the quadruplex Edison was unsure how to set the price. He originally thought his product could sell for somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. After he pitched his product to <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Union\" title=\"Western Union\">Western Union</a>, Edison was thrilled to see they offered him $10,000 for the telegraph. This financial success allowed Edison to be the founder of the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement, Menlo Park.\n</p><p>It is recognized that Edison understood the concept of technology brokering. And some of his methods were rather elementary. In his own notes it stated, \"1st Study the present construction, 2nd Ask for all past experiences\u2026study and read everything you can on the subject.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Products\">Products</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Technology_brokering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Products\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The desire of technology brokers to work with old/discontinued, or already in use products/ideas, has provided an array of fascinating products. For instance, obesity has been a problem for years and many people have gone through endless treatments; however, the craving for food that is high in fat and sugar does not go away. IDEO designed a Crave Aid Patch, similar to the <a href=\"/wiki/Nicotine_patch\" title=\"Nicotine patch\">Nicotine Patch</a> used to quit smoking. This patch comes in different flavors of unhealthy food, so that when an individual is craving unhealthy food he/she can wear this patch and fight the hunger.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another excellent example of technology brokering is the telephone. Since it was invented, the telephone has undergone a great number of changes: from residential-only, to being portable in a brief case, to more modernized digital <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_phone\" title=\"Mobile phone\">cell phones</a> with access to internet and much more. It seemed as though the residential phone would disappear completely due to the technology found in the cellular phones; however, technology brokering was able to bring about a huge change in residential phones. <a href=\"/wiki/Verizon_Communications\" title=\"Verizon Communications\">Verizon communications</a> recently introduced the Verizon Hub, a residential phone that allows you to send and receive text-messages, pictures, connect to the internet, and link your cell phone to your Verizon Hub so you can answer your home phone even if not at home.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The beauty of technology brokering is not inventing totally new products, it is the ability to reimage or recreate a product while using an old idea/product. For example, the Craving Aid Patch was a product originally designed for smokers and in many cases seen as a medical procedure. Nonetheless, exactly the same idea has now been used to create a totally different product using the same technology. Similar to the Craving Aid Patch, which is just an old idea reinvented into a new product, the Verizon Hub, perhaps the most modern residential phone, is based on the very same idea as when it was first invented, in the years of <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell\" title=\"Alexander Graham Bell\">Alexander Graham Bell</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Technology Brokering can make an impact on any kind of product regardless of its nature. For example, a bar tap handle could be pretty much anything, a stick or piece of metal, a button, etc. However, with the help of IDEO, Sam Adams was able to innovate its bar tap handles. The totally redesigned Sam Adams tap continues to have a similar shape as the others, but Sam Adams\u2019 has a blue fluorescent cover displaying the Sam Adams brand while giving a sense of the elegance and class behind the Sam Adams brand.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>The Light Bulb</b>\n</p><p>On December 31, 1879, Edison first displayed his most popular invention. It was the first \"practical incandescent, electric lamp. This is a perfect example of Thomas Edison leveraging technology brokering. Edison was not the first person to invent electric light. J.W. Starr filed a patent for an incandescent bulb in 1854. That was 30 years before Edison began working on the light bulb we know today. When Edison first started testing incandescent lamps, the arc light was being used for lighting streets and also for various other applications.\n</p><p>When Edison began testing incandescent lamps he ran into a major problem. The problem was Edison wasn\u2019t sure what material to use for the filament. Most of the material he tried would melt. There was too much oxygen and heat created by the electric current. As a result the filaments would always burn. He used two methods to correct this issue. At first Edison had to find a new material to use. He began by using platinum for his filaments with little success. Eventually he made his filaments by carbonizing <a href=\"/wiki/Bristol_board\" title=\"Bristol board\">Bristol board</a>, which is a type of cardboard. He also acquired the best vacuum pumps available at the time. This would reduce the amount of oxygen inside of the bulbs. These two changes made it possible for Edison to create the light bulb we all use today.\n</p><p>As mentioned above, Edison did not invent the electric light. However, he did leverage technology brokering in order to piece together many different existing technologies to make a better light bulb. As one could assume, Edison was highly appraised for his accomplishments. Many people today believe he was the first person to invent the electric light when truly he was great at leveraging technology brokering.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Process_model\">Process model</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Technology_brokering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Process model\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>\u2022\tStep1: Access</b>\nAccording to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton\u2019s study of IDEO, \"IDEO has access to dissimilar industries and it enables them to generate product innovations.\" \"Each engineer has a distinct body of technological knowledge from working with IDEO clients, from past technical training and work experience, and from his or her personal interests and backgrounds.
