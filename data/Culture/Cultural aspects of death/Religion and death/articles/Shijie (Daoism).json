<i>sh\u012b</i> (\u5c38 or \u5c4d, \"corpse; body\") and <i>ji\u011b</i> (\u89e3, \"separate; divide; cut apart\"), and has been described as a \"rather strange name\" (Seidel 1987: 230), \"notoriously slippery term\" (Benn 2003: 139), with \"the potential for confusion\" (Campany 2002: 53), and sometimes \"misrepresented or interpreted in a way too vague to be intelligible\" (Pas 1998: 57).\n</p><p><i><b>Sh\u012b</b></i> (\u5c38) has three sets of English translation equivalents in Paul W.

Campany describes the <i>shi</i> \"impersonator of deceased ancestors, one who sat in their place during the solemn presentation of food, drink, and announcements and the performance of dances\" (2002: 53).\n</p><p>Besides the usual meaning of \"corpse, dead body\", <i>shi</i> \u5c38 can sometimes mean \"body, mortal body\"\u2014particularly in <i>shijie</i> contexts. Joseph Needham translates <i>shijie</i> as \"release from the mortal part\" (1974: 297), which is more appropriate than \"release from the corpse\" because the first step in achieving <i>shijie</i> transcendence is to abandon one's corporeal body (Pregadio 2004: 117). Anna Seidel points out that <i>shi</i> in the term <i>shijie</i> denotes \"all the corruptible aging factors of the physical body,\" rather than the corpse itself (1987: 230). Fabrizio Pregadio cites a classic Daoist text that clearly uses the word <i>shi</i> to denote \"not specifically a corpse, but in general the 'mortal body', either living or dead\". A passage in the c. 200 CE <i><a href=\"/wiki/Xiang%27er\" title=\"Xiang&#39;er\">Xiang'er</a></i> commentary to the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daodejing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Daodejing\">Daodejing</a></i> (see below) contrasts <i>shisi</i> (\u5c38\u6b7b) and <i>shisheng</i> (\u5c38\u751f), which cannot be read literally to mean \"a corpse dies\" and \"a corpse lives\". \"When the mortal body dies (<i>shisi</i>), that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives (<i>shisheng</i>), that is accomplishment\"; this context refers to options for a living person, and not to a postmortem renewal; \"its subject, in other words, is not the 'corpse' but the 'mortal body'\" (2004: 116-117). However, Campany contends that what is escaped through <i>shijie</i> is not the adept's <i>shi</i> dead body but the administrative system of death registration (2002: 53).\n</p><p>Owing to the ambiguities of reading the original <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_character\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese character\">Chinese character</a> \u5c38 for <i>shi</i> \"corpse; mortal body; personator of the dead; etc.\", the basic meaning of \"corpse\" is clarified with the character <i>shi</i> \u5c4d that adds <i>si</i> (\u6b7b, \"die; death\") to <i>shi</i> \u5c38. Compare the word <i>s\u01d0sh\u012b</i> (\u6b7b\u5c4d, lit. \"dead corpse\") meaning \"corpse; dead body\".\n</p><p><i><b>Jie</b></i> (\u89e3) has seven sets of English translation equivalents in Kroll's dictionary:\n</p>\n<ol><li>untie, unknot, loosen, release \u2026 doff, take off</li>\n<li>disjoint, dismember \u2026 dissect; analyze, take apart</li>\n<li>remove, eliminate \u2026 resolve; (find a) solution, work out (a problem)</li>\n<li>deliver from, release, liberate, free oneself from; emancipate</li>\n<li>dissipate, dissolve; disperse; dispel</li>\n<li>open out; unfurl, unfold; reveal</li>\n<li>explain, expound; exposition \u2026 (2017: 210)</li></ol>\n<p>Kroll gives <i>shijie</i> as a usage example under both <i>shi</i> 2. and <i>jie</i> 4., glossed as \"'deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse,' in which the adept's supposed corpse is buried but is actually substituted with a personal object (sword, staff, etc.) that temporarily takes on the appearance of the corpse, thus allowing one to escape from the bureaucracy of death; a lower-level means of transcendence.\" \n</p><p>Scholars propose divergent semantic interpretations of the <i>jie</i> in <i>shijie</i>: \"to molt,\" \"to quarter,\" \"to expel an affliction\" (Robinet 1979: 58); \"to divide, separate, disperse, to detach, deliver\", \"to loosen, dissolve, explain\", and \"emancipation, liberation\" in Chinese Buddhism (Pas 1998: 58); and \"release, deliverance, escape\" (Campany 2002: 53). The ancient <i>shijie</i> is related with the medical term <i>sh\u012bt\u01d0 ji\u011bpu</i> (\u5c4d\u9ad4\u89e3\u5256, \"autopsy; postmortem examination\") that combines <i>sh\u012bt\u01d0</i> (\u5c4d\u9ad4, \"corpse; remains\") with <i>ji\u011bp\u014du</i> (\u89e3\u5256, \"dissect\").\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Varieties\">Varieties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Varieties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The forms of <i>shijie</i> are quite diverse, in its broadest meaning, the term sometimes simply denotes disappearance, \"to depart on a journey through foreign lands.\" It more commonly designates a type of disappearance that leaves a trace behind, such as a body without its bones, or a coffin that contains only a symbolic staff, sword, or sandal. Sometimes <i>shijie</i> can even refer to an adept who comes back to life after <a href=\"/wiki/Apparent_death\" title=\"Apparent death\">apparent death</a> (Robinet 1979: 58-59).\n</p><p>The French sinologist Isabelle Robinet compares the common forms of <i>shijie</i>.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Jianjie</i> (\u528d\u89e3, \"deliverance by a sword\") is considered the most noble <i>shijie</i> method. This technique requires either an inferior \"simple sword\" or a divine \"magical sword\" that enables one \"to return to your old village under another name\" since the subterranean officials no longer have any hold on those who have performed it.</li>\n<li><i>Bingjie</i> (\u5175\u89e3, \"deliverance by a military weapon\" or \"escape by execution\") is the liberation of those who have been executed, such as the famous <a href=\"/wiki/Zuo_Ci\" title=\"Zuo Ci\">Zuo Ci</a> (155-220) who continued to be seen alive in <a href=\"/wiki/Jingzhou\" title=\"Jingzhou\">Jingzhou</a> despite the fact that <a href=\"/wiki/Cao_Cao\" title=\"Cao Cao\">Cao Cao</a> was in possession of his head and the rest of his body had disappeared.</li>\n<li><i>Wenjie</i> (\u6587\u89e3, \"peaceful deliverance\"), which contrasts with <i>bingjie</i>, involves replacing the body with sandals or a staff. <a href=\"/wiki/Maxime_Kaltenmark\" title=\"Maxime Kaltenmark\">Maxime Kaltenmark</a> showed that Daoist magical sandals are birds, which enable the adept to soar aloft and fly away, similar with <i>jianjie</i>.</li>\n<li><i>Shuijie</i> (\u6c34\u89e3, \"deliverance by water\") is when the body of a drowned person is protected by a compassionate divinity, \"On the outside it is said that he drowned; on the inside, in truth, he is secretly saved.\"</li>\n<li><i>Huojie</i> (\u706b\u89e3, \"deliverance by fire\") involves a Daoist who is burned alive and apparently flies away in the form of a bird. In certain cases, the adept's body undergoes <a href=\"/wiki/Spontaneous_human_combustion\" title=\"Spontaneous human combustion\">spontaneous human combustion</a>, such as Cai Jing (\u8521\u7d93), whose body burned for three days until his bones dissolved and \"only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell\" (1979: 60-62).</li></ul>\n<p>Another variation is <i>zhangjie</i> (\u6756\u89e3, \"staff-liberated)\", when the adept's bamboo staff served as a temporary stand-in for his real body, which was transformed and vanished away to the realm of the immortals (Strickmann 1979: 130).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_terms\">Related terms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Related terms\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i>Shijie</i> is similar to the word <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bianhua\" title=\"Bianhua\">bianhua</a></i> (\"transformation; metamorphosis\") and its synonymous components <i>bian</i> (\u8b8a, \"change; alter\") and <i>hua</i> (\u5316, \"change; transform\"). For instance, the 499 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Zhen%27gao\" title=\"Zhen&#39;gao\">Zhen'gao</a></i> refers to a superior method of <i>shijie</i> called <i>huadun</i> (\u5316\u9041, \"to transform and escape\"), and mentions <i>tuohua dunbian</i> (\u8a17\u5316\u9041\u8b8a, \"to simulate transformation and hide by metamorphosis\"); and the 983 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Taiping_Yulan\" title=\"Taiping Yulan\">Taiping Yulan</a></i> describes <i>shijie dunbian</i> (\u5c38\u89e3\u9041\u8b8a, \"delivered from the body and transformed by escaping\") (Robinet 1979: 57). All types of <i>bianhua</i> require a material support, and <i>shijie</i> generally involves \"going away by making use of a material object.\" However, there is an essential difference between them. <i>Bianhua</i> is a magical trick or the manipulation of a power that the mystic can use while alive; <i>Shijie</i> is only practiced at the end of life and is a form of deliverance linked with the purification and refinement of the body (Robinet 1993: 168).\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg/220px-Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"116\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg/330px-Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg/440px-Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4000\" data-file-height=\"2113\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Album_of_18_Daoist_Paintings_-_10.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/He_Xiangu\" title=\"He Xiangu\">He Xiangu</a> flying on a crane; painting by <a href=\"/wiki/Zhang_Lu_(painter)\" title=\"Zhang Lu (painter)\">Zhang Lu</a> (1464\u20131538)</div></div></div>\n<p>The <i>hu\u00e0</i> (\u5316, \"change; transform; convert\") in <i>bianhua</i> occurs in several Daoist alternative terms for <i>shijie</i>. <i>Ji\u011bhu\u00e0</i> (\u89e3\u5316, with the <i>jie</i> \"release; etc.\" in <i>shijie</i>) means \"liberate the mortal body and attain the Dao\". <i>Xi\u0101ohu\u00e0</i> (\u92b7\u5316, with \"melt away; disintegrate\") means \"release the physical body and transform into a <i>xian</i>\" (see the <i>Shiji</i> below). <i>Y\u01d4hu\u00e0</i> (\u7fbd\u5316, with \"feather; wing\") refers to an insect \"growing wings; <a href=\"/wiki/Eclosion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eclosion\">eclosion</a>\", which Daoists semantically extended to \"die and become a <i>xian</i> flying up to heaven\"; wings are a common feature in depictions of <i>xian</i>, either riding a mythological flying creature or flying with their own wings\u2014compare <i>y\u01d4r\u00e9n</i> (\u7fbd\u4eba, with \"person\") \"<i>xian</i> transcendent/immortal; Daoist priest\". \n</p><p>As detailed in \"Early textual usages\" below, the term <i>xingjie</i> (\u5f62\u89e3, \"release of the form\"), with <i>x\u00edng</i> (\u5f62, \"outward form, appearance, shape; figure, configuration; structure, contour, outline\", Kroll 2007: 509), was a near synonym of <i>shijie</i> (\"release from the corpse\") that was recorded several centuries earlier. \n</p><p><i>Tu\u014ds\u01d0</i> (\u8a17\u6b7b, \"feign death; simulate death\", later written \u6258\u6b7b) frequently occurs in <i>shijie</i> contexts.

Before reaching a hundred years they die like all the others. Yet uncultured and ignorant people still hold that they are separated from their bodies, and vanish, and that, as a matter of fact, they do not die. What is understood by separation from the body? Does it mean that the body dies, and the spirit disappears? Or that the body does not die, but drops its coil? If one says that the body dies, and the spirit is lost, there is no difference from death, and every one is a genius. And if one believes that the body does not die, but throws off its coil, one must admit that the bones and the flesh of all the deceased Taoists are intact and in no wise different from the corpses of ordinary mortals. When the cricket leaves its chrysalis, the tortoise drops its shell, the snake its skin, and the stag its horns, in short, when the horned and skinned animals lose their outward cover, retaining only their flesh and bones, one might speak of the separation from the body. But even if the body of a dead Taoist were similar to a chrysalis, one could not use this expression, because, when the cricket leaves the chrysalis, it cannot be considered as a spirit with regard to the chrysalis. Now to call it a separation from the body, when there is not even a similarity with the chrysalis, would again be an unfounded assertion missing the truth. The Grand Annalist [i.e., <a href=\"/wiki/Sima_Qian\" title=\"Sima Qian\">Sima Qian</a>, the <i>Shiji</i> compiler] was a contemporary of Li Shao Ch\u00fcn. Although he was not amongst those who came near to Li Shao Ch\u00fcn\u2019s body, when he had expired, he was in a position to learn the truth. If he really did not die, but only parted with his body, the Grand Annalist ought to have put it on record, and would not have given the place of his death. (tr.

Only by guarding the Dao without being full and overflowing is one able to transform wearing out into accomplishment.\" (2004: 117); noting that the passage refers to options given to a living person for their \"mortal body\", and not to a postmortem renewal for their \"corpse\".\n</p><p>The commentary to two <i>Daodejing</i> chapters describe an early Daoist understanding of transcendence. The adept <i>tu\u014ds\u01d0</i> (\u8a17\u6b7b, \"feigns/simulates death\") and goes to the <i>T\u00e0iy\u012bn</i> (\u592a\u9670, Palace of Great Darkness, in the extreme north of the heavens), where their bodily form is refined, in analogy with alchemically <a href=\"/wiki/Refining_(metallurgy)\" title=\"Refining (metallurgy)\">refining</a> base metals, resulting in <i>fusheng</i> (\u5fa9\u751f, \"rebirth\" or \"second birth\") in a body that preserves itself indefinitely (Pregadio 2018: 387).

While the Celestial Masters recognized that death was inevitable, they sought longevity not through extended life in this world, but through the avoidance of death, described in terms of \"feigned death\" and continued existence in the next life (Bokenkamp 1997: 47).\n</p><p><i>Daodejing</i> Chapter 33 ends with the baffling phrase \"Those who die without perishing are longevous [\u6b7b\u800c\u4e0d\u4ea1\u8005\u58fd]\", which the <i>Xiang'er</i> commentary explains.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a Daoist's practices are complete, the spirits of the Dao call that person to return. Departing the world through feigned death [\u907f\u53bb\u8a17\u6b7b], the person passes through Grand Darkness to be born again and not perish. That is longevity. Commoners have no good merits, and when they die, they belong to the Earth Office. That is to perish. (tr.

When there is no place for them to stay in the world, the worthy withdraw and, feigning death [\u907f\u53bb\u8a17\u6b7b], pass through Grand Darkness to have their images reborn on the other side. This is to be \"obliterated without perishing.\" The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds, so when they die it is truly death. They are taken away in service of the Earth Offices. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 102) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Pregadio specifically translates <i>lianxing</i> (\u7149\u5f62) as \"refine their [bodily] forms\", and says, \"Since the release from, or rather of, the mortal body is a necessary step to continue one\u2019s cultivation, the refining process takes place after one who is ready for it has \"simulated death\". Leaving one\u2019s mortal body and refining one\u2019s form results, at first, in entering again into a state in which neither form nor matter exist, but only a <i>xiang</i> (\u8c61, image, appearance). After the adept\u2019s bodily form has been refined, the process culminates in his \"rebirth\".\" (2018: 387).\n</p><p>The <i>Xiang'er</i> commentary refers to those who lose faith in the Dao as <i>x\u00edngsh\u012b</i> (\u884c\u5c38, \"mobile corpses\").

It is not the Dao that they practice, but merely the way of the corpses. The reason the people of the Dao are able to achieve the longevity of Transcendents is that they do not practice the way of the corpses. They differ from the vulgar and thus are able to perfect their corpses, allowing them to enter the ranks of the Transcendent nobility. (tr.

My name was not recorded in the Great Dark Storehouse (\u5927\u5e7d\u85cf), yet now I am already set to rest in Haoli. Roaming in the infernal realms, I wail over this in eternal vexation.' Having completed [this incantation], return home. In addition, you must change your surname and byname; these must not be the same as before. Thereupon you will not die in a thousand autumns or a myriad years; for the ledgers have already been fixed, and your name has forever been expunged.\" (tr.

Buddhist <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mara%E1%B9%87asati\" title=\"Mara\u1e47asati\">Mara\u1e47asati</a></i>), and a <i>shijie</i> simulated corpse. The text gives instructions for compounding and ingesting a mercury-based elixir called <i>shijie yao</i> (\u5c38\u89e3\u85e5, <i>shijie</i> drug), and writing out in red characters (as for an imperial edict) the Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding (\u9748\u5bf6\u592a\u7384\u9670\u751f\u4e4b\u7b26), which includes stylized <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy\" title=\"Chinese calligraphy\">Chinese calligraphy</a> for <i>bingsi</i> (\u75c5\u6b7b, died of illness), <i>shi</i> (\u5c38, corpse), and <i>gui</i> (\u9b3c, ghost). \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>After you have ingested the Medicine for the Release from the Mortal Body for the prescribed number of days, write the talisman [of the Highest Mystery of Living Unseen] in red on white silk, and place it on your belly.

Pregadio 2018: 390) </p></blockquote>\n<p>This Taiqing account shows that <i>shijie</i> \"release from the mortal body\" requires <i><a href=\"/wiki/Memento_mori\" title=\"Memento mori\">memento mori</a></i>-like meditation practices and ritual aspects. The adept literally \"stages\" his or her death, and the \"audience\" of family members or Daoist companions participate in the \"performance\". They state that the corpse disappeared and was replaced by another object, such as a sword or staff. This <i>shijie</i> object performs the same function as played by the <i>tishen</i> (\u66ff\u8eab, \"replacement bodies\") in early funerary rites. In a ritual sense, the object replaces the deceased, whether the adept's death is real or only \"simulated\" (Pregadio 2018: 390-391). The same scripture also describes how to make male and female versions of a talisman for \"masters of the Dao who wish to perform <i>shijie</i>\", which when written with a \"spirit-brush\" (\u795e\u7b46) on any wood or metal object will immediately transform it into a substitute cadaver that will subsequently \"die and depart\" (Campany 2002: 54).\n</p><p>Comparing the two documentary <i>shijie</i> procedures, Campany finds common elements. Both involve a ritual performance (an incantation protesting one's untimely death, meditating on oneself as a corpse). Each uses an administrative document to magically activate an object (one's grandfather's corpse, one's discarded clothing) that creates an illusory substitute corpse. Both mandate a complete <a href=\"/wiki/Name_change\" title=\"Name change\">name change</a>.\n</p><p>The usual interpretation for a practitioner who performs <i>shijie</i> to change their name is as a simple trick to elude the spirits enforcing the \"registers of life and death\" for each person's lifespan; the adept changes their name in the belief that the spirit-bureaucrats would be unable to locate them and cause their death. On a deeper level, Pregadio notes the <a href=\"/wiki/Homophone\" title=\"Homophone\">homophonous</a> correspondence between <i>g\u01ceim\u00edng</i> (\u6539\u540d, changing name) and <i>g\u01ceim\u00ecng</i> (\u6539\u547d, changing destiny), and says the change of name does not merely intend to cheat the spirits, but is symbolically equivalent to the meditational and ritual act of \"taking off one's clothes\", that is, discarding one\u2019s old persona (Pregadio 2018: 391).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Baopuzi\"><i>Baopuzi</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Baopuzi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Daoist scholar <a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Hong\" title=\"Ge Hong\">Ge Hong</a>'s c. 320 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Baopuzi\" title=\"Baopuzi\">Baopuzi</a></i> (Master who Embraces Simplicity) reflects contemporary understanding of <i>shijie</i> during the <a href=\"/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420)\" title=\"Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)\">Jin dynasty</a> (265\u2013420). Two \"Inner Chapters\" mention <i>shijie</i>, and Ge's appended \"Daoist Library\" records the <i>Shijie jing</i> (\u5c38\u89e3\u7d93, Classic of <i>Shijie</i>), which is no longer extant (Ware 1966: 382).\n</p><p>One passage about the 2nd century BCE <i>fangshi</i> Li Shaojun (\u674e\u5c11\u541b, mentioned in the <i>Lunheng</i> above) lists <i>shijie</i> as the lowest category of <i>xian</i> transcendents after <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tian\" title=\"Tian\">tian</a></i> (heavenly) and <a href=\"/wiki/Di_(Chinese_concept)\" title=\"Di (Chinese concept)\">di</a><i> (earthly).</i>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The manuals of the immortals say that masters of the highest category are able to raise themselves high up into the aery void; these are called 'celestial immortals' [<i>tianxian</i> \u5929\u4ed9]. Those of the second category resort to the famous mountains (and forests) and are called 'terrestrial immortals' [<i>dixian</i> \u5730\u4ed9]. As for those of the third category they simply slough off the body after death, and they are called 'corpse-free immortals' [<i>shijiexian</i> \u5c38\u89e3\u4ed9]. (2, tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 106, adapted from Ware 1966: 47, \"Corpse-freed Genii\") </p></blockquote>\n<p>Based on Han dynasty sources, Ge Hong concludes that Li Shaojun must have been a <i>shijiexian</i> because long after his death from illness, <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Han\" title=\"Emperor Wu of Han\">Emperor Wu of Han</a> (r. 141-87) had the coffin opened, and it was found to contain \"only a gown and hat\". Ge gives three other <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Han\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastern Han\">Eastern Han</a> (25-220 CE) adepts who were <i>shijie</i> transcendents. Xie Yuanyi (\u8b1d\u5143\u4e00) took Fei Changfang (\u8cbb\u9577\u623f) away and left \"a bamboo effigy to be buried in his place\"; Li Yiqi (\u674e\u610f\u671f) and two disciples \"died\" in <a href=\"/wiki/Pidu_District\" title=\"Pidu District\">Pixian</a>, but when their families opened their coffins they found in each \"a bamboo staff with red writing on it\" (tr. Ware 1966: 47-48). \n</p><p>In another <i>Baopuzi</i> passage, Ge Hong denounced as a charlatan the healer Li Kuan (\u674e\u5bec), who treated illnesses with holy water and amulets and became extremely popular in south China. Ge's personal acquaintances who had witnessed Li's healing rituals, using \"very shallow\" recipes, unanimously said he was frail, senile, and no different from ordinary old people. After Li Kuan died from a virulent plague, his followers repeatedly claimed that he had metamorphosed into a <i>xian</i> transcendent through \"release as a corpse and that his was not a true death\". Ge concluded that Li's death proved he was \"not the right type of individual\" to become a <i>shijiexian</i> (tr. Ware 1966: 159-160).\n</p><p>In the <i>Baopuzi</i>, Ge Hong considered processes like <i>shijie</i> to be perfectly natural. \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual? (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 284, adapted from Ware 1966: 62) </p></blockquote>\n<p>During <a href=\"/wiki/Zhou_dynasty\" title=\"Zhou dynasty\">Zhou dynasty</a> funerals, amulets of jade, beads or cicadas, were placed in the mouth of the dead (Needham et al. 1976: 3).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shenxian_zhuan\"><i>Shenxian zhuan</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Shenxian zhuan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Besides the <i>Baopuzi</i>, Ge Hong also compiled the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Shenxian_Zhuan\" title=\"Shenxian Zhuan\">Shenxian Zhuan</a></i> (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that provides more information about <i>shijie</i> than the earlier <i><a href=\"/wiki/Liexian_Zhuan\" title=\"Liexian Zhuan\">Liexian Zhuan</a></i> above. Five hagiographies of <i>xian</i> directly mention <i>shijie</i> and many others allude to it with finding empty coffins, such as Ling Shouguang (\u9748\u58fd\u5149).\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ling Shouguang was a native of <a href=\"/wiki/Fufeng_County\" title=\"Fufeng County\">Fufeng</a>. At the age of over seventy obtained a method for [making] \"efflorescence of vermilion\" pills. These he synthesized and ingested, with the result that his appearance was that of a person in his twenties. By the first year of the [Latter] Han <i>jian'an</i> period [196 CE] he was already two hundred twenty years old. Later, without having shown any signs of illness, he \"died\" at the home of Hu Gang (\u80e1\u5ca1) in <a href=\"/wiki/Jiangling_County\" title=\"Jiangling County\">Jiangling</a>. Over a hundred days after his funeral and burial, someone saw Ling in Xiaohuang. This person sent a letter to Hu Gang, who, upon receiving the letter, dug up the coffin and looked inside. It was empty except for an old shoe. (tr. Campany 2002: 232) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Wang Yuan's (\u738b\u9060) hagiography has a rare description of how the <i>shijie</i> process feels. Wang explains to his pupil Cai Jing (\u8521\u7d93):\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"By birth, you are destined to transcend the world; you will be chosen as a replacement for an office. But your knowledge of the Way is scant; your pneumas are few and you have much flesh. You cannot ascend [directly] in this condition, but must avail yourself of shijie. It's like passing out through a dog's hole [too narrow to permit a person easy passage], that's all.\" Then Wang declared to Cai the essential teachings, and left him. Soon Cai felt his entire body grow hot as if on fire. He craved cold water to bathe himself in; his entire family brought water and poured it over him, and it was like making steam by pouring water over hot rocks. This went on for three days. Then, once his bones had completely dissolved, he stood up, went into his room, and covered himself with a blanket. Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell. (tr. Campany 2002: 260) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Cai Jing's <i>shijie</i> is not merely escape by means of a simulated corpse that leaves behind the adept's possession (shoe, staff, etc.) but a transformative refinement that dissolves their bones (believed to be the seat of lifespan allotment) and leaves behind only their skin. Thus, Campany suggests translating Cai Jing's case as \"'release from one's corpse', where the 'corpse' is all the dross of one's own former, impure body, refined away to leave one with a newly incorruptible body\" (2002: 266).\n</p><p>The hagiography of Yin Changsheng (\u9670\u9577\u751f), who supposedly lived over three hundred years, estimates the frequency of adepts achieving <i>shijie</i>. \"In upper antiquity, there were many transcendents, so many that they cannot all be accounted for. But since the rise of the Han, only forty-five persons have attained transcendence\u2014forty-six counting myself. Twenty of them did so via 'escape by means of a simulated corpse,' the rest all ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.\" (tr. Campany 2002: 275).\n</p><p>Campany summarizes five common features of <i>shijie</i> stories in the <i>Shenxian zhuan</i> and other early hagiographies.\n</p>\n<ol><li>Some adepts, when about to perform <i>shijie</i>, pretend to be ill and make a public announcement to that effect. This can now be seen as motivated by the need to make the \"death\" more believable\u2014something necessary only if the death is being staged with intent to deceive.</li>\n<li>When, after his feigned death, the adept is sighted alive, it is always at a distant place.</li>\n<li>When, after such a sighting, the coffin is opened and found devoid of a corpse, some other object is always present instead\u2014a talisman, a sword, a piece of clothing, or an entire outfit in the shape of a body. These objects are the substrata of the ritually and meditationally produced, illusory corpse that replaced the adept's own body long enough for him to escape. They are, in fact, so many <i>shi</i> \u5c38\u2014not in the sense of actual corpses but in the sense of ritual impersonator or simulacrum of the dead in the mortuary and commemorative rites.</li>\n<li>If, in the narrative, the adept ever returns home (and often he does not), he does so only after considerable time has passed\u2014usually more than a generation.</li>\n<li>In some cases, the adept is said to have changed his names after performing <i>shijie</i>. The ubiquity of sobriquets rather than proper names for the subjects of hagiographies is probably also due to the name-changing strategy for eluding detection by spirits. (Campany 2002: 58-59)</li></ol>\n<p>However, not every <i>shijie</i> narrative in the <i>Shenxian zhuan</i> conforms to these patterns.

Perfected Consort An (\u5b89\u5983) suggests <i>jianjie</i> (\u528d\u89e3, escape by means of a sword; here written <i>jiejian</i> \u89e3\u528d) to her spirit-fianc\u00e9 Yang Xi, \"My lord, if you can't abide the smoke from windblown flames and wish to embrace Perfected form in a secluded wood, then could you just seek the Way of escape by means of the sword and perform the technique of announcing [your own] end? If you finish yourself off, doing it openly or in secret and leaving your trace [corpse-simulacrum] concealed or in plain view are matters to be separately arranged at the last moment. It's all up to you, discerning lord!\" (tr. Smith 2013: 101). \n</p><p>A <i>Zhen'gao</i> revelation from Mao Gu (\u8305\u56fa), one of the Three Lords Mao, discloses to Xu Mi that his missing elder brother Xu Mai (\u8a31\u9081, 300-348), had paired with a Perfected partner, retreated into the mountains, and escaped from the world by means of a \"simulated corpse\" (Smith 2013: 18). Another context says Xu Mai studied under his teacher Wang Shilong (\u738b\u4e16\u9f8d), and \"received the Way of loosening constraints [<i>jieshu zhi dao</i> \u89e3\u675f\u4e4b\u885c], practiced the method of walking backward, consumed jade fluid, and had audience at Brain-Essence [Palace]\". This \"Way of loosening constraints\" may refer to the <i>shijie</i> variety called <i>jiedai</i> (\u89e3\u5e2f, escape leaving one's waistband behind) (Smith 2013: 276). Others revelations tell Xu Hui that he will perform a \"nocturnal escape\", which apparently means staging death under cover of night, without using a simulacrum like a sword or staff, and tell Xu Mi that he is too preoccupied with worldly affairs to escape immediately (Smith 2013: 299).\n</p><p><i>Zhen'gao</i> passages provide a general outline of a complicated <i>shijie</i> process, which goes through several stages, usually over a span of many years. First, the practitioner must become \"suitably detached\" from worldly affairs. Second, one must be in the correct frame of mind that views life and death as opposite banks of the same river\u2014\"both are equal and essential\". Third, after one escapes, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hun_and_po\" title=\"Hun and po\">hun</a></i> cloud-souls go to Grand Yin, the <i>po</i> earth-souls enter the earth, and the Four Numina and Five Male Ones preserve the body's seminal essence and five viscera. Fourth, once the cloud-souls arrive at Grand Yin (a place far in the north), they undergo further refinement, in a process like that which takes place in the alchemist's sealed crucible. Finally, all those who are fit for the process inevitably wake up as Perfected. \"Only then can the practitioner truly understand the wondrousness of the spirit immortals' \"dying but not perishing\" and the profundity of the principles governing life and death\". (Smith 2013: 300).\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Zhao_Cui\" title=\"Zhao Cui\">Zhao Cui</a> (d. 622 BCE) was a legendary Daoist transcendent who assisted <a href=\"/wiki/Duke_Wen_of_Jin\" title=\"Duke Wen of Jin\">Duke Wen of Jin</a> (r. 636-628), and the <i>Zhen'gao</i> records that five to six years after he died, \"a man travelling through the mountains one evening spotted this corpse inside a rock chamber. The flesh had rotted, but the bones remained. He also saw that the five viscera in the abdomen were still alive as before. The [bodily] fluids and blood were wrapped in bundles therein; a purple placenta was woven on the outside.\" (tr. Smith 2013: 302-303)\n</p><p>Many <i>Zhen'gao</i> passages mention alchemical drugs as a means to achieving <i>shijie</i> \"release from the corpse\". Chinese alchemists were  aware that the metallic compounds produced in their furnaces were highly poisonous, but they believed that the practitioner would suffer only an apparent death while in fact passing into the heavens without dying (Bokenkamp 1997: 291; Smith 2013: 284). One context lists historical figures who achieved <i>shijie</i> by consuming the powerful alchemical <a href=\"/wiki/Langgan#Alchemy\" title=\"Langgan\">Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence</a>, which was compounded from <a href=\"/wiki/Toxic_heavy_metal\" title=\"Toxic heavy metal\">toxic heavy metals</a>.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those who feigned construction of a tomb after swallowing Efflorescence of Langgan are Yan Menzi [\u884d\u9580\u5b50], Gao Qiuzi [\u9ad9\u4e18\u5b50], and Master Hongyai [\u6d2a\u6daf\u5148\u751f]. The residents of the three counties (in which their graves are found) all call them vacant tumuli of the dead of highest antiquity. They are unaware, though, that on one occasion Gao Qiuzi entered Mount Liujing through liberation by means of a corpse. He afterwards consumed a powder of Liquefied Gold [\u91d1\u6db2], then ingested Efflorescence of Langgan at Zhongshan and feigned the appearance of still another death, whereupon he at last entered Xuanzhou [\u7384\u5dde, \"dark region\" netherworld]. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 131, cf. Needham and Lu 1974: 296) </p></blockquote>\n<p>These practitioners notably do not ascend into the Shangqing heavens but live among the terrestrial paradises. \n</p><p>The Shangqing School founder, <a href=\"/wiki/Wei_Huacun\" title=\"Wei Huacun\">Wei Huacun</a>, who supposedly performed <i>shijie</i> herself (Bokenkamp 1997: 251), describes some others who performed it.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finding the Way and leaving the world is done either visibly or in secret. Using the body to leave a trace behind is the secret [approach to] the Way. Some have taken two swigs of rose-gem essence and knocked on their coffins, or consumed a speck of it once and had their corpses rot.

Smith 2013: 295-298) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Sima Jizhu (\u53f8\u99ac\u5b63\u4e3b) was a diviner for Han Emperor Wen (r. 180-157 BCE); \"head and feet in different places\" (<i>t\u00f3uz\u00fay\u00ecch\u00f9</i> \u982d\u8db3\u7570\u51e5) is a <a href=\"/wiki/Fixed_expression\" title=\"Fixed expression\">fixed expression</a> for beheaded persons. The <i>Zhen'gao</i> translator Thomas E. Smith describes Wei Huacun as employing \"graveyard humor\", such as the name for <a href=\"/wiki/Mica#Mica_powder\" title=\"Mica\">mica powder</a>, <i>yunsan</i> (\u4e91\u6563, lit. \"disperse like clouds\") with <i>san</i> (\u6563 also meaning \"scatter; vanish; (<a href=\"/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine\" title=\"Traditional Chinese medicine\">TCM</a>) powdered medicine\"), which is a pun for \"vanishing powder\" (2013: 300).\n</p><p>The <i>Shangqing</i> classic <i>Jianjing</i> (\u528d\u5de0, Sword Scripture) compares several <i>shijie</i> alchemical preparations and says the <i>lingwan</i> (\u9748\u4e38, Numinous Bolus) elixir is the only one that permits the adept to return home without changing his or her name. The <i>Zhen'gao</i> Appendix to the <i>Jianjing</i> describes the range of different techniques.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those who manage to escape by means of the corpse through the use of other medicines and are not transformed by means of the Numinous Bolus may not, in any case, return to their hometowns, for the Three Offices would detain them. There are those who die and revive. There are those who get beheaded, only to emerge [again] from one side. There are those whose corpses disappear before encoffinment. There are those whose human forms remain but whose bones are not recovered, those whose clothes remain but whose forms disappear, and those whose hair falls out but whose forms are lost. Departing in broad daylight is called a superior escape by corpse, and departing at midnight is called an inferior escape by corpse. (Smith 2013: 304-305) </p></blockquote>\n<p>This passage distinguishes two grades of <i>shijie</i> by the time of day when the adept leaves the world, superior <i>bairi</i> (\u767d\u65e5, daytime; broad daylight) and inferior <i>yeban</i> (\u591c\u534a, midnight). The term <i>bairi</i> is usually translated as \"in broad daylight\" but more precisely means \"midday; noon\", in contrast to <i>shijie</i> proper at midnight. Hagiographies of Daoist immortals provide many examples of ascension to Heaven occurring exactly at midday, often expressed with the stock phrase <i>bairi shengtian</i> (\u767d\u65e5\u6607\u5929, \"ascending to Heaven in broad daylight\"). These two ways of deliverance are distinguished by opposite but corresponding <i><a href=\"/wiki/Yin_and_yang\" title=\"Yin and yang\">yinyang</a></i> features: ascent and descent, midday and midnight, light and darkness, sun and moon. On one hand, ascent to Heaven is the way of non-return to the world, a spiritual journey ascending from one empyrean to the next. On the other, descent to Great Darkness is the way of return, one obtains a \"second birth\" and eventually comes back to the world (Pregadio 2004: 122).\n</p><p>The reason for this inferior status of an adept who performs <i>shijie</i> is that despite their having attained an advanced spiritual state, it is insufficient for them to \"ascend to heaven in broad daylight\", and they need to undergo a transformational \"refining the bodily form\". As long as the adept continues dwelling in their physical body, they are able to focus upon creating their perfected body (Pregadio 2018: 391).\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Li_Tieguai,_by_Huang_Shen,_1757.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Li_Tieguai%2C_by_Huang_Shen%2C_1757.jpg/220px-Li_Tieguai%2C_by_Huang_Shen%2C_1757.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"471\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Li_Tieguai%2C_by_Huang_Shen%2C_1757.jpg/330px-Li_Tieguai%2C_by_Huang_Shen%2C_1757.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Li_Tieguai%2C_by_Huang_Shen%2C_1757.jpg/440px-Li_Tieguai%2C_by_Huang_Shen%2C_1757.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"1711\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Li_Tieguai,_by_Huang_Shen,_1757.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Huang_Shen\" title=\"Huang Shen\">Huang Shen</a>'s painting of Li Tieguai, 1757</div></div></div>\n<p>Logically, a question about <i>shijie</i> occurs: \"If \"release from the corpse\" serves to leave one\u2019s ordinary body and to generate a \"perfected body\", why would an adept ever return to their mortal body from which they wanted to be liberated?\" The famed legend of <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Tieguai\" title=\"Li Tieguai\">Li Tieguai</a> (\"Iron-Crutch Li\"), one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Eight_Immortals\" title=\"Eight Immortals\">Eight Immortals</a> in the Daoist pantheon, illustrates that the function of this \"recovered\" body is to provide a means to cultivate the \"perfected\" body. Once when Li Tieguai was in deep meditation, his spirit left his body and was roaming in the heavens, but his disciples mistakenly thought that he had died and cremated what they believed was his corpse. When his spirit returned, Li realized that since his original body was no longer available, he had to enter the only available corpse, that of a lame beggar who had recently starved to death. Thus, what is to be \"perfected\" through <i>shijie</i> is not the physical form, Iron-Crutch only needed a body in order to continue his Daoist practices. \"Even in this uncommon case of a forced \"release from the mortal body\", the focus of the practice is the perfected body.\" (Pregadio 2018: 392).\n</p><p>The <i>Zhen'gao'</i>s Examination of the Corpse section is widely quoted (Strickmann 1979: 182). It gives wide-ranging criteria for verifying <i>shijie</i> \"escape by an apparent corpse\", reflecting the wide variety of escape methods and contingent factors (e.g., choosing to escape openly or secretly) that would tend to leave different signs on the corpse.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a person dies, you must look at the body. If it is like that of a living person, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If you see that the feet are not blue and the skin is not wrinkled, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If the light of the eyes is undimmed and no different from that of a living person, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If all the head hair has fallen out but the body and bones are missing, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If an [apparent] escape by corpse occurs in broad daylight, then even though [the person] is an immortal it is not an instance of escape by corpse. (tr. Smith 2013: 300-301) </p></blockquote>\n<p>Most of these criteria would allow a deceased master's disciples to announce that he or she had successfully achieved <i>shijie</i> \"escape by corpse\", except the one \"broad daylight\" criterion for not attaining <i>shijie</i> that actually indicates the highest form of transcendence, directly rising to heaven. Declaring successful <i>shijie</i> is easy, \"none of the criteria are negative indicators of a failed quest\". (Smith 2013: 301).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Daojiaoyishu\"><i>Daojiaoyishu</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Daojiaoyishu\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Even though the word <i>shijie</i> (\u5c38\u89e3) was in use during the 1st century CE, before Buddhism had any influence in China, the meaning was probably later influenced by <i>ji\u011btu\u014d</i> (\u89e3\u812b)\u2014the Chinese Buddhist translation of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Moksha\" title=\"Moksha\">moksha</a></i> (liberation, emancipation, release) (Pas 1998: 58). Cross-borrowings between Buddhism and Daoism were so pervasive that many narratives about <a href=\"/wiki/Bhikkhu\" title=\"Bhikkhu\">Buddhist monks</a> include supposedly distinctive Daoist practices such as <i>shijie</i> (liberation from the corpse) and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bigu_(grain_avoidance)\" title=\"Bigu (grain avoidance)\">bigu</a></i> (grain avoidance) (Campany 1996: 329, 2009: 59). For instance, the 648 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Jin\" title=\"Book of Jin\">Book of Jin</a></i> records that the Buddhist monk Shan Daokai (\u55ae\u885c\u958b), a contemporary of the Central Asian missionary <a href=\"/wiki/Fotudeng\" title=\"Fotudeng\">Fotudeng</a> (c. 232-348 CE), \"achieved a cicada-like metamorphosis by ingesting pills\" (Needham et al. 1976: 112).\n</p><p>The c. 700 Buddhist-influenced text <i>Daojiaoyishu</i> (\u885c\u654e\u7fa9\u6a1e, Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings) describes <i>shijie</i> as the second of three types of <i>bianhua</i> transformations. \nThe first is adepts who \"ascend to Heaven in broad daylight\" (<i>bairi shengtian</i> \u767d\u65e5\u6607\u5929), merge with the divine, and roam together with the gods, which means that \"one's entire person ascends to Heaven\".\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The second [type of transformation] is \"release from the corpse\" (<i>shijie</i>). Some replace their corpse with a sword or a bamboo staff; all of a sudden, they rise up and go, and abruptly they are no longer there. Some leave behind their skin. Some receive a funeral and are buried, but then if their coffin is opened there is only a staff or a shoe. Some roam to the five sacred peaks, while some can rise to Heaven. In the Southern Palace (Nangong) there is the Court of Flowing Fire (<i>liuhuo zhi ting</i>); in the Golden Gate (Jinmen) there is the Water of Smelting Refinement (<i>yelian zhi shui</i>). All those who inwardly ascend to Heaven while they are alive must first go to the Court of Fire (<i>huoting</i>) in order to refine their form and spirit, while those who rise to heaven after their death must first go the Courtly Pond (<i>tingchi</i>) in order to refine their celestial soul(s) (<i>hun</i>) and body frame. All this accords with the results of their practice (<i>gongye</i>). </p></blockquote>\n<p>The third is \"transfer by extinction\" (<i>miedu</i> \u70d5\u5ea6, the Chinese Buddhist name for \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nirvana\" title=\"Nirvana\">Nirvana</a>\"), \"The mortal form (<i>shixing</i>) does not become ashes, as if the corpse is guarded by the Great One (<a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_theology#Taiyi\" title=\"Chinese theology\">Taiyi</a>) itself. Sometimes, after years, the corpse reverts to be a human being.\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 118). The <i>shijie</i> implements such as a sword or shoe perform a function similar to the <i>tishen</i> (\u66ff\u8eab, \"replacement bodies\") used in some Daoist rites to represent the adept's negative and \"unrefined\" aspects, worldly bonds which made it impossible for one to achieve a higher form of liberation in life (Pregadio 2004: 125-126).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Interpretations\">Interpretations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Interpretations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The term <i>shijie</i> \"corpse deliverance\" has \"baffled scholars because the ideas and practices behind it have remained quite murky\", perhaps owing to intentional secrecy among Daoist initiates (Campany 2002: 52).

Two possible results of <i>shijie</i> \"liberation from the corpse\" were either an empty coffin if the physical body had fully etherealized, or the changeless perpetuation of an adept's light body, never showing any signs of post-mortem decomposition (1974: 284).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Body_preservation\">Body preservation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Body preservation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Xin_Zhui_3.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Xin_Zhui_3.JPG/220px-Xin_Zhui_3.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Xin_Zhui_3.JPG/330px-Xin_Zhui_3.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Xin_Zhui_3.JPG/440px-Xin_Zhui_3.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3000\" data-file-height=\"4000\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Xin_Zhui_3.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The perfectly preserved body of <a href=\"/wiki/Xin_Zhui\" title=\"Xin Zhui\">Xin Zhui</a> (d. 163 BCE)</div></div></div>\n<p>Needham and Lu also interpret that the remarkably well-preserved body of <a href=\"/wiki/Xin_Zhui\" title=\"Xin Zhui\">Xin Zhui</a> or Lady Dai (d. 163 BCE), discovered in 1972 among <a href=\"/wiki/Mawangdui\" title=\"Mawangdui\">Mawangdui</a> tombs, showed that early Chinese mortuary specialists, whom they presume were Daoists, had sufficiently advanced chemical knowledge and skill to achieve an almost perpetual conservation, which suggests \"for the first time all that [<i>shijie</i>] may have implied\".

For a Daoist religious believer, suicide could sometimes be an  acceptable way to escape during periods of social or political trouble. For example, <a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Xuan\" title=\"Ge Xuan\">Ge Xuan</a> (164-244) resorted to <i>shijie</i> to flee from the oppression of <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Jin\" title=\"Emperor Wu of Jin\">Emperor Wu of Jin</a> (1979: 132-133).\n</p><p>In response, Isabelle Robinet contended that <i>shijie</i> \"liberation from the body\" was not a ritual suicide\u2014an \"interpretation that has grown up without any supporting evidence\"\u2014but instead a procedure of salvation after death. When a practitioner dies before completing spiritual purification, a kind of \"partial death\" takes place, with an afterlife in an intermediate realm while it awaits a more complete purification and final deliverance (1997: 138).\n</p><p>Ursula-Angelika Cedzich concurs with Strickman's ritual suicide hypothesis. In one of the best-documented cases, Tao Hongjing's disciple <a href=\"/wiki/Tao_Hongjing#Reclusion_on_Maoshan\" title=\"Tao Hongjing\">Zhou Ziliang</a> (\u5468\u5b50\u826f, 497-516) received visions from Perfected Ones who guaranteed him transcendence into Shangqing heavens, and gave instructions how to compound a deadly potion of mushrooms and cinnabar, with which he committed suicide (2001: 33-34, 37-39).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resurrection\">Resurrection</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Resurrection\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another interpretation of <i>shijie</i> centers around similarities with <a href=\"/wiki/Resurrection\" title=\"Resurrection\">resurrection</a> as the concept of coming back to life after death. \n</p><p>Donald Harper studied documents found in Late Warring States tombs, including an official report that recounts a spectacular resurrection story. A man named Dan (\u4e39, cinnabar), who was employed by a general in the <a href=\"/wiki/Wei_(state)\" title=\"Wei (state)\">Wei</a> army, committed suicide in 300 BCE because he had murdered a man. After Dan's burial, however, the general filed an official bureaucratic complaint with the netherworld administration claiming that he had not yet been \"fated\" to die, and they subsequently released Dan from the grave and returned him to the world of the living in 297 BCE (1994: 13-14). However, it took several years after his resurrection before Dan could hear or eat food again, and \"his four limbs were useless\" (1994: 22-23). Harper suggests that the concept of <i>shijie</i> began around the 1st century CE from a synthesis of ancient beliefs about resurrecting the dead and the Daoist notion of <i>xian</i> transcendence/immortality, \"shijie was a special form of resurrection with elements that distinguished it from an already existing belief in resurrection in popular religion\" (1994: 25).\n</p><p>Julian Pas says that when Daoism adopted the <i>shijie</i> procedure, properly translated here not as \"liberation from the body\" but as \"liberation through the body\", it changed the focus from relying on official documents to revive a dead person to relying on self-cultivation to metamorphize into a <i>xian</i> transcendent (1998: 59). In addition, <i>shijie</i> has some parallels with Christian <a href=\"/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead\" title=\"Resurrection of the dead\">resurrection of the dead</a> in which the deceased body is reunited with the soul. Describing the <a href=\"/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus\" title=\"Resurrection of Jesus\">resurrection of Jesus</a>, the Bible says his tomb was found empty, except for some <a href=\"/wiki/Empty_tomb#Grave_clothes\" title=\"Empty tomb\">grave clothes</a>\u2014which is reminiscent of Daoist <i>shijie</i> cases when the master's coffin is found empty except for some article of clothing left behind (1998: 60).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Escaping_difficulties\">Escaping difficulties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shijie_(Daoism)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Escaping difficulties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In some cases, a Daoist adept carrying out <i>shijie</i> \"escape by means of a corpse\" was not attempting miraculous transcendence but was simply absconding from difficult demands, such as when <a href=\"/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Jin\" title=\"Emperor Wu of Jin\">Emperor Wu of Jin</a> indefinitely detained <a href=\"/wiki/Ge_Xuan\" title=\"Ge Xuan\">Ge Xuan</a>, he told his disciple, \"I do not have the leisure to prepare the great drug [of immortality].

For similar reasons, Feng Liang (\u99ae\u826f) supposedly killed his horse, smashed his carriage, tore his clothes to pieces, and disappeared. Everyone believed that wild animals had killed him, and his family buried the remains found at the site\u2014but Feng returned more than ten years later (Cedzich 2011: 40).\n</p><p>Narratives involving this expedient type of <i>shijie</i> have common themes of <a href=\"/wiki/Name_change\" title=\"Name change\">name change</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Identity_creation\" title=\"Identity creation\">identity creation</a> (Cedzich 2011: 27).
