Most of the pyramids of the Old Kingdom were built here, along with many mastabas and other tombs. Saqqara is the site of the first Egyptian pyramid, the Pyramid of Djoser.  The size of the necropolis is 2.5 by 6 kilometres, located about 30 kilometres south of Cairo.  Burials in the necropolis include the Apis bulls, falcons, ibises, baboons,    and boats.
