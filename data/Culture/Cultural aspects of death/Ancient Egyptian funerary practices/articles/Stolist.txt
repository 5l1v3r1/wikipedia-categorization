Stolist is a term used to describe something within the culture of ancient Egypt. The stolist was a person participating within the society of ancient Egypt who held the rank of priest, and whom we understand to have been an adorner of divine images. At some time stolist belonged to a group or guild known as nekrostolisteis, as is attested to by the archaeological finds of the Siwa oasis, this particularly being an inscription dating to the 1st century C.E.
