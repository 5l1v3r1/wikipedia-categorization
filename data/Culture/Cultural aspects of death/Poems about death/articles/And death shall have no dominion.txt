"And death shall have no dominion" is a poem written by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914â€“1953). The title comes from St. Paul's epistle to the Romans (6:9).  In early 1933 Thomas befriended Bert Trick, a grocer who worked in the Uplands area of Swansea.  Trick was an amateur poet who had several poems published in local papers. In spring 1933 Trick suggested the two men both write a poem on the subject of 'immortality'. Trick's poem, which was published in a newspaper the following year, contained the refrain "For death is not the end."  In 1933, in a notebook marked 'April', Thomas wrote the poem "And death shall have no dominion". Trick persuaded him to seek a publisher and in May of that year it was printed in New English Weekly.  On 10 September 1936, two years after the release of his first volume of poetry (18 Poems), Twenty-five Poems was published. It revealed Thomas' personal beliefs pertaining to religion and the forces of nature, and included "And death shall have no dominion".
