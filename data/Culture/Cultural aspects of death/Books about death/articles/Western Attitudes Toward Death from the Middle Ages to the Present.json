He argues that prior to the seventeenth century, people were acutely aware of their own eminent death, prepared for it, and accepted it. True to his roots as a medieval historian, he cites examples such as of <a href=\"/wiki/King_Ban\" title=\"King Ban\">King Ban</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tristan\" title=\"Tristan\">Tristan</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Lancelot\" title=\"Lancelot\">Lancelot</a>\u2014these characters are shown facing death while knowing that their time has come\u201d and prepare themselves by following prescribed rituals. These rituals were often religious such as Lancelot positioning the body to be facing Jerusalem.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The dying man readied his body and soul for death and waited.\n</p><p>There were four general characteristics: first, the dying person would usually be lying in bed, or at least in a recumbent position. In the <a href=\"/wiki/Christian\" title=\"Christian\">Christian</a> tradition the dying person would lie on his or her back, facing the heavens. Second, the dying person in this period always presided over his death and understood its accompanying religious rituals and protocol. The priest was not brought until he was called for, and loved ones did not say goodbye until the dying person consented. Third, death was a public ceremony and parents, spouses, family, neighbors and even children were present at the bedside. Death was seen as <a href=\"/wiki/Norm_(sociology)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Norm (sociology)\">normal</a> and it was customary for loved ones to witness the occasion. Finally,  while accepted and witnessed, it lacked \u201ctheatrics\u201d and a \u201cgreat show of emotions.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s explains his choice of \u201cTamed Death\u201d as a title is meant to contrast with the \u201cwild\u201d death of the twentieth century, in which people fear and avoid death.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In this early medieval period people were not concerned with what would happen to their bodies after death. For superstitious reasons they did not want the dead to be buried in cities or near the houses of the living, but if the body was buried in a <a href=\"/wiki/Churchyard\" title=\"Churchyard\">churchyard</a> and remained under the church\u2019s protection, little else mattered. People did not believe that the grave should be permanent (especially the graves of the poor) and <a href=\"/wiki/Ossuaries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ossuaries\">ossuaries</a> were very common.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Moreover, the burial grounds were common meeting places where dancing, gambling, and even commerce took place.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"One.27s_Own_Death\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"One's_Own_Death\">One's Own Death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Western_Attitudes_Toward_Death_from_the_Middle_Ages_to_the_Present&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: One&#039;s Own Death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Subtle changes in western people\u2019s attitudes toward death occurred around the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Ari\u00e8s titled this mentality shift: \u201cOne\u2019s Own Death.\u201d The defining feature of this era was a new <a href=\"/wiki/Personalization\" title=\"Personalization\">personalization</a> of death, in which the <a href=\"/wiki/Individual\" title=\"Individual\">individual</a> rather than the act of death itself came to the forefront. Ari\u00e8s notes four major indicators that signify this change.\n</p><p>He explains that in the previous era, the Christian tradition of <a href=\"/wiki/Last_Judgment\" title=\"Last Judgment\">Last Judgment</a> separated believers and non-believers after death. Christians alleged that during the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_coming\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second coming\">second coming</a> of Christ believers would be resurrected in <a href=\"/wiki/Paradise\" title=\"Paradise\">Paradise</a>, while non-believers would cease to exist. However, by the twelfth century Ari\u00e8s observes that Last Judgment had taken on new meaning. It came to signify judgment passed on one\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Soul\" title=\"Soul\">soul</a> after the moment of death. In the new Christian tradition, people believed that after death their good and bad deeds would be weighed against each other, and based on those deeds they would be either dammed or admitted immediately into heaven.  This made death more personal and individual.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s notes that the actual moment of death began to gain greater significance, as Christians believed that a person\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Deathbed_confession\" title=\"Deathbed confession\">deathbed</a> behavior and personal reflection on their own deeds, at the moment of death, could influence heavenly judgment. As in the previous era friends and family were often present, but their presence became more closely tied to witnessing the moment before judgment rather than simply witnessing death.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Finally, in this era, depictions of <a href=\"/wiki/Corpses\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corpses\">corpses</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Skeletons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skeletons\">skeletons</a> became more prevalent, and individual <a href=\"/wiki/Tombs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tombs\">tombs</a> with inscriptions grew in popularity.  Although Ari\u00e8s religious artwork had featured <a href=\"/wiki/Macabre\" title=\"Macabre\">macabre</a> themes in the past, by the seventeenth century there was an influx of artwork that featured decaying cadavers and the physical body after death. Ari\u00e8s argues that this artwork was meant warn against moral corruption and also express love of life. He states that men of that era felt a \u201clove of life which we today can scarcely understand,\u201d due to our increased longevity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s also notes that by the thirteenth century individual tombs with inscriptions were becoming more typical, especially for the religious elite and royalty. Although during the <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_funerals_and_burial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman funerals and burial\">Roman</a> period individual graves had not been uncommon, this practice had faded during the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_ages\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Middle ages\">middle ages</a>. By the eighteenth century,   the middle and lower classes were also likely to have tombs, or at least plaques, marked with individual inscriptions. As people became more conscious of their individual place in the world, their death reflected that awareness <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thy_Death\">Thy Death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Western_Attitudes_Toward_Death_from_the_Middle_Ages_to_the_Present&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Thy Death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>By the early eighteenth century, Ari\u00e8s observed an abrupt change in the western person\u2019s attitude toward death. Death was dramatized, exalted, feared, and in some cases worshipped.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Looking to themes in artwork from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, Ari\u00e8s argues that death became categorically similar to sex, and was seen as a break from the ordinary. Although the erotic associations with death did not last beyond a that short period, he maintains that death was no longer normalized. People did not look at death as a familiar occasion that was part of life, as they had in the past. Although people continued to participate socially and ritualistically in death, and crowds still flocked to the bedside of a dying person, their purpose had changed. Instead of witnessing death, they <a href=\"/wiki/Mourning\" title=\"Mourning\">mourned</a> it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although <a href=\"/wiki/Mourning\" title=\"Mourning\">mourning</a> was not completely new in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Ari\u00e8s argues that it became unregulated. It was less of a ritualized social obligation, and more of a spontaneous and often excessive display of <a href=\"/wiki/Emotions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emotions\">emotions</a>. Ari\u00e8s maintains that survivors no long accepted the death of friends and loved ones. He states that people of this period lamented that death was such a complete rupture from life and were consoled by preserving the <a href=\"/wiki/Memory\" title=\"Memory\">memory</a> of the deceased. Memorializing the dead became an important feature of the period of \u201cthy death.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There was also a renewed interest in <a href=\"/wiki/Burial\" title=\"Burial\">burial</a> grounds and <a href=\"/wiki/Grave_marker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grave marker\">grave markers</a>. In the past Christians had been content to relinquish bodies to the care of the <a href=\"/wiki/Catholic_Church\" title=\"Catholic Church\">church</a>. Even when gravestones became more prevalent, Ari\u00e8s argues that they were predominantly an expression of individuality or representative of individual donations to the church. However, by the eighteenth century, bodies were buried away from the church in individual <a href=\"/wiki/Cemetery\" title=\"Cemetery\">cemetery</a> plots, where people felt they could commiserate with the dead and cultivate their memory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s also observes that while all western people celebrated cemeteries and their new role in society, France, Italy, and Germany are known for more elaborate tombs and burial sites when compared to the simplistic style of North America, the UK, and Northwestern Europe. He suggests that this trend is due to economic inequalities; poorer nations were more inclined to build elaborate tombs as a statement against the elegant simplicity that wealthier nations promoted.  Ari\u00e8s also notes that because the countries that favored more ornate tombs were also <a href=\"/wiki/Catholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Catholic\">Catholic</a>, it later became indicative of religion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Forbidden_Death\">Forbidden Death</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Western_Attitudes_Toward_Death_from_the_Middle_Ages_to_the_Present&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Forbidden Death\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The final period Ari\u00e8s demarcates in the evolution of western attitudes toward death is the era of \u201cforbidden death.\u201d Beginning in the very late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ari\u00e8s argues that a \u201cbrutal revolution\u201d occurred in western attitudes toward death, in which death became both shameful and forbidden. While this trend began in the United States - spreading to England, Northwestern Europe, and eventually the whole of the continent - the bulk of his analysis in this section deals primarily with England and Europe. Growing out of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sentimentality\" title=\"Sentimentality\">sentimental</a> era of \u201cthy death,\u201d in which survivors mourned the death of loved ones openly, spontaneously, and with heightened displays of emotion, it soon became common practice to shield the people actually dying from the reality of their condition. The mourner, so moved by the gravity of death, wished to spare their dying loved one any emotional turmoil. Thus in the era of \u201cforbidden death\u201d the dying man no longer presided over his own death. Soon the extreme emotions that survivors expressed in the previous period were replaced with an equally extreme avoidance of death and suppression of emotion that became dominant in twentieth century. Ari\u00e8s names two societal trends that he believes were very influential on shifting attitudes toward death: the advent of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital\" title=\"Hospital\">hospital</a> as a place of dying, and a growing sentiment that life should be, above all, <a href=\"/wiki/Happiness\" title=\"Happiness\">happy</a>.\n</p><p>Citing trends in <a href=\"/wiki/Literature\" title=\"Literature\">literature</a>, such as the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Tolstoy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tolstoy\">Tolstoy</a>, Ari\u00e8s argues that the feeling surrounding death changed before its actual rituals did. By 1930-1950, he states that the displacement of the site of death from the home to the hospital accelerated changes in attitude. While for most of history the dying person took his or her last breath in bed, surrounded by loved ones, now, in era of \u201cforbidden death\u201d people are more likely to end their lives alone on a hospital bed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Aries_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Aries-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s stresses that death is in the hospital is often a \u201ctechnical cession\u201d that is predetermined by a hospital team, frequently occurring after the dying person has already lost <a href=\"/wiki/Consciousness\" title=\"Consciousness\">consciousness</a>. He argues that the moment of death is difficult to distinguish for most survivors because they have already witnessed many \u201csilent deaths\u201d as the dying person loses different abilities \u2013 from <a href=\"/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation\" title=\"Mechanical ventilation\">breathing</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Feeding_tube\" title=\"Feeding tube\">eating</a> on their own, to <a href=\"/wiki/Speech\" title=\"Speech\">verbal</a> communication and eventually consciousness. He states that in this current period there is no great and dramatic act of death, which was what family, friends, and neighbors used to gather together to witness. Ari\u00e8s writes: \u201cNo one any longer has the strength or patience to wait over a period of weeks for a moment which has lost its meaning.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-Aries_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Aries-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Instead, doctors battle against death and when death finally comes it is usually considered a failure of medicine rather than a normal occurrence.\n</p><p>Ari\u00e8s second observation regarding social changes over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was that happiness became the expected dominant emotion. He states that people began to believe \u201clife is always happy or should always seem so.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Death, being sorrowful and ugly, was therefore denied. Expressing <a href=\"/wiki/Sadness\" title=\"Sadness\">sadness</a> or emotional turmoil, Ari\u00e8s argues, is likely to be equated with bad manners, mental instability, and unnecessary morbidity. Referencing anthropologist <a href=\"/wiki/Geoffrey_Gorer\" title=\"Geoffrey Gorer\">Geoffrey Gorer</a>, Ari\u00e8s states that death has replaced <a href=\"/wiki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">sex</a> as western society\u2019s greatest <a href=\"/wiki/Taboo\" title=\"Taboo\">taboo</a>. Children are less likely to be shielded from the notion of sex in the modern era, but they are not taught about death. When death occurs a child is told the deceased are \u201cresting\u201d and every effort is made to distract them from the truth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s also argues that the prevalence of <a href=\"/wiki/Cremation\" title=\"Cremation\">cremation</a> in England and parts of Europe reflects the western world\u2019s denial of death. He states that the act of cremation, with its usual lack of formality, associated rituals, and permanent location for remains is the ultimate expression of \u201cforbidden death.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although Ari\u00e8s states that many of the recent trends regarding death originated in the United States, he argues that Americans have a unique death culture that is an amalgamation of the two extreme periods \u201cthy death\u201d and \u201cforbidden death.\u201d He maintains that Americans do deny death as a part of life, and they are equally likely to die alone in a hospital, but once death actually occurs Americans have rituals that are all their own. <a href=\"/wiki/Embalming\" title=\"Embalming\">Embalming</a> became common practice in America by the early to mid-twentieth century, and American funerals are distinguished by the \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Wake_(ceremony)\" title=\"Wake (ceremony)\">wake</a>\u201d or viewing of the deceased. Ari\u00e8s maintains that both practices are far less frequent in the rest of the western world. He argues that the embalmed body is not seen as fully dead and Americans believe they can communicate their last words and goodbyes to the deceased at this moment. <a href=\"/wiki/Funeral_directors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Funeral directors\">Funeral directors</a>, he states, market themselves as \u201cdoctors of grief\u201d who can see people through the period of mourning and return them to normalcy after the rituals of death (funeral, wake, burial/cremation) are complete. In this way, Ari\u00e8s argues, death is sold like any other <a href=\"/wiki/Consumer_good\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Consumer good\">consumer good</a>. Ari\u00e8s concludes by stating that the current consensus toward death is that while we are vaguely aware of it, \u201cat heart we feel we are nonmortals.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Critical_Reception_and_Influence\">Critical Reception and Influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Western_Attitudes_Toward_Death_from_the_Middle_Ages_to_the_Present&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Critical Reception and Influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Ari\u00e8s\u2019 <i>Western Attitudes Toward Death</i> has been applauded in both the field of <a href=\"/wiki/History\" title=\"History\">history</a> and the wider world of <a href=\"/wiki/Academia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Academia\">academia</a>.

Philipe Ari\u00e8s published frequently on the subject for the remainder of his career, including a revision of <i>Western Attitudes Toward Death</i>, titled <i>The Hour of Our Death</i>, which further separated the period he called \u201cOne\u2019s Own Death,\u201d into two separate categories: \u201cThe Death of Self,\u201d and \u201cRemote and Imminent Death.\u201d This was done to take into consideration certain economic disparities in the period as well as the impact of the Reformation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Ari\u00e8s works on the history of death are now considered seminal and current historians of death rely heavily on his frameworks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although Ari\u00e8s is credited with opening the history of death up to further inquiry, many critics found that his short book spanning over a millennia of subject matter treated the subject too lightly, leaving more questions than answers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> He was accused of overgeneralization on a number of counts.

Finally, although Ari\u00e8s periodization of western attitudes toward death was one of his biggest contributions, many critics questioned the periods he established, finding them \u201cvague\u201d or unconvincing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Since the publication of <i>Western Attitudes Toward Death</i>, Ari\u00e8s, even by his critics has been hailed \u201cthe <a href=\"/wiki/Doyen\" title=\"Doyen\">doyen</a> of the historians of death.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-Porter_28-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Porter-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> As predicted by early reviewers, Ari\u00e8s\u2019 work has helped present death as a subject for serious historical inquiry. Generations of historians have since examined attitudes toward death from many vantage points \u2013 <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cultural\">cultural</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Racial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Racial\">racial</a>, socio-ecomomic \u2013 providing sharper explanations for attitude shifts in various geographic locations and time periods. The notion of \u201cForbidden Death\u201d has received particular attention from scholars and critiques of the American funeral industry were popular in the 1960s and 70s. <a href=\"/wiki/Jessica_Mitford\" title=\"Jessica Mitford\">Jessica Mitford</a>\u2019s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_American_Way_of_Death\" title=\"The American Way of Death\">The American Way of Death</a></i> exposed high profit margins for funeral directors and the large manufacturers that supply the material necessities related to burial (caskets, grave markers, etc.) <sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Similarly, <a href=\"/wiki/Ivan_Illich\" title=\"Ivan Illich\">Ivan Illich</a>, a well-known critic of modern medicine, devoted a chapter in his famed work <i>Medical Nemesis</i> to the horrors of hospital death. This chapter, he states \u201cleans heavily on the masterful essays by Philippe Ari\u00e8s.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Although many historians have commented on Ari\u00e8s\u2019 depiction of hospital death, few have commented on Ari\u00e8s\u2019 notion that the modern age is oppressed by its obsession with happiness. Historian Gary Laderman agreed that death has become a \u201cforbidden\u201d subject in recent years, but challenged Ari\u00e8s, stating: \u201cperhaps the experience of two world wars, particularly the mass destruction of the holocaust in Europe and the dropping of the atomic bomb in Japan, contributed to this reticence to discuss the subject.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>American historians, in the years that followed the publication of Western Attitudes Toward Death, became particularly interested in the deviation Ari\u00e8s noted between Americans and Europeans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/David_Stannard\" title=\"David Stannard\">David Stannard</a>, an early reviewer of Ari\u00e8s\u2019 work, penned <i>The <a href=\"/wiki/Puritan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puritan\">Puritan</a> Way of Death</i> a few short years after Ari\u00e8s\u2019 publication. He maintained that American religious practices strongly influenced their attitudes toward death. While he hoped to clarify some of the comments Ari\u00e8s made about changes in American attitudes, he applauded Ari\u00e8s <a href=\"/wiki/Social_influence\" title=\"Social influence\">seminal</a> work as both \u201cprofound and insightful.\u201d Although Philipe Ari\u00e8s\u2019 <i>Western Attitudes Toward Death</i> has been heavily critiqued, historians of death have venerated it as a <a href=\"/wiki/Classic\" title=\"Classic\">classic</a> and foundational work on the subject.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span
