Variety Obituaries is a 15-volume series with facsimile reprints of the full text of every obituary published by the entertainment trade magazine Variety from 1905 to 1994.  The first eleven volumes were published in 1988 by Garland Publishing, which subsequently became part of Routledge. Information for each deceased person can include the following: Volume 11 is the alphabetical index for 1905 to 1986. It contains approximately 120,000 names. There are multiple entries for some people, so 100,000 different people is a realistic estimate. Each of the four volumes after 1986 has its own index. Celebrities are indexed under their birth names also. For example, Cary Grant is also indexed as “Leach, Alexander Archibald”. Clara Bow is also indexed by her popular nickname “The It Girl”. The names of living celebrities appear in the index when there are obituaries for their spouses and relatives; for example, Bob Hope died after the reprints were discontinued, but immediately beneath his indexed name are the obituary references of nine of his relatives, as well as his masseur and his business agent. Non-human celebrities also appear in the index, such as Champion (Gene Autry’s horse) and Bonzo the chimpanzee. Excerpt from a review in Library Journal by John Smothers:
