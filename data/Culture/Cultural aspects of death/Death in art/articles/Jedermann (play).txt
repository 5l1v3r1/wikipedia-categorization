Jedermann (Everyman) is a play by the Austrian playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal. It is based on several medieval mystery plays, including the late 15th-century English morality play Everyman. It was first performed on 1 December 1911 in Berlin under the direction of Max Reinhardt at the Circus Schumann (which later became the Großes Schauspielhaus). Jedermann has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival since 1920,  except between 1922 and 1925 and during the years of the Nazi annexation of Austria and World War II from 1938 until 1946.   Since then, the play has been performed there every year. Amongst the most famous actors performing the title role were Curd Jürgens, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Maximilian Schell and Gert Voss. The play has been made into a film at least eight times, including in 1958,  1961,  1970,  1983,  2000,  2004,  2010,  and 2013.  The 1961 film Jedermann, directed by Max Reinhardt's son Gottfried Reinhardt and filmed at the Salzburg Festival, was submitted as the Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 34th Academy Awards, but it was not selected as one of the five nominees in the category.
