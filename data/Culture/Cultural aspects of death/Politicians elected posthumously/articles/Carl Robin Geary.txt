Carl Robin Geary, Sr, was elected mayor of Tracy City, Tennessee on April 13, 2010. Despite the fact that Mr Geary had died on March 10, he still received 268 votes, while the incumbent, Barbara Brock, only received 85. When asked what would come of her political career after losing to a dead man, Mrs Brock replied: "I'll live," she said. "I'm a survivor." The mayoral seat to which Mr Geary was elected was declared vacant and the city's four aldermen selected a new mayor.
