Teta, Alf Marra (Arabic for: Grandma, A Thousand Times) is a documentary film about a feisty Beiruti grandmother. The 50-minute film was produced in 2010 as a UAE/Qatar/Lebanon co-production with the financial support of the Doha Film Institute and Screen Institute Beirut.  The film was produced by Veritas Films. It was the first film to be released by a company based in Twofour54, Abu Dhabi’s media content creation freezone.  “Teta, Alf Marra” achieved several ‘firsts’ for the regional filmmaking industry.  It was the first locally produced documentary to show in cinemas in the UAE and secure regional distribution. It was also the first documentary produced in the GCC to qualify for Academy Awards qualification, with theatrical runs in Los Angeles and New York City.    The film is a poetic documentary that puts a feisty Beiruti grandmother at the center of brave film exercises designed to commemorate her many worlds before they are erased by the passage of time and her eventual death. Teta Fatima is the 83-year-old matriarch of the Kaabour family and the sharp-witted queen bee of an old Beiruti quarter. With great intimacy, the film documents her larger-than-life character as she struggles to cope with the silence of her once-buzzing house and imagines what awaits her beyond death. Meanwhile, her beloved violinist husband (deceased 20 years) is both an essential absence and presence. His features manifest through the face of their filmmaker grandson while his previously unpublished violin improvisations weave through her world and that of the film. Teta, Alf Marra brings together grandfather, grandmother and grandson in a playful documentary that aims to defy a past death and a future one. Teta, Alf Marra was directed by award-winning filmmaker Mahmoud Kaabour. Teta, Alf Marra has won a number of international awards, including:
