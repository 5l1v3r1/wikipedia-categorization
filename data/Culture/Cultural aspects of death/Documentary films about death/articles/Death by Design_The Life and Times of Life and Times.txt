Death by Design is a 1995 science documentary directed by Peter Friedman and Jean-François Brunet of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris which focuses on cell biology, with an emphasis on programmed cell death and why our lives depend on it.  Featured are prominent biologists such as Nobel prize laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini (along with her artist twin sister Paola Levi-Montalcini), Martin Raff, Polly Matzinger, Pierre Goldstein, and Nobel laureateRobert Horvitz. The documentary is notable for its combination of a whimsical use of metaphors with scientific rigor, and incorporates animation, micro-cinematography, and scenes from old Hollywood films and stock footage, including Busby Berkley-choreographed dance routines. The opening scene features the trailer from the 1950s science fiction film It Came From Outer Space.
