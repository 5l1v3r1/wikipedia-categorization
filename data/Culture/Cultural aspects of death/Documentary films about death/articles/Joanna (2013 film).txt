Joanna is a 2013 Polish documentary film by Aneta Kopacz about Joanna Salyga, a young woman with cancer with only three months to live, and her efforts to make the most of her time with her husband and young son. Kopacz came to know Salyga's story through her blog Chustka. Salyga's readers sponsored a crowdfunding campaign to produce this film. Joanna was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) at the 87th Academy Awards.   I don’t feel disappointed and a loser in any way. I made a film which moves people all over the world as a significant experience and event in their lives. A film which won numerous awards and was nominated for an Oscar! And finally, a film which allows the memory of Joanna to survive and which will show her son Jaś what a simple day with his mom looked like. Nothing is lost here!
