Orozco the Embalmber (Spanish: Orozco el embalsamador) is a Japanese documentary film following a Colombian embalmer named Froilan Orozco.  Having personally taken care of 50,000 corpses, Orozco lives in an extremely poor, violent, and crime-infested area, where corpses can be seen on the streets and the homicide rate is among the highest in the world.  The film collects footage taken over several years of Orozco's line of work, examining in a very graphic and unflinching cinéma vérité manner as he embalms and restores corpses.  Orozco died during the production of the film.
