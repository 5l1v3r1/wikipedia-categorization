Once used to refer to all forms of mourning for one's parents, it evolved in meaning to refer only to the practice of officials resigning their posts for mourning.\n</p><p>The roots of the practice lie in the <a href=\"/wiki/Confucianist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Confucianist\">Confucianist</a> focus on filial piety as a key virtue of government, and thus was instituted during the <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Han_dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Western Han dynasty\">Western Han dynasty</a>, when Confucianism first became the official ideology of the empire. During the mourning period, banqueting, marriage, official activities and participation in the <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_Examinations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imperial Examinations\">Imperial Examinations</a> are all proscribed. The length of the mourning period is nominally three years, though in practice it has been described as being between twenty-five to twenty-seven months; this is also in line with Confucian prescriptions, since it takes three years for a human child to be fully weaned. At the end of the period, officials will be returned to the same rank as their last previously served post.\n</p><p>Nonetheless, given the length of the mandatory mourning and the tight restrictions on political or public activity, this practice often had a negative effect on the career of officials. Measures did exist to allow the government to recall an official in mourning; this is often applied to key officials in the bureaucracy, who are unable to leave their duties immediately as prescribed, or in times of emergency. On the other hand, failure to report a deceased parent and submit to filial mourning was an offence, and officials were liable to be impeached upon discovery.\n</p><p>Even the <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_Emperor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese Emperor\">Emperor</a> was subjected to filial mourning, though his indispensability to administrative duties means he need only mourn for 27 days, instead of months.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2206\nCached time: 20180914021848\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.040 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.084 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 85/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4907/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.018/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 876 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   67.595      1 -total\n 88.27%   59.665      1 Template:Unreferenced\n 66.73%   45.104      1 Template:Ambox\n 11.63%    7.858      1 Template:Zh\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:35962095-0!canonical and timestamp 20180914021848 and revision id 832678676\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ko","url":"https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%82%BC%EB%85%84%EC%83%81","langname":"Korean","autonym":"\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4","*":"\uc0bc\ub144\uc0c1"},{"lang":"ja","url":"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%81%E6%86%82","langname":"Japanese","autonym":"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e","*":"\u4e01\u6182"},{"lang":"zh","url":"https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%81%E6%86%82","langname":"Chinese","autonym":"\u4e2d\u6587","*":"\u4e01\u6182"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_May_2012"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_containing_simplified_Chinese-language_text"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_containing_traditional_Chinese-language_text"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Death_customs"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Han_dynasty"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Chinese_words_and_phrases"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from May 2012"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chinese Emperor"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Confucianist"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Han dynasty"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Imperial Examinations"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pinyin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Simplified Chinese characters"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Traditional Chinese characters"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Western Han dynasty"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Zh"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Lang-zh"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Zh"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Description","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Filial_mourning","byteoffset":309,"anchor":"Description"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Filial mourning","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q847297"}]}}
