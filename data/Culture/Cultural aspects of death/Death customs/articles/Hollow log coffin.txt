  A hollow log coffin is a type of coffin used by the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land, Australia. It consists of a tree trunk hollowed out by termites and painted by a clan member of the deceased, with the bones placed inside.  Hollow log coffins are also known as dupun, lorrkon, djalumbu, badurru, mudukundja, mululu, and larajeje in Aboriginal languages.
