Ode to the Death of Jazz is an album by  Finnish avant-garde jazz composer, bandleader and drummer Edward Vesala recorded in 1989 and released on the ECM label in 1990.  The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick awarded the album 2Â½ stars stating "it feels as though something essential is being restrained, as though Vesala is reluctant to simply let his ensemble surge forward unbound. Fine instrumental work abounds, however, notably by the leader himself on drums and the Garbarek-laden tones of tenor saxophonist Jouni Kannisto. In sum, the listener gets the impression that, although all the elements are in place for a fine album, excessive control has led to a dilution of the power that could have been".
