The Piano Trio No. 2  in E minor, for violin, cello and piano, Op. 67, by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in 1944, in the midst of World War II. The composition was dedicated to Shostakovich's good friend, Ivan Sollertinsky, a Russian polymath and avid musician, who had recently died at age 41.  The work received its premiere in Leningrad on 14 November 1944.  The piece consists of four movements, with a complete performance running 25 to 27 minutes. The Jewish melody from the last movement was quoted in Shostakovich's famous String Quartet No. 8. The third movement is featured in choreographer John Neumeier's ballet "The Seagull" (Hamburg, 2002).
