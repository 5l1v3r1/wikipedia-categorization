 Khaad (Bengali: খাদ; English: The Abyss) is a 2014 Indian Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly. It's about a story of a group of people trying to make-out alive of a situation that tests their strength, patience and resilience.          Because of a train strike, a group of tourists, mostly unrelated to each other, get stuck in New Mal Junction. These people are honeymooners (Saheb and Mimi), family vacationers (Pallavi Chatterjee, Koushik Banerjee, Tridha Choudhury), an ailing mother and her son (Lily Chakraborty, Kaushik Ganguly), a priest (Ardhendu Banerjee), a heroine and her abnormal brother (Gargi Roy Choudhury, Rajdeep Ghosh), one trekker (Kamaleshwar Mukherjee), a bus conductor (Rudranil), and a retired teacher (Maasud Akthar). One of the tourists, the priest manages to  arrange  a bus from the church for them to reach North Bengal. The other tourists also join him in the bus trip, but unfortunately the bus meets with a terrible accident. It falls off a cliff into an abyss, but the tourists survive with minor injuries. Injured and traumatized, they realize that they have become completely detached from any form of human contact. It was also not possible to climb 400–500 ft so easily during the daylight hours that were remaining that day. So they decide to spend that night there and think they will try to find another way out the next day. While spending that night, they decide to play a game. The priest suggests a game which is to reveal everyone's secret or anything that the person wants to confess to the world but never gathered courage. This secret is to be left behind in the abyss and from the next day, they could begin afresh.  Everyone agrees.  Gradually, the situation starts to change while the game progresses.  Everyone's darkest secrets are revealed one by one. This goes on until the wee hours of the night.Atlast it is revealed that all the sixteen passengers of the bus are dead in that fatal accident. Their inner soul just does the thing by saying their guilt feelings in them to every one.
