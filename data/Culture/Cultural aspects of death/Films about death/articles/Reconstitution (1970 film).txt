 Reconstitution (Greek: Αναπαράσταση, translit. Anaparastasi) is a 1970 Greek dramatic black and white independent art film directed by Theo Angelopoulos. It is the director's first feature film. While based on true events, it transcends them to recall the ancient myths of the Atrides and Clytemnestra. In 1986, the Greek Film Critics Association named it the third-best Greek film in history. In a remote village in Epirus, a woman murders her husband, who had just returned from Germany, where he had gone to work, with the help of her lover. The crime is never shown on screen. The main characters (judge, policemen, journalists) try to reconstruct and understand a news item that escapes them. It was awarded Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Cinematography at the Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema in 1970, as well as Best Foreign Film at the Hyères Festival, International Federation of Film Critics Special Mention at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival and Prix Georges-Sadoul in 1971.
