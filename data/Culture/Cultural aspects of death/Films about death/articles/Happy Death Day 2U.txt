 Happy Death Day 2U  is an upcoming American slasher film written and directed by Christopher B. Landon. It stars Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Suraj Sharma, and Ruby Modine.  It is a sequel to 2017's Happy Death Day. Jason Blum is serving as a producer through his Blumhouse Productions banner and will be distributed by Universal Pictures. Director Christopher B. Landon has talked about the possibility of a sequel, focusing on why Tree went into a time loop.  Jessica Rothe stated that while most horror sequels retread the original, Landon's pitch instead "elevates the movie from being a horror movie into a Back to the Future type of genre film where the sequel joins us right from where we left off, it explains a lot of things in the first one that didn't get explained, and it elevates everything."  On May 1, 2018, Blumhouse Productions announced that Landon would return to direct the film, with Rothe and Israel Broussard reprising their roles while Suraj Sharma and Sarah Yarkin joined the cast.  The next day, it was announced that Ruby Modine would reprise her role.  Principal photography on the film began on May 14, 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
