Venomous is a 2001 disaster horror film starring Treat Williams, Mary Page Keller and Hannes Jaenicke and directed by Fred Olen Ray, credited as Ed Raymond. In 1991, a group of Iraqi commandos penetrates a secret American government lab, releasing genetically modified rattlesnakes. Over the following years, the snakes breed and multiply. In the present days, an earthquake drives them from the underground to the surface, and the snakes infect whoever they bite with a fatal virus. A small-town doctor tries to correct the situation, but the government wants to hide the traces of its wrongdoings.
