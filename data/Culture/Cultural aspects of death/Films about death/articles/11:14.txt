11:14 is a 2003 American-Canadian indie black comedy film written and directed by Greg Marcks. The film was edited in a way that the various scenes of the movie all take place around the pivotal time of 11:14 PM. The film involves a series of interconnected events that converge around two car-related accidents at 11:14Â p.m.  The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding flashbacks: 11:13 - 11:33 11:09 - 11:29 11:04 - 11:24 10:59 - 11:19 10:54 - 11:14 As of May 2018, 11:14 holds a 92% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews.  Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, called it an "inventive, black comedy" and "a meticulous piece of plot construction, entertaining, full of incidents and infused throughout with a mischievous and bleak sense of humor."
