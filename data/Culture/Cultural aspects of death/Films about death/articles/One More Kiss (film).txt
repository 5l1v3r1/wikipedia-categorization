 One More Kiss is a Scottish romantic drama directed by award-winning film maker Vadim Jean (Leon the Pig Farmer, Beyond Bedlam, Clockwork Mice) and starring Valerie Edmond, Gerard Butler and James Cosmo in the main roles. The film’s tragic story revolves around a cancer-diagnosed woman who decides to live her remaining life to the full, which includes throwing herself into a triangle romance with an old flame. When Sarah Hopson (Valerie Edmond) discovers she has a brain tumour, she leaves her successful high-rise lifestyle in New York City and returns to her hometown in the Scottish Borders, where she left her widower father Frank (James Cosmo) and her childhood sweetheart Sam (Gerard Butler) to pursue a career in the United States seven years ago. Upon arriving Sarah finds out that Sam, a restaurant owner, is now happily married to Charlotte (Valerie Gogan). This, however, does not stop her from asking the couple a last favour – which is to let Sarah spend her remaining time in the company of the only man she has ever loved. Director Vadim Jean decided on an all-Scottish cast with the following three actors starring in the main roles: The original intention was for the film to be set in Jean’s home town of Bristol, but in the end they decided to use the beautiful landscapes of Northern England and Edinburgh, Scotland instead – with the former being the main setting. The opening and closing sequences, however, were shot in New York City.
