La citt√† sconvolta: caccia spietata ai rapitori (internationally released as Kidnap Syndicate) is a 1975 Italian poliziottesco directed by Fernando Di Leo. Even being a minor work in the Di Leo's filmography, the film gained some critical attention for being an original re-interpretation of the "vigilante" subgenre.
