Echoes of a Summer is a 1976 Canadian/American film directed by Don Taylor, based on the Broadway play Isle of Children by Robert L. Joseph, who also adapted the screenplay. The eleven-year-old Deirdre (Jodie Foster) suffers from an incurable heart condition. For two years, her parents Eugene (Richard Harris) and Ruth (Lois Nettleton) have consulted heart specialists - but without any success. Now they have gone to Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia to ensure that her last days are as pleasant as possible. The nine-year-old neighbour boy Phillip (Brad Savage) is the only one who brings a little happiness into the home, since Deirdre knows exactly what is wrong with her. After she suffers from an acute attack and the end comes faster than everybody had thought, Deirdre and Phillip succeed anyway in celebrating the twelfth birthday of the girl as a day of joy.
