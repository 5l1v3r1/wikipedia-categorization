The Skyrunner® World Series is an annual international championship of skyrunning (high altitude endurance races) organised from 2008 by the International Skyrunning Federation (ISF).  Previously the races were organised by the Federation for Sport at Altitude (FSA) that was founded in 1995 and functioned until ISF took over.  The 2016 Skyrunner® World Series has four disciplines:   Points are allocated according to the finishing position, with 100 for the winner, 88 for second, 78 for third, down to two points for the fortieth placed competitor. The same scale is used for the women's event, but only down to fifteenth position. In order to prolong the opportunity to win the championship, double points are awarded in the final race. The best four results across the season are totalled, and the runner with the highest cumulative score is declared champion for the year.  That is the results of the singles races of the various years.
