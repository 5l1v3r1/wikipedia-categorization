The FINA Diving World Series is a diving competition series held annually since 2007. This series is held around the world (the current series includes 4 events) where the divers collect points depending on their results to determine the World Series champions. This series is reserved for only the best divers in the World and national wild cards. Most of the divers are medallists from previous Olympics, World Championships and World Cups.  Overall ranking is based on the combined results from the legs of the series. Divers earned points based on placement at each competition. For individual events, points were counted separately for each person. For synchronized events, points were combined for each country â€“ some countries had different pairs compete at the different legs of the series. Medals were not awarded for overall ranking, but top divers (or countries for synchro) who competed in all the legs earned prize money.
