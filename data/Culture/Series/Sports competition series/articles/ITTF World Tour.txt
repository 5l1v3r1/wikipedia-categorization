The ITTF World Tour, known as the ITTF Pro Tour until 2011, is an annual series of table tennis tournaments introduced by International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) in 1996. The tour includes events in six categories: Men's and Women's Singles, Men's and Women's Doubles, and Under-21 Men's and Women's Singles. The tour has its own points system, with players accumulating points based on their performances in the tournaments they enter.  The players who gain the most points in each of the six different categories will be invited to participate in the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals at the end of the year.
