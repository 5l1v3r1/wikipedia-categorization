Starting 2008 season, the women's winners will receive the equal prize money amount as men's winners.  The prize money is distributed via the following formula:                          T         o         t         a         l                   p         r         i         z         e                   m         o         n         e         y                   ×                                                P               e               r               c               e               n               t               a               g               e                          100                                     {\displaystyle Total\ prize\ money\ \times {\frac {Percentage}{100}}}     The Super Series Premier and Super Series tournaments offer ranking points to players based on the round a player/pair reaches. The Super Series Premier tournaments offer higher ranking points, second only to BWF tournaments (BWF World Championships and Summer Olympics). Points will be used for World Ranking and also Super Series standing to decide the top eight players/pairs play in the Super Series Masters Finals.  Starting in 2007, players from the same nation are not separated in the main draw of the tournaments. All but the top two seeds will not be divided into two draws as they were before. The top Chinese player Lin Dan has criticized the rule change.  2010 onwards saw rules altered with nationality separation in the first round.  Entries must be made five weeks before the start of the tournament. Only 32 players/pairs will play in the main round. Among the 32 players/pairs, only eight players/pair will be seeded in each event. Each event will have 28 highest-ranked players/pairs in World Ranking and four qualifiers. Prior to September 2008, 32 players/pairs can participate in qualifying rounds. Since then, only up to 16 players/pairs can participate in qualifying rounds, where four highest-ranked players/pairs in World Ranking will be seeded.  This change is to avoid a big strain between the qualifiers and the main events.  Each Super Series tournament will be held in six days, with the main round in five days.  Starting in 2011, top ten players/pairs of each discipline in the World Ranking will be required to play in all Super Series Premier tournaments and a minimum of four Super Series tournaments occurring in the full calendar year. Players who qualify for Super Series Masters Finals are obliged to play. A fine and above the normal withdrawal fees will be imposed upon players/pairs who fail to play. Exemption from penalty will be considered by BWF on receipt of a valid medical certificate or strong evidence that prove players unfit to participate. However, retired or suspended players are not subject to these regulations.   In 2007 season, each tournaments can present local umpires. However, after the outcry of several players during the tournaments,  starting 2008, each Super Series tournaments must present eight international certificated and accredited umpires.  Current regulations state that at least six umpires must be from member associations other than the host member association, at least four BWF and two continental certificated umpires with well spread nationality.  In every three years, the BWF Council will review the countries that host a Super Series Premier and Super Series tournament.  In history, 14 tournaments in 13 countries hosted at least a season of the series. China was the sole country to host the series twice in a season from the year of 2007–2013. Starting in 2014 season, Australia hosted a Super Series tournament.   At the end of the Super Series circuit, top eight players/pairs in the Super Series standing of each discipline, with the maximum of two players/pairs from the same member association, are required to play in a final tournament known as the Super Series Masters Finals.
