The Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour is the latest name for the women's professional racquetball tour. It features the world's best players and several events each season - running from September to May - that are mostly played in the USA. Women's professional racquetball has existed since the 1970s but the women's pro tour began in 1980, when the Women's Professional Racquetball Association (WPRA) was created.  The tour was run by International Management Group, and did well in the early 1980s in part due to the great rivalry between Lynn Adams and Heather McKay.  The WPRA lasted until 1994, when the Women's International Racquetball Tour (WIRT) was created. In 2000, the United States Racquetball Association (USRA) took over administration of the WIRT, and renamed it the Ladies Professional Racquetball Association (LPRA). This led to  significant growth under the supervision of the USRA, which had a three year plan for the LPRA.  In 2005, the players took over control and ownership of the tour, and again it was reorganized and rebranded as the Women's Professional Racquetball Organization.  Shannon Feaster, a former player, served as the WPRO Commissioner from 2005 to 2011, when she stepped down to focus on her family. Gigi Rock was then hired as the new commissioner in July 2010.  In 2012, the players decided to reorganize and created the LPRT with T. J. Baumbaugh as President and Andy Kulback Deputy Commissioner. Kulback resigned in October 2016.
