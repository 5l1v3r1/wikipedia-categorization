Generica is the collective title of a series of five EPs released by Jon Crosby, lead singer and founder of the rock band VAST. The collection of songs was also released as a double-album with a plain white cover featuring Crosby's name and the album title, containing slightly different mixes of some tracks.  In late 2007 and early 2008, Jon Crosby released five download-only EPs on the band's website, under the collective title Generica, which was to be "an exploration of people, places and American music." The first three volumes were composed of solo acoustic guitar songs, while the last two were recorded along with VAST band members under the name "Jon Crosby And The Resonator Band". Crosby stressed the difference between this outfit and VAST: All songs by Jon Crosby unless otherwise noted.
