Junkyard Hearts is a set of 4 EPs released independently by Joseph Arthur in 2002 to coincide with his first headline tour in the UK. The EPs were released on special edition CD and collectors' edition 12" vinyl (with each 12" sleeve illustrated by Joseph Arthur himself).  The EPs were only made available on the tour and are thus now hard to find. The set preceded his third studio album Redemption's Son. The songs "Dear Lord," "The Termite Song," "Favorite Girl," and "Voices Will Fight" (later renamed "In the Night") appear on the album Redemption's Son. The version of "Dear Lord" on EP II features a longer outro than the version of the song found on Redemption's Son. Real World Records reissued the four EPs onto a double CD set in July 2012, as a part of their Real World Gold series.   All tracks written by Joseph Arthur.
