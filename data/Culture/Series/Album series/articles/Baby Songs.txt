Baby Songs is one of the first, and longest-running, American, independent children's home video series. Since 1985, more than 4 million copies of Baby Songs have been sold. In 1985, Amy Weintraub and Brooks McEwan founded the company Backyard Productions, now Backyard Enterprises, Inc., to release Baby Songs. Inspired by the music videos on MTV, Weintraub and McEwan created the first collection of music videos for babies and toddlers.  They partnered with American children's musician Hap Palmer, a recording artist since 1969, to create Baby Songs. The videos often feature Palmer performing either his original songs or adaptations of folk, nursery rhymes and popular songs to live children.  The songs are separated by short animated video segments. Baby Songs also released videos without Palmer, often starring other singers (such as John Lithgow's Kid Size Concert). The company has released 13 titles on VHS and DVD, and four audio compilations.  The videos aired as a segment on the tv program "Lunch Box" on The Disney Channel
