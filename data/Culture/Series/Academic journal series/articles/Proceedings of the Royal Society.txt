Many celebrated names in science have published their research in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, including Paul Dirac,  Werner Heisenberg,  Ernest Rutherford,  and Erwin Schr√∂dinger.  All articles are available free  at the journals' websites after one year for Proceedings B and two years for Proceedings A. Authors may have their articles made immediately open access (under Creative Commons license) on payment of an article processing charge.

Starting with volume 76, the Proceedings were split into  The Proceedings have since undergone further name changes.
