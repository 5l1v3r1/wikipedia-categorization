The Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers were first published by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) in 1847.  The Proceedings were published under this single title until 1963, when they began to be published in two parts. The Proceedings have since expanded further, in part by incorporating four journals previously published separately: the Proceedings of the Institution of Automobile Engineers (in 1971), the Journal of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers (in 1971), the Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science (in 1983) and Engineering in Medicine (in 1989).  Sixteen individual parts now make up the Proceedings, as follows:  In 2010, SAGE Publications began publishing the Institution's journals on behalf of the IMechE.  The IMechE Proceedings Archive 1847â€“1996 continues to be hosted on the MetaPress platform.  As of May 2011, 14 of the journals that make up the Proceedings were included in the Journal Citation Reports.
