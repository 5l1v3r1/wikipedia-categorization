The Eiffel Tower series of Robert Delaunay (1885 – 1941) is a cycle of paintings and drawings of the Eiffel Tower, with its main sequence executed 1909-1912, and additional works going up to 1928, considered the most prominent artworks of the iconic Paris tower and by this artist. Executed in an emerging Orphist style, co-founded by Sonia Delaunay and František Kupka, that added bright colors and increased abstraction to Cubism, the series sits chronologically and stylistically between the artist's Saint-Séverin series and Windows series. The 1913 La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France, a collaborative work between Sonia Delaunay and the poet Blaise Cendrars, forms an epic narrative of a Trans-Siberian Railway journey that concludes at Paris and a Simultanist Eiffel Tower; they had announced a plan to sell 150 copies, which would equal in height the Tower itself.  Cendrars's 1924 essay on Robert Delaunay describes his feminization of it, and Sonia Delaunay described the Tower as his "Eve future"    Delaunay's Eiffel Tower series is evoked in architectural paintings of other iconic buildings by his contemporary, the New York artist, John Marin's Woolworth Building, No. 31 of 1912,  and later by the Ontario artist Greg Curnoe's CN Tower series of the 1970s and 1980s.  The Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein's appreciation of Delaunay's work informed his Soviet montage theory, as he imagined developing cinematically  "a dynamic fusion of a series, moving past the spectator, of those hundred views of the Eiffel Tower" rather than a "summation within a single canvas".
