The Cluster Paintings are a series of paintings created by Nabil Kanso in 1986-1988. They are characterized by compositions that divide the canvas space into sections reflecting a cluster of irregular shaped planes offering variations of contrasts and viewpoints. These characteristics expanded in later works such as the America and Living Memories series.
