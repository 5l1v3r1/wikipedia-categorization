Passage is an outdoor 2014 art installation consisting of 38 weathered steel boat sculptures by Bill Will, installed along the MAX Orange Line in the Brooklyn neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Bill Will's Passage consists of 36 weathered steel boat sculptures installed adjacent to MAX Orange Line tracks along Southeast 17th Avenue between McLoughlin and Powell boulevards.
