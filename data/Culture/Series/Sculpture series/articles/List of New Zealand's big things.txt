The big things of New Zealand are  large novelty statues located in small towns which typically relate to the town and its identity.   Examples include: the Taihape gumboot, where gumboot-throwing is encouraged; the large L&P bottle (Lemon and Paeroa) in the town where the drink originated, and the Big Sheep Shearer in Te Kuiti, where the national sheep-shearing competitions are held.  A similar tradition is found in Australia.
