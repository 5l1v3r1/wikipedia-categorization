Hammering Man is a series of monumental kinetic sculptures designed by Jonathan Borofsky which have been installed in various cities around the world. This project was structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates (LERA). The first one was a 3.4 m high sculpture at Paula Cooper Gallery made out of wood. Some installations in various museums followed. Outside U.S. installations followed 1985 in Dallas, 1988 in La Jolla and L.A., European installations in Basel 1989, Frankfurt 1990, and others. The most prominent  Hammering Man is 21 metres tall and was commissioned in 1990, for the new Messeturm (exhibition tower) building at the Frankfurt Trade Fair.   (50°06′45″N 8°39′10″E﻿ / ﻿50.11250°N 8.65278°E﻿ / 50.11250; 8.65278) Also in the same city was an unofficial 6 ft tall copy of the Hammering Man in the Hülya-Platz (in the district Bockenheim, 50°7′25.29″N 8°38′23.00″E﻿ / ﻿50.1236917°N 8.6397222°E﻿ / 50.1236917; 8.6397222) where the hammer, which could be moved with a hand crank, demolished a swastika. The sculpture was donated by a citizen's group against neo-nazism to commemorate the Solingen arson attack of 1993. The sculpture was often vandalised and in April 2007 it was demounted and scrapped after becoming so badly damaged and corroded that it was considered a danger for public safety.  The sculpture has since been replaced by a successor.  Hammering Man in Seattle is 14.6 m (48 feet) tall, 76 cm (30 inches) wide and 18 cm (7 inches) deep, and weighs 26,000 pounds .  He is located directly in front of the Seattle Art Museum (47°36′25.31″N 122°20′17.20″W﻿ / ﻿47.6070306°N 122.3381111°W﻿ / 47.6070306; -122.3381111) and made out of hollow-fabricated steel with a mechanized arm of aluminum, an electric motor and flat black automotive paint. He was built in 1991 at a cost of $450,000. Original funding was provided by the Virginia Wright Fund in honor of Prentice Bloedel; City of Seattle 1% for Art funds;  the Museum Development Authority and PONCHO (Patrons of Northwest Civic, Cultural and Charitable Organizations). During installation on September 28, 1991, the first sculpture fell and had to be replaced. Hammering Man's arm "hammers" silently and smoothly four times per minute 20 hours a day. It runs on a 3-hp electric motor set on an automatic timer. Hammering Man rests his arm 1–5 a.m. each morning as well as every year on Labor Day. The sculpture was fabricated by Lippincott, Inc., North Haven, Connecticut and installed by Fabrication Specialities, Seattle. On Labor Day 1993, a group of local artists led by Jason Sprinkle attached a scaled-to-fit ball and chain to the sculpture's leg.  The largest Hammering Man is in Seoul, South Korea (37°34′11.67″N 126°58′20.85″E﻿ / ﻿37.5699083°N 126.9724583°E﻿ / 37.5699083; 126.9724583) next to the Heungkuk Life Insurance building in the Gwanghwamun area of the city. Seoul's version of Hammering Man was erected in 2002.  It weighs 50 tons and stands 22 m/72 ft high. Seoul's Hammering Man strikes a blow every minute and seventeen seconds and is considered an important city landmark. In August 2009, the city of Seoul completed a project to move the sculpture 4.8 m/16 ft closer to the sidewalk and dedicated a new small gallery park at the site.  A spiral path, surrounding the statue, was created to enhance the presence of the work of art.  Specially designed benches, landscaping, and lighting were added to the surrounding park to complete the effect.   Reference:
