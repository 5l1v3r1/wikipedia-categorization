The Enchanted Highway is a collection of the world's largest scrap metal sculptures   constructed at intervals along a 32-mile (51 km) stretch of two-lane highway in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of North Dakota. The road has no highway number, although its northern portion is ​100 1⁄2th Avenue SW (counting from Bismarck, ND, which is 85 miles [137 km] to the east). Local artist Gary Greff conceived of the project, built it beginning in 1989, maintains it and plans more sculptures. A goal is to counter the trend toward extinction of small towns such as Regent, North Dakota. The Enchanted Highway extends north from Regent to the Gladstone exit on Interstate 94 east of Dickinson. Each sculpture has a developed pull-out and several have picnic shelters. The highway passes through scenic farm country with intermittent buttes. Regent is a popular pheasant hunting area, and wild game is abundant. In 2012, Greff opened a motel, The Enchanted Castle, in Regent.  The motel continues the theme of the Enchanted Highway.
