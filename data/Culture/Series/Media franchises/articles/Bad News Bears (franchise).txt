The Bad News Bears is an American sports comedy multi-media franchise created by screenwriter Bill Lancaster. It began in 1976 with The Bad News Bears, and was followed by two sequels and a remake: The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (1977), The Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978) and Bad News Bears (2005). While the first film garnered critical acclaim, critics were less enthusiastic about its sequels. Furthermore, the series has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and teen film narratives in America.
