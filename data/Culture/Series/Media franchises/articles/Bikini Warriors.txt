It primarily consists of a series of fantasy figures created by Hobby Japan and Megahouse, featuring character designs from multiple artists including Rei Hiroe, Hisasi, Saitom and Tony. A 12-episode anime television series based on the setting aired between July 7 and September 22, 2015. A manga series and a video game have also been announced.  The series consists of a sequence of short stories describing the (mis-) adventures of four female adventurers in a fantasy world teeming with dangerous monsters and hostile magicians. Clad in generously cut-out, yet effective bikini-type armor, the four women must learn to overcome the hazards of their world to meet their living expenses while at the same time trying to get comfortable with the idea of exposing too much of their curvaceous physiques. An anime television series based on the manga by studios Feel and PRA aired between July 7 and September 22, 2015. Madman Entertainment secured streaming rights in Australia & New Zealand, who simulcasted the series on AnimeLab.
