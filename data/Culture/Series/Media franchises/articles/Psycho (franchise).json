href=\"/wiki/Marion_Crane\" title=\"Marion Crane\">Marion Crane</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Leigh\" title=\"Janet Leigh\">Janet Leigh</a>) steals $40,000 from her employer and flees <a href=\"/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona\" title=\"Phoenix, Arizona\">Phoenix, Arizona</a> by car. While en route to Sam's <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n</p><p>Owner <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Bates\" title=\"Norman Bates\">Norman Bates</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Perkins\" title=\"Anthony Perkins\">Anthony Perkins</a>) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new <a href=\"/wiki/Interstate_highway_system\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Interstate highway system\">Interstate</a> and mentions he lives with <a href=\"/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)\" title=\"Norma Bates (Psycho)\">his mother</a> in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n</p><p>Marion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &#8212; including the money &#8212; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n</p><p>Shortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister <a href=\"/wiki/Lila_Crane\" title=\"Lila Crane\">Lila</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Vera_Miles\" title=\"Vera Miles\">Vera Miles</a>) and private detective Milton Arbogast (<a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Balsam\" title=\"Martin Balsam\">Martin Balsam</a>), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n</p><p>Arbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers (<a href=\"/wiki/John_McIntire\" title=\"John McIntire\">John McIntire</a>) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n</p><p>Posing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and <a href=\"/wiki/Mummy\" title=\"Mummy\">mummified</a> body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n</p><p>After Norman's arrest, a <a href=\"/wiki/Forensic_psychiatry\" title=\"Forensic psychiatry\">forensic psychiatrist</a> tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's <a href=\"/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)\" title=\"Psyche (psychology)\">psyche</a> as an <a href=\"/wiki/Disassociative_identity_disorder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disassociative identity disorder\">alternate personality</a>. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n</p><p>In the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Psycho_II_.281983.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psycho_II_(1983)\"><i>Psycho II</i> (1983)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Psycho II (1983)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_II_(film)\" title=\"Psycho II (film)\">Psycho II (film)</a></div>\n<p>Convicted killer <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Bates\" title=\"Norman Bates\">Norman Bates</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Perkins\" title=\"Anthony Perkins\">Anthony Perkins</a>) is released from a mental institution. <a href=\"/wiki/Lila_Crane\" title=\"Lila Crane\">Lila Loomis</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Vera_Miles\" title=\"Vera Miles\">Vera Miles</a>), the sister of Bates' victim <a href=\"/wiki/Marion_Crane\" title=\"Marion Crane\">Marion Crane</a>, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n</p><p>Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond (<a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Loggia\" title=\"Robert Loggia\">Robert Loggia</a>), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey (<a href=\"/wiki/Dennis_Franz\" title=\"Dennis Franz\">Dennis Franz</a>). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named <a href=\"/wiki/Emma_Spool\" title=\"Emma Spool\">Emma Spool</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Claudia_Bryar\" title=\"Claudia Bryar\">Claudia Bryar</a>).\n</p><p>One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis (<a href=\"/wiki/Meg_Tilly\" title=\"Meg Tilly\">Meg Tilly</a>), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n</p><p>Norman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n</p><p>Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n</p><p>Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n</p><p>Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n</p><p>Mary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n</p><p>Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n</p><p>Mary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n</p><p>Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n</p><p>While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n</p><p>Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n</p><p>A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n</p><p>The sheriff inaccuratetely believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n</p><p>Norman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n</p><p>Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Psycho_III_.281986.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psycho_III_(1986)\"><i>Psycho III</i> (1986)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Psycho III (1986)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_III\" title=\"Psycho III\">Psycho III</a></div>\n<p>The film begins with Maureen Coyle (<a href=\"/wiki/Diana_Scarwid\" title=\"Diana Scarwid\">Diana Scarwid</a>), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide.

Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler (<a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Alan_Browne\" title=\"Robert Alan Browne\">Robert Alan Browne</a>) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke (<a href=\"/wiki/Jeff_Fahey\" title=\"Jeff Fahey\">Jeff Fahey</a>), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n</p><p>Sheriff John Hunt (<a href=\"/wiki/Hugh_Gillin\" title=\"Hugh Gillin\">Hugh Gillin</a>) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable (<a href=\"/wiki/Roberta_Maxwell\" title=\"Roberta Maxwell\">Roberta Maxwell</a>), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane (<a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Leigh\" title=\"Janet Leigh\">Janet Leigh</a>). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n</p><p>After the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_A_New_Beginning\" title=\"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\">Friday the 13th: A New Beginning</a>'</i>s <a href=\"/wiki/Juliette_Cummins\" title=\"Juliette Cummins\">Juliette Cummins</a>). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n</p><p>The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n</p><p>A group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local <a href=\"/wiki/American_football\" title=\"American football\">football</a> game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Katt_Shea_Ruben&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Katt Shea Ruben (page does not exist)\">Katt Shea Ruben</a>), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1960 film)\">original</a>) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n</p><p>The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n</p><p>Tracy talks to Statler and Myrna (<a href=\"/wiki/Lee_Garlington\" title=\"Lee Garlington\">Lee Garlington</a>) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n</p><p>Maureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who <i>was</i> in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n</p><p>She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bates_Motel_.281987.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bates_Motel_(1987)\"><i>Bates Motel</i> (1987)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Bates Motel (1987)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Bates_Motel_(film)\" title=\"Bates Motel (film)\">Bates Motel (film)</a></div>\n<p>In 1987, <a href=\"/wiki/NBC\" title=\"NBC\">NBC</a> released a <a href=\"/wiki/Telefilm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Telefilm\">telefilm</a> spin-off entitled <i>Bates Motel</i>.

The radio receives a call from Norman Bates, who has re-entered society and married another of his former psychiatrists, Connie. Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are <a href=\"/wiki/Reverse_chronology\" title=\"Reverse chronology\">slightly out of order</a>. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates, had schizophrenia (see <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_II_(film)\" title=\"Psycho II (film)\">Psycho II</a></i>); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph, who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Psycho_.281998.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psycho_(1998)\"><i>Psycho</i> (1998)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Psycho (1998)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1998 film)\">Psycho (1998 film)</a></div>\n<p>In need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis (<a href=\"/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen\" title=\"Viggo Mortensen\">Viggo Mortensen</a>) out of debt, Marion Crane (<a href=\"/wiki/Anne_Heche\" title=\"Anne Heche\">Anne Heche</a>) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees <a href=\"/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona\" title=\"Phoenix, Arizona\">Phoenix, Arizona</a> by car. While en route to Sam's <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n</p><p>Owner Norman Bates (<a href=\"/wiki/Vince_Vaughn\" title=\"Vince Vaughn\">Vince Vaughn</a>) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n</p><p>Marion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &#8212; including the money &#8212; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n</p><p>Shortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister Lila (<a href=\"/wiki/Julianne_Moore\" title=\"Julianne Moore\">Julianne Moore</a>) and private detective Milton Arbogast (<a href=\"/wiki/William_H._Macy\" title=\"William H. Macy\">William H. Macy</a>), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n</p><p>Arbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers (<a href=\"/wiki/Philip_Baker_Hall\" title=\"Philip Baker Hall\">Philip Baker Hall</a>) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n</p><p>Posing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and <a href=\"/wiki/Mummy\" title=\"Mummy\">mummified</a> body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n</p><p>After Norman's arrest, <a href=\"/wiki/Forensic_psychiatry\" title=\"Forensic psychiatry\">forensic psychiatrist</a> Dr. Fred Richmond (<a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Forster\" title=\"Robert Forster\">Robert Forster</a>) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's <a href=\"/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)\" title=\"Psyche (psychology)\">psyche</a> as an <a href=\"/wiki/Disassociative_identity_disorder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disassociative identity disorder\">alternate personality</a>. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n</p><p>In the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Television\">Television</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Television\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Bates_Motel_.282013.E2.80.932017.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bates_Motel_(2013\u20132017)\"><i>Bates Motel</i> (2013\u20132017)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Bates Motel (2013\u20132017)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Bates_Motel_(TV_series)\" title=\"Bates Motel (TV series)\">Bates Motel (TV series)</a></div>\n<p>On January 23, 2012, A&amp;E announced that a television series called <i>Bates Motel</i> was in development at the network.

The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal <a href=\"/wiki/Ed_Gein\" title=\"Ed Gein\">Ed Gein</a>. Author <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Bloch\" title=\"Robert Bloch\">Robert Bloch</a> lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Bates\" title=\"Norman Bates\">Norman Bates</a> was very different in the novel from in <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1960 film)\">the film version</a>. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stefano\" title=\"Joseph Stefano\">Joseph Stefano</a> adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable. In 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_II_(novel)\" title=\"Psycho II (novel)\">Psycho II</a></i> which had nothing to do with the <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_II_(film)\" title=\"Psycho II (film)\">1983 film version</a>. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film. In 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company Bloch wrote a third novel called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_House\" title=\"Psycho House\">Psycho House</a></i>. However, according to horror writer <a href=\"/wiki/David_J._Schow\" title=\"David J. Schow\">David J. Schow</a>, when writing it Bloch originally called it <i>Psycho 13</i>. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"List_of_novels\">List of novels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: List of novels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<table class=\"sortable wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Novel\n</th>\n<th>Year\n</th>\n<th>Author\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(novel)\" title=\"Psycho (novel)\">Psycho</a></i>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/1959_in_film\" title=\"1959 in film\">1959</a>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\"><a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Bloch\" title=\"Robert Bloch\">Robert Bloch</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_II_(novel)\" title=\"Psycho II (novel)\">Psycho II</a></i>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/1982_in_film\" title=\"1982 in film\">1982</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_House\" title=\"Psycho House\">Psycho House</a></i>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/1990_in_film\" title=\"1990 in film\">1990</a>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Graphic_novels\">Graphic novels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Graphic novels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1992, a series of <a href=\"/wiki/Graphic_novel\" title=\"Graphic novel\">graphic novels</a> based on the original <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1960 film)\">Psycho</a></i> was published by the Innovation Comics group.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Peggy_Robertson\" title=\"Peggy Robertson\">Peggy Robertson</a>, Hitchcock's production assistant, read <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Boucher\" title=\"Anthony Boucher\">Anthony Boucher</a>'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio <a href=\"/wiki/Paramount_Pictures\" title=\"Paramount Pictures\">Paramount Pictures</a> rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Leigh6_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Leigh6-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Hitchcock chose to film <i>Psycho</i> to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: <i>Flamingo Feather</i> and <i>No Bail for the Judge</i>. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Paramount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rebello23_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rebello23-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Hitchcock decided to plan for <i>Psycho</i> to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents\" title=\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i>, and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive <a href=\"/wiki/Joan_Harrison_(screenwriter)\" title=\"Joan Harrison (screenwriter)\">Joan Harrison</a>, who did not think the film would be a success.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Hitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stefano\" title=\"Joseph Stefano\">Joseph Stefano</a> to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a <a href=\"/wiki/Lens_flare\" title=\"Lens flare\">lens flare</a>, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. <i>Psycho</i> was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n</p><p>In 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel <i>Psycho II</i>, which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Originally, the film was intended as a <a href=\"/wiki/TV_movie\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TV movie\">made-for-cable</a> production.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boys_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-boys-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Perkins\" title=\"Anthony Perkins\">Anthony Perkins</a> originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Bates\" title=\"Norman Bates\">Norman Bates</a>, but when the studio became interested in others (including <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Walken\" title=\"Christopher Walken\">Christopher Walken</a>), Perkins quickly accepted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-film_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-film-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The studio also wanted <a href=\"/wiki/Jamie_Lee_Curtis\" title=\"Jamie Lee Curtis\">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> (daughter of <i>Psycho</i> star <a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Leigh\" title=\"Janet Leigh\">Janet Leigh</a>) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-film_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-film-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Director <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Franklin_(director)\" title=\"Richard Franklin (director)\">Richard Franklin</a> was hired to direct <i>Psycho II</i> because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Topaz_(1969_film)\" title=\"Topaz (1969 film)\">Topaz</a></i>, and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Roadgames\" title=\"Roadgames\">Roadgames</a></i> starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rear_Window\" title=\"Rear Window\">Rear Window</a></i>. Franklin hired writer <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Holland_(director)\" title=\"Tom Holland (director)\">Tom Holland</a> to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen <i>The Beast Within</i>, which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to <i>Psycho</i> and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1960 film)\">Psycho</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hilton_A._Green\" title=\"Hilton A. Green\">Hilton A. Green</a>, was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter <a href=\"/wiki/Patricia_Hitchcock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Patricia Hitchcock\">Patricia Hitchcock</a> and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. <i>Psycho II</i> was filmed at <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_Studios\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universal Studios\">Universal Studios</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_City,_California\" title=\"Universal City, California\">Universal City, California</a> on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boys_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-boys-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boys_13-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-boys-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> According to <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Franklin_(director)\" title=\"Richard Franklin (director)\">Richard Franklin</a>, filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers <a href=\"/wiki/John_W._Corso\" title=\"John W. Corso\">John W. Corso</a> and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually <a href=\"/wiki/Courthouse_Square\" title=\"Courthouse Square\">Courthouse Square</a>, which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress <a href=\"/wiki/Meg_Tilly\" title=\"Meg Tilly\">Meg Tilly</a> due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind <i><a href=\"/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi\" title=\"Return of the Jedi\">Return of the Jedi</a></i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boys_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-boys-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>Psycho II</i> was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics <a href=\"/wiki/Gene_Siskel\" title=\"Gene Siskel\">Gene Siskel</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Roger_Ebert\" title=\"Roger Ebert\">Roger Ebert</a> both gave the film thumbs down on <i><a href=\"/wiki/At_the_Movies_(1982%E2%80%931990_TV_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)\">At the Movies</a></i>, specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen <i>Psycho</i> a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, <i>Psycho II</i> is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then <i>Psycho II</i> begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-ebert_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ebert-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In the British magazine <i><a href=\"/wiki/Empire_(magazine)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Empire (magazine)\">Empire</a></i>, film critic <a href=\"/wiki/Kim_Newman\" title=\"Kim Newman\">Kim Newman</a> gave the film three out of five stars, calling <i>Psycho II</i> \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world <i>wants</i> Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With the surprise financial and critical success of <i>Psycho II</i>, Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Edward_Pogue\" title=\"Charles Edward Pogue\">Charles Edward Pogue</a> was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim <a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Leigh\" title=\"Janet Leigh\">Janet Leigh</a> in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked <i>Psycho II</i> director <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Franklin_(director)\" title=\"Richard Franklin (director)\">Richard Franklin</a> to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for <i>Psycho III</i> began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie <i><a href=\"/wiki/Blood_Simple\" title=\"Blood Simple\">Blood Simple</a></i> directed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Coen_brothers\" title=\"Coen brothers\">Coen brothers</a>. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite <i>Psycho III</i> being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. <a href=\"/wiki/Lee_Garlington\" title=\"Lee Garlington\">Lee Garlington</a>, who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor <a href=\"/wiki/Jeff_Fahey\" title=\"Jeff Fahey\">Jeff Fahey</a> suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. <i>Psycho III</i> was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the <i>Psycho</i> movie franchise.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Roger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of <i>The New York Times</i> said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of <i>The Chicago Reader</i> said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" <i>Variety</i> called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n</p><p>With the financial failure of <i>Psycho III</i>, Universal decided to continue the <i>Psycho</i> franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(TV_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friday the 13th (TV series)\">Friday the 13th</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Freddy%27s_Nightmares\" title=\"Freddy&#39;s Nightmares\">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a></i> TV series. In this televised <a href=\"/wiki/Spin-off_(media)\" title=\"Spin-off (media)\">spin-off</a> of <i>Psycho</i>, Norman Bates is portrayed by <a href=\"/wiki/Kurt_Paul\" title=\"Kurt Paul\">Kurt Paul</a>, who previously stood in as a <a href=\"/wiki/Stunt_double\" title=\"Stunt double\">stunt double</a> for Anthony Perkins in <i>Psycho II</i> and <i>Psycho III</i>. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a <a href=\"/wiki/Pilot_episode\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pilot episode\">pilot</a> for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the <a href=\"/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)\" title=\"Independence Day (United States)\">4th of July</a> weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n</p><p>A year after <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bates_Motel_(film)\" title=\"Bates Motel (film)\">Bates Motel</a></i> aired, production on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_IV:_The_Beginning\" title=\"Psycho IV: The Beginning\">Psycho IV: The Beginning</a></i> began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with <i>Psycho III</i> screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however <i>Psycho III</i> was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and <a href=\"/wiki/Mick_Garris\" title=\"Mick Garris\">Mick Garris</a> was brought in.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stefano\" title=\"Joseph Stefano\">Joseph Stefano</a> was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for <i>Psycho IV</i>, I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Actress <a href=\"/wiki/Olivia_Hussey\" title=\"Olivia Hussey\">Olivia Hussey</a> was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Psycho_Legacy\" title=\"The Psycho Legacy\">The Psycho Legacy</a></i>, Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During filming, Perkins had been diagnosed with <a href=\"/wiki/HIV/AIDS\" title=\"HIV/AIDS\">HIV</a> and had to receive treatment during production. Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>Psycho IV: The Beginning</i> was filmed at <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_Studios_Florida\" title=\"Universal Studios Florida\">Universal Studios Florida</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Orlando,_Florida\" title=\"Orlando, Florida\">Orlando, Florida</a> from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n</p><p>The film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of <i>L Magazine</i> said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty.

Way too obvious and pretty obnoxious.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Despite some negative reviews, the film received high <a href=\"/wiki/Nielson_ratings\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nielson ratings\">Nielson ratings</a> with around 10 million viewers watching the premiere.\n</p><p>In 1997, Universal announced that a remake of <i>Psycho</i> was in production with Gus Van Sant directing.\nThe <a href=\"/wiki/Audio_commentary\" title=\"Audio commentary\">audio commentary</a> track that accompanies the DVD release of the film, and the \"making-of\" documentary (<i>Psycho Path</i>) that the DVD includes, provide numerous details about where the film strived to remain faithful to the original, and where it diverged. Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"<a href=\"/wiki/Aspic\" title=\"Aspic\">aspic</a>\" that would seem <a href=\"/wiki/Anachronism\" title=\"Anachronism\">anachronistic</a> in the new setting.\n</p><p>According to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was <a href=\"/wiki/Norman_Bates\" title=\"Norman Bates\">Norman Bates</a>; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by <a href=\"/wiki/Vera_Miles\" title=\"Vera Miles\">Vera Miles</a>, and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Cinematography\" title=\"Cinematography\">cinematography</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cinematic_techniques\" title=\"Cinematic techniques\">cinematic techniques</a> were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n</p><p>The film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<sup id=\"cite_ref-mojo_28-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-mojo-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> to $60 million;<sup id=\"cite_ref-mojo_28-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-mojo-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> while promoting his 2002 film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Gerry_(2002_film)\" title=\"Gerry (2002 film)\">Gerry</a></i>, Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This version of <i>Psycho</i> received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Award\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Golden Raspberry Award\">Golden Raspberry Awards</a>, for <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Prequel,_Remake,_Rip-off_or_Sequel\" title=\"Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel\">Worst Remake or Sequel</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Director\" title=\"Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director\">Worst Director</a> for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Actress\" title=\"Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress\">Worst Actress</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Camille_Paglia\" title=\"Camille Paglia\">Camille Paglia</a> commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in <a href=\"/wiki/Shot-for-shot\" title=\"Shot-for-shot\">shot-for-shot</a> remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the <a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1960 film)\">1960 film</a> rather than a remake. Film critic <a href=\"/wiki/Roger_Ebert\" title=\"Roger Ebert\">Roger Ebert</a> wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Screenwriter <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stefano\" title=\"Joseph Stefano\">Joseph Stefano</a>, who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Maslin\" title=\"Janet Maslin\">Janet Maslin</a> gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real <i>Psycho</i> (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Perkins\" title=\"Anthony Perkins\">Anthony Perkins</a>'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a <a href=\"/wiki/Double_entendre\" title=\"Double entendre\">double-entendre</a> (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Critic <a href=\"/wiki/Leonard_Maltin\" title=\"Leonard Maltin\">Leonard Maltin</a> gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Continuity\">Continuity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Continuity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While <i>Bates Motel</i> was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where <i>Psycho</i> left off, it ignored the continuity of <i>Psycho II</i>, <i>Psycho III</i>, and <i>Psycho IV: The Beginning</i> due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in <i>Psycho II</i>. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1998 film)\">Psycho</a></i> (1998), a shot-for-shot <a href=\"/wiki/Remake\" title=\"Remake\">remake</a> of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998.

The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. <i>Psycho</i> is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Simpsons\" title=\"The Simpsons\">The Simpsons</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">South Park</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/American_Dad!\" title=\"American Dad!\">American Dad!</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show\" title=\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></i> and more.

Many critics and filmmakers have cited <i>Psycho</i> as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Psycho_Legacy\" title=\"The Psycho Legacy\">The Psycho Legacy</a></i>) \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Perkins\" title=\"Anthony Perkins\">Anthony Perkins</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Leigh\" title=\"Janet Leigh\">Janet Leigh</a> spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock\" title=\"Alfred Hitchcock\">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of <i>Psycho</i>. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to <i>Psycho</i>. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as <i>The Psycho Movies.com</i> have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as <i>Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho</i>, <i>The Moment of Psycho</i>, Janet Leigh's <i>Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller</i> have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including <i>The Making of Psycho</i> (1997) and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Psycho_Legacy\" title=\"The Psycho Legacy\">The Psycho Legacy</a></i> (2010). The film also spawned the show <i><a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock:_The_Art_of_Making_Movies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies\">Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies</a></i> at <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_Studios_Florida\" title=\"Universal Studios Florida\">Universal Studios Florida</a>, with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed.

It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original <i>Psycho</i> film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)\" title=\"Psycho (1960 film)\">Psycho</a></i>, the house was featured in several television productions including <i>The Virginian</i> and <i>Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater</i>.\n</p><p>In 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Night_Gallery\" title=\"Night Gallery\">Night Gallery</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys\" title=\"The Hardy Boys\">The Hardy Boys</a></i> and even in films such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Invitation_to_a_Gunfighter\" title=\"Invitation to a Gunfighter\">Invitation to a Gunfighter</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Modern_Problems\" title=\"Modern Problems\">Modern Problems</a></i>. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_II_(film)\" title=\"Psycho II (film)\">Psycho II</a></i>. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including <i><a href=\"/wiki/Amazing_Stories\" title=\"Amazing Stories\">Amazing Stories</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Knight_Rider_(1982_TV_series)\" title=\"Knight Rider (1982 TV series)\">Knight Rider</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Welcome_to_My_Nightmare\" title=\"Welcome to My Nightmare\">Welcome to My Nightmare</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Diff%27rent_Strokes\" title=\"Diff&#39;rent Strokes\">Diff'rent Strokes</a></i>.\n</p><p>In 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_III\" title=\"Psycho III\">Psycho III</a></i>. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bates_Motel_(film)\" title=\"Bates Motel (film)\">Bates Motel</a></i>. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Murder,_She_Wrote\" title=\"Murder, She Wrote\">Murder, She Wrote</a></i> from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n</p><p>In 1988, plans for <i><a href=\"/wiki/Psycho_IV:_The_Beginning\" title=\"Psycho IV: The Beginning\">Psycho IV: The Beginning</a></i> were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n</p><p>In 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake <i>Psycho</i> were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The <a href=\"/wiki/Studio_Tour\" title=\"Studio Tour\">tram tour</a> features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"24_Hour_Psycho\"><i>24 Hour Psycho</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: 24 Hour Psycho\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>An art installation, <i><a href=\"/wiki/24_Hour_Psycho\" title=\"24 Hour Psycho\">24 Hour Psycho</a></i>, created by artist <a href=\"/wiki/Douglas_Gordon\" title=\"Douglas Gordon\">Douglas Gordon</a> in 1993, and later installed in the <a href=\"/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art\" title=\"Museum of Modern Art\">Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York, consists of a silent screening of <i>Psycho</i>, slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. <i>24 Hour Psycho</i> is featured prominently in <a href=\"/wiki/Don_DeLillo\" title=\"Don DeLillo\">Don DeLillo</a>'s 2010 novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/Point_Omega\" title=\"Point Omega\">Point Omega</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_work\">Related work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Related work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Psycho_Legacy_.282010.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Psycho_Legacy_(2010)\"><i>The Psycho Legacy</i> (2010)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Psycho_(franchise)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: The Psycho Legacy (2010)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/The_Psycho_Legacy\" title=\"The Psycho Legacy\">The Psycho Legacy</a></div>\n<p>In 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called <i>The Psycho Legacy</i>.
