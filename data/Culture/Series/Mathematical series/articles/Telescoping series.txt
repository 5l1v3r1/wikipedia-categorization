In mathematics, a telescoping series is a series whose partial sums eventually only have a fixed number of terms after cancellation.   The cancellation technique, with part of each term cancelling with part of the next term, is known as the method of differences. For example, the series (the series of reciprocals of pronic numbers) simplifies as  Let                                    a                        n                                     {\displaystyle a_{n}}     be a sequence of numbers. Then,  and, if                                    a                        n                             →         0                 {\displaystyle a_{n}\rightarrow 0}     In probability theory, a Poisson process is a stochastic process of which the simplest case involves "occurrences" at random times, the waiting time until the next occurrence having a memoryless exponential distribution, and the number of "occurrences" in any time interval having a Poisson distribution whose expected value is proportional to the length of the time interval.  Let Xt be the number of "occurrences" before time t, and let Tx be the waiting time until the xth "occurrence".  We seek the probability density function of the random variable Tx.  We use the probability mass function for the Poisson distribution, which tells us that where λ is the average number of occurrences in any time interval of length 1.  Observe that the event {Xt ≥ x} is the same as the event {Tx ≤ t}, and thus they have the same probability.  The density function we seek is therefore The sum telescopes, leaving For other applications, see:
