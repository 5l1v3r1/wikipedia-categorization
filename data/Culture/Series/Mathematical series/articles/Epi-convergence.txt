In mathematical analysis, epi-convergence is a type of convergence for real-valued and extended real-valued functions.  Epi-convergence is important because it is the appropriate notion of convergence with which to approximate minimization problems in the field of mathematical optimization. The symmetric notion of hypo-convergence is appropriate for maximization problems. Mosco convergence is a generalization of epi-convergence to infinite dimensional spaces. Let                         X                 {\displaystyle X}     be a metric space, and                                    f                        ν                             :         X         →                    R                          {\displaystyle f^{\nu }:X\to \mathbb {R} }     a real-valued function for each natural number                         ν                 {\displaystyle \nu }    . We say that the sequence                         (                    f                        ν                             )                 {\displaystyle (f^{\nu })}     epi-converges to a function                         f         :         X         →                    R                          {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} }     if for each                         x         ∈         X                 {\displaystyle x\in X}     The following extension allows epi-convergence to be applied to a sequence of functions with non-constant domain. Denote by                                                                R                          ¯                             =                    R                  ∪         {         ±         ∞         }                 {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}=\mathbb {R} \cup \{\pm \infty \}}     the extended real numbers. Let                                    f                        ν                                     {\displaystyle f^{\nu }}     be a function                                    f                        ν                             :         X         →                                                R                          ¯                                     {\displaystyle f^{\nu }:X\to {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}}     for each                         ν         ∈                    N                          {\displaystyle \nu \in \mathbb {N} }    . The sequence                         (                    f                        ν                             )                 {\displaystyle (f^{\nu })}     epi-converges to                         f         :         X         →                                                R                          ¯                                     {\displaystyle f:X\to {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}}     if for each                         x         ∈         X                 {\displaystyle x\in X}     Epi-convergence is the appropriate topology with which to approximate minimization problems. For maximization problems one uses the symmetric notion of hypo-convergence.                         (                    f                        ν                             )                 {\displaystyle (f^{\nu })}     hypo-converges to                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     if and Assume we have a difficult minimization problem  where                         g         :         X         →                    R                          {\displaystyle g:X\to \mathbb {R} }     and                         C         ⊆         X                 {\displaystyle C\subseteq X}    . We can attempt to approximate this problem by a sequence of easier problems for functions                                    g                        ν                                     {\displaystyle g^{\nu }}     and sets                                    C                        ν                                     {\displaystyle C^{\nu }}    . Epi-convergence provides an answer to the question: In what sense should the approximations converge to the original problem in order to guarantee that approximate solutions converge to a solution of the original? We can embed these optimization problems into the epi-convergence framework by defining extended real-valued functions So that the problems                                    inf                        x             ∈             X                             f         (         x         )                 {\displaystyle \inf _{x\in X}f(x)}     and                                    inf                        x             ∈             X                                        f                        ν                             (         x         )                 {\displaystyle \inf _{x\in X}f^{\nu }(x)}     are equivalent to the original and approximate problems, respectively. If                         (                    f                        ν                             )                 {\displaystyle (f^{\nu })}     epi-converges to                         f                 {\displaystyle f}    , then                                    lim sup                        ν             →             ∞                             [         inf                    f                        ν                             ]         ≤         inf         f                 {\displaystyle \limsup _{\nu \to \infty }[\inf f^{\nu }]\leq \inf f}    . Furthermore, if                         x                 {\displaystyle x}     is a limit point of minimizers of                                    f                        ν                                     {\displaystyle f^{\nu }}    , then                         x                 {\displaystyle x}     is a minimizer of                         f                 {\displaystyle f}    . In this sense, Epi-convergence is the weakest notion of convergence for which this result holds.
