In mathematics, the Sturm series  associated with a pair of polynomials is named after Jacques Charles François Sturm. Let                                    p                        0                                     {\displaystyle p_{0}}     and                                    p                        1                                     {\displaystyle p_{1}}     two univariate polynomials. Suppose that they do not have a common root and the degree of                                    p                        0                                     {\displaystyle p_{0}}     is greater than the degree of                                    p                        1                                     {\displaystyle p_{1}}    . The Sturm series is constructed by: This is almost the same algorithm as Euclid's but the remainder                                    p                        i             +             2                                     {\displaystyle p_{i+2}}     has negative sign. Let us see now Sturm series                                    p                        0                             ,                    p                        1                             ,         …         ,                    p                        k                                     {\displaystyle p_{0},p_{1},\dots ,p_{k}}     associated to a characteristic polynomial                         P                 {\displaystyle P}     in the variable                         λ                 {\displaystyle \lambda }    : where                                    a                        i                                     {\displaystyle a_{i}}     for                         i                 {\displaystyle i}     in                         {         1         ,         …         ,         k         }                 {\displaystyle \{1,\dots ,k\}}     are rational functions in                                    R                  (         Z         )                 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} (Z)}     with the coordinate set                         Z                 {\displaystyle Z}    . The series begins with two polynomials obtained by dividing                         P         (         ı         μ         )                 {\displaystyle P(\imath \mu )}     by                                    ı                        k                                     {\displaystyle \imath ^{k}}     where                         ı                 {\displaystyle \imath }     represents the imaginary unit equal to                                                 −             1                                     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}     and separate real and imaginary parts: The remaining terms are defined with the above relation. Due to the special structure of these polynomials, they can be written in the form: In these notations, the quotient                                    q                        i                                     {\displaystyle q_{i}}     is equal to                         (                    c                        i             −             1             ,             0                                        /                             c                        i             ,             0                             )         μ                 {\displaystyle (c_{i-1,0}/c_{i,0})\mu }     which provides the condition                                    c                        i             ,             0                             ≠         0                 {\displaystyle c_{i,0}\neq 0}    . Moreover, the polynomial                                    p                        i                                     {\displaystyle p_{i}}     replaced in the above relation gives the following recursive formulas for computation of the coefficients                                    c                        i             ,             j                                     {\displaystyle c_{i,j}}    . If                                    c                        i             ,             0                             =         0                 {\displaystyle c_{i,0}=0}     for some                         i                 {\displaystyle i}    , the quotient                                    q                        i                                     {\displaystyle q_{i}}     is a higher degree polynomial and the sequence                                    p                        i                                     {\displaystyle p_{i}}     stops at                                    p                        h                                     {\displaystyle p_{h}}     with                         h         <         k                 {\displaystyle h<k}    .
