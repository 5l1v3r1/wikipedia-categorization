In mathematics, the method of dominant balance is used to determine the asymptotic behavior of solutions to an ordinary differential equation without fully solving the equation. The process is iterative, in that the result obtained by performing the method once can be used as input when the method is repeated, to obtain as many terms in the asymptotic expansion as desired.  The process goes as follows: For arbitrary constants  c and a, consider   This differential equation cannot be solved exactly. However, it is useful to consider how the solutions behave for large x: it turns out that                         y                 {\displaystyle y}     behaves like                                    e                        x                                              {\displaystyle e^{x}\,}     as x → ∞ .  More rigorously, we will have                         log         ⁡         (         y         )         ∼                    x                          {\displaystyle \log(y)\sim {x}}    , not                         y         ∼                    e                        x                                     {\displaystyle y\sim e^{x}}    . Since we are interested in the behavior of y in the large x limit, we change variables to  y = exp(S(x)), and re-express the ODE in terms of S(x), or where we have used the product rule and chain rule to evaluate  the derivatives of y. Now  suppose first that a solution to this ODE satisfies  as  x → ∞, so that    as  x → ∞.  Obtain then the dominant asymptotic behaviour by setting If                                    S                        0                                     {\displaystyle S_{0}}     satisfies the above asymptotic conditions, then the above assumption is consistent. The terms we dropped will have been negligible with respect to the ones we kept.                                     S                        0                                     {\displaystyle S_{0}}     is not a solution to the ODE for S, but it represents the dominant asymptotic behavior, which is what we are interested in. Check that this choice for                                    S                        0                                     {\displaystyle S_{0}}     is consistent, Everything is indeed consistent.  Thus the dominant asymptotic behaviour of a solution to our ODE has been found, By convention, the full asymptotic series is written as so to get at least the first term of this series we have to  take a further step to see if there is a power of x out the front. Proceed by  introducing a new subleading dependent variable, and then seek asymptotic solutions for C(x). Substituting into the above ODE for S(x) we find Repeating the same process as before, we keep C'  and (c − a)/x to find that The leading asymptotic behaviour is then
