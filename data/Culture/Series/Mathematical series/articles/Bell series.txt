In mathematics, the Bell series is a formal power series used to study properties of arithmetical functions. Bell series were introduced and developed by Eric Temple Bell. Given an arithmetic function                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     and a prime                         p                 {\displaystyle p}    , define the formal power series                                    f                        p                             (         x         )                 {\displaystyle f_{p}(x)}    , called the Bell series of                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     modulo                         p                 {\displaystyle p}      as: Two multiplicative functions can be shown to be identical if all of their Bell series are equal; this is sometimes called the uniqueness theorem: given multiplicative functions                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     and                         g                 {\displaystyle g}    , one has                         f         =         g                 {\displaystyle f=g}     if and only if: Two series may be multiplied (sometimes called the multiplication theorem): For any two arithmetic functions                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     and                         g                 {\displaystyle g}    , let                         h         =         f         âˆ—         g                 {\displaystyle h=f*g}     be their Dirichlet convolution.  Then for every prime                         p                 {\displaystyle p}    , one has:  In particular, this makes it trivial to find the Bell series of a Dirichlet inverse. If                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     is completely multiplicative, then formally:  The following is a table of the Bell series of well-known arithmetic functions.
