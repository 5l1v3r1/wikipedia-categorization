In mathematics, Kronecker's lemma (see, e.g., Shiryaev (1996, Lemma IV.3.2)) is a result about the relationship between convergence of infinite sums and convergence of sequences. The lemma is often used in the proofs of theorems concerning sums of independent random variables such as the strong Law of large numbers. The lemma is named after the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker. If                         (                    x                        n                                        )                        n             =             1                                   ∞                                     {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }}     is an infinite sequence of real numbers such that  exists and is finite, then we have for all                         0         <                    b                        1                             ≤                    b                        2                             ≤                    b                        3                             ≤         …                 {\displaystyle 0<b_{1}\leq b_{2}\leq b_{3}\leq \ldots }     and                                    b                        n                             →         ∞                 {\displaystyle b_{n}\to \infty }     that  Let                                    S                        k                                     {\displaystyle S_{k}}     denote the partial sums of the x's. Using summation by parts, Pick any ε > 0. Now choose N so that                                    S                        k                                     {\displaystyle S_{k}}     is ε-close to s for k > N. This can be done as the sequence                                    S                        k                                     {\displaystyle S_{k}}     converges to s. Then the right hand side is: Now, let n go to infinity. The first term goes to s, which cancels with the third term. The second term goes to zero (as the sum is a fixed value). Since the b sequence is increasing, the last term is bounded by                         ϵ         (                    b                        n                             −                    b                        N                             )                    /                             b                        n                             ≤         ϵ                 {\displaystyle \epsilon (b_{n}-b_{N})/b_{n}\leq \epsilon }    .
