The Gram–Charlier A series (named in honor of Jørgen Pedersen Gram and Carl Charlier), and the Edgeworth series (named in honor of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth) are series that approximate a probability distribution in terms of its cumulants.  The series are the same; but, the arrangement of terms (and thus the accuracy of truncating the series) differ.  The key idea of these expansions is to write the characteristic function of the distribution whose probability density function  f is to be approximated in terms of the characteristic function of a distribution with known and suitable properties, and to recover f through the inverse Fourier transform. We examine a continuous random variable. Let                                                                f               ^                                                  {\displaystyle {\hat {f}}}     be the characteristic function of its distribution whose density function is f, and                                    κ                        r                                     {\displaystyle \kappa _{r}}     its cumulants. We expand in terms of a known distribution with probability density function ψ, characteristic function                                                                ψ               ^                                                  {\displaystyle {\hat {\psi }}}    , and cumulants                                    γ                        r                                     {\displaystyle \gamma _{r}}    . The density ψ is generally chosen to be that of the normal distribution, but other choices are possible as well. By the definition of the cumulants, we have (see Wallace, 1958)  which gives the following formal identity: By the properties of the Fourier transform,                         (         i         t                    )                        r                                                                    ψ               ^                                          (         t         )                 {\displaystyle (it)^{r}{\hat {\psi }}(t)}     is the Fourier transform of                         (         −         1                    )                        r                             [                    D                        r                             ψ         ]         (         −         x         )                 {\displaystyle (-1)^{r}[D^{r}\psi ](-x)}    , where D is the differential operator with respect to x. Thus, after changing                         x                 {\displaystyle x}     with                         −         x                 {\displaystyle -x}     on both sides of the equation, we find for f the formal expansion If ψ is chosen as the normal density  with mean and variance as given by f, that is, mean                         μ         =                    κ                        1                                     {\displaystyle \mu =\kappa _{1}}     and variance                                    σ                        2                             =                    κ                        2                                     {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}=\kappa _{2}}    , then the expansion becomes since                                    γ                        r                             =         0                 {\displaystyle \gamma _{r}=0}     for all r  > 2, as higher cumulants of the normal distribution are 0. By expanding the exponential and collecting terms according to the order of the derivatives, we arrive at the Gram–Charlier A series. Such an expansion can be written compactly in terms of Bell polynomials as Since the n-th derivative of the Gaussian function                         ϕ                 {\displaystyle \phi }     is given in terms of Hermite polynomial as this gives us the final expression of the Gram-Charlier A series as Integrating the series gives us the cumulative distribution function  where                         Φ                 {\displaystyle \Phi }     is the CDF of the normal distribution.  If we include only the first two correction terms to the normal distribution, we obtain with                         H                    e                        3                             (         x         )         =                    x                        3                             −         3         x                 {\displaystyle He_{3}(x)=x^{3}-3x}     and                         H                    e                        4                             (         x         )         =                    x                        4                             −         6                    x                        2                             +         3                 {\displaystyle He_{4}(x)=x^{4}-6x^{2}+3}    .  Note that this expression is not guaranteed to be positive, and is therefore not a valid probability distribution. The Gram–Charlier A series diverges in many cases of interest—it converges only if                         f         (         x         )                 {\displaystyle f(x)}     falls off faster than                         exp         ⁡         (         −         (                    x                        2                             )                    /                  4         )                 {\displaystyle \exp(-(x^{2})/4)}     at infinity (Cramér 1957). When it does not converge, the series is also not a true asymptotic expansion, because it is not possible to estimate the error of the expansion. For this reason, the Edgeworth series (see next section) is generally preferred over the Gram–Charlier A series. Edgeworth developed a similar expansion as an improvement to the central limit theorem.  The advantage of the Edgeworth series is that the error is controlled, so that it is a true asymptotic expansion. Let                         {                    Z                        i                             }                 {\displaystyle \{Z_{i}\}}     be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with mean                         μ                 {\displaystyle \mu }     and variance                                    σ                        2                                     {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}    , and let                                    X                        n                                     {\displaystyle X_{n}}     be their standardized sums: Let                                    F                        n                                     {\displaystyle F_{n}}     denote the cumulative distribution functions of the variables                                    X                        n                                     {\displaystyle X_{n}}    .

Now assume that, in addition to having mean                         μ                 {\displaystyle \mu }     and variance                                    σ                        2                                     {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}    , the i.i.d. random variables                                    Z                        i                                     {\displaystyle Z_{i}}     have higher cumulants                                    κ                        r                                     {\displaystyle \kappa _{r}}    .

The coefficients of n-m/2 term can be obtained by collecting the monomials of the Bell polynomials corresponding to the integer partitions of m.

As such we need to examine three cases: Thus, the required polynomial is The first five terms of the expansion are  Here, φ(j)(x) is the j-th derivative of φ(·) at point x.

Blinnikov and Moessner (1998) have given a simple algorithm to calculate higher-order terms of the expansion. Note that in case of a lattice distributions (which have discrete values), the Edgeworth expansion must be adjusted to account for the discontinuous jumps between lattice points.
