In mathematics, a series or integral is said to be conditionally convergent if it converges, but it does not converge absolutely. More precisely, a series                                                 ∑                            n               =               0                                         ∞                                                a                            n                                                  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sum \limits _{n=0}^{\infty }a_{n}}     is said to converge conditionally if                                                  lim                            m               →               ∞                                                           ∑                            n               =               0                                         m                                                           a                            n                                                  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \lim \limits _{m\rightarrow \infty }\,\sum \limits _{n=0}^{m}\,a_{n}}     exists and is a finite number (not ∞ or −∞), but                                                 ∑                            n               =               0                                         ∞                                                |                            a                                n                                         |                      =           ∞           .                          {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sum \limits _{n=0}^{\infty }\left|a_{n}\right|=\infty .}     A classic example is the alternating series given by which converges to                          ln         ⁡         (         2         )                 {\displaystyle \ln(2)}    , but is not absolutely convergent (see Harmonic series). Bernhard Riemann proved that a conditionally convergent series of real numbers may be rearranged to converge to any value at all, including ∞ or −∞; see Riemann series theorem. The Lévy–Steinitz theorem identifies the set of values to which a series of terms in Rn can converge. A typical conditionally convergent integral is that on the non-negative real axis of                         sin         ⁡         (                    x                        2                             )                 {\displaystyle \sin(x^{2})}     (see Fresnel integral).
