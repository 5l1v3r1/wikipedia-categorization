In mathematics and computer science, a rational series is a generalisation of the concept of formal power series over a ring to the case when the basic algebraic structure is no longer a ring but a semiring, and the indeterminates adjoined are not assumed to commute.  They can be regarded as algebraic expressions of a formal language over a finite alphabet. Let R be a semiring and A a finite alphabet. A noncommutative polynomial over A is a finite formal sum of words over A.  They form a semiring                         R         ⟨         A         ⟩                 {\displaystyle R\langle A\rangle }    . A formal series is a R-valued function c, on the free monoid A*, which may be written as The set of formal series is denoted                         R         ⟨         ⟨         A         ⟩         ⟩                 {\displaystyle R\langle \langle A\rangle \rangle }     and becomes a semiring under the operations A non-commutative polynomial thus corresponds to a function c on A* of finite support. In the case when R is a ring, then this is the Magnus ring over R.  If L is a language over A, regarded as a subset of A* we can form the characteristic series of L as the formal series corresponding to the characteristic function of L. In                         R         ⟨         ⟨         A         ⟩         ⟩                 {\displaystyle R\langle \langle A\rangle \rangle }     one can define an operation of iteration expressed as and formalised as The rational operations are the addition and multiplication of formal series, together with iteration. A rational series is a formal series obtained by rational operations from                         R         ⟨         A         ⟩                 {\displaystyle R\langle A\rangle }    .
