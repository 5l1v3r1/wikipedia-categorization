In mathematical analysis, Lambert summation is a summability method for a class of divergent series. A series                         ∑                    a                        n                                     {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}}     is Lambert summable to A, written                         ∑                    a                        n                             =         A                  (                    L                  )                 {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}=A\,(\mathrm {L} )}    , if If a series is convergent to A then it is Lambert summable to A (an Abelian theorem).
