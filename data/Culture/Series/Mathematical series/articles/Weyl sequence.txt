In mathematics, a Weyl sequence is a sequence from the equidistribution theorem proven by Hermann Weyl:  The sequence of all multiples of an irrational α, In other words, the sequence of the fractional parts of each term will be uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1). In computing, an integer version of this sequence is often used to generate a discrete uniform distribution rather than a continuous one.   Instead of using an irrational number, which cannot be calculated on a digital computer, the ratio of two integers is used in its place.  An integer k is chosen, relatively prime to an integer modulus m.  In the common case that m is a power of 2, this amounts to requiring that k is odd. The sequence of all multiples of such an integer integer k, That is, the sequence of the remainders of each term when divided by m will be uniformly distributed in the interval [0, m). The term appears to originate with George Marsaglia’s paper "Xorshift RNGs".   The following C code generates what Marsaglia calls a "Weyl sequence": In this case, the odd integer is 362437, and the results are computed modulo m = 232 because d is a 32-bit quantity. The results are equidistributed modulo 232.
