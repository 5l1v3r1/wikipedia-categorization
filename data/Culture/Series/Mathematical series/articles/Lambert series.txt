In mathematics, a Lambert series, named for Johann Heinrich Lambert, is a series taking  the form It can be resummed formally by expanding the denominator: where the coefficients of the new series are given by the Dirichlet convolution of an with the constant function 1(n) = 1: This series may be inverted by means of the Möbius inversion formula, and is an example of a Möbius transform. Since this last sum is a typical number-theoretic sum, almost any natural multiplicative function will be exactly summable when used in a Lambert series.  Thus, for example, one has where                                    σ                        0                             (         n         )         =         d         (         n         )                 {\displaystyle \sigma _{0}(n)=d(n)}     is the number of positive divisors of the number n. For the higher order sigma functions, one has where                         α                 {\displaystyle \alpha }     is any complex number and is the divisor function. Lambert series in which the an are trigonometric functions, for example, an = sin(2n x), can be evaluated by various combinations of the logarithmic derivatives of Jacobi theta functions. Other Lambert series include those for the Möbius function                         μ         (         n         )                 {\displaystyle \mu (n)}    : For Euler's totient function                         φ         (         n         )                 {\displaystyle \varphi (n)}    : For Liouville's function                         λ         (         n         )                 {\displaystyle \lambda (n)}    : with the sum on the right similar to the Ramanujan theta function, or Jacobi theta function                                    ϑ                        3                             (         q         )                 {\displaystyle \vartheta _{3}(q)}    . We also have a slightly more generalized Lambert series expansion generating the sum of squares function                                    r                        2                             (         n         )                 {\displaystyle r_{2}(n)}     in the form of    In general, if we write the Lambert series over                         f         (         n         )                 {\displaystyle f(n)}     which generates the arithmetic functions                         g         (         m         )         =         (         f         ∗         1         )         (         m         )                 {\displaystyle g(m)=(f\ast 1)(m)}    , the next pairs of functions correspond to other well-known convolutions expressed by their Lambert series generating functions in the forms of  where                         ε         (         n         )         =                    δ                        n             ,             1                                     {\displaystyle \varepsilon (n)=\delta _{n,1}}     is the multiplicative identity for Dirichlet convolutions,                                    Id                        k                             ⁡         (         n         )         =                    n                        k                                     {\displaystyle \operatorname {Id} _{k}(n)=n^{k}}     is the identity function for                                    k                        t             h                                     {\displaystyle k^{th}}     powers,                                    χ                        sq                                     {\displaystyle \chi _{\operatorname {sq} }}     denotes the characteristic function for the squares,                         ω         (         n         )                 {\displaystyle \omega (n)}     which counts the number of distinct prime factors of                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     (see prime omega function),                                    J                        t                                     {\displaystyle J_{t}}     is Jordan's totient function, and                         d         (         n         )         =                    σ                        0                             (         n         )                 {\displaystyle d(n)=\sigma _{0}(n)}     is the divisor function (see Dirichlet convolutions). Substituting                         q         =                    e                        −             z                                     {\displaystyle q=e^{-z}}     one obtains another common form for the series, as where as before. Examples of Lambert series in this form, with                         z         =         2         π                 {\displaystyle z=2\pi }    , occur in expressions for the Riemann zeta function for odd integer values; see Zeta constants for details. In the literature we find Lambert series applied to a wide variety of sums.  For example, since                                    q                        n                                        /                  (         1         −                    q                        n                             )         =                                 L             i                                   0                             (                    q                        n                             )                 {\displaystyle q^{n}/(1-q^{n})=\mathrm {Li} _{0}(q^{n})}     is a polylogarithm function, we may refer to any sum of the form as a Lambert series, assuming that the parameters are suitably restricted.  Thus which holds for all complex q not on the unit circle, would be considered a Lambert series identity.  This identity follows in a straightforward fashion from some identities published by the Indian mathematician S. Ramanujan.  A very thorough exploration of Ramanujan's works can be found in the works by Bruce Berndt. A somewhat newer construction recently published over 2017–2018 relates to so-termed Lambert series factorization theorems of the form   where                                    s                        o                             (         n         ,         k         )         ±                    s                        e                             (         n         ,         k         )         =         [                    q                        n                             ]         (         ∓         q         ;         q                    )                        ∞                                                                    q                                k                                                        1               ±                                q                                    k                                                                                  {\displaystyle s_{o}(n,k)\pm s_{e}(n,k)=[q^{n}](\mp q;q)_{\infty }{\frac {q^{k}}{1\pm q^{k}}}}     is the respective sum or difference of the  restricted partition functions                                    s                        e                            /                          o                             (         n         ,         k         )                 {\displaystyle s_{e/o}(n,k)}     which denote the number of                         k                 {\displaystyle k}    's in all partitions of                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     into an even (respectively, odd) number of distinct parts.

Another characteristic form of the Lambert series factorization theorem expansions is given by   where                         (         q         ;         q                    )                        ∞                                     {\displaystyle (q;q)_{\infty }}     is the (infinite) q-Pochhammer symbol. The invertible matrix products on the right-hand-side of the previous equation correspond to inverse matrix products whose lower triangular entries are given in terms of the partition function and the Möbius function by the divisor sums The next table lists the first several rows of these corresponding inverse matrices.

Then we have the following recurrence relations for involving these functions and the pentagonal numbers proved in:  Derivatives of a Lambert series can be obtained by differentiation of the series termwise with respect to                         q                 {\displaystyle q}    . We have the following identities for the termwise                                    s                        t             h                                     {\displaystyle s^{th}}     derivatives of a Lambert series for any                         s         ≥         1                 {\displaystyle s\geq 1}        where the bracketed triangular coefficients in the previous equations denote the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds.
