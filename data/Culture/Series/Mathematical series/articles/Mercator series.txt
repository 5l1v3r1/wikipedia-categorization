In mathematics, the Mercator series or Newton–Mercator series is the Taylor series for the natural logarithm: In summation notation, The series converges to the natural logarithm (shifted by 1) whenever                         −         1         <         x         ≤         1                 {\displaystyle -1<x\leq 1}     . The series was discovered independently by Nicholas Mercator, Isaac Newton  and Gregory Saint-Vincent. It was first published by Mercator, in his 1668 treatise Logarithmotechnia. The series can be obtained from Taylor's theorem, by inductively computing the nth derivative of                         ln         ⁡         (         x         )                 {\displaystyle \ln(x)}     at                         x         =         1                 {\displaystyle x=1}     , starting with Alternatively, one can start with the finite geometric series (                        t         ≠         −         1                 {\displaystyle t\neq -1}    ) which gives It follows that and by termwise integration, If                         −         1         <         x         ≤         1                 {\displaystyle -1<x\leq 1}     , the remainder term tends to 0 as                         n         →         ∞                 {\displaystyle n\to \infty }    . This expression may be integrated iteratively k more times to yield where and are polynomials in x.  Setting                         x         =         1                 {\displaystyle x=1}     in the Mercator series yields the alternating harmonic series The complex power series is the Taylor series for                         −         log         ⁡         (         1         −         z         )                 {\displaystyle -\log(1-z)}     , where log denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm. This series converges precisely for all complex number                                    |                  z                    |                  ≤         1         ,         z         ≠         1                 {\displaystyle |z|\leq 1,z\neq 1}    . In fact, as seen by the ratio test, it has radius of convergence equal to 1, therefore converges absolutely on every disk B(0, r) with radius r < 1. Moreover, it converges uniformly on every nibbled disk                                                                                 B                 (                 0                 ,                 1                 )                              ¯                                   ∖           B           (           1           ,           δ           )                          {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\overline {B(0,1)}}\setminus B(1,\delta )}    , with δ > 0. This follows at once from the algebraic identity: observing that the right-hand side is uniformly convergent on the whole closed unit disk.
