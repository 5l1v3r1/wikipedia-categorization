In mathematics, the field                                                 T                                   L             E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{LE}}     of logarithmic-exponential transseries is a non-Archimedean ordered differential field which extends comparability of asymptotic growth rates of elementary nontrigonometric functions to a much broader class of objects. Each log-exp transseries represents a formal asymptotic behavior, and it can be manipulated formally, and when it converges (or in every case if using special semantics such as through infinite surreal numbers), corresponds to actual behavior. Transseries can also be convenient for representing functions.  Through their inclusion of exponentiation and logarithms, transseries are a strong generalization of the power series at infinity (                                   ∑                        n             =             0                                   ∞                                                                    a                                n                                                        x                                n                                                                 {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {a_{n}}{x^{n}}}}    ) and other similar asymptotic expansions. The field                                                 T                                   L             E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{LE}}     was introduced independently by Dahn-Göring  and Ecalle  in the respective contexts of model theory or exponential fields and of the study of analytic singularity and proof by Ecalle of the Dulac conjectures. It constitutes a formal object, extending the field of exp-log functions of Hardy and the field of accelerando-summable series of Ecalle. The field                                                 T                                   L             E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{LE}}     enjoys a rich structure: an ordered field with a notion of generalized series and sums, with a compatible derivation with distinguished antiderivation, compatible exponential and logarithm functions and a notion of formal composition of series. Informally speaking, exp-log transseries are well-based (i.e. reverse well-ordered) formal Hahn series of real powers of the posive infinite indeterminate                         x                 {\displaystyle x}    , exponentials, logarithms and their compositions, with real coefficients. Two important additionnal conditions are that the exponential and logarithmic depth of an exp-log transseries                         f                 {\displaystyle f}    , that is the maximal numbers of iterations of exp and log occurring in                         f                 {\displaystyle f}    , must be finite. The following formal series are log-exp transseries: The following formal series are not log-exp transseries: It is possible to define differential fields of transseries containing the two last series, they belong respectively to                                                 T                                   E             L                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{EL}}     and                                    R                             ⟨                        ⟨             ω             ⟩                      ⟩                          {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \left\langle \left\langle \omega \right\rangle \right\rangle }     (see the paragraph Using surreal numbers below). A remarkable fact is that asymptotic growth rates of elementary nontrigonometric functions and even all functions definable in the model theoretic structure                         (                    R                  ,         +         ,         ×         ,         <         ,         exp         )                 {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+,\times ,<,\exp )}     of the ordered exponential field of real numbers are all comparable:  For all such                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     and                         g                 {\displaystyle g}    , we have                         f                    ≤                        ∞                             g                 {\displaystyle f\leq _{\infty }g}     or                         g                    ≤                        ∞                             f                 {\displaystyle g\leq _{\infty }f}    , where                         f                    ≤                        ∞                             g                 {\displaystyle f\leq _{\infty }g}     means                         ∃         x         ∀         y         >         x         f         (         x         )         ≤         g         (         x         )                 {\displaystyle \exists x\forall y>xf(x)\leq g(x)}    .  The equivalence class of                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     under the relation                         f                    ≤                        ∞                             g         ∧         g                    ≤                        ∞                             f                 {\displaystyle f\leq _{\infty }g\wedge g\leq _{\infty }f}      is the asymptotic behavior of                         f                 {\displaystyle f}    , also called the germ of                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     (or the germ of                         f                 {\displaystyle f}     at infinity). The field of transseries can be intuitively viewed as a formal generalization these growth rates:  In addition to the elementary operations, transseries are closed under "limits" for appropriate sequences with bounded exponential and logarithmic depth.  However, a complication is that growth rates are non-Archimedean and hence do not have the least upper bound property.  We can address this by associating a sequence with the least upper bound of minimal complexity, analogously to construction of surreal numbers.  For example,                         (                    ∑                        k             =             0                                   n                                        x                        −             k                                        )                        n             ∈                            N                                                  {\displaystyle (\sum _{k=0}^{n}x^{-k})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}     is associated with                                    ∑                        k             =             0                                   ∞                                        x                        −             k                                     {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }x^{-k}}     rather than                                    ∑                        k             =             0                                   ∞                                        x                        −             k                             −                    e                        −             x                                     {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }x^{-k}-e^{-x}}     because                                    e                        −             x                                     {\displaystyle e^{-x}}     decays too quickly, and if we identify fast decay with complexity, it has greater complexity than necessary (also, because we care only about asymptotic behavior, pointwise convergence is not dispositive). Because of the comparability, transseries do not include oscillatory growth rates (such as                         sin         ⁡         x                 {\displaystyle \sin x}    ).  On the other hand, there are transseries such as                                    ∑                        k             ∈                            N                                          k         !                    e                                       x                                −                                                         k                                            k                       +                       1                                                                                                                          {\displaystyle \sum \limits _{k\in \mathbb {N} }k!\operatorname {e} ^{x^{-{\frac {k}{k+1}}}}}     that do not directly correspond to convergent series or real valued functions. Another limitation of transseries is that each of them is bounded by a tower of exponentials, i.e. a finite iteration                                    e                                       e                                                   .                                                               .                                                                           .                                                                                       e                                                                x                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} ^{\operatorname {e} ^{.^{.^{.^{\operatorname {e} ^{x}}}}}}}     of                                    e                        x                                     {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} ^{x}}    , thereby excluding tetration and other transexponential functions, i.e. functions which grow faster than any tower of exponentials. There are ways to construct fields of generalized transseries including formal transsexponential terms, for instance formal solutions                                    e                        ω                                     {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} _{\omega }}     of the Abel equation                                    e                                       e                                ω                                         ⁡             (             x             )                             =                    e                        ω                             ⁡         (         x         +         1         )                 {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} ^{\operatorname {e} _{\omega }(x)}=\operatorname {e} _{\omega }(x+1)}    .  Transseries can be defined as formal (potentially infinite) expressions, with rules defining which expressions are valid, comparison of transseries, arithmetic operations, and even differentiation.  Appropriate transseries can then be assigned to corresponding functions or germs, but there are subtleties involving convergence.  Even transseries that diverge can often be meaningfully (and uniquely) assigned actual growth rates (that agree with the formal operations on transseries) using accelero-summation, which is a generalization of Borel summation. Transseries can be formalized in several equivalent ways; we use one of the simplest ones here. A transseries is a well-based sum                         ∑                    a                        i                                        m                        i                                     {\displaystyle \sum a_{i}m_{i}}     with finite exponential depth, where each                                    a                        i                                     {\displaystyle a_{i}}     is a nonzero real number and                                    m                        i                                     {\displaystyle m_{i}}     is a monic transmonomial (                                   a                        i                                        m                        i                                     {\displaystyle a_{i}m_{i}}     is a transmonomial but is not monic unless the coefficient                                    a                        i                             =         1                 {\displaystyle a_{i}=1}    ; each                                    m                        i                                     {\displaystyle m_{i}}     is different; the order of the summands is irrelevant). The sum might be infinite or transfinite; it is usually written in the order of decreasing                                    m                        i                                     {\displaystyle m_{i}}    . Here, well-based means that there is no infinite ascending sequence                                    m                                       i                                1                                                         <                    m                                       i                                2                                                         <                    m                                       i                                3                                                         <         ⋯                 {\displaystyle m_{i_{1}}<m_{i_{2}}<m_{i_{3}}<\cdots }     (see well-ordering). A monic transmonomial is one of 1, x, log x, log log x, ..., epurely_large_transseries. A purely large transseries is a nonempty transseries                         ∑                    a                        i                                        m                        i                                     {\displaystyle \sum a_{i}m_{i}}     with every                                    m                        i                             >         1                 {\displaystyle m_{i}>1}    . Transseries have finite exponential depth, where each level of nesting of e or log increases depth by 1 (so we cannot have x + log x + log log x + ...). Addition of transseries is termwise:                         ∑                    a                        i                                        m                        i                             +         ∑                    b                        i                                        m                        i                             =         ∑         (                    a                        i                             +                    b                        i                             )                    m                        i                                     {\displaystyle \sum a_{i}m_{i}+\sum b_{i}m_{i}=\sum (a_{i}+b_{i})m_{i}}     (absence of a term is equated with a zero coefficient). Comparison: The most significant term of                         ∑                    a                        i                                        m                        i                                     {\displaystyle \sum a_{i}m_{i}}     is                                    a                        i                                        m                        i                                     {\displaystyle a_{i}m_{i}}     for the largest                                    m                        i                                     {\displaystyle m_{i}}     (because the sum is well-based, this exists for nonzero transseries).                          ∑                    a                        i                                        m                        i                                     {\displaystyle \sum a_{i}m_{i}}     is positive iff the coefficient of the most significant term is positive (this is why we used 'purely large' above).  X > Y iff X − Y is positive. Comparison of monic transmonomials: Multiplication: This essentially applies the distributive law to the product; because the series is well-based, the inner sum is always finite. Differentiation: With these definitions, transseries is an ordered differential field.  Transseries is also a valued field, with the valuation                         ν                 {\displaystyle \nu }     given by the leading monic transmonomial, and the corresponding asymptotic relation defined for                         0         ≠         f         ,         g         ∈                                 T                                   L             E                                     {\displaystyle 0\neq f,g\in \mathbb {T} ^{LE}}     by                         f         ≺         g                 {\displaystyle f\prec g}     if                         ∀         0         <         r         ∈                    R                  ,                    |                  f                    |                  <         r                    |                  g                    |                          {\displaystyle \forall 0<r\in \mathbb {R} ,|f|<r|g|}     (where                                    |                  f                    |                  =         max         (         f         ,         −         f         )                 {\displaystyle |f|=\max(f,-f)}     is the absolute value). We first define the subfield                                                 T                                   E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{E}}     of                                                 T                                   L             E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{LE}}     of so-called log-free transseries. Those are transseries which exclude any logarithmic term. Inductive definition: For                         n         ∈                    N                          {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} }    , we will define a linearly ordered multiplicative group of monomials                                                                M                                                n                                     {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {M}}_{n}}    . We then let                                                 T                                   n                                   E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{n}^{E}}     denote the field of well-based series                                    R                  [         [                                                M                                                n                             ]         ]                 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [[{\mathfrak {M}}_{n}]]}    .

(This conjecture is informal since we have not defined which isomorphisms of Hardy fields into differential subfields of                                    T                          {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} }     are permitted.)

Without defining accelero-summation, we note that when operations on convergent transseries produce a divergent one while the same operations on the corresponding germs produce a valid germ, we can then associate the divergent transseries with that germ. A Hardy field is said maximal if it is properly contained in no Hardy field. By an application of Zorn's lemma, every Hardy field is contained in a maximal Hardy field. It is conjectured that all maximal Hardy fields are elementary equivalent as differential fields, and indeed have the same first order theory as                                                 T                                   L             E                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{LE}}    .  Logarithmic-transseries do not themselves correspond to a maximal Hardy field for not every transseries corresponds to a real function, and maximal Hardy fields always contain transsexponential functions.
