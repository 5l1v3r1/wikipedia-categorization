Bandit is a series of four made-for-television film spin-offs  based on the popular Smokey and the Bandit film series. The four films in the series are: Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel. They were produced for Universal Television's Action Pack syndicated programming block in 1994 from original director/writer Hal Needham. Brian Bloom stars in the series as a younger version of Bandit, the character originated by Burt Reynolds in the Smokey and the Bandit films. The series also serves as a prequel as it focuses on events that took place prior to the original film.  The car featured in these films is a Dodge Stealth while the Smokey and the Bandit films featured three generations of the Pontiac Trans Am. Bandit goes home for a family reunion and, along the way, he meets music star Mel Tillis who is forced to make an emergency landing when his plane malfunctions. Bandit helps Mel but soon finds himself in hot water when his cousin Johnny (Christopher Atkins) gets into the music bootlegging business. A Bandit imposter (Gerard Christopher) lands Bandit in jail, but he needs to break out to deliver a futuristic car safely to the Governor (Gary Collins). Bandit is on the run with Crystal "the Beauty" (Kathy Ireland), a young woman being pursued by a mobster (Tony Curtis), a bounty hunter (Joseph Cortese) and the FBI. Bandit inherits a carnival from his Uncle Cyrus (Donald O'Connor), but has to get down and dirty when shady characters try to interfere. On October 12, 2010, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released all four television films on DVD along with the Smokey and the Bandit trilogy as part of Smokey and the Bandit: The 7-Movie Outlaw Collection.
