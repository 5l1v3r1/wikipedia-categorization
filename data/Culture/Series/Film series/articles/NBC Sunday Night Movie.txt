The NBC Sunday Night Movie was a weekly film block which ran on NBC on Sunday nights from 9-11pm or 8:30pm until 11pm. This was NBC's counterprogramming to the CBS Sunday Movie. The last film to air was Friday Night Lights with 2.6 million viewers.   During the mid-1980s the Sunday Night Movie was aired consistently enough to be ranked in the top 30 highest rated programs for 1985-1988.  Between 1976 and 1981, the Sunday Night Movie was replaced by an umbrella program, The Big Event. Although many Big Events were film premieres, made for TV movies and installments of miniseries, some were specials and sports events. Similar to The NBC Monday Movie.
