Count Bobby (German: Graf Bobby) is a fictional Viennese comic figure that has been very popular for many years. The inventors of Count Bobby are unknown. Originally a popular figure in jokes, in the early 1950s Count Bobby became so popular that the jokes were collected in anthologies. Later, he was the main character in a number of films, played by Peter Alexander. Many of the jokes about Count Bobby also feature his friend Baron Rudi, who is a little more versed in the ways of the actual world, more energetic and a little brighter, and thus the perfect foil for Bobby. Their stories range from the silly to the downright philosophical. Both Count Bobby and Baron Rudi are a little remote from daily life; their education is somewhat problematic; their intellectual abilities are only so-so; but their manners are impeccable. Both have a hard time making ends meet - but noblesse oblige! They speak in a slightly bored inflection in a nasal Viennese dialect known as Schönbrunnerdeutsch, or German as spoken at the Habsburg Imperial Court at Schönbrunn.
