 893239 or Yakuza-Nijusan-Ku (ヤクザ23区) is the project name for a collection of short films based on Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) and 23-区 (Ku, or special wards) in Tokyo, Japan. Each clip is about 5–18 minutes long and is shot by a different director with his own crew from various backgrounds. The project covers almost all the 23 wards in Tokyo with an extra episode shot in the City of Torrance (which has the biggest Japanese population in the continental US) in Los Angeles County. This project was promoted through its official website with trailers and through YouTube where each entire movie is shown.  The films were shot and edited between 2005 and 2006 by 23 different producers in one of the 26 wards in Tokyo which they liked to shoot a movie about. During the first promotion phase (November 27-February 14), the movies were in Japanese only, but English-subtitled versions were added in early February 2007. (These newly added versions were planned to be broadcast on YouTube until the end of February 2007.) January 28, 2007 Yahoo!Japan announced in its MOVIE section that 893239 collections had over 100,000 accesses on YouTube.  Sports Houchi (daily newspaper) had its first coverage on 893239. As of August 2007, most of these were seemingly removed from YouTube by their uploaders. English Title" (Original Title) Alphabetical order by English title. (Film Runtime: MM:SS)
