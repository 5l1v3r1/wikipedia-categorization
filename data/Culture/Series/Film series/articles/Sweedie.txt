Sweedie, a.k.a. My Sweedie, The Swedish Maid is a fictional character portrayed by actor Wallace Beery in a series of comedy films  from 1914â€“16. The series is notable as the means by which Beery, a particularly masculine actor (which is the series' joke), first made his name in the film industry.
