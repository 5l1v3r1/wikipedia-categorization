Cannon Movie Tales is the collective name for a series of live-action films created in the late 1980s by Cannon Group producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, associate producer Patricia Ruben, and executive producer Itzik Kol. Filmed principally on location in Israel, these stories are generally fairy tales based on material by either the Brothers Grimm or Charles Perrault, among others. Major stars, from both the United States and the United Kingdom, play the leading roles, in which they are joined by a mostly all-Israeli cast. The major Israeli-born member of the crew was the series' production designer, Marek Dobrowolski.  Announced as early as May 1986 (at the Cannes Film Festival),  Cannon initiated the project as its answer to Disney's fairy-tale offerings, and invested US$50 million in the series.   Sixteen stories, each costing US$1.5 million,  were originally planned;   only nine were released.
