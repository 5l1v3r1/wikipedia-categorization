Curious George is a multi-media franchise based on the book series of the same name by H. A. Rey and Margret Rey. The series began with the 2006 theatrical release of Curious George. The film's success led it to receiving two direct-to-video sequels, a television series (which aired three specials during its run) as well as a video game.
