The Adventures of Justine is a series of seven erotic feature films and television films featuring Daneen Boone as the heroine Justine Wilkenson. Justine is a precocious teenage student who dreams about the be-spectacled but handsome Professor Robson, a faculty member at the Topacre Academy for gifted young girls. Justine, along with several of the other girls, is infatuated with the Professor. Justine and Robson are involved in each episode with archeological and erotic adventures Ã  la Indiana Jones, with bad guys trying to steal an ancient artifact but obviously being more interested in engaging in lots of sex acts and kidnapping Justine. Justine always manages one way or another to remain a virgin. Most episodes conclude with the suggestion that the adventure has simply been Justine's dream, daydream or fantasy. The theme song "Justine" was written by Michael Sutton and Wendy Young. The film A Private Affair was written by Brian Clemens.
