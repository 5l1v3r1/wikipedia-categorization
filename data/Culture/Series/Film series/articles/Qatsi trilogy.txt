The Qatsi trilogy is the informal name given to a series of three cinematic films produced by Godfrey Reggio and scored by Philip Glass: The titles of all three motion pictures are words from the Hopi language, in which the word qatsi translates to "life." The series was produced by the Institute For Regional Education, who also created the Fund For Change.   Many of director Godfrey Reggio's other motion-pictures use  cinematic techniques and stylistic elements he first explored in the Qatsi trilogy. The cinematic films of Koyaanisqatsi cinematographer Ron Fricke—Chronos (1985), Baraka (1992), and Samsara (2011)—are also made in a similar style.
