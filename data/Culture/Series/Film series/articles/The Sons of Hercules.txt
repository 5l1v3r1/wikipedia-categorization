The Sons of Hercules was a syndicated Embassy Pictures television show that aired in the United States of America in the 1960s.  The series repackaged 13 Italian sword-and-sandal films by giving them a standardized theme song for the opening and closing titles, as well as a standard introductory narration attempting to relate the lead character in each film to the Greek demigod Hercules. These films however were not all originally made as "Hercules" films in Italy.  Although two of them did originally feature Hercules (and not his sons),  four of the films were originally Maciste movies in Italy, and the others were just isolated gladiator or mythological hero movies not released theatrically in the US. There were 13 films in the Sons of Hercules syndication package. The first title listed for each film was its American television title, followed by the translated original Italian title in parentheses:  (Note* - Some channels broke the films up into two parts, and showed them in two weekly one-hour time slots as if it were a weekly TV series.)
