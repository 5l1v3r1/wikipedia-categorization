 Finding Nemo is a CGI animated film series and Disney media franchise that began with the 2003 film of the same name, produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

The film tells the story of a clownfish named Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) who gets abducted, his over-protective father Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) who, along with a regal tang named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), searches for him all the way to Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and let little Nemo take care of himself. Finding Dory is the seventeenth Pixar film. The film focuses on the amnesiac character Dory, (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who travels to California to find her long-lost parents, Jenny and Charlie, as well as exploring the idea of her being reunited with her family.  It takes place one year after Finding Nemo and is set off the coast of Morro Bay, California.
