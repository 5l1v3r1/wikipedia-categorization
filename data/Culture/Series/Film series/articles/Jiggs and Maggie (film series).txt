Jiggs and Maggie were the major characters in a series of films made by the American studio Monogram Pictures between 1946 and 1950. Jiggs and Maggie are Irish immigrants to the United States, who constantly argue. The characters were created by the cartoonist George McManus in his long-running strip Bringing Up Father.  McManus appears in four of the films, playing himself. The characters had first appeared on screen in the 1928 MGM film Bringing Up Father. In 1946 Monogram made a fresh version starring actors Joe Yule and Renie Riano. Due to the popularity of the film, a series of four spin-offs were made. Monogram was a low-budget studio that specializes in making comedy, crime and western series. The final film in the series, Jiggs and Maggie Out West, was released a little less than a month after Yule suffered a fatal heart attack.
