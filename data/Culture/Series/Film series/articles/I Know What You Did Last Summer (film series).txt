 I Know What You Did Last Summer is an American horror film series, based on the novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. The series consists of three films. After an accident on a winding road, four teens make the fatal mistake of dumping their victim's body into the sea. But exactly one year later, the dead man returns from his watery grave and he's looking for more than an apology. The murderous fisherman with a hook is back to once again stalk the two surviving teens, Julie James and Ray Bronson who left him for dead, as well as cause even more murder and mayhem, this time at a posh island resort. A group of teenagers in Colorado find themselves being stalked and killed one by one by a mysterious figure with a hook, exactly one year after they covered up a friend's accidental death. On September 14, 2014, Sony reported that they have plans to remake the film; Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard are writing a script. In a June 1, 2016, Blumhouse.com "Shockwaves" podcast, writer Mike Flanagan revealed and further confirmed this new iteration and reimagination of the franchise would not have any inventions of the Lois Duncan novel (the antagonist being a central character) nor the 1997 feature (the fisherman Ben Willis and four primary protagonists Julie James, Helen Shivers, Barry Cox, and Ray Bronson). Further, the new direction and scope of the film necessitates an estimated budget of $15â€“20 million. Sony also states that the film is a high priority and is set for a release somewhere between 2017 and 2020.
