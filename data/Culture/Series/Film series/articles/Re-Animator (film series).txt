Re-Animator is a film series consisting of three horror films directed by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna. They are based on the 1922 short story Herbert Westâ€“Reanimator by H. P. Lovecraft. The lead character, Herbert West, is portrayed by actor Jeffrey Combs in all three films. Two unproduced sequels were Island of Re-Animator, a The Island of Doctor Moreau-style story  and the better known House of Re-Animator  which would have featured Dr. Herbest West reanimating the President of the United States.  In 2017, an Italian version entitled Herbert West: Re-Animator was released with Emanuele Cerman as Dr. Herbert West.  A film by the name of Antihuman was set to release in early 2017 before being rebranded into the Re-Animator franchise as Re-Animator: Evolution with Johnathan Schaech in the lead role as Dr. Herbert West. The title was then changed to Herbert West: Re-Animator with a release date of December 15, 2018, and Schaech no longer on the cast list. It was described as "much darker, more thought provoking, and more so grounded in science than the original film" and will keep in tune with the original Lovecraft story. No news has been released since late 2016 though.   Between 1991 and 1992, Adventure Comics, a division of Malibu Comics, released two miniseries related to the films:
