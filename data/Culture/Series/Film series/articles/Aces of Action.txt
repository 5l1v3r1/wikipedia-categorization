"Aces of Action" was the informal nickname given to the movie teaming of Richard Arlen and Andy Devine. They made a number of low budget action films together for Universal.   In February 1939 Universal announced they would make seven "outdoor pictures" starring the duo over the next year, all produced by Ben Pivar.   The films were well received and the series continued until Arlen left Universal for Pine-Thomas Productions. Universal then tried Devine in a series of other "buddy" comedies, teaming him with Leo Carillo and Broderick Crawford.
