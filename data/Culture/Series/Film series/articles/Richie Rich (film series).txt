The Richie Rich films is a series of two American family films, based on the character of the same name, who was originally featured in Harvey Comics. The first film was a theatrical release directed by Donald Petrie, that stars Macaulay Culkin. Its sequel was a direct-to-video feature directed by John Murlowski, starring David Gallagher replacing Macaulay Culkin. Both films were distributed by Warner Bros. The film features Richard "Richie" Rich Jr. (Macaulay Culkin), who is the world's wealthiest kid, who has what any kid could ever image, but the thing that Richie desires the most is to have friends. When a greedy CFO plans to steal the Rich's family fortunes, Richie must do whatever he can to save his home, with the help of what he's been searching for. The film plays quite similar to It's a Wonderful Life where Richie Rich (David Gallagher) plays the role  George Bailey, when he wishes that he was never born after being blamed for ruining Christmas, but this don't go well when after using the wishing machine invented by Professor Keenbean, everything has turned upside down where his spoiled cousin Reggie Van Dough has taken over his life, and it is up to Richie to find Professor Keenbean to take him back to the machine and undo the wish.
