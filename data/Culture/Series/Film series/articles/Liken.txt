 The Liken Series is a continuing musical based on events in the Old Testament and New Testament of the Holy Bible, as well as stories from the Book of Mormon. The series is popular among many LDS/Mormon families. They have a Bible Site,  a Scriptures site,  a Studio Site,  and a Beta TV Site  where you can watch select movies and clips. It remains unannounced as to whether they might create musicals based on stories in the Doctrine and Covenants or Pearl of Great Price. According to the Liken website, "If you're concerned about what is going on in today's mainstream media, we think you'll like what you find here at Liken", because "we don't believe "family friendly" means it has to be boring." Further, "you'll find movies and music that will not only entertain your family, but uplift and inspire them as well."  According to LDS Cinema Online, which reviews films from a Mormon perspective, "if you’re looking for spiritually challenging, deeply insightful cinema for adults, Liken is far from your ideal. Neither is any of these films a paragon of cinematic technique, acting, comedic or musical performance, etc. The films have their weaknesses to be sure", but "Whatever the case, the filmmakers have gotten something right. It’s a formula that catches kids’ attention and causes them to remember what they see".  A Herald Extra writer wrote "From the beginning, the “Liken” films have been noted for their energetic, catchy music, which is a major element of “Jonah and the Great Fish."  Their theme song appears in multiple movies. It emphasizes the mood and tone of the scene. Characters are listed by movie release order. A full cast list is not included.
