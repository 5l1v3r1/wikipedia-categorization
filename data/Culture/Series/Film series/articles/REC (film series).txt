REC (stylized as [•REC]) is a Spanish zombie horror film franchise.  The original 2007 film was shot in Barcelona, Spain and the title is an abbreviation of the word "record", as it appears on a video camera. REC was followed by three sequels; REC 2 in 2009, REC 3: Génesis in 2012, and REC 4: Apocalypse in 2014 as the final installment in the franchise.  Spanish company Filmax International is responsible for the production of the REC franchise and released all four installments.   The series lead protagonist, Ángela Vidal, is portrayed by actress Manuela Velasco in all the films except REC 3: Génesis.  Actor Javier Botet portrays Tristana Medeiros, the series main antagonist.  The first film was remade in the United States as the 2008 film Quarantine.  Quarantine 2: Terminal was released in 2011. Although the sequel's plot picks up directly from where Quarantine leaves off, it is not a remake of REC 2. Quarantine 2: Terminal takes the series in a completely different direction with its own rules and mythology different from those of the REC series, making it its own distinguishable franchise.
