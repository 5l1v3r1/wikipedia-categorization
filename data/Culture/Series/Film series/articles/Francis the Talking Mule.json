I told this to the classification interviewer, who dutifully recorded my civilian background on a large card. They say the Army always finds the job to fit the man. I was assigned as assistant on a garbage truck.\n</p><p>\"Circumstances led me, via Officer Candidate School, to Hawaii, where I was assigned as Co-Officer-in-Charge of an Army newspaper called <i>MIDPACIFICAN</i>. One night I was sitting looking at a blank, unpainted wall. To pass the time I wrote four pages of dialogue between a second lieutenant and an Army mule. I had no intention of writing more. But that little runt of a mule kept bothering me. With memories of OCS fresh in my mind I thought I might rid myself of the creature by shipping him off to become a second lieutenant. Francis outwitted me. He refused to go\". \n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Under the <a href=\"/wiki/Nom_de_plume\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nom de plume\">nom de plume</a> of Peter Stirling, Stern wrote several short stories for <i><a href=\"/wiki/Esquire_Magazine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Esquire Magazine\">Esquire</a></i> about a nameless, brand-new U. S. Army 2nd lieutenant fighting the Japanese in the jungles of Burma. Following the war, he connected three of the stories, \"I Meet Francis\", \"Francis and the Golden\", and \"Francis Unmasked\" into the 1946 novel <i>Francis</i>.\n</p><p>In 1948 Stern published a sequel, <i>Francis Goes to Washington</i> with the former lieutenant (now named Peter Sterling) running for Congress with the help of Francis.  Stern gave up fiction writing to become editor of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/New_Orleans_Item\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Orleans Item\">New Orleans Item</a></i>, a newspaper he purchased in 1949<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and ran until 1958.\n</p><p>According to his autobiography, <a href=\"/wiki/Mickey_Rooney\" title=\"Mickey Rooney\">Mickey Rooney</a> was originally considered for a <a href=\"/wiki/United_Artists\" title=\"United Artists\">United Artists</a> <i>Francis</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Feature_film\" title=\"Feature film\">feature film</a> with his company Rooney Inc optioning and then turning down the property <sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> before Universal-International acquired the rights. Rooney took the lead after Donald O'Connor left for the final film in the series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_in_the_Haunted_House\" title=\"Francis in the Haunted House\">Francis in the Haunted House</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Themes\">Themes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Francis_the_Talking_Mule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Themes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The book and film series focused on the exploits of Francis, an experienced <a href=\"/wiki/US_Army\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US Army\">Army</a> mule, and Peter Stirling (played by <a href=\"/wiki/Donald_O%27Connor\" title=\"Donald O&#39;Connor\">Donald O'Connor</a>), the young soldier whom he befriends (and stays with through civilian life and then back into the military). In the original 1950 film the mule identifies himself to the commanding general as \"Francis...123rd Mule Detachment...[serial number] M52519\". With a plot device like the later series <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mister_Ed\" title=\"Mister Ed\">Mister Ed</a></i>, Francis would usually only talk to Peter, thus causing problems for his nominal \"master\". The first six films were directed by Universal comedy veteran <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Lubin\" title=\"Arthur Lubin\">Arthur Lubin</a>, previously known for helming <a href=\"/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello\" title=\"Abbott and Costello\">Abbott and Costello</a> vehicles, who would go on to produce and direct <i>Mister Ed</i> for television.\n</p><p>As the titles indicated, each film had a different setting or gimmick, exposing the world-wise mule and the naive GI to race track excitement, the world of journalism, and many branches of the military, from <a href=\"/wiki/West_Point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"West Point\">West Point</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps\" title=\"Women&#39;s Army Corps\">WACs</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/US_Navy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US Navy\">Navy</a>. The basic plots were fairly similar, however. Stirling, with the sage but <a href=\"/wiki/Sardonic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sardonic\">sardonic</a> advice of Francis (gleaned from overhearing generals plan strategy or from discussions with other equines), would triumph over his own incompetence. However, inevitably, he would be forced to reveal that his adviser was a mule, and be subject to mental analysis (sometimes more than once per film) until the grand reveal, when Francis displayed his talent (usually either to individuals, or to a large group). The astonishing existence of a talking mule, however, was conveniently forgotten by the next film.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Films\">Films</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Francis_the_Talking_Mule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Films\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_(film)\" title=\"Francis (film)\">Francis</a></i> (1950) a.k.a. <i>Francis the Talking Mule</i></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Goes_to_the_Races\" title=\"Francis Goes to the Races\">Francis Goes to the Races</a></i> (1951)</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Goes_to_West_Point\" title=\"Francis Goes to West Point\">Francis Goes to West Point</a></i> (1952)</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Covers_the_Big_Town\" title=\"Francis Covers the Big Town\">Francis Covers the Big Town</a></i> (1953)</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Joins_the_WACS\" title=\"Francis Joins the WACS\">Francis Joins the WACS</a></i> (1954)</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_in_the_Navy\" title=\"Francis in the Navy\">Francis in the Navy</a></i> (1955)</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_in_the_Haunted_House\" title=\"Francis in the Haunted House\">Francis in the Haunted House</a></i> (1956)</li></ul>\n<p><i>Francis Goes to Washington</i>, based on the 1948 novel by Stern, was meant to be the first <i>Francis</i> sequel,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> but filming was postponed as there were \"too many complications\" for it \"to be made as things stand at the present\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Film_series_actors\">Film series actors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Francis_the_Talking_Mule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Film series actors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The distinctive voice of Francis was provided by veteran character actor <a href=\"/wiki/Chill_Wills\" title=\"Chill Wills\">Chill Wills</a>, who lent his deep, rough vocal texture and Western twang to the cynical and sardonic mule. As was customary at the time, Wills never received billing for his vocal work, though he was featured prominently on-screen as blustery General Ben Kaye in the fourth entry, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Joins_the_WACS\" title=\"Francis Joins the WACS\">Francis Joins the WACS</a></i>.  \n</p><p>The actual mule who appeared on-screen was not a male at all, but a female named Molly, selected because she was easy to handle. She was purchased from Jake and Jenny Frazier in <a href=\"/wiki/Drexel,_Missouri\" title=\"Drexel, Missouri\">Drexel, Missouri</a>. According to author Pauline Bartel, Universal paid $350 for the animal, but made millions from the film series. Molly was trained by Les Hilton, a former apprentice of <a href=\"/wiki/Will_Rogers\" title=\"Will Rogers\">Will Rogers</a>, who would also go on to train <a href=\"/wiki/Bamboo_Harvester\" title=\"Bamboo Harvester\">Bamboo Harvester</a>, the horse who played <a href=\"/wiki/Mister_Ed\" title=\"Mister Ed\">Mister Ed</a>. To create the impression that the mule was actually talking, Hilton used a thread fed into the animal's mouth, which when tugged, would cause Molly to try to remove it by moving her lips (the same technique used for <i>Mister Ed</i>).\n</p><p>The seventh and final entry in the series, <i>Francis in the Haunted House,</i> was made without any of the key creative personnel. <a href=\"/wiki/Leonard_Maltin\" title=\"Leonard Maltin\">Leonard Maltin</a>, in most editions of his <i><a href=\"/wiki/Leonard_Maltin%27s_Movie_Guide\" title=\"Leonard Maltin&#39;s Movie Guide\">Movie Guide</a></i>, says O'Connor quit, quoting the actor, \"When you've made six pictures and the mule still gets more fan mail than you do....\" <a href=\"/wiki/Mickey_Rooney\" title=\"Mickey Rooney\">Mickey Rooney</a>, who according to his autobiography was originally considered for a United Artists \"Francis\" movie before Universal bought the rights, replaced O'Connor as a new but similar character, David Prescott. Director Lubin and Chill Wills were also absent, replaced respectively by <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Lamont\" title=\"Charles Lamont\">Charles Lamont</a> and voice actor <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Frees\" title=\"Paul Frees\">Paul Frees</a>, who did a close approximation of Wills' voice. The film did not attempt any real explanation as to why Francis had left Peter Stirling. Francis explains that he decided to befriend reporter Prescott because he once lived on a farm owned by Prescott's uncle and wanted to protect his nephew out of respect for the deceased. With the original elements gone, the film became a standard tale of fake ghosts and gangsters, was poorly received, and is widely viewed as the weakest entry in the series.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Animated_trailer\">Animated trailer</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Francis_the_Talking_Mule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Animated trailer\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some of the Francis films had animated trailers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_appearances\">Later appearances</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Francis_the_Talking_Mule&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Later appearances\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Francis also made a brief cameo, in animated form and voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Marvin_Miller_(actor)\" title=\"Marvin Miller (actor)\">Marvin Miller</a>, in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Productions_of_America\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United Productions of America\">UPA</a> cartoon short <i>How Now Boing Boing</i> (1954), starring <a href=\"/wiki/Gerald_McBoing_Boing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gerald McBoing Boing\">Gerald McBoing Boing</a>.
