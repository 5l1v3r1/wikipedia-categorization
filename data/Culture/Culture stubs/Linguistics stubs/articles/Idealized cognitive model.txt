An Idealized Cognitive Model, or ICM, is the name given in cognitive linguistics to describe the phenomenon in which knowledge represented in a semantic frame is often a conceptualization of experience that is not congruent with reality.   It has been proposed by scholars such as George Lakoff and Gilles Fauconnier.
