Schesis onomaton ("state of nouns", from Ancient Greek σχέσις [skhésis, “state, condition, attitude”] and ὀνομάτων [onomátōn, "of nouns"]), often misspelled scesis onomaton,  was originally a rhetorical technique consisting of a sentence constructed only of nouns and adjectives. It later came to mean such a series of nouns and adjectives or any series of words that were synonymous expressions.  In the second sense it is a rhetorical technique used to emphasize an idea by repeating it rapidly using slightly different words that have the same or a very similar meaning.
