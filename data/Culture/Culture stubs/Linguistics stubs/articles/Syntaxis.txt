Syntaxis is a style in writing or in rhetoric that favors complex syntax, in contrast to the simple sentence structures of parataxis. For example, 19th-century German academic prose, and John Milton's "Paradise Lost" poetry in English are notably syntactic.  Syntaxis may – depending on the author – also contrast with, or include, hypotaxis.
