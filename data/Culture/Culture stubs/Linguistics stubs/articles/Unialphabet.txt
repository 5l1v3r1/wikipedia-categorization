The Unialphabet system of classification for bilingual wordbooks, created by the Spanish lexicographer Delfin Carbonell Basset, blends both languages into one single body of facts rather than employing the traditional two-part method. This way, the user can go straight to the word, not minding whether he or she is in the English or Spanish part, making it easier to check the words or expressions in either language. The parallel lexicographical quality control is assured as the foreign counterpart word or idiom can be easily checked out. This method was first used in A Spanish and English Dictionary of Idioms by Carbonell Basset and then in Dictionary of Proverbs, Sayings, Maxims, Adages, English and Spanish, with a foreword by John Simpson of the University of Oxford.
