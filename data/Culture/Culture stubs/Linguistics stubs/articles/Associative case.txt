 The associative case (abbreviated ASS) is a grammatical case which expresses associativity which is, although related, not identical to comitivity which is expressed by using the comitative case. Associativity is a grammatical category which expresses the meaning "X and the group (of one or more members) associated with X", where X is a nominal, typically of human reference. An example is the Hungarian János-ék meaning "John and associates / John and his group / John and them",  or the Japanese Tanaka-tachi meaning "Tanaka and associates / Tanaka and his group / Tanaka and them".
