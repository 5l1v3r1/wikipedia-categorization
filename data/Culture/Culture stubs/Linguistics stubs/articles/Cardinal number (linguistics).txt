In linguistics, more precisely in traditional grammar, a cardinal number or cardinal numeral (or just cardinal) is a part of speech used to count, such as the English words one, two, three, but also compounds, e.g. three hundred and forty-two (Commonwealth English) or three hundred forty-two (American English). Cardinal numbers are classified as definite numerals and are related to ordinal numbers, such as first, second, third, etc.    Notes
