In grammar, a tense confusion occurs when a writer shifts from the present tense to the past tense (or vice versa).    For example, in the following example, the change from "saw" (past tense) to "is" (present tense) represents a tense confusion: Example: He saw that she is very tall.It is important to avoid tense confusions because they hurt reader comprehension.    They are a common grammatical error,  especially among beginning writers.
