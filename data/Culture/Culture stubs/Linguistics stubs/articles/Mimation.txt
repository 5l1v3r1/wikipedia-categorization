Mimation refers to the suffixed -mÂ  (the letter mem in many Semitic abjads) which occurs in some Semitic languages. This occurs in Akkadian on singular nouns.  It was also present in the Proto-Semitic language. It is retained in the plural and the few remaining dual forms in Modern Hebrew. It corresponds to the letter nun (-n) in Classical Arabic and is retained in the singular (nunation), dual, and plural.
