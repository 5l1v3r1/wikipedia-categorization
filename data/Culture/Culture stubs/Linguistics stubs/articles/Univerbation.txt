In linguistics,   univerbation is the diachronic process of combining a fixed expression of several words into a new single word.   Some English examples include always from all [the] way (the s was added later), onto from on to, albeit from all be it, and colloquial gonna from going to. The process is epitomized in Talmy Giv√≥n's aphorism that "today's morphology is yesterday's syntax".
