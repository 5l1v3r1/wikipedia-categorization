Hypozeuxis is a rhetorical term for an expression or sentence where every clause has its own independent subject and predicate.  If the same words are repeated in each clause, it is also an example of anaphora. The opposite of hypozeuxis is hyperzeuxis, which may also be a form of zeugma or syllepsis.
