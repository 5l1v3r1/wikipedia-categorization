Valleyspeak or Valspeak is an American sociolect, originally of the San Fernando Valley in Southern California. This sociolect became an international fad for a certain period in the 1980s and 1990s, with a peak period from around 1981 to 1985. Many phrases and elements of Valleyspeak, along with surfer slang and skateboarding slang, have become staple elements of the California English dialect lexicon, and in some cases wider American English (such as the widespread use of "like" as a discourse marker). The term "Valley Girl" and the Valley manner of speech was given a wider circulation with the release of a hit 1982 single by Frank Zappa titled "Valley Girl", on which Moon Zappa, Frank's then fourteen-year-old daughter, delivered a monologue in "Valleyspeak" behind the music. This song popularized phrases such as "grody to the max" and "gag me with a spoon". An early appearance of Valleyspeak and the Valley Girl stereotype was through the character of Jennifer DiNuccio, played by Tracy Nelson in the 1982â€“1983 sitcom Square Pegs. According to an interview with Nelson included on the 2008 DVD release of the series, she developed the character's Valleyspeak and personality prior to the Zappa recording becoming popular.  Among the recognizable characters with Valley Girl accents are Hillary Banks (Fresh Prince of Bel Air,) Cher Horowitz of Clueless and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.
