The semblative case is a grammatical case that denotes the similarity of one entity to another.  Wagiman, an indigenous Australian language, has a semblative case suffix -yiga, that is functionally identical to the -like suffix in English, as in the example: English has a number of semblative derivational suffixes, including -like and -esque.  However, as in many other languages, semblativity in English is marked with derivational affixes instead of being an inflectional case.
