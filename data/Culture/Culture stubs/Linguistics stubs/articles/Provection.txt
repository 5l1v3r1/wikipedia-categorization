Provection (from Latin: provectio "advancement") is a linguistic term referring to the carrying over of the final consonant of a word to the following word. Examples in English include newt from earlier an ewte and nickname from earlier an eke name. It is also observed in Celtic languages, both Scottish Gaelic, noted in The Gaelic of Arran by Nils Magnus Holmer  and extensively in Breton grammar.
