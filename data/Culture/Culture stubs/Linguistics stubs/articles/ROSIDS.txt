 ROSIDS Rapid Open Source Intelligence Deployment System, which timeshifts the video then processes speech-to-text through the SAIL LABS Technology automatic speech recognition and then hands the XML result to a machine translation engine. The translated text is then resynchronized with the video and the result is translated close caption in real time. The idea originated after a request of a Navy to deploy these systems on board ships in order to be aware of what is being said on television stations close to the ship's route or at the port of call. It was later used in peace keeping solutions. In 2007 the inventing team from SAIL LABS Technology won the European ICT Prize.
