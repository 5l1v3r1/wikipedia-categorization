Macro-Paesan (also spelled Macro-Paezan) is a proposal linking several small families and language isolates of northwest South America. Kaufman (2007) proposes the structure at the right. Paez–Barbacoan is commonly proposed, though Curnow (1998) showed that it (or at least Paez–Coconucan) is spurious.  Kunza–Kapixana was a more provisional suggestion, and Kunza has since turned out to be an isolate.
