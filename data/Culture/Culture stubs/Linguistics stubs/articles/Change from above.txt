Change from above is linguistic change that enters the language from above the level of consciousness; that is, speakers are generally aware of the linguistic change and implement its use in order to sound more dominant.  It stands in contrast to change from below. In change from above, the change usually enters formal speech, not the vernacular.  This change usually begins with speakers in higher social classes and diffuses down into the lower classes. The upper classes use these new linguistic forms in order to differentiate themselves from the lower classes, while lower classes use these forms in order to sound more formal and similar to the upper class. However, it is important to keep in mind that the concepts of change from above and below refer to consciousness and not social class.  Diffusion is one of the major kinds of change from above. It includes changes of words, sounds, mergers, and reassignment of words to different categories. A person would pick-up on these changes over a lifetime.  Women usually tend to lead in these kinds of variation and in change from above in general. This is also the case for change from below.  William Labov (1927-) is a linguistic professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in language change. He is generally considered to be the father of sociolinguistics.  Change from above is seen in Labov's New York Department Store study exhibiting the social stratification of New York City, where the upper classes reintroduced the word-final pronunciation of /r/ as a prestige form.
