 A Latinism (rarely also known as a Latinity) is a word, idiom, or structure in a language other than Latin that is derived from, or suggestive of, the Latin language.  The process of creating and imposing Latinisms is Latinization (or Latinisation), and historically was frequently applied to proper names as well as words. There are many Latinistic terms in English and other (especially Western) languages. Latinism can also refer to a word borrowed into another language directly from Latin, especially one deemed pretentious; English has many of these, as well.
