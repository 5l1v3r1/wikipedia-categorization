Sentence arrangement refers to the location of ideas and the placement of emphasis within a sentence. Based on these factors, a sentence may be classified as loose, balanced, periodic, or cumulative. A loose sentence expresses the main thought near the beginning and adds explanatory material as needed. A cumulative sentence places the general idea in the main clause and gives it greater precision with modifying words, phrases, or clauses placed before it, after it, or in the middle of it. In this example, the phrases eyes squinting, puffy, and always on alert look forward to the pronoun he in the main clause; the phrases after the word forest look back  to the word week in the main clause.
