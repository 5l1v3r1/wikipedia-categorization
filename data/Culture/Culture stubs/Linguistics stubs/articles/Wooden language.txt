Wooden language is language that uses vague, ambiguous, abstract or pompous words in order to divert attention from the salient issues.   The French scholar Françoise Thom identified four characteristics of wooden language: abstraction and the avoidance of the concrete, tautologies, bad metaphors, and Manichaeism that divides the world into good and evil.  It originally referred to wording imposed by the Soviet Union.    The phrase is a literal translation of the French expression langue de bois. The French phrase became widely used during the 1970s and 1980s, arriving in the language from Russian via Polish.  The fictional language of Newspeak in George Orwell’s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four often mirrors and satirizes wooden language.
