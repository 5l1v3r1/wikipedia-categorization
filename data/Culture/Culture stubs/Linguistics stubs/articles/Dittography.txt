Dittography is the accidental, erroneous act of repeating a letter, word, phrase or combination of letters by a scribe or copyist.  The term is used in the field of textual criticism. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on, is known as haplography.
