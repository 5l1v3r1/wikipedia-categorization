 A sugar baby is a person who is in a specific type of transactional relationship. A person in such a romantic relationship may receive cash, gifts or other benefits in exchange for being in the relationship.  The practice is sometimes called "sugaring". The sugar baby's partner is referred to as the "sugar daddy" or "sugar momma" and is typically wealthier and older than the sugar baby. This expanding  trend has produced the highest number of sugar babies in the United States, followed by Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Colombia.  In America, students  are able to find men or women through online dating services with such names as "Mysugardaddy",  "Sugardaddie", "SeekingArrangement", "SugarDaddyForMe", and "MutualArrangements".      The site SeekingArrangement claims to have over 1.4Â million students among its members, comprising 42 percent of registrants. Almost one million of these are in the United States.  According to the SeekingArrangement website, 36% of what sugar babies using their site receive goes to tuition payments, while 23% is used to pay rent. The rest is spent on books, transportation, clothes, and other items.  The online sites used for introducing people who may negotiate sugar arrangements are technically dating sites. Membership on one site in 2016 was $70 a month for sugar daddies, but free for sugar babies. What happens after the initial date, whether much or nothing, involving sex or not, is between the parties.
