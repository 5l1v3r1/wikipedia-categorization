Mejeriet, or Kulturmejeriet (the dairy), is a cultural venue in Lund, Sweden, which opened in 1987. It originally started as a co-operative dairy in 1896 by the corner of Malmövägen and the Lund-Revinge-Harlösa railroad. The dairy itself closed in 1968. The venue has a full service bar and restaurant, a cinema, a theatre company, 13 rehearsal rooms (where 50 bands rehearse) and two stages that since the inauguration has hosted concerts with legends such as Miles Davis, Bo Diddley, Bad Religion, NOFX,  Ramones, Primal Scream, Sun Ra, George Clinton, Massive Attack, Dead Prez, Miriam Makeba, The Stone Roses, Iggy Pop, Elvis Costello, Oasis, My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr. and Sinéad O'Connor. The venue is run as a non-profit organization and works as an umbrella organization for the other non-profit members which in turn is responsible for the events at the venue. Today, the venue arranges concerts, clubs, cinema viewings, exhibitions and other cultural events. Mejeriet is a member of Trans Europe Halles, a European network of independent cultural centres.
