"Two Solitudes" refers to a perceived lack of communication, and moreover a lack of will for communication between Anglophone and Francophone people in Canada. The term was popularized by Hugh MacLennan's novel Two Solitudes.  In her investiture speech as Governor-General of Canada, MichaÃ«lle Jean specifically stated that "the time of 'two solitudes' had finished".
