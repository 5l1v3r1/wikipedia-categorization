The Christmas Market and Craft Fair is located in Centenary Square, Chamberlain Square, New Street, and Victoria Square.  It is the largest such market outside Germany and Austria,  attracting over 3.1 million visitors in 2010,  over 5 million visitors in 2011,  almost 5 million visitors in 2013  and over 5.5 million visitors in 2014.

The market is affiliated with the Frankfurt Christmas Market in the city of Frankfurt,  one of the oldest such markets in Germany (dating from 1393), hence the name. The market will run from 17 November until 29 December 2016, from 10am to 9pm each day, excluding Christmas Day itself, and will contain in excess of 180 stalls.
