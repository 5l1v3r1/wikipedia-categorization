Body hopping is the fictional ability and desire to possess people in quick succession. A body hopper can transfer quickly from one physical body to another physical body with little or no resistance and few conditions on moving on to a new body, and usually without getting stuck in said body for a long period of time. Although this idea is very unlikely, scientific studies suggest that this process would result in significant trauma.  This fictional occurrence can be seen in some media.  This popular scheme has been portrayed in a multitude of fantasy films and novels.  One of the earliest known examples of body swapping in literature is seen in the 1882 book Vice Versa by Thomas Antsey Guthrie, who wrote under the pseudonym F. Antsey in the 19th century.
