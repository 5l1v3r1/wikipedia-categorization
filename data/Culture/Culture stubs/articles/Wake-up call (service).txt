A wake-up call (alarm call in the United Kingdom) is a service provided by most lodging establishments, similar to an alarm clock via a telephone. In east Asia, it is commonly known as a "morning call." The phrase has been used to describe a sign or warning that alerts one to negative or dangerous behavior or circumstances.
