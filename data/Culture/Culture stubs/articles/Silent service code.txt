The silent service code is a way for a diner to "talk" to servers during a meal without saying a word, mainly to tell them that the diner is finished.  This will prevent any embarrassing situations where the server would take a meal prematurely. To tell a server you have finished place your napkin to the left of your plate, and place all your utensils together in a "4-o'clock" position on your plate. Utensils crossed on a plate signify that a diner is still eating. If you must leave during the meal, you should place the napkin on your chair to avoid any confusion. The code is almost always taught during business dining etiquette classes.
