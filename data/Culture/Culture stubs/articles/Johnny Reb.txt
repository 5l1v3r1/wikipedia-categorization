Johnny Reb or Johnny Rebel is the national personification of the Southern states of the United States, or less generally, the Confederacy during the American Civil War.  Patriots used Johnny Reb and his Union counterpart Billy Yank to symbolize the common soldiers in the American Civil War of the 1860s. Johnny Reb is usually pictured in gray wool uniform with the typical kepi-style forage cap made of wool broadcloth with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor. He is often shown with his weapons and with the Confederate flag.
