Cheli, according to the Royal Spanish Academy, is the jargon with elements of certain traditional working class districts of Madrid, Spain, such as Lavapi√©s and Atocha in the southern part of the old city (close to cockney culture of London's East End), together with marginal and counter-cultural elements.  Cheli, mainly a juvenile jargon, especially strong in the early 1980s, is linked to the movement called movida in Madrid. It is still used by some people and despite its limited semantic fields, related to marginality, parties, drugs, nightlife and friendship, several words have been accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy, due to its wide expansion.
