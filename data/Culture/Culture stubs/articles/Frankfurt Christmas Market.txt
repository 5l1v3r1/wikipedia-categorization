The Frankfurt Christmas Market (in German: Frankfurter Weinachtmarkt ) is an annual outdoor Christmas market in central Frankfurt, Hessen, Germany.  The Christmas market opens in late November and continues until just before Christmas (normally 22 December) during Advent. It occupies a large area in central Frankfurt, including Friedrich-Stoltze-Platz, Hauptwache (to the north), Mainkai, Paulsplatz, and RÃ¶merberg (to the south).  The market is one of the oldest such "Christkindchesmarkets" in Germany.  Its origins date back to 1393.  There are a number of affiliated markets, including in Birmingham, England.
