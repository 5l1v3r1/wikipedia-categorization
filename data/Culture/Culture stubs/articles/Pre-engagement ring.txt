A pre-engagement ring, also known as a friendship ring or promise ring, is a ring given as a gift to a romantic partner to signify a commitment to a monogamous relationship, often as a precursor to an engagement ring.   They can be worn on any finger, but those symbolizing pre-engagement rings are generally worn on the left ring finger. Sometimes, the left middle finger or right ring finger is used instead to avoid giving an impression that it is an actual engagement ring.
