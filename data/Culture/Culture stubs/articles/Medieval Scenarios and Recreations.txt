Medieval Scenarios and Recreations, Inc.,  known simply as MSR, is an educational non-profit Living History organization dedicated to the education, understanding and appreciation of the Middle Ages. The structure for this activity revolves around the Kingdom of Acre (pronounced AC-R).  MSR places special emphasis on the fairs and festivals they produce for the public. They create these events with the intention of recreating an experience for guests similar to that found by attendees of an actual medieval fair. Visitors enjoy a series of performances and demonstrations, can visit period merchants and artists, and are given a full palette of activities to enjoy. Archery, children's games, puppet shows, painting and activity booths are one type of activity, along with martial demonstrations of live steel medieval swordplay, combat "of peace" with wooden swords, and fencing demonstrations. MSR's fairs have traditionally feature their horse show, with barded heavy war horses and fully armored jousters breaking lances (but not each other.)  They also create smaller, more frequent events for members and their guests which recreate the experience of attending a medieval feast or other activity.  MSR's Kingdom of Acre seeks to replicate nearly all aspects of medieval life... the lords and ladies, citizens and subjects of Acre enjoy period music, song and dance, historic research costume design, calligraphy, archery, medieval games, cooking, brewing and other varied medieval arts and crafts. Members are afforded the opportunity to seek their "roots" through heraldic research and those who have no roots in the crusader period can always make them up.
