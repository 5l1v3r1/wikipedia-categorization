Crying The Neck is a harvest festival tradition once common in counties of Devon and Cornwall in the United Kingdom. The tradition has declined following the invention of machines such as the combine harvester. There are no known practices in Devon but in Cornwall the tradition was revived in the early twentieth century by the Old Cornwall Society. In The Story of Cornwall, by Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin, the following explanation is given on the practice: The rest would then shout,  and the reply would be:  Everyone then joined in shouting: (calling the farmer by name.)" In a harvest scene in the third episode of the second series of the 2015 of Poldark, Francis Poldark performs the tradition at Trenwith, his estate. In a harvest scene in the third episode of supernatural drama The Living and the Dead, Charlotte Appleby performs the tradition at her husband's family's farm, which she manages.  https://web.archive.org/web/20120315040347/http://picturepenzance.co.uk/photos/showimage.php?i=24287&c=680
