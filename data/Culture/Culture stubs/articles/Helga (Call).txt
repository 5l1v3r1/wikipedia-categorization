Calling „Helga!“ is a running gag at German concerts and festivals. A person may call for a Helga,  others answer and come to a chorus like group effect.  „Helga ist tot!“ (Helga is dead) denies the helgaing request.  Further allegations se gravestones, memorials or graffiti. The background is unknown, some reports point to a rather rainy Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, where a high pressure cyclone called Helga was called for but didn't arrive in time. The call was namegiver for an annual prize for German festivals.  and is being  used by a service company.
