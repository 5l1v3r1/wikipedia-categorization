Make me a sandwich is a catchphrase used in popular culture, often on the internet, to mock or discredit women.  It is a play on the stereotype that women belong in the kitchen.     For example, during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination for United States President, it was noted in the news that a Facebook group had been created titled "Hillary Clinton: Stop Running for President and Make Me a Sandwich."      The phrase, as used in an intended humorous sexist context, dates to at least 1995.
