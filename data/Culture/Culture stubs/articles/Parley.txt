Parley is a discussion or conference, especially one between enemies over terms of a truce or other matters. The  word is derived from French parler, "to speak". During the 18th and 19th centuries, attacking an enemy during a parley was considered one of the grossest breaches of the rules of war.  The British Army was accused of multiple parley violations during the American Revolutionary War, specifically arresting Continental Army officers engaged in negotiations as traitors in addition to hanging uniformed despatch riders as spies.  Some examples where a parley is a significant element of the plot are described below: In Game Of Thrones Mance Raider asks if Lord Snow has come to parley when he leaves castle black and goes beyond the wall in an attempt to assassinate Mance, the King beyond the wall, before Stanisâ€™ army ride west from east watch and defeat the wildling army.
