Leaving the nest or moving out refers to the notion of a young person moving out of the accommodation provided by their guardian, fosterers or parent.  Such a move can be motivated by various factors, including a desire for independence, the discovery of a more viable location and/or practicality.  The age at which young people move out of their previous accommodation has been rising since the turn of the 21st century.  Some cultures view leaving the nest as one of the key milestones in the transition from tweenhood or teenhood to becoming an adult besides obtaining employment and getting wedded.  In some cultures, especially Middle Eastern ones, it is not as socially acceptable for a woman or girl to leave the home to live by herself without a marriage arrangement.  Some researchers have suggested that a delay in leaving the nest may result in a decrease in sexual activity.
