A self-clasping handshake is a gesture in which one hand is grasped by the other and held together in front of the body or over the head.  In the United States, this gesture is a sign of victory, being made by the winning boxer at the end of a fight.   Russian leaders of the Soviet Union, such as Khrushchev, used the gesture to symbolise friendship when visiting the United States, and so risked misunderstanding.
