Outhouse tipping is a prank consisting of overturning an outhouse or a portable toilet, usually onto the door.  It allegedly used to be performed as revenge for not being given a treat at Halloween.  Legendary versions of elaborate outhouse pranks have been preserved in the histories of various schools, towns, and communities.    The prank itself is the topic of other jokes.  For example, in 1992, during the annual North Kansas City Snake Parade, a course in "Outhouse Tipping 101" was given in an open-air classroom.
