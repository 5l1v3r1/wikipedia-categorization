A steambath is a steam-filled room for the purpose of relaxation and cleansing. It has a long history, going back to Greek and Roman times. The origins of the steam bath come from the Roman bath, which began during the height of the Roman Empire. Ancient Roman baths served many community and social functions within Roman society. Many citizens in Rome used Roman public baths, regardless of socioeconomic status. These Roman baths were supplied by natural hot springs from beneath the ground.  Historical parts of a spa â€“ Roman, medieval, Georgian and Victorian have been restored in Bath, England and is available as a public bath or Thermae.  Today, natural steam baths still exist, and often still use similar systems that the Romans used, which contain pipes and pumps that bring water up and into the large pool areas, wherever the natural springs exist. Heaters are also now used to maintain warm temperatures in the baths. There are many different types of steam baths, which are different from saunas. (Both are hot, but the steam in a sauna is created by throwing water on a stove.)  Turkish baths, steam rooms and steam showers are types of steambath.
