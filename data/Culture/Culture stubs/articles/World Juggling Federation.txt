The World Juggling Federation (WJF) is the world's only organization devoted to the promotion and advancement of juggling as a sport (competitive juggling).  In 2003, the WJF was created by long-time International Jugglers' Association member, Jason Garfield.  Garfield attracted interest and membership by framing the skills of juggling as a sport.   The federation became more widely known in 2005 when Jason bought airtime on ESPN, televising his WJF II juggling competition. The WJF's most well-known event is the WJF convention, which has been broadcast on ESPN2. The organization  encourages jugglers to compete against each other in order to get better. In WJF-sponsored events, the participants use juggling props, which include: WJF competition events sometimes include (pending enough competitors attending): There are "junior"-, "beginner"-, "intermediate"- and "advanced"-level competitors in each of the three main WJF  disciplines. Annual WJF conventions are held; and juggling competitions produce annual winners who are named "overall champions". At WJF 5, the top competition event ran alongside the Battle for the WJF Presidency, with Thomas Dietz as the inaugural winner, beating Jason Garfield. However, Dietz resigned from presidency soon after, saying he didn't have time to fulfill his duties as president. At WJF 7 in 2011, Doug Sayers was initially named overall champion, but due to a miscount of the scores this was proved not to be the case, as Vova had scored more points overall.
