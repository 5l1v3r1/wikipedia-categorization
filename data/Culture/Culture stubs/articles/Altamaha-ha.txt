In Georgia folklore, the Altamaha-ha (or Altie) is a legendary creature, alleged to inhabit the myriad small streams and abandoned rice fields near the mouth of the Altamaha River (after which it is named) in southeastern Georgia, United States.  Sightings are particularly reported around Darien and elsewhere in McIntosh County.  According to The Brunswick News, the legend has its roots in Muscogee tradition.  An alligator gar has been proposed as being a possible identity for recent sightings attributed to the creature.
