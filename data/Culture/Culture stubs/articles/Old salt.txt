An "old salt" is an old sailor who is often a raconteur, or teller of sea stories. Much of the history and traditions of mariners are passed from generation to generation by these sea stories as told and retold by old salts. Sea stories may be truthful, half-truths, or falsehoods. However, they always enhance the reputations of sailors. In the United States Navy, the "Old Salt" is a title passed to the longest-serving Surface Warfare Officer on active duty.  The award, currently held by Admiral Kurt W. Tidd, Commander, U.S. Southern Command, honors the officer with the earliest standing SWO qualification.
