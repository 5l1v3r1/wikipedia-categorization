Good old days is a clich√© in popular culture. It is used to reference a time considered by the speaker to be better than the current era. It is a form of nostalgia which can reflect homesickness or yearning for long-gone moments.  In 1726, John Henley used this phrase in his book The Primitive Liturgy "to all honest Admirers of the good old Days of their best and wisest Fore-fathers, this first Part of the Primitive Liturgy Is most humbly dedicated".  In 1727, Daniel Defoe wrote in The Complete English Tradesman "In the good old days of Trade, which our Fore-fathers plodded on in."  In this part of his book, Defoe talks about how in 'the good old days' tradesman had were better off then in Defoe's time.
