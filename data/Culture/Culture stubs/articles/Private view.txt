A private view is a special viewing of an art exhibition by invitation only, normal at the start of a public exhibition.  Typically wine and light refreshments are served on the form of a reception. If the artworks are by a living artist, it is normal for them to attend the private view. An opening of an art exhibition which is open to the public is known as a vernissage.
