A blue rinse is a dilute hair dye used to reduce the yellowed appearance of grey or white hair, typically associated with older women.   In a manner similar to laundry bluing, the blue rinse can make yellow-white hair appear blue-white.  The blue rinse gained popularity after Jean Harlow's appearance in the 1930 film, Hell's Angels.   Queen Elizabeth also contributed to the popularity of the blue rinse in the 1940s.
