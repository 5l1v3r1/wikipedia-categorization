Bashu culture (巴蜀文化), sometimes also named Sichuanese culture, refers to the culture of the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Chongqing, and the surrounding areas - which often include the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, since the Han Chinese groups in these two provinces also primarily speak Southwestern Mandarin nowadays. It has a long history of over 3000 years, widely regarded as one of the cradles of modern Chinese civilization.
