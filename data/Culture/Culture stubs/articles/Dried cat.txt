It is the custom in some European cultures to place the dried or desiccated body of a cat inside the walls of a newly built home to ward off evil spirits or as a good luck charm. It was believed that the cats had a sixth sense and would have psychic abilities in the afterlife to find the spirits. Putting the cat in the wall was seen as a blood sacrifice to ward off the evil spirits . Although some accounts claim the cats were walled in alive, examination of recovered specimens indicates post-mortem concealment in most cases. In the British Isles,   as well as in northern Europe and North America,  the dried or mummified bodies of cats are frequently found concealed within structures and are believed to have been placed there to bring good luck or to protect the building and its occupants from harm. In some cases, the animals are found deliberately posed as if in the midst of attack.  In other cases, they are accompanied by dried rats, mice, or birds. Cats in ancient Egypt were valued very highly and were seen to be very close to the gods. They believed the cats were an embodiment of the goddess Bastet.   Harming a cat in ancient Egypt was an offense punishable by death. When a cat died the Egyptians would mummify and bury their cats as an offering to the gods. [unreliable source?]
