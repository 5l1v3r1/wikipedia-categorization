Vote brigading is massively coordinated online voting. It refers to the practice of affecting reviews or scores on websites that feature crowdvoting, such as online stores or review websites, by calling on large numbers of people to submit (often false) reviews, thus boosting or decreasing ratings artificially. This may be done for political reasons, for example to harm the commercial prospects and credibility of films dealing with controversial or sensitive subjects.   Vote brigading is a form of participation bias, which can decrease the reliability of the aggregated score. The first known use of "brigade" or brigading in reference to orchestrated negative voting online was a post by blogger Konstantine Thoukydides from the German web forum Toy Town, about a massively downvoted thread by a "downvote brigade".
