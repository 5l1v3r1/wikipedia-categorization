Sipapu is a Hopi word for a small hole or indentation in the floor of a kiva or pithouse . Kivas were used by the Ancestral Puebloans and continue to be used by modern-day Puebloans. The sipapu symbolizes the portal through which their ancient ancestors first emerged to enter the present world.  Moreover, The Hopi Sacred Stories explain that this is the hole in which the first peoples of this world entered.  As "They" stepped outside of the "Sipapu", they changed from lizard-like beings into homo sapiens, or human form (See Waters, 1963, and later reprints; Courlander, 1971).

The Hopi and other Pueblo Culture people (Zuni, Acoma) believe that they are born of the Grand Canyon which is where the original Sipapu is located.

Each kiva is subterranean and contains a small hole, just off center, to represent their place of emergence for religious purpose.
