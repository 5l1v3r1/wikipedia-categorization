Come Home Year is a Canadian civic event for many towns that encourages a return to home town.  Due to significant economic migration away from many of the small rural towns these events draw many generations to celebrate. In 2000, there was a provincial "Come Home Year" in Newfoundland and Labrador where many people came back to visit their various communities. In 2005, Saskatchewan had a "Come Home Year" as part of the province's centennial celebration. In 2017, McIvers, Newfoundland hosted a Come Home event that temporarily tripled the town's population.
