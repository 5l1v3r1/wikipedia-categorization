A shrug is a gesture performed by raising both shoulders, and is a representation of an individual either being indifferent about something or not knowing an answer to a question.  A shrug is an emblem, meaning that it integrates the vocabulary of only certain cultures and may be used in place of words.  It can also be used when simply ignoring a question. It may be accentuated with raised eyebrows, a turned-down mouth, an exaggerated frown, and raised palms. It is very common in Western cultureâ€”rather than saying "I don't know", one may simply perform a shrug. In the English-speaking world it may be accompanied by a three-syllable grunt or hummed mumble mimicking the intonation of "I dunno" (low-high-low).  Shoulder shrugs are among the symptomatic tics of Tourette syndrome.  The shrug gesture is a Unicode emoji included as U+1F937 ðŸ¤· SHRUG.
