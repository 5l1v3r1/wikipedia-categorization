Faithbooking, or spiritual scrapbooking is a creative expression of a family's spiritual journey, values and events that are captured in scrapbooks, diaries or journals that combine the use of photographs, decorated papers, scripture, thoughts, prayers, blessings, stories and embellishments such as buttons, ribbon and other creative art media.  The goal of faithbooking is to creatively preserve and tell a story about how a family grows spiritually.  Many religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam have adopted the concept of faithbooking.
