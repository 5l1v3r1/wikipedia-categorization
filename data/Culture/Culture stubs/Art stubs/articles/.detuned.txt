.detuned is a demoscene project by the German demogroup .theprodukkt (also known as Farbrausch), released on the PlayStation 3. It was initially released on September 20, 2009 in Japan, and on October 15 in Europe and North America. It is the second demo released on the PlayStation 3 after Linger in Shadows. .detuned features a man sitting in a chair surrounded by a psychedelic environment. The player can switch into various modes, and using the trigger buttons and right analogue stick, apply certain effects on the man, which e.g. make his head shrink or apply a post-processing filter on the visuals and music. The player is also able to load their own music in. IGN cited the lack of lasting appeal as the biggest problem about .detuned, saying that "selling for $2.99 in the US PlayStation Store, that's about a dollar per minute of entertainment". Overall they awarded the game a 4/10, with a 1/10 on Lasting Appeal.
