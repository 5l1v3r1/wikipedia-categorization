American Art is a peer-reviewed scholarly journal dedicated to exploring all aspects of the American visual art from colonial to contemporary times. It seeks to promote sound scholarship and thought-provoking interpretation on topics in the fine arts, popular culture, public art, film, electronic multimedia, decorative arts, and handicraft. Through a broad interdisciplinary approach, the journal provides readers with a richer understanding not only of specific artists and objects, but also of the cultural factors that have shaped American visual culture over three centuries. American Art embraces all methods of investigation to explore the nation's rich and diverse artistic legacy. It is published by the University of Chicago Press and was known until 1991 as Smithsonian Studies in American Art.
