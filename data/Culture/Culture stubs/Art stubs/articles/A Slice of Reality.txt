A Slice of Reality is a work of modern art by Richard Wilson sitting by (and commissioned for) the Millennium Dome on the north-western bank of the Greenwich Peninsula. It consists of a 9-metre (30 ft)  sliced vertical section through the former 800-ton  60-metre (200 ft) sand dredger Arco Trent and exposes portions of the former living quarters of the vessel to the elements (such as a visible pool table in the lower decks).   These photographs were taken during Open House London 2015. View from bow View from starboard The weather deck The bridge The poop deck Accommodation deck
