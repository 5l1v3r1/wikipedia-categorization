Suprematist Composition (blue rectangle over the red beam) is a painting by Kazimir Malevich, a Russian painter known as a pioneer of geometric abstraction. The painting represents a constellation of geometry and color in space with remarkable austerity. The painting was created in 1916 and stayed with the artist until June 1927. Malevich exhibited his work in the Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung in Berlin, but was soon to leave for the Soviet Union. The painting soon went to German architect Hugo HÃ¤ring, who then sold it to the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. It stayed there for the next 50 years.  It was shown at various expositions, mostly in Europe.  After an extended legal battle over the painting's ownership, which endured for 17 years, the painting was returned to heirs of the artist. A few months later, in November 2008, the artist's heirs sold it at a Sotheby's auction for $60 million to the Nahmad family  . In 2018 it was sold at a Christie's auction for $85.8 million with fees to art dealer Brett Gorvy  . It is the most expensive work in the history of Russian art  .
