The chinstrap beard is a type of facial hair that extends from the hair line of one side of the face to the other, following the jawline, much like the chin curtain; unlike the chin curtain though, it does not cover the entire chin, but only the very edges of the jaw and chin. It was fashionable from the late 18th century through the mid-19th century in Europe, and later in Russia and Japan. It was worn by Hudson Taylor, an English missionary to China, and also by Paul Kruger, the president of the 19th-century Transvaal Republic (in what is now South Africa). It is also worn today, but in an alternative version by athletes such as Obada Obaisi, Dwyane Wade, Elvis Andrus, Raymond Felton, Matt Hardy and David Ortiz among others.
