The wedding dress worn by Princess Anne for her marriage to Mark Phillips on 14 November 1973, at Westminster Abbey was designed by Maureen Baker, the chief designer for the ready-to-wear label Susan Small; she had previously designed outfits for the princess.  The dress was an embroidered "Tudor-style" wedding dress with a high collar and "mediaeval sleeves".  The train was embroidered by Lock's Embroiderers.  Anne was said to have designed many aspects of the dress herself.  Compared to previous royal wedding dresses, it was described as "simplistic" and was noted as being close to contemporary 1970s wedding fashions.
