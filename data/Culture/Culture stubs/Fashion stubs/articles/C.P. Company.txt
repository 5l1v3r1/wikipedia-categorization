C.P. Company is an Italian apparel brand founded in 1975 by designer Massimo Osti.  Initially called Chester Perry, its name was changed in 1978 following a lawsuit.  It became known for its functional, military-inspired outerwear and the use of innovative fabrics, processing techniques and design. Its most iconic piece, the "Mille Miglia jacket" (also known as "Goggle jacket", 1988), features two clear lenses on the hood — the "goggle" — and one on the wrist, for the wristwatch.   In 1984 Osti sold his company shares to GFT (Gruppo Finanziario Tessile), but stayed on as the brand's stylist until 1994.  In 1993 the brand was acquired by Carlo Rivetti's Sportswear Company. In 2010 it was sold to Enzo Fusco's FGF Industry S.P.A.  In 2015 the company's intellectual property was bought by Hong Kong apparel group Tristate Holdings Limited (SEHK: 458).
