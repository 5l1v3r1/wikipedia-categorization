Dip dye (also known as "tip dyeing") is a hair coloring style that involves dipping the ends of the hair into dye. The dye used can be either a naturally colored dye or a bright colored dye, the latter being the more popular choice.  The method has become increasingly popular as a result of social media and its usage by celebrities.   Dip dye originates from the process of tie dyeing clothing (especially T-shirts).   Dip-dyeing and the ombr√© hairstyle are similar. However, dip dyeing usually involves brighter neon colors and a less smooth gradient in color  than an ombre style, which is typically a more blended and natural coloration.  Another similar hair coloring technique that is confusing is balayage because it is so similar to ombre, but looks like "growing-out" highlights.
