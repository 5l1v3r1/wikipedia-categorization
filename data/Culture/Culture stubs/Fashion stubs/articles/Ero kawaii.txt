Ero kawaii (エロ可愛い, literally "erotic cute"), or erokawa, is a Japanese subculture that draws on Western notions of sexiness, in contrast to the popular cuteness (kawaii) trend. The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ero (shortened from the English word "erotic", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter kawaii, meaning "cute".   Ero kawaii started with singer Kumi Koda using the term to describe her own style.
