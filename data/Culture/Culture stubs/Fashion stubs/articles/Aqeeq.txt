Akik or aqiq (Arabic: العقيق‎) means quartz, however usually refers to the chalcedony variant of quartz. Well-known types of chalcedony are carnelian, agate, and onyx. It is considered a semi-precious gem stone, and rings set with carnelian have special significance in the Islamic religion. It must be ground into shape and polished to a shine. The finished gem is then mounted on a ring according to the stones finished size. Both men and women wear it as jewellery. An aqiq ring also has religious importance in Islam as it is considered sunnah to wear one. The prophet Muhammad wore a carnelian / aqiq ring set with silver on his right hand as a commemoration of the removal of idols from the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 630 CE. To this day many Muslims do the same, including both Shia and Sunni clergy.
