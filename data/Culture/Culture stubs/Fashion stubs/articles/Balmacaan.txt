A balmacaan is a "loose, full overcoat with raglan sleeves, originally made of rough woolen cloth."  It is named after an estate near Inverness, Scotland,  and is a single-breasted coat, often a raincoat.  To decrease risk of water penetrating the coat, the number of seams is reduced by bringing the sleeve to the collar rather than to the shoulder as usual.  A balmacaan has  raglan sleeves and a Prussian collar, and is usually made of tweed or gabardine.
