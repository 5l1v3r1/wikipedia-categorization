A French twist is a common "updo" hair styling technique. It is created by gathering the hair in one hand and twisting the hair upwards until it turns in on itself against the head. It is then secured with barrettes, combs, hair sticks and/or hairpins. It was popular in the late 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. French twists are usually worn to proms and weddings. Hair clips are also commonly used with French twists.
