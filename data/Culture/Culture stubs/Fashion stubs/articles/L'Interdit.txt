Audrey Hepburn L'Interdit (pronounced [lɛ̃.tɛʁ.di]) was a perfume created in 1957 by Hubert de Givenchy.  The word interdit is French for "forbidden." The nose/parfumeur behind this feminine aldehydic-floral fragrance was Francis Fabron (1913 - 2005).  It has a delicate, floral, powdery aroma. It contains notes of rose, jasmine, violet and, at the heart, a blend of woods and grasses.   Givenchy created the perfume for Audrey Hepburn, who wore it for a year before its release to the public.  Hepburn also became the first actress to become the face of a perfume, for L'Interdit.
