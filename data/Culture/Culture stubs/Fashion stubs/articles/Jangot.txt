A Jangot (장옷) is a type of clothing worn by women of the Joseon Dynasty period as a veil to cover their faces.  Jangot is similar to durumagi, or the outer jacket of a hanbok.  The difference is a jangot has a collar (git) and a ribbon for tying (goreum).  According to the principles of the Joseon Dynasty's Confucianism, women were ordered not to show their face to foreign men, so they would cover their faces in many ways while going out.
