A boat neck, also called a bateau neck or Sabrina neckline, is a wide neckline that runs horizontally, front and back, almost to the shoulder points, across the collarbone.  It is traditionally used in nautically inspired sweaters and knitwear, but is also featured in more elegant cocktail dresses and eveningwear.  The style derives from sailors' blouses or sweaters, often with wide navy and white horizontal stripes.  The wide, plain neck was said to facilitate quick removal if a sailor were to fall overboard.  The Boat Neck was first designed by Coco Chanel. She received inspiration from the wide necks worn by French sailors
