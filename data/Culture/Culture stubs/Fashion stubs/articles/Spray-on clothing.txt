Spray-on clothing is a form of clothing, that is applied by spraying polymer over the body in such a manner that it appears as clothing. It is a polymer mix that dries relatively quickly.    On September 15, 2010, Ian Sample, The Guardian's Science correspondent reported on a press conference where Dr Manuel Torres showed a spray-on clothing product named Fabrican.   Covering the same announcement Prita Ganapati, writing for Wired magazine referred to the result as "spray-on fabric".   The Guardian referred to both "spray-on bandages" and "spray-on fabric".  Scientific American referred to both "spray-on clothing" and "spray-on clothes".  Torres described the fabric as similar to felt. In a 2010 article published in the Daily Mail Laura Stott described being allowed to wear a prototype spray-on shirt, and being pleasantly surprised that it did not tear, or rip, when she hung her large handbag from her shoulder.   She said she was able to take off the shirt as easily as any t-shirt, and that it retained its shape on subsequent wearings.
