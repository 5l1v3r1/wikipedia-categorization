Kuboraum (German:  "cubic room")  is a brand of Italian-made sunglasses and optical glasses that was founded in Berlin in 2012 by Italians Livio Graziottin, a designer, and Sergio Eusebi, an anthropologist.  The brand refers to its eyewear as "masks".   Graziottin was previously head designer at Belstaff.   Antonio Pincin, an engineer, joined the business due his experience in eyewear production.  Kuboraum designs were first presented in February 2012 during Milan Fashion Week at Mido, an eyewear tradeshow.  The brand held a store in store at Isetan in Tokyo.
