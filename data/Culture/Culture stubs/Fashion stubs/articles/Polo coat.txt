A polo coat also known as a camel coat is a piece of men's outerwear originally worn by polo players in England. It is available from Polo Ralph Lauren but was not invented by Mr Lauren.  The polo coat was originally a wrap coat with a belt, but eventually adopted a double-breasted with buttons configuration.  Camelhair was the fabric at first, but later camelhair and wool blends became standard due to its higher durability.  The terms polo coat and camel coat are thus synonymous.
