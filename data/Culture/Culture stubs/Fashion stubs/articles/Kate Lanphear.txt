Kate Lanphear is head of Google's Fashion Week search project.  Women's Wear Daily described the project as focused on New York Fashion Week and offering "searchable highlights provided by designers and shopping directly from the runway."  Previously she was style director at Elle,  then The New York Timesâ€™s T magazine.  In September 2014, she became editor-in-chief of Maxim, hired in 2014 to lead a redesign of the faltering magazine (in 2007 ownership of the magazine sold for $250 million; in 2014 it sold again for only $2 million.)  Her redesign hewed more closely to the style of men's magazines like Esquire and GQ that attracted older, more affluent readers; under her tenure, the magazine moved away from "photo spreads of scantily clad women" and featured a man (Idris Elba) on the cover for the first time.  Advertising pages grew significantly, but newsstand sales of the magazine fell,  and Lanphear left the magazine in November 2015.
