Maria Grazia Chiuri (Italian pronunciation: [maˈriːa ˈgrattsja ˈkjuːri]; born February 1964) is an Italian fashion designer.   Chiuri was born in 1964 in Rome, Italy. From 1999 to 2016, Chiuri worked for Valentino, her then best teammate was Pierpaolo Piccioli.  She has studied in IED, Istituto Europeo di Design in Rome. In July 2016, Chiuri was announced as the creative director at Dior.    "She will be the first woman to lead the creative side in the label’s 69-year history,  and the role will be her first solo appointment after more than two decades of working with Pierpaolo Piccioli,  who has been named creative director at Valentino."   Chiuri took the spot left over when Raf Simons left the position in October.  "As artistic director of the storied Paris fashion house, Ms Chiuri will follow in the footsteps of designers like Yves Saint Laurent, Gianfranco Ferre and John Galliano."  She put on her premiere fashion show for Christian Dior SE during September for the Fashion Week spring and summer line in 2016.  Featured in the show was a T-shirt bearing the title of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's essay We Should All Be Feminists.   The collection also caused a lot of controversy as it was later revealed that many pieces were in fact exact replicas of traditional Romanian folk costumes. The refusal of Dior and of Chiuri led to an online campaign under the hashtag #give credit.
