 iD Dunedin Fashion Week is an annual festival of fashion held in the New Zealand city of Dunedin, usually in March or April. The festival has been held regularly since its inception in 2000. The 2015 show included 35 events, and attracted over 8000 people from around New Zealand and overseas.  Fashion Week includes a series of events around Dunedin and its Otago environs, such as tours, talks, and exhibitions, and features two major award shows. The first of these is the iD International Emerging Designer Awards, held in conjunction with Otago Polytechnic, which is a one-night show held at Dunedin Town Hall. Entry is restricted to recent graduates or current final-year students in fashion related courses, and regularly attracts new designers from around the world.  The week culminates in the second major show, the iD Dunedin Fashion Show. This two-night show takes place at Dunedin Railway Station, and the main platform is turned into one of the world's longest catwalks, a little over 110 metres (360Â ft) in length. The show is restricted to current commercial designers, and includes international guest designer selections - including major names,   although its primary focus is on local competitive entries.
