Marques'Almeida is a British fashion label which debuted in 2011.  The label was founded by Portuguese designers Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, who met while they were both students at Central Saint Martins in London.  They are known for their creative use of denim, and Style.com credited the label with helping launch the revival of distressed denim in the 2010s.  However the brand's focus is actually on high-end women's wear,  and, even though they initially gained prominence for their use of denim, they didn't include jeans in their collection until several years later.  In 2015, the label won the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, the largest cash prize for a new brand in fashion.
