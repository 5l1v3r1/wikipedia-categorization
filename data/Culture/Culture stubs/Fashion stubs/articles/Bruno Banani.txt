Bruno Banani is a German fashion company with headquarters in Chemnitz.  On 11 March 2009, Bruno Banani launched a product range using the eco-friendly fiber Biophyl from Advansa with class 1 Oeko-tex standard rating.  The marketing rights for the perfumes with the brand name Bruno Banani are held by the Wella company, Cosmopolitan cosmetics. Prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics, German media took an interest in a Tongan luger training in Germany, who was apparently also called Bruno Banani. In January 2012, it was revealed that his real name was Fuahea Semi, and that his renaming had been a marketing ploy.   In 2013, Semi officially changed his name to Bruno Banani, and competed under that name.
