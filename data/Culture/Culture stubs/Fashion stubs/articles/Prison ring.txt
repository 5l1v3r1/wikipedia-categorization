A prison ring is a type of plastic jewelry fashioned by hand in prisons, by working scrap plastic material, commonly celluloid items such as a toothbrush or a pen.  Celluloid was historically a popular material since it could be heat bonded and glues were often less available.  A common feature of prison rings were small photos mounted on the bezel.
