The British Fashion Council (BFC) is a non-profit trade group for British fashion designers founded in 1983. Its main goal is to promote British fashion design in both the UK and internationally. Organising the twice-yearly London Fashion Week is one of the primary activities. Based in London, it was formerly chaired by Natalie Massenet and its current chief executive is Caroline Rush.   Previous chairs of the BFC have included Edward Rayne, Nicholas Coleridge CBE,  Harold Tillman and Sir Stuart Rose.
