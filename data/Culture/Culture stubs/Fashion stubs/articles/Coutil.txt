Coutil (or Coutille) is woven cloth created specifically for making corsets.  It is woven tightly to inhibit penetration of the corset's bones and resist stretching. Coutil has a high cotton content.  Cotton has good dimensional stability, or a resistance to stretching, which makes it a good choice for such a stressed garment. Coutil may be made to be plain (similar to 100% cotton facing), satin, or brocade.  It is common for coutil to have a herringbone texture, or a similar woven texture.
