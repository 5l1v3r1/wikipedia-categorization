Snickers Workwear is a Swedish company which designs, manufactures and distributes workwear for professional tradesmen and service people. Snickers was started in the early 1970s by Matti Viio, a Swedish electrician who felt there were shortcomings with traditional workwear. The name Snickers comes from the Swedish word snickare which means carpenter in English. Snickers products are available in 15 countries through approximately 5,000 dealers. Because of trademark issues in the United States, Snickers operates there under the brand, Skillers Workwear.
