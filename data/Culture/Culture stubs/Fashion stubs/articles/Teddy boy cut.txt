Teddy Boy is a style of haircut. It was popular with mods in England during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Typically the hair was cut relatively long in comparison to regular styles of that period. It was typically brushed back and heavy grease used. The style has come back into popularity recently within the rockabilly and psychobilly sub-cultures. Definition
