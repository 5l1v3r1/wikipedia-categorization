A covert coat was originally "a short topcoat worn for hunting,"  but is now sold as a gentleman's overcoat. It originated in the late 19th century to be worn when riding a horse.   Covert cloth, from which the coat is made, is a heavy tweed named after a covered area rich in game wildlife that would serve as a starting point on a hunt.  A covert coat is always single-breasted with notch lapels, a centre vent, flap pockets, and a signature four (sometimes five) lines of stitching at the cuffs and hem; a ticket pocket is optional. The collar may be constructed of covert cloth or velvet.  The traditional colour varies from a light greenish-tan brown to a fawnish mix to a rather deep tannish-green, but variants in grey and navy are also common.  Variants were worn by George VI and Edward VIII, as well as by Jason Statham and Stephen Graham in the 2000 crime comedy film Snatch.  The covert coat caused media attention during the 2015 General Election in UK when worn by UKIP party leader Nigel Farage
