Byredo is a modern Swedish luxury house, founded in Stockholm in 2006 by Ben Gorham.   Its products are made in Sweden.  Byredo is a portmanteau of  "By Redolence".   The brand is expanding into leather goods and accessories,   and the first collection of handbags and small leather goods debuted at Paris Fashion Week in September 2017.  Byredo is available in Russia, France, Hong Kong, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and on Byredo.com.  Ben Gorham began to be intrigued by scent and memory after travelling to his mother's hometown in India, where he was stirred by the aromas of spices and incense. Inspired by this trip, Byredo's scented candles and perfumes have been developed with an understated approach, using simple compositions of the highest quality raw materials.  In 2013 Gorham  sold a majority stake of the company to London-based investment firm Manzanita Capital,   which also has invested in Diptyque and Malin + Goetz,  and owns Space NK.  Perfumer Jérôme Epinette has created scents for the brand.  Byredo collaborated with photographers Inez and Vinoodh on its 1996 Inez & Vinoodh fragrance.   Byredo is collaborating with Ikea on a home fragrance expected to launch in 2019.   Forbes magazine named Byredo Super Cedar among the best scents launched in 2016.
