A bandage dress is a tight-fitting "bodycon" dress that is (or appears to be) made from multiple thin strips of cloth sewn together, with the individual strips shaped like bandages. The bandage dress was made popular by the designer Hervé Léger.   The material in a bandage dress is heavier and provides some contouring, a bodycon dress does not provide this shaping element
