A clothing swap is a type of swapmeet wherein participants exchange their valued but no longer used clothing for clothing they will use. Clothing swaps are considered not only a good way to refill one's wardrobe, but also are considered an act of environmentalism.  It is also used to get rid of and obtain specialist clothing. Cloth swap can be specialized - they can cater for example for clothes swaps only for high end brands.  The notion of swapping is not a new concept; however, many groups and organizations exist that hold clothing swaps, in a variety of sizes, to raise money and clothes for charitable donations.  Clothes swaps originated in San Francisco California with events hosted by Suzanne Agasi in the late nineties.  Online clothes swapping has also become popular, with websites offering an environmentally friendly and frugal alternative to shopping or second-hand shops.
