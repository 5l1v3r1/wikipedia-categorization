Charo Ronquillo (born April 22, 1990 in Cabuyao City, Laguna, Philippines) is a Filipino fashion model.  She was described by Bill Ford as, "that unique look from the Philippines".  Ronquillo was discovered playing basketball at an arcade at a mall in the Philippines. Before entering high school she ticked off, “short hair, ugly teeth, tomboyish and always picking a fight,” as her main traits. Only when she started paying attention to her looks did modeling become an interest.  At 17 years old, Ronquillo joined and won the Ford Supermodel of the World Philippines 2005 Search. She went on to represent the Philippines at the Supermodel World Finals 2006 in New York City  and placed 3rd with a $100,000 contract with Ford Models.  Since her win, Ronquillo appeared on the catwalks of New York Fashion Week, modeling for labels and designers including Lacoste, Lela Rose, Nanette Lapore, Zero Maria Cornejo, Tory Burch, Antonio Berardi, Kenneth Cole, Mac Cosmetics Barbie Collection, Zaldy for L.A.M.B. by Gwen Stefani, BCBG, Sisley and Benetton New York fashion Week F/W 2009-2010 for Elie Tahari and Paris Fashion Week Haute Couture FW 2011-2012 for Julien Fournié and Eric Tibusch.
