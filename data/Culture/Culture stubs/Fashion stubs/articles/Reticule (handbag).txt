A reticule, also known as a ridicule or indispensable, was a type of small handbag, similar to a modern evening bag, used mainly from 1795 to 1820.  According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the name "reticule" came from the French r√©ticule, which in turn came from the Latin reticulum, a diminutive of rete, or "net".  The reticule became popular with the advent of Regency fashions in the late 18th century. Previously, women had carried personal belongings in pockets tied around the waist, but the columnar skirts and thin fabrics that had come into style made pockets essentially unusable.   When the reticule first appeared, it was made of netting. As time went by, they were made from all kinds of fabrics, including velvet, silk, and satin.  A reticule usually had a drawstring closure at the top and was carried over the arm on a cord or chain. Reticules were made in a variety of styles and shapes and sometimes trimmed with embroidery or beading. Women often made their own reticules.
