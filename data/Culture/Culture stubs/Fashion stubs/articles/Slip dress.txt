A slip dress is a woman's dress that closely resembles an underslip or petticoat.  It is traditionally cut on the bias, with spaghetti straps.  Slip dresses first became widely worn in the last decade of the 20th century, as part of the underwear-as-outerwear trend, when they were made from layered chiffon, polyester satins and charmeuse, and often trimmed with lace.  The slip dress looked like an undergarment, but was intended to be seen, and through the use of lace and sheer elements, offer glimpses of the body beneath.   Designers associated with slip dresses include John Galliano, whose debut design for Dior was a lace-trimmed slip dress worn by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1996;  Calvin Klein and Narciso Rodriguez.
