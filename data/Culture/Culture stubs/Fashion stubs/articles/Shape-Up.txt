A Shape-Up, also called a Line-Up or a Edge-up, is a hairstyle that involves cutting along the natural hairline to make it straight. The haircut grew in popularity during the 1980s, typically with those who have Afro-textured hair. Edge-ups are typically found among men. The barber uses T-shaped clippers ("outliners"), or a sharp razor blade to line up the customer's hair line, circling the entire head to include behind the ears, the back of the head, and sideburns.
