Crochet braids, also known as latch hook braids,  are techniques for braiding hair that involve crocheting synthetic hair extensions to a person's natural hair with a latch hook or crochet hook. This method is associated with African American hair culture. While crochet braids are a hybrid of traditional braids, they're considered to be more similar to weaves.  The natural hair can be twisted or braided, but is most commonly styled into cornrows before affixing the synthetic hair. Using a latch hook or crochet hook, the synthetic hair (in the form of loose bulk) is then attached. Parts of the hair extensions are grabbed by the hook and pulled through the underside of each cornrow, working from the front of the hair to the back at a 90 degree angle.  Crochet braids are known as a protective style and assist with hair growth.
