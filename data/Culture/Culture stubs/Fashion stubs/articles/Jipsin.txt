Jipsin are Korean traditional sandals made of straw. Koreans have worn straw sandals since ancient times. They are categorized as yi (이, 履), shoes with a short height, and the specific name can vary according to the materials used, as with samsin, wanggolsin, cheongol jisin, and budeulsin.  In the Joseon period, jipsin were worn mostly by commoners, working farmers, and scholars while on outings. Today's Jipsin style is inherited from the Joseon period.
