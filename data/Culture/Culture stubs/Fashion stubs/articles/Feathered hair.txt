Feathered hair was a hairstyle popular in the 1970s and the early 1980s with men and women. It was designed for straight hair. The hair was layered, with either a side or a center parting. The hair would be brushed back at the sides, giving an appearance similar to the feathers of a bird.    The haircut gained phenomenal popularity in the early 1970s.  Many celebrities wore this style at some time or another including Farrah Fawcett, Princess Diana, John Travolta, and Rob Lowe.
