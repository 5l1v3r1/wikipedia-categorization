A Kariba suit is a two-piece suit for men designed in Jamaica in the early 1970s to be worn on business and formal occasions as a Caribbean replacement for the European style suit and popularised by Michael Manley, the leader of the People's National Party.  After the party came to power in 1972, Parliament passed a law affirming the correctness of the outfit for official functions and Manley, by now Prime Minister, wore a fancy black one when he met Queen Elizabeth II.  The style of the jacket is a formalised version of a safari jacket common in Africa, worn without a shirt and tie, making it more comfortable clothing for a tropical climate.
