A hair tattoo, or scalp micropigmentation,  is a cosmetic tattoo that gives the illusion of a close buzz cut hairstyle on a bald head.   The procedure can also be used to conceal the scars from hair transplantation or to make thinning hair seem thicker.  In contrast to other tattoos, the procedure does not penetrate as deeply, and the inks used are less prone to colour change over time.
