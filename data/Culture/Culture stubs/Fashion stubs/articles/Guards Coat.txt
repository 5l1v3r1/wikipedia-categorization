A Guards Coat or Guard's Coat (sometimes Guard's coat) is a men's topcoat which has a half belt in the back,  and is based on the coat that used to be worn by English Officers of the Guard.  It can be buttoned with three buttons or just two.  A Guards Coat is similar to a Paletot.  The Guards Coat has peaked lapels and welt pockets   and comes mostly in formal colours such as a deep navy or midnight blue, and is more formal than the Ulster coat.
