  Duchamp is a British men's clothing and accessories company founded in 1989. The company was founded in 1989 by Mitchell Jacobs,  a former buyer at Browns.  The company was named after the French artist Marcel Duchamp with the following claim by JacobsÂ : "Duchamp turned everyday objects into art and I turned everyday icons of men's fashion into wearable art".  Duchamp initially specialised in cufflinks  and branched in 1992 into ties, with characteristic bold colours and "futuristic" designs.    Jacobs established a wholesale trade and opened in 1998 a small boutique in Notting Hill   In 2006, when the founder sold the company to its management and the private-equity fund Kcaj LLP,  Marc Psarolis became part-owner and chief executive.   The same year, the company opened a 750-square-foot store on Regent Street and introduced a line of shirts.  In 2011, the company claimed to sell "more than 60,000 ties a year [...] as well as cufflinks, suits, jackets, socks and shirts".
