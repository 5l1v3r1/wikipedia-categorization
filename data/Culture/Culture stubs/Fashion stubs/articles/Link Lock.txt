A Link Lock is a type of mechanical connection used in the jewellery industry. It was invented by Christopher James Curwood in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The locking mechanism on the joiner consists of a notch that can be pushed into a small barrel.  A flap is then able to push down into the notch, inside the barrel, locking the link, hence the name Link Lock. Link Locks are made in various metals to match the base pieces they are affixed to. The first ever size was named Number 5 and measured 5.5 mm (0.22 in) when closed.  The small link weighs 0.1 grams (0.0035 oz) and lifts 50000 times its own weight. The Link Lock’s introduction in Australia and New Zealand accelerated charm sales in the retail jewellery industry.  Link Lock became a leading findings seller in Australia and New Zealand by 2003. Link Lock is patented and Christopher James Curwood’s manufacturing company, McCallum Gold, holds patents world-wide.
