Not of This World (NOTW) is a Christian based apparel company that caters to younger Christians. NOTW was founded in 2001 by Aurelio F. Barreto III, founder and former CEO of Dogloo Inc. In 2015, the company was purchased by Mardel Christian Bookstore  and moved its headquarters to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The phrase "not of this world" comes from The Gospel of John. According to John, before Jesus was arrested, he prayed for his disciples, saying, "I have given [my disciples] your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth." (John 17:14-17)
