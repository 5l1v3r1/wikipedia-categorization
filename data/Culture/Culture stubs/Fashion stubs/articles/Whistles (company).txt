Whistles is a clothing brand with 46 stores across the UK. It was founded in 1976 by Lucille and Richard Lewin. In January 2008, Jane Shepherdson, former Topshop director, signed a deal to purchase a 20 per cent stake in Whistles and was appointed the job of chief executive.  In March 2016, Whistles and its 46 shops was bought by the South African retailer, Foschini Group.  In the past, the style of Whistles was described as having "a pretty but decidedly yummy mummy-ish air".  Since Shepherdson's appointment as chief executive, the clothes were said to have cleaner silhouettes with a more sophisticated palette; "baby pinks and lilacs have made way for olives, camel, china blue, tea rose and yes, plenty of black â€“ and the detailing has a quirky vintage feel rather than being fussy."
