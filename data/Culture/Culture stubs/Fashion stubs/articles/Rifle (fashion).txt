Rifle is an Italian clothing company founded in 1958 in Prato. They were most famous for their jeans during the 1980s, especially in the USSR, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the rest of Eastern Europe. In several of these countries (e.g. Czechoslovakia or Poland) the term "rifle" became synonymous with the word jeans, and is still as a slang prevalent today, with most people in those countries calling any jeans simply rifle (mostly phonetically: ri-fle). They were also very popular in Switzerland, UK, Israel and Holland between 1975 and 1990. There are upscale lines of Rifle Jeans, called Super Rifle, Golden Rifle and Royal Rifle.
