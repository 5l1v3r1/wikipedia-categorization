Kit and Ace is a Canadian apparel brand founded in 2014 by Shannon Wilson, former lead designer of Lululemon Athletica, and her stepson J. J. Wilson.  The company is best known for producing machine-washable technical cashmere wool clothing and accessories.    Hold It All Inc., a Vancouver-based holding company,  owns the brand.  The brand has retail stores in Canada, and formerly had retail stores in the US, the UK, and Australia.  In September 2015, the company installed shop-in-shop cafes from Toronto-based  Sorry Coffee Co in  its London and Toronto stores.   In April 2017 Kit and Ace closed all its international stores, focusing on e-commerce and its 9 Canadian shops.  Kit and Ace has never accepted cash as payment,  allowing stores to be more efficient.
