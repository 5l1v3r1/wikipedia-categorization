Stone Island is an Italian high-end men's apparel brand from Ravarino. It is part of  Carlo Rivetti's "Sportswear Company" (SPW). Stone Island is known by its compass patch that buttons onto the upper sleeve of the left arm.  Originally the patches were green edged, badges from around the year 2000 onwards became black edged. There are also a run of rarer 'white badges' which were originally made on certain jackets to celebrate the new millennium. The white badge is now apparent on jackets that use materials that Stone Island develops themselves in-house. Novel jacket designs include the "Liquid Reflective" jacket, that uses thousands of small shards of glass that reflect light. Massimo Osti (b. 1944; â€  2005) started his first label C.P. Company in 1974.  Stone Island was set as a secondary line or diffusion collection of his main  label.   The brand specialized in surface treatment of fabrics and dyeing techniques. GFT bought the company in 1983, Osti left in 1994, it is now run by Carlo Rivetti. In mid 2017, Stone Island sold Singaporean Sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings a 30% stake in its business for a yet to be disclosed sum.  From the mid 1990s the make has been popular among football fan 'casual (subculture)' in England and throughout the rest of Europe.  The brand can also be seen in many football hooliganism based films, such as Green Street Hooligans and The Football Factory. Canadian rapper Drake (musician) is also regularly seen wearing Stone Island and has created it as a culture in the rap industry.
