  The Fashion and Textile Museum is a contemporary fashion museum in Bermondsey, London. Founded by British designer Zandra Rhodes in 2003, the museum is part of the Newham College of Further Education â€“ one of Europe's largest further education colleges. Recent exhibitions at the museum have included; Liberty in Fashion,  Art Textiles,  1920s Jazz Age Fashion & Photographs  and Missoni Art Colour.  Rather than running a permanent exhibition, the Fashion and Textile Museum offers an ongoing programme of temporary displays, including current exhibition, "Orla Kiely: A Life in Pattern",  which runs until September 2018. The museum is housed in a converted warehouse which was redesigned by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta in collaboration with Rhodes.   It was Legorreta's first and only building in Europe.   In addition to the exhibition space, the building contains a textile studio and printing workshop and private residential quarters.  The building has become a tourist attraction in its own right due to its colour scheme of hot pink, burnt orange, yellow, and bright blue.
