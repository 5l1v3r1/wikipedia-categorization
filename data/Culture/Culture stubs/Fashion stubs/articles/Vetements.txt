 Vetements (from vêtements [vɛtmɑ͂], French for "clothing") is a French clothing and footwear "design collective"  and brand founded by fashion designer Demna Gvasalia  in 2014 and designed by a  collective including his brother Guram and five other friends who have previous experience at  Maison Margiela, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga, Céline, and Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Arts.  Championing a more 'pragmatic' approach to fashion, Demna reflects the 'down to earth nature' that he says is reflected in what today's youth wear. Operating from a philosophical and methodological approach to his designs, Demna propelled Vetements to world class status in just three short seasons.   Vogue has stated: "Part of the genius of Demna Gvasalia’s Vetements is its appropriation and refinement of mass culture into tongue-in-cheek garments."  Luxury vendors who stock the collection include SSENSE, Net-A-Porter, Browns Fashion, and Matchesfashion.
