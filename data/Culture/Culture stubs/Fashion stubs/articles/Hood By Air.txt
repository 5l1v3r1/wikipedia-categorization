Hood By Air was a high fashion streetwear brand first launched in 2006, on hiatus in 2009-2012, and active through 2017.  The designer was Shayne Oliver—a former student at Fashion Institute of Technology and New York University who described his design aesthetic as "ghetto gothic" and banjee—    who was named among The 25 Greatest Black Fashion Designers by Complex.  Its influences include 1990s-era Tommy Hilfiger, Polo Sport and DKNY.  The brand collaborated with A$AP Rocky, Kanye West and Rihanna,  and won awards from LVMH and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.  It was chosen for a guest spot at menswear trade show Pitti Uomo in 2015.   Its  runway pieces were sold at high-end boutiques like Opening Ceremony, Colette in Paris and Harvey Nichols in London.  On April 6, 2017, Hood By Air announced that Oliver would be leaving the brand to take a new role at Helmut Lang.
