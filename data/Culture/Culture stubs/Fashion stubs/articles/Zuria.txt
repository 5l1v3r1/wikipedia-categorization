A zuria is a hooded dress worn by the Tigrinya women in Eritrea and Ethiopia.  Traditional zurias go to the ankles, with a gauze hood around the head and shoulders. Today[when?] a zuria comes in different forms and designs with an extra sheen due to the demands of fashion. Zurias are worn during holidays, weddings, or parties.
