A scrunchie (or scrunchy) is a fabric covered elastic hair tie used to fasten long hair.  Large, elaborate styles and diminutive, unassuming forms are available in many different colors, fabrics, and designs.  Although scrunchies are most commonly used in hair, they can also be worn around the wrist or ankle as an accessory to enhance an outfit.  Aurora patented the Sc√ºnci in 1986, which may be the origin of the style; in 1989 she sold them under the trademark "Rommi".  Scrunchies were particularly popular in the 1980s and 1990s, including larger, more elaborate versions.  Debbie Gibson in particular wore them; Madonna wore a large velvet scrunchie in Desperately Seeking Susan.   An episode of Sex and the City mocked the fashion.
