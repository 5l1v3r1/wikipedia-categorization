 Miami Fashion Week is an annual fashion week held in Miami, Florida, United States. Miami Fashion Week, not to be confused with the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Miami, takes place every year during the spring and is held in the Wynwood Arts District. Miami Fashion Week was started in 1998 and is the world's largest fashion week for Latin American and the Caribbean fashion designers. The influence of Miami Fashion Week reaches beyond the expected swimwear. As the longest running fashion week in the region, Miami Fashion Week turns out a staggering amount of designs in the evening wear, menswear and intimate wear departments, focusing on Resort Wear due to the city's close proximity to the ocean and it being a travel destination to many international visitors.  In May 2015 the company was acquired by The Fashion Shows and began an aggressive and innovative strategic relaunching plan for the event with the goal to revolutionize the fashion industry in the city of Miami. The brand then welcomed Antonio Banderas as its Honorary President in order to heighten the event in the top international fashion circuit.
