The À Gogo movement (also spelled àu gogo, a gogo, a go-go, or à go•go) started in postwar France and quickly spread throughout western Europe, most notably in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Italy. The name derives from the French term à gogo (in abundance, galore). It is considered a continuation of café society, who were also wealthy socialites and prominent members of the arts and sciences. Participants were often referred to as the go crowd, the in crowd and later as the jet set. These are terms created and applied by the media to identify people of certain mindset and do not refer to any formal organization. To put the movement in context, it should be considered an aspect of social behavior existing under the overarching movement of post World War II modernism. This article refers to the European à gogo movement, and should not be confused with the American gogo music that followed, borrowing certain elements from it years later.
