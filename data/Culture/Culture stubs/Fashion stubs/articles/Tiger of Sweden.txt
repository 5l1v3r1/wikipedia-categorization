Tiger of Sweden was founded 1903 in the Swedish town Uddevalla, by the tailors Markus Schwartzman and Hjalmar Nordstr√∂m. It is a classical menswear brand. Tiger of Sweden began during the 1990s to develop suits attractive to the young and trendy inner-city crowd. Its line of products include clothes, shoes and spectacles. Tiger of Sweden is sold across Europe, South Africa and in Canada.  The Silver Label is the more fashion forward or directional product and is quite limited in distribution.  The Black Label is styled for a slimmer fashion conscious male. Tiger of Sweden has three main brands: Men, Women & Jeans Collection. The company was sold to the Danish clothing company IC Group in 2003.
