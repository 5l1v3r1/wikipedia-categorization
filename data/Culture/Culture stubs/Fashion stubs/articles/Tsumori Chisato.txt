Tsumori Chisato is a Japanese fashion designer.   Tsumori Chisato was born in the Japanese city of Saitama, Japan. Chisato attended Tokyo's Bunka Fashion College. She began work with Issey Miyake in 1977 under the "Issey Sports" line, which was later renamed "I.S. Chisato Tsumori Designs." With the support of Issey Miyake, she started her own line in 1990.  She took her work to Paris in 2003, at the same time beginning her menswear line. Throughout her career she has built a loyal following in the United States.  Her aesthetic focuses on prints and has a "healthy dose of manga/bohemian cuteness".  Tsumori Chisato has a large following simply for her wonderful prints. Most are painted by hand and draw inspiration from Japanese culture and manga, contemporary art, felines and various other sources.  While most prints are hand painted, some prints are watercolor, drawn by pencil, or digital renderings. Although she lives in Paris, she pulls inspiration from her colorful life in Japan.    Along with her penchant for prints, her signature style was quickly associated with her innovative and luxurious textiles, intricate beading, embroidery, appliqués along with the prints of her own design. She seeks to create joyful, expressive garments.   Chisato always admired French culture, and fashion. She decided on Paris for her first free-standing shop outside of Asia in 1999. The boutique was designed by Christian Biecher and is located on rue Barbette in the Marais neighborhood. The flagship boutique showcases Chisato’s love for the arts through various collaborations with photographers, visual artists and set designers whose work is featured in-store and in the windows.  Currently, the Tsumori Chisato brand has over 40 sales points along with Asian freestanding stores. The brand continues to expand steadily throughout the United States, Italy, Russia and Scandinavia.
