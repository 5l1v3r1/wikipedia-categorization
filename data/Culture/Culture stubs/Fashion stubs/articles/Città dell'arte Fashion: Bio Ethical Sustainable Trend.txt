Città dell'arte Fashion: Bio Ethical Sustainable Trend is an initiative of the Fondazione Pistoletto (Pistoletto Foundation) to promote sustainability in the fashion industry. It was unveiled by Vogue Italia editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani and the artist Michelangelo Pistoletto at a press conference at Pistoletto's studio in Biella on September 22, 2009.  From September 23, 2009 through February 2010, the participants are committed to providing a new model for sustainable practices in fashion.  The purpose of Città dell'arte Fashion: Bio Ethical Sustainable Trend is to encourage and find ways for the fashion industry to exemplify a new model of socially responsible, ethical, and sustainable fashion.  Michelangelo Pistoletto invited eleven Italian designers to create one look from sustainable Italian textiles.
