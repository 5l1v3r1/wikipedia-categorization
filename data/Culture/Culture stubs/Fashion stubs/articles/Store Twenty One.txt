Store Twenty One is a discount clothing and homeware retailer in the United Kingdom. Store Twenty One was created by Grabal Alok, the Indian owned textile manufacturer that bought parts of the QS Stores (formerly Quality Seconds) and Bewise chains that went into administration in 2006. Quality Seconds was founded in 1932 as a clothing supplier and opened stores in the 1960s to sell factory seconds to the public. From the 1980s QS stopped selling seconds but remained a discount clothing store.  In 2015 the business had 125 stores nationwide, selling a selection of fashion and homeware at discounted prices. Its head office was based in Solihull, West Midlands.  In July 2016, it was reported that Store Twenty One was facing financial difficulties and that some stores were closing down, as it faced going into administration in August if no agreement in reducing rents was agreed. In July 2016, it was proposed and agreed that company voluntary arrangement action be taken.  In May 2017, it was reported that Store Twenty One was on the brink of going into administration for the second time, due to poor trading conditions and the bank had withdrawn extra funding. A total of 77 stores were scheduled to be closed over the coming months.   It entered compulsory liquidation on 11 July 2017.  By October 2017, the business began trading again as it was bought out by another company, who have purchased their liquidated stock, and taken on at least thirty seven shops at present.
