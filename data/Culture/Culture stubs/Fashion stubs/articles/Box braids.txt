Box braids are hair braids which are characterized by "boxy" or square-shaped hair divisions.   They can also be created by adding in synthetic braiding hair (i.e. kanekalon hair). This hairstyle is a means of protective styling which are styles that protect hair follicles from damage and promotes hair growth. Box Braids rose to popularity after Janet Jackson's portrayal of Justice in John Singleton's 1993 film Poetic Justice.
