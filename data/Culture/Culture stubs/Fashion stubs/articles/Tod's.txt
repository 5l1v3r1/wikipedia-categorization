Tod's S.p.A., also known as Tod's Group, is an Italian company which produces luxury shoes and other leather goods. It is presided over by businessman Diego Della Valle. Filippo Della Valle started the shoemaking business out of a basement in the late 1920s. Diego Della Valle, the elder son of Dorino Della Valle and a grandson of Filippo Della Valle, expanded the workshop and turned it into a factory that started manufacturing shoes for American department stores in the 1970s. Diego brought in innovative marketing strategies in the early 1980s, kept the handmade manufacturing process and went on to create brands of lifestyle named Tod's, Hogan and Fay. Roger Vivier, maker of high luxury shoes, was acquired in the mid-1990s and developed starting in 2000.  In 2003, Italian designer Bruno Frisoni was hired as Roger Vivier's Creative Director. The Della Valle family, which owns the luxury maker, also has stakes in RCS MediaGroup, the football team Fiorentina and other companies. All members of the family were born in the middle Italian region of Marche, and many of them continue to reside there. Tod's has numerous stores around the world, including large flagship stores in Europe, the U.S., China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Australia. In November 2015, Tod’s acquired further stock in the Roger Vivier shoe brand for €415 million. It had previously owned a 57.5% stake, now up to 60.7%.
