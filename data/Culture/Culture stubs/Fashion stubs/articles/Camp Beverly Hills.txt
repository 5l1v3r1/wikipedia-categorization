Camp Beverly Hills is an American US-based clothing line founded by Jeffrey A. Stein  It hit a pop-culture phenomenon that began in the 1980s, the Camp Beverly Hills vintage clothing line is making comeback with a full re-launch of the brand.  Beverly Hills' glitzy name has helped Camp Beverly Hills turn its fashion products into money-making ventures.  It began in 1977, as an inexpensive alternative to the stores of Rodeo Drive.  During the next decade, the line became popular after introducing some of the first casual clothing to use pastel colors. Recently, due to the recent wave of 1980s nostalgia, the company has been relaunched.
