The tellum or reverse mullet (also referred to as a frullet ) is a hairstyle similar to the mullet.  "Tellum" is "mullet" spelled backwards.  While a mullet is short in the front and long in the back, the opposite is true for a tellum. The hair is longer in the front (usually straight cheek-chin length hair), and is short/buzzed in the back. The back is often spiky as well. It is not uncommon that the back layers of hair are dyed a different color than the front, or that there are drastically different colored streaks (highlights/lowlights) running through the front of the hair. In the late 1970s first interpretation of tellum was the devilock made famous by The Misfits. The Misfits style has the lock is centered on the eyes and gelled in place.  In the late 1980s this style of hair was very popular among emo subculture, which later was transformed to "emo hairstyle". What's why the tellum is often associated with "emo style" and is often, but not always, worn by those who could be stereotypically called “emo”.  In the early 1990s Edward Furlong's hairstyle in Terminator 2: Judgment Day gave a new wave of tellum's popularity among teens.  In 2007 when Kate Gosselin entered the spotlight, she and her half tellum - half bob hairstyle quickly became a fan favorite of the popular reality series, Jon and Kate Plus 8. “The Kate,” as it was aptly named, was one of the most talked about hairstyles of 2009. Although the media (and Kate Gosselin) tried to convince the public that the hairstyle was in high demand, many people just weren’t feeling "The Kate".
