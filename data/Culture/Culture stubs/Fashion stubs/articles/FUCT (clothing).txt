FUCT is a clothing brand founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by American artist and designer Erik Brunetti and partner at the time, professional skateboarder Natas Kaupas. FUCT has been referred to as one of the pioneering brands of modern streetwear, often incorporating various elements and icons of pop culture alongside anti-government and anti-religious campaigns into their designs. FUCT, along with Stussy, Keith Haringâ€™s Pop Shop, and Japan's Hysteric Glamour were among the first brands to popularize such concepts. Along with clothing manufactured for various markets, FUCT also produces a higher-end FUCT SSDD line of clothing exclusively for the Japanese market.
