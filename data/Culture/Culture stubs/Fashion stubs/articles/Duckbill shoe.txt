A duckbill, bearpaw or cow's mouth was a style of shoe with a broad toe which was fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries.  This style started with Charles VIII of France, who had an extra toe and was later worn by Henry VIII of England.  It replaced the excessively long toe of the poulaine but also tended to become impractical as it became enlarged with stuffing and horns and so could be a foot wide, giving the wearer a waddling gait.  It might also be adorned with slashes to show the fine lining and sumptuary laws were introduced to restrict all these excesses.
