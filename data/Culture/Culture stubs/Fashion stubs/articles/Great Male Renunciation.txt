The Great Male Renunciation is the historical phenomenon at the end of the 18th century in which men stopped using brilliant or refined forms in their dress, which were left to women's clothing.  Coined by psychoanalyst John Fl√ºgel in 1930, it is considered a major turning point in the history of clothing in which the men relinquish their claim to adornment and beauty.  The Great Renunciation encouraged the establishment of the suit's monopoly on male dress codes at the beginning of the 19th century.
