23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag (Ukrainian: День Державного Прапора України Day of the National Flag of Ukraine) in Ukraine; beginning in 2004.   24 July was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev.  The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, one-and-a-half years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag of the Ukrainian state (early 1992).  Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on 24 August.
