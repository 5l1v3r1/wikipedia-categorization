KP is a Ukrainian newspaper published six times a week  in Kiev, the nation's capital. It is a Russian language newspaper with some regional editions in the Ukrainian language.  In March 2009 the paper was awarded a "Newspaper of the Year 2008" award.  In order to apply with Ukrainian decommunization laws the newspaper changed its name from Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine (Russian: Комсомольская правда в Украине; Ukrainian: Комсомольська правда в Україні) to KP in January 2016.  But the newspaper stressed it was never a "mouthpiece" of (the youth wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) Komsomol.
