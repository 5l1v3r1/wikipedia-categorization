Hopak-Kolom (Ukrainian: Гопак-Koлoм) is a popular folk dance from Ukraine. It is similar to the Hopak, although performed in a circle. Although not as popular today as earlier in the 20th century, it is still performed by amateurs, professional Ukrainian dance ensembles as well as other performers of folk dances.
