  "Be My Valentine! (Anti-Crisis Girl)" (originally titled just Be My Valentine) is a song by Ukrainian singer Svetlana Loboda and was the Ukrainian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, held in Moscow, Russia. The song also has a Russian version, titled Парень, Ты НиЧё! (Paren, Ti NiCHo). The song competed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009 for Ukraine, where it  performed 17th in the running order, following Albania's Kejsi Tola and "Carry Me in Your Dreams" and preceding Estonia's Urban Symphony and "Rändajad". It qualified for the final, where it finished 12th with 70 points.  Svetlana has stated that she would be using a "Hell Machine", a machine that rotates and descends to the stage in Moscow.  The music video that was released in late March was not an original creation, but rather a combination of three of Loboda's past videos, namely "Mishka", "Postoy Muschina", and "Ne Macho", and thus Loboda is often seen not singing along to the song's lyrics.
