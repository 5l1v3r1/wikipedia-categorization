The Hutsulka (Ukrainian: Гyцyлкa) is a popular Ukrainian  folk dance from southwestern Ukraine. It is performed by amateurs, professional Ukrainian dance ensembles as well as other performers of folk dances. The Hutsulka or Verkhovynka are musical relatives of the Kolomiyka, with a difference. They usually include a slow lyrical introduction in 68 or 34 time, followed by a typical Kolomiyka.
