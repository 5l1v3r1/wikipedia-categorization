Constitution Day (Ukrainian: День Конституції) is an Ukrainian public holiday celebrated on 28 June since 1996.   It commemorates the anniversary of the approval by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) of the Constitution of Ukraine on 28 June 1996.   Before the Revolution of Dignity, 2014  , many Ukrainians did not use to see it as a holiday. According to surveys about 10% believed it should not be a day off, but a working day (there were 12% in 2008; this number had shrunk from 14% in 2003).  Currently this is a significant event both in Western and Eastern Ukraine   and is celebrated among the most respected holidays in Ukraine.  Soviet Constitution day (7 October) was never observed in the Ukrainian SSR (the predecessor of modern Ukraine).
