Naye tsayt ('New Times') was a Yiddish-language newspaper published from Kiev between September 1917 and May 1919. Naye tsayt was an organ of the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party (fareynikte).  Prior to the launching of Naye tsayt, the party published Der yidisher proletarier from Kiev.  In 1919, the newspaper was merged into Komunistishe fon.
