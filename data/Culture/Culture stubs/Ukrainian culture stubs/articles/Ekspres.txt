Ekspres (Ukrainian: Експрес) is a Ukrainian language Lviv-based, daily broadsheet newspaper founded in 1992.   It claims to be the biggest newspaper in Ukraine in Ukrainian in terms of circulation.  Its popularity is based in Western Ukraine.  According to Ekspres employees and IFEX, Ekspres has been subjected to intimidation by the Judicial system of Ukraine and the Ukrainian police over recent years.   In February 2012 the International Press Institute "condemned alleged attempts by local officials to gag Ekspres".  The Ministry of Revenues and Duties denied such allegations in August 2013.  The newspapers editorial office was shot at three times in 2009.
