The Ukrainian Cultural Centre of Toronto was located at 83-85 Christie St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada until the building was sold in 2013 to a Filipino community church. In 2016 it is located at 9 Plastics Ave, Etobicoke  (Toronto). It was the host of many Ukrainian events. "Christie", as the building was dubbed, was the heart of the Ukrainian community in the Greater Toronto Area, bringing together people with a common culture and important ideas.  The Centre is where the heritage was kept alive. The Ukrainian Cultural Centre consisted of a large and a small banquet hall, concert stage, full kitchen, rehearsal spaces, classrooms, library, cafeteria, nightclub, offices and a gymnasium. The Centre was home to the main offices of both the weekly Ukrainian language national newspaper HOMIN UKRAINY (Ukrainian Echo) and the Ukrainian Youth Association of Canada.  Both these institutions were founded in 1948 by Ukrainian immigrants to Canada. The Centre still offers English classes for newcomers and immigrants to Canada and other community events at its new location at St. Volodymyr's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral. Before 1960, the building at 83 Christie St. was originally the home of the Toronto branch of the UJPO (United Jewish Peoples' Order).
