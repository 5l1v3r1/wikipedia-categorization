Hey, O.K (Ukrainian: Гей, любо) is an album by the band Vopli Vidopliassova. It was released by the Ukrainian-Canadian label Kobza in 1990. The album is not acknowledged on the band's official website.  All tracks written by Oleg Skripka unless otherwise specified.Both tracks written by Yuri Zdorenko and Oleg Ovchar (tracks 10 and 15) are not in Russian. Normally, the tracks are sung in Russian, but here they are presented with Ukrainian titles. Track 10 is in vocalise and track 15 is in English. Track 16 is arranged differently from the version that would later appear on Hvyli Amura a decade later. Track 19 has a drum and guitar intro instead of the speech and the outro features Zdorenko sliding his hand over the neck. The songs were written between 1987 and 1990. An 8-song demo tape recorded in the Kobza Studio in 1989 circulates. The tape contains 6 of the songs plus two unreleased songs, "Ty ushel" and "Chio San". "Chio San" would later be re-recorded and released on the album Chudovy svit in 2013, more than 20 years after the original conception of the song. "Ty ushel" was intended to be put on the tape, but was left off and later appeared in 1992 on Abo abo. "Bili plyamy" is also arranged differently on this tape, suggesting the tape was recorded before the present arrangement of the song. The track list goes as follows: Videos of "Zv'yazok" and "Ty ushel" from these sessions were included on the documentary "Hai zhyve VV" in 1995.
