Northward is a hard rock duo composed of Dutch vocalist Floor Jansen of Nightwish and Norwegian guitarist JÃ¸rn Viggo Lofstad of Pagan's Mind.  The two created the project in 2007, writing an entire album worth of music in 2008 but being unable to record previously due to their busy schedules; they ultimately reunited in 2017 to finally record the album, which will be released in October 19, 2018 by Nuclear Blast.  The backup band for the album consists of bassist Morty Black of TNT, drummers Jango Nilsen and Stian Kristoffersen, and keyboardist Ronny Tegner, the latter two also being members of Pagan's Mind. The album is mixed and mastered by Volbeat producer Jacob Hansen. It will feature a duet between Jansen and her sister Irene on the song "Drifting Islands".
