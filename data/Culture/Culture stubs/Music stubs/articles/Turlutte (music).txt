In Quebec, the turlutte is a form of traditional popular song, which is associated  with specific melody ornaments.  It is more accurately characterized as a song or vocal style in the French chanson tradition. It is associated particularly with the working class or trade union tradition in the Canadian encyclopedia.  These include the following: A skilled proponent of the turlutte is La Bolduc, whose satirical and sometimes racy songs were based on the Quebec and Irish folk traditions.

It lends itself well to group playing and percussive use of feet and hands, as in the performance at Kyneton, central Victoria, where the Celtic Southern Cross Summer School produced this ethnomusicologically notable clip.  It has also been rendered on guitar.  Canadian music Entry on French Wikipedia
