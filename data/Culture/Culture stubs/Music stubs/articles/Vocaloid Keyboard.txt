Vocaloid Keyboard is a physical MIDI keytar with a built-in Vocaloid synthesizer and vocal database. The product is currently offered to businesses interested in it,  and will be commercially released in "Winter 2017".  The Vocaloid Keytar was designed using the VY1 vocal.  It is part of the eVocaloid range, a LSI sound generator called the "NSX-1" source chip which can generate 30 sounds of midi.  For VY1, it uses the NSX-1 chip "eVY1".  When first demonstrated in 2015, it came in 3 colours; black, white and pink, however other colours have been shown.    The 37 key prototype was showcased between July 3â€“5, 2015 in the "Two Yamahas, One Passion" exhibition at Roppongi Hills. The event showcased technological designs by both Yamaha Corporation and Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd.   The keyboard could be rented from Joysound for a limited time.  In December a special event was held in which the first major appearance of the Vocaloid Keyboard was used.  In the event a green version was shown with the Megpoid vocal used as the voice within the instrument.   At the "Think MIDI 2015" event, a demo of the keyboard was seen.   Later in December, a purple Yuzuki Yukari version began development.
