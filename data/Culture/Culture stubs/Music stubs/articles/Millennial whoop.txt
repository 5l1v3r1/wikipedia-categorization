Music blogger Patrick Metzger,   The millennial whoop is a melodic pattern alternating between the fifth and third notes in a major scale, typically starting on the fifth, in the rhythm of straight 8th-notes, and often using the "wa" and "oh" syllables.  It has been extensively used in 2010s pop music.   The term was first coined by the musician Patrick Metzger, who described it in a blog entry on The Patterning in August 2016,  and later in a TED talk in February 2017.  He suggests that, while the millennial whoop gained popularity from the late 2000s to 2010s, it has probably always been around.  In 2013 songwriter Ally Burnett tried to sue Carly-Rae Jepsen and Owl City over their 2012 song "Good Time", arguing similarities to her 2010 song "Ah, It's a Love Song".  Jepsen settled out of court, but Owl City won.  An early use of what would later be known as the "millennial whoop" is the 1983 song "Jungle Love" by Morris Day and the Time.  A notable use of the millennial whoop is in the 1987 theme song by Mark Mueller for the American animated television series DuckTales which ran for a total of 100 episodes.  It does not occur in some other language versions of the 1987 theme  nor in the 2017 English version of the theme song.  The 2017 song "Millennial Whoop" by The Pilgrims was written as a response to the idea of older generations looking down upon the younger for using such tropes: the song makes use of the interval pattern.  Black Metal band Zeal & Ardor used the millennial whoop in his song "Waste" off of Stranger Fruit.  Songs where the millennial whoop appear include:
