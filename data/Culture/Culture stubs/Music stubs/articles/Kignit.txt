Kignit or qenet (ቅኝት) is a mode in the music of Ethiopia, particularly that of the Amhara people in the Ethiopian highlands. There are four main kignit that are used, all of which are pentatonic: tizita (ትዝታ), bati (ባቲ), ambassel (አምባሰል), and anchihoye (አንቺሆዬ).   Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.  Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tizita, a song of reminiscence.  Ashenafi Kebede was one of the early scholars to standardize the kignits of northern and central Ethiopia.
