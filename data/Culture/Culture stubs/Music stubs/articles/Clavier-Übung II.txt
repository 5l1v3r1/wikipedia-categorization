 Johann Sebastian Bach's Clavier-Übung II was published in 1735, containing two works written for performance on a two-manual harpsichord. In the publication, Bach contrasted a work in Italian style – a Concerto nach Italienischem Gusto (Concerto after the Italian taste, now known as the Italian Concerto), BWV 971, with a work in French style, a suite which he called Ouvertüre nach franzosischer Art (Overture in the French style, also known as the French Overture), BWV 831. The French Overture had previously been written down in C minor; for the publication of 1735 Bach transposed it to B minor and made slight changes to the musical text, for example in the rhythms of the first movement. The reason for the transposition is not known: one speculation is that the aim was to increase the contrast between the two works. F major is a "flat" key and B minor is a "sharp" key, and the keynotes are related by a tritone, which is the most distant modulation. Another possible motivation is that out of the eight German note names A, B (B♭), C, D, E, F, G, H (B♮), six had already been used as keynotes in the Partitas, thus only F and H remained.
