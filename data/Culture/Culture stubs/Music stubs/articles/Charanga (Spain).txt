Charanga is, in several areas of Spain a name given to represent a small musical band, with wind and percussion instruments, which typically plays during popular festivals (mostly in northern Spain and in the Valencian Community). The musicians are often amateurs and usually travel around as different towns celebrate their festivals. For the most part, charangas play popular, traditional songs, which have simple rhythms and often feature risqu√© lyrics. Also, they often play medleys. The most typical type of event in which they play is the pasacalles, a performance which moves along the streets of a town, while the public follows the band and dances to its tunes (and have a few beers). In the past, the name charanga was also applied to certain military musical bands.
