Sangtra√Øt was a hard rock and heavy metal group with mediaeval reminiscences, from La Jonquera, in Catalonia, Spain. It is different from other groups of the same generation in Catalonia. They got together in 1982.  They became fairly popular in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to songs such as "El vol de l'home ocell" (The flight of the birdman), "Somnis entre boires" (Dreams in the fog) and "El senyor de les pedres" (The lord of the stones). The group dissolved on December 20, 2001, following a farewell concert in Barcelona, but they made a comeback at Canet de Mar Music Festival in 2016.
