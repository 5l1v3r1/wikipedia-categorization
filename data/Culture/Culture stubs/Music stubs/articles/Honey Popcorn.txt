Honey Popcorn (Hangul: 허니팝콘) is a girl group based in South Korea formed by Kyun Create, consisting of Japanese adult video actresses Yua Mikami, Miko Matsuda, and Moko Sakura.  The group debuted on March 21, 2018 with Bibidi Babidi Boo.   In February 2018, Mikami announced that she would debut in South Korea with a new girl group with Miko Matsuda and Moko Sakura.  Prior to this, all three girls had worked as idol singers in Japan, with Mikami as a member of SKE48, Matsuda as a member of NMB48, and Sakura as a member of Bakusute Sotokanda Icchome (a sub-unit of Akihabara Backstage Pass). The group was funded by Mikami herself as a passion project.  Their debut was met with controversy by Korean media outlets.
