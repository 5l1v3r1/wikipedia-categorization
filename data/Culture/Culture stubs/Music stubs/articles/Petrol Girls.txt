Petrol Girls is a feminist post-hardcore band formed in London in 2012 by Ren Aldridge and Liepa Kuraitė, with Joe York and Zock Astpai joining later. The band is named after les Pétroleuses.   Petrol Girls formed and played their first show in 2012, after just two practises, at a house party hosted by founding member Ren Aldridge (vocals) to celebrate International Women’s Day. Retaining original bassist Liepa Kuraitė, who had never played before Aldridge invited her to join, they eventually recruited Joe York (guitar) and Zock Astpai (drums) to complete a sustainable lineup.    Aldridge took the name from a group of 19th century French revolutionaries, les Pétroleuses, after hearing them mentioned by Laurie Penny.   After two EPs, their eponymous self released 7" from 2014 and Some Thing from 2016, the band released their debut album Talk of Violence on Bomber Music in 2017.    In April 2018 the band released single "Survivor" and announced they had signed to Hassle Records for their next release.
