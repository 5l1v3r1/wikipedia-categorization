A music award is an award or prize given for skill or distinction in music. There are different awards in different countries, and different awards may focus on or exclude certain music. For example, some music awards are only for classical music and include no popular music. Some music awards are academic, some are commercial and created by the music industry. Examples include the Billboard Music Award, Grammy Award, Glenn Gould Prize, and Pulitzer Prize for Music.
