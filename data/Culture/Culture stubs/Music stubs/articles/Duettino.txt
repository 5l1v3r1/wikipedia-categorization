A duettino is an unpretentious duet with a concise form.    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart offers several well-known examples of the type, including "La ci darem la mano" from Don Giovanni and "Duettino No. 3" from La clemenza di Tito, a song only twenty-four measures long.   He also described "Via resti servita" in The Marriage of Figaro as a duettino.  By the time of Gioachino Rossini, a duettino was a common part of the introduction of the Farsa opera genre.  Rossini composed several pieces in the form.
