The Sebene is a kind of instrumental bridge typically executed on the electric guitar and is a characteristic element of the Congolese rumba.  The development of the sebene in congolese music has been credited to both Franco Luambo , but it predates both of them with Congolese guitarist Henri Bowane being the reputed inventor in the 1940s.   In the sebene, one or more guitarists repeat short phrases, while the lead player improvises around the theme.
