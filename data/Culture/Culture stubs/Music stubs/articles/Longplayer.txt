Longplayer is a self-extending composition by Jem Finer which is designed to continue for one thousand years. It started to play on 1 January 2000, and if all goes as planned, it will continue without repetition until 31 December 2999. It will restart on that date.  Longplayer is based on an existing piece of music, 20 minutes and 20 seconds in length, which is processed by computer using a simple algorithm. This gives a large number of variations, which, when played consecutively, gives a total expected runtime of 1000 years, that is 10 centuries. It uses Tibetan singing bowls and gongs, which are able to create a range of sounds by either striking or rolling pieces of wood around the rims. This source music was recorded in December 1999. It was commissioned by Artangel. Longplayer could be heard in the relaxation zone of the Millennium Dome in London during its year of opening in 2000. The piece was also played in the 19th century lighthouse at Trinity Buoy Wharf and other public listening posts in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Egypt, where it can still be heard today.  It can also be heard via an Icecast Internet stream, hosted (as of 2008) by Greenwich-based SPC. Four excerpts of Longplayer were released on a vinyl LP.
