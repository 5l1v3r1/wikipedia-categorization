Greece was represented by Takis Biniaris with the song "Miazoume", at the 1985 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 4 May in Gothenburg, Sweden.  The song was chosen internally by broadcaster ERT. Greece withdrew, having been drawn eighteenth in order of presentation. The reason behind the withdrawal, was that the Eurovision contest coincided with Holy Saturday. Their entry would have been "Wagon-lit" (βάγκον λι) performed by Polina. Takis Biniaris was the nineteenth and last performer on the night of the contest, following Luxembourg. At the close of voting, "Miazoume" had received 15 points, placing Greece 16th of the 19. The Greek jury awarded its 12 points to France.
