The5 are a pop boy band composed of Kazem Chamas, Ahmed Hassan, Adil Echbiy, Said Karmouz and Mohamed Bouhezza (aka BMd).     They finished second in the fourth series of the Arabic televised singing competition The X Factor Arabia in 2015 and are currently considered the most popular boy band in the Middle East region.     In 2015, Kazem Chamas, Ahmed Hassan and Adil Echbiy auditioned as solo candidates for the fourth series of the Arabic televised singing competition The X Factor Arabia, whereas Said Karmouz and Mohamed Bouhezza (aka BMd) auditioned together. They were put together to form a five-piece boy band in Beirut, Lebanon, thus qualifying for the "Groups" category. Elissa and Donia Samir Ghanem, their future mentor, have both come up with the idea of forming the band. They reached the finals and ended up as runners-up losing to Hamza Hawsawi on June 13, 2015.
