 Clima (meaning Climate in English) was a cultural magazine published in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Ismail Xavier argues that although it existed just for three years from 1941 to 1944, the magazine significantly influenced cultural criticism in Brazil.  Clima was established in 1941   and the first issue appeared in May 1941.  The founders were the Brazilian intellectuals,  who were called the Grupo Clima.  One of the founders was Paulo Emilio Salles Gomes.  The others included Antonio Candido, DÃ©cio de Almeida Prado, Gilda de Mello e Souza, Ruy Coelho and Lourival Gomes Machado.  Antonio Candido was also worked as a literary critic of the magazine,  which was published on a monthly basis.  Clima existed until 1944.
