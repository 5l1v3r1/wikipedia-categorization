The Yale Hippolytic (or The Hippolytic) is the leading left-of-center publication at Yale University. Founded in the spring of 2003, it publishes twice per semester. In the fall of 2003, the "Hippo" - as it is known colloquially on campus - won the financial support of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think-tank based in Washington, DC. The magazine is a member of the Campus Progress network of college publications. In addition to covering local, national and international political issues, The Hippolytic engages in cultural criticism, publishing book and film reviews. The magazine took its name from Hippolyte Havel, a  turn-of-the-century activist and artist in Greenwich Village.
