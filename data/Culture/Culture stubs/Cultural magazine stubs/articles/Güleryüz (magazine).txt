The Ottoman Turkish satirical magazine Güleryüz ("laughing face")  appeared in Istanbul weekly from 1921 to 1923 with a total of 122 editions.  Its publisher, Sedat Simavi (1896-1952), was a Turkish journalist, political cartoonist, writer and film director. He is also known as co-founder of the Turkish Association of Journalists (Türkiye Gazeteciler Cemiyeti, 1946) and the daily newspaper Hürriyet (1948).   During the War of Independence (1919-1923) Güleryüz was the most influential humoristic magazine in Istanbul. It was the only one who supported Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Moreover, it publicly contributed to the assumption that the war could be won.  Parts of its volumes were regularly censored.  Its texts and numerous caricatures were written and designed by the editor himself, Dergide Ahmed Rasim, Ercümend Ekrem, Fazıl Ahmed, Cevad Şakir and Mustafa İzzet.  As a counterpart and support of the Turkish government the politico-humorous journal Aydede was founded in 1922.
