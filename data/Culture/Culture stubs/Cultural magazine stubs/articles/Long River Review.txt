Long River Review is the University of Connecticut's award-winning annual literary magazine run by undergraduate students with the assistance of faculty staff.  It is currently coordinated by Professor and Director of Creative Writing Sean Forbes. Each year a selection and interview process is held to find the most qualified students to join the LRR staff. The Long River Review class is only offered once a year, for the production of the magazine in the springtime.  The class itself is divided into groups of focused panelists and specific position roles. Panelists comb through the multitude of submissions received every year to pick the very best pieces in fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, or translations to publish. Students with position roles help make sure the magazine runs smoothly, overseeing various areas including editing, fundraising, copy editing, and social media. The class works together to produce a professional, fully realized magazine for sale. The process of creating this magazine helps students understand more about the literary publishing industry and get real hands-on experience working in a practical setting.  Along with written submissions, the Long River Review also accepts art submissions for publication in the magazine, accepting photographs, drawings, illustrations, comics, mixed media designs, and more.  Long River Review replaced Writing UConn : fiction, essays, poetry (OCLC 19407118) run by the Department of English from 1983–1997.
