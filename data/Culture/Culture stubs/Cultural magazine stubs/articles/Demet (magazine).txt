The Ottoman women's magazine Demet ("floral bouquet") was founded in 1908 in Istanbul, two weeks after the proclamation of the Second Constitutional Era. Altogether, seven issues exist, they were published once a week.  Editor-in-chief and publisher was Celāl Sāhir (1883–1935). Even though the magazine was aimed at women, the editorial team of the first two issues was made up exclusively of men, such as Mehmet Akif Ersoy (1873–1936), Selim Sırrı (Tarcan) (1874–1957), and Enis Avni (1886-1958). Among the female writers were later Halide Salih Hanımlar (Halide Edip, 1884–1964), Nigar Bint-i Osman (1862–1918), and İsmet Hakkı Hanım. In addition to literary and scientific articles, what interested the female readers most were political publications.  Besides Kadınlar Dünyası (1913–1921), Maḥāsin (1908–1910), and Kadın (1908–1910),   is considered one of the first and most important women's magazines in the Second Constitutional Era.
