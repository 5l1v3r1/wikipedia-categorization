David Latimer, Jonathan Wells, RES was a bi-monthly magazine chronicling the best in cutting edge film, music, art, design and culture. The magazine was launched with a preview issue in January 1997  at the Sundance Film Festival.

Subsequent issues featured innovative filmmakers and artists such as Chris Cunningham, Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Lars von Trier, Bj√∂rk, Radiohead, and Takagi Masakatsu. RES was headquartered in New York City.  When the magazine first launched, it carried the tagline "The Magazine of Digital Filmmaking".  Jonathan Wells served as the Editor-in-Chief and later Editorial Director, while Karol Martesko-Fenster served as Publisher.   In July 2000, Holly Willis took over as Editor-in-Chief and oversaw a redesign of the magazine by Trollback + Company. Starting with the September/October 2002 issue, the magazine evolved into a lifestyle magazine for creators covering the fields of film, music, art and design. Since the redesign, all issues of the magazine were bundled with a DVD that was sent to subscribers. The DVDs featured short films, music videos and music. RES was the first U.S. publication to include a DVD with every issue of the print publication.  The October 2006 issue of RES was the last issue to be printed.  A new hybrid magazine format was supposed to be launched by RES in 2007, and was intended to be published in several media. However, it was not materialized.  RES was published by RES Media Group, which also produced the international touring film festival, RESFest.
