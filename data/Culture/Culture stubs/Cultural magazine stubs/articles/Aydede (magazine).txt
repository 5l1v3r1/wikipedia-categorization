The Ottoman Turkish satirical magazine Aydede (Ottoman Turkish: آى دده‎) appeared in a first episode from January to November 1922 twice a week in 90 issues. Its owner and publisher Refik Halid Karay (1888-1965), a well-known poet and journalist, criticized through the published articles, poems and caricatures not only the social inconveniences and imbalances within the Turkish society, but also the young Turkish republic in general.   Despite the short period of its publication, the magazine influenced the satirical style of many intellectuals and subsequent satirical magazines, including Akbaba.  1922, the publication of the magazine was ceased when Refik Halid was forced by the Turkish Government into exile to Aleppo and Beirut. After his return, he published the magazine 1948 und 1949 for another ten months in a second episode in 125 issues, but with little success.
