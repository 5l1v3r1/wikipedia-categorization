1843 (formerly Intelligent Life) is a bi-monthly cultural magazine published by the Economist Group.   It was launched under the title Intelligent Life in September 2007 as a quarterly publication, having previously been a summer annual and describes its coverage as “the arts, style, food, wine, cars, travel and anything else under the sun, as long as it’s interesting”.  Beginning March 2016, publisher Economist Group relaunched and rebranded Intelligent Life as 1843 (named for The Economist's founding year). It remains at six issues per year.   In addition to contributions from The Economist journalists, 1843 features articles by writers from around the world and photography commissioned for each issue. It is edited by Rosie Blau.
