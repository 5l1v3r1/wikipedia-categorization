St Botolph's Review was the student-made poetry journal  from Cambridge University, England in  1956, which saw the first publication of Ted Hughes' poetry, at the  launch of which Hughes met Sylvia Plath.  The first issue appeared on 26 February 1956.  It was named for St Botolph's Church, Cambridge as one of its founders, Lucas Myers, lived at the rectory of that church.  A second edition was published in 2006.  A copy of the original journal was stored in the British Library in 2010.  Led by Hughes, the other contributors were listed as:  David Ross, Daniel Huws, Daniel Weissbort, Lucas Myers, Nathaniel Minton and George Weissbort.
