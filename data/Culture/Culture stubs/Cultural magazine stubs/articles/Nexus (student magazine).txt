Nexus is the weekly free students' magazine of the Waikato Students Union (WSU) at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.  Nexus was established more than forty years ago and now has an advertised circulation of 5000 weekly.  It is published throughout the academic year in the form of a full colour magazine and is also made available on the WSU website. In the late 90's the magazine faced troubled times, caused mainly by the student union membership being made voluntary.  The magazine has experienced hard times due to its controversial content.  In 2003 the advertisement of the magazine, "Nexus, Funnier than Porn", caused criticism.
