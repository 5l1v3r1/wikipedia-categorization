The Ryerson Review of Journalism is a Canadian magazine, published twice annually by final year journalism students at Ryerson University. The magazine profiles personalities, issues and controversies in Canadian media.  In addition to the features in the printed magazine, weekly online features and a daily blog are maintained by the staff of the Review.  The magazine's mandate has, from the very beginning, asked What does this mean for Canadian journalism now? Don Obe, who was chair of Ryerson's journalism school in mid-1983, began planning for a student-produced magazine project. The first issue of the Ryerson Review of Journalism was printed in April 1984. The magazine has won a number of National Magazine Awards, as well as citations by Rolling Stone and Utne Reader and a number of awards from the Association of Educators in Journalism and Mass Communication.
