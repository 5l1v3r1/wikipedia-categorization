The Arabic-language magazine An-Nibrās (النبراس;The Lantern) appeared once a month in 1909 und 1910 in Beirut. The founder and publisher was Sheikh Mustafa al-Ghalayini, a well-known Lebanese theologian, writer and reformer. In addition to scientific articles and findings, an-Nibrās focused on cultural topics.  The reader should not only be informed literarily and historically. Especially the criticism of politics and society played a major role for al-Ghalayini. Religious topics were not of primary importance but should be noted as well.  Newspaper subscriptions were offered outside of Lebanon not only to Egypt but also to America and India.
