The Cornell Lunatic, the college humor magazine at Cornell University, was founded on April 1, 1978, by Joey Green. During Green’s tenure as editor, the Lunatic was a 72 page glossy magazine of satire and parody published once a semester. The Lunatic staff was responsible for many pranks on campus, including a parody of the 1979 Cornell–Yale Homecoming Football Game program. Today, the Lunatic continues to publish once a semester,  and the magazine is distributed on campus for free. Famous alumni from the magazine include science fiction novelist Adam-Troy Castro, CSI producer Naren Shankar, and Harvard economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan. On March 29, 2008, more than fifty Lunatic alumni and guests gathered at the Cornell Club in Manhattan to celebrate the Lunatic's 30th anniversary and the publication of the book Lunacy: The Best of the Cornell Lunatic.
