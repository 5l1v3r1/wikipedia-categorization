Jewish Currents  is a progressive, secular Jewish quarterly magazine that carries on the insurgent tradition of the Jewish left through independent journalism, political commentary, and a "countercultural" approach to Jewish arts and literature. The magazine was first published in 1946 by the Morning Freiheit Association, under the name Jewish Life and was associated with the Communist Party, USA until 1956 when it broke with the party and took its current name. Now in its 60th year of publication, J.C. is undergoing a revival and expansion under the leadership of its new editor, Lawrence Bush, whose new column, "Religion and Skepticism," contends playfully with many manifestations of the "spirituality" of contemporary American culture. Other regular columns include "Jewish Women Now," "It Happened in Israel," "Inside the Jewish Community," "Our Secular Jewish Heritage," "Around the World," and "Mameloshn: Yiddish Poetry." From Marchâ€“April 2005 until the March-April 2009 issue, Jewish Currents was distributed to all members of the Workmen's Circle as a benefit of membership.
