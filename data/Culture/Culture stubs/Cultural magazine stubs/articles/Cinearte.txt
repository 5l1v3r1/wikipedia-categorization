Cinearte was a Brazilian magazine about cinema, which was founded in Rio de Janeiro on March 3, 1926.  Its founders were Mario Behring and Adhemar Gonzaga.     Cinearte was published on a weekly basis.  The magazine first attempted to lay a bridge between Brazilian cinema and North American cinema.  However, it later focused on national cinema.   The magazine ceased publication in July 1942.
