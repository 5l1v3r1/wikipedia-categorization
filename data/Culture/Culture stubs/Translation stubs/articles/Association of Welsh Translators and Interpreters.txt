The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters (in Welsh, Cymdeithas Cyfieithwyr Cymru) is a professional body representing English/Welsh translators and interpreters in Wales. The association has some 340 members, most of whom are translators; less than a quarter are interpreters. The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters is a member of the International Federation of Translators (FIT).  The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters was established in 1976  to provide a forum for the discussion of issues relating to Welsh/English translation and interpreting. Its goal is to ensure professional translation standards are upheld in the field of Welsh/English translation and interpreting. The association also advises the Welsh Language Board on translation issues.
