The Tchernichovsky Prize is an Israeli prize awarded to individuals for exemplary works of translation into Hebrew. It is awarded by the municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo.  Although initially awarded annually, it is now awarded every two years. The prize was founded, in the name of the poet Shaul Tchernichovsky, following a 1942 resolution of the municipality.  Tchernichovsky himself participated in formulating the policies for the grant of the award and attended the first award ceremony for the prize in 1943.
