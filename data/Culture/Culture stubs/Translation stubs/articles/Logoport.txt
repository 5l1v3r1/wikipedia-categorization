Logoport is a proprietary software program owned by the localisation company Lionbridge. The program is a CAT (Computer Assisted Translation) tool, which uses a translation memory stored on an online central database to provide translators with similar previous translation units on which to base new translations. Depending on the setup and previous translations, the central database can contain a huge amount of words and sentences that can be used to aid in translation from previously translated sentences.
