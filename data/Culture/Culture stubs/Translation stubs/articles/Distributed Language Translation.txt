Distributed Language Translation (Esperanto: Distribuita Lingvo-Tradukado, DLT) was a project to develop an interlingual machine translation system for twelve European languages. It ran between 1985 and 1990. DLT was undertaken by the Dutch software house BSO (now part of Atos Origin) in Utrecht in cooperation with the now defunct Dutch airplane manufacturer Fokker and the Universal Esperanto Association. The project's results were far from the expected. From a modern view, the DLT concept was erroneous in itself, as it couldn't distinguish the different meanings of the same word in different contexts.[neutrality is disputed] Modern statistic-based and context-based translation programs are able to produce a better translation.
