The Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council (CTTIC) (or, in French, the Conseil des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes du Canada) is a federation of provincial and territorial associations representing translators, terminologists and interpreters (collectively known as "language professionals") in Canada. Since professional organization is a matter of provincial and territorial jurisdiction in Canada, CTTIC admits only provincial and territorial bodies, called associations, orders, societies or corporations. The Council's total membership consists of the eleven member bodies which, in turn, represent their own members. As a result, the CTTIC speaks for about 3,500 language professionals, some 2,500 of whom are certified. The CTTIC is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT). The Council was originally incorporated in 1956 as the Society of Translators and Interpreters of Canada (STIC), or, in French, the Société des traducteurs et interprètes du Canada (STIC). It changed its name, becoming CTIC (the Canadian Translators and Interpreters Council, or, in French the Conseil des traducteurs et interprètes du Canada) in 1970. The Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario (ATIO) and the Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec (OTTIAQ) (known, at that time, as the Société des traducteurs du Québec (STQ)), are the founding members of the Council. On June 11, 2012, OTTIAQ withdrew from CTTIC.  Original members: Since 1972 the following associations have joined:
