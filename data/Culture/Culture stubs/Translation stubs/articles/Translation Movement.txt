The Translation Movement was a movement started in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad which translated many Greek classics into Arabic. The relationship between the early period of Islamic mathematics and the mathematics of Greece and India is not fully understood as much work is extant only in Latin translations or has not survived.  The Sabian, Thabit ibn Qurrah (836â€“901), translated Nicomachus of Gerasa's Arithmetic and, under the patronage of the Banu Musa brothers, translated and revised the works of the major Greek mathematicians.
