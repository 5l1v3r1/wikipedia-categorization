Premio de Traducción Literaria Tomás Segovia is a Mexican literary award given to translators.   The honorarium includes a cash prize of US$100,000 making it one of the richest literary prizes in the world. It alternates every year between translators who translate into Spanish, and those translating from Spanish.  It is named in honor of Spanish-born Mexican author, translator and poet Tomas Segovia (1927–2011).  The award was established in 2012 by the National Council for Culture and Arts (Conaculta), a Mexican government agency responsible for promoting the arts. It is financed by Conaculta in partnership with Fondo de Cultura Economica (Mexico's leading publisher) and the Guadalajara International Book Fair, where the award will be presented.
