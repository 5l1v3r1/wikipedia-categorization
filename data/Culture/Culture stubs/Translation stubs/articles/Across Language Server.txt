Across Language Server is a software platform for computer-assisted translation (CAT) that includes additional features for the management of projects. The software is produced and sold by Across Systems GmbH, a company located and founded in Karlsbad in 2005 as a Corporate spin-off of Nero AG and which maintains an additional site in Glendale, California. The functional principle is similar to the one SDL Trados, XTM and memoQ feature: Just like the server solutions of these two programs, Across Language Server also saves translation units or terminology entries (depending on the project's configuration) into a local or a central MSSQL database. Besides the "Server", which is available in different versions, there is also a single-user version called Across Translator Edition, working with a local MS-SQL database. This single-user application is able to connect to the server, enabling to work on both local and Across-Server-based projects. Freelance translators can acquire the Basic Edition of the single-user version for free. Version 5 of the MS-SQL-database-based Across Language Server was launched in 2009.  Version 6 of Across Language Server was released on 2 July 2014.  Version 6.3 was introduced on 26 November 2015.
