Governor's Comedy Club is an American comedy club in Levittown, New York, on Long Island. It was more than 30 years old as of 2015. It hosts a variety of comedians from local talent, to national headliners such as Kevin James, Nick DiPaolo, Andrew Dice Clay, and Gilbert Gottfried. It has two sister clubs also on Long Island: The Brokerage Comedy Club & Vaudeville Cafe (opened in 1980) in Bellmore and McGuire's in Bohemia. In 2017, Governor's opened "The Lil' Room", which is a smaller and intimate 60-seat showroom located within Governor's of Levittown, separate from the club's main showroom. They also opened a summer-only showroom inside the Memory Motel in Montauk. Governor's also had a former club, Gateway, located in Medford; Gateway had closed temporarily but has since re-opened (now based out of the Clarion Hotel in Ronkonkoma), though not run by the Governor's group. They all hold Comedy Classes, which train up and coming comedians on comedy writing and performance styles, resulting in a "Graduation Show" at either the Governor's, Brokerage or McGuire's clubs.
