It's Bad for Ya is the 19th album, and 14th and final HBO stand-up comedy special by stand-up comedian George Carlin. It was televised live on March 1, 2008, on HBO, less than four months before Carlin died of heart failure at age 71.  The album is the follow-up to the 2005 HBO special Life Is Worth Losing. Carlin worked on this material since ending his Life Is Worth Losing tour. The working title for this show was The Parade of Useless Bullshit.  Filmed in the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, California, the show's stage behind Carlin was designed to represent a cozy living room theme. The CD was released July 29, 2008, and the DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 25, 2008. It's Bad for Ya received the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, awarded posthumously.  The live HBO performance special was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. It lost to Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project. The audio recording of the special won the Grammy for Best Comedy Album in the 51st Grammy Awards.
