  The Wharf Revue is a series of musical comedy revues presented by the Sydney Theatre Company. Each show features four comedians - usually Jonathan Biggins, Phillip Scott and Drew Forsythe, accompanied by a female performer - satirising media personalities and political events in sketches and songs. The music and lyrics are largely written by Scott. Female Wharf Revue performers have included Amanda Bishop, Genevieve Lemon and Helen Dallimore (filling in). The revue has become something of a Sydney cultural institution.
