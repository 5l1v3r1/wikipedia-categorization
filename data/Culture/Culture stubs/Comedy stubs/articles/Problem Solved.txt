Problem Solved is a slogan on a t-shirt designed by Route 66 Attitude, a clothing line sold by major U.S. department store Kmart. The shirt depicts a male stick figure and a female stick figure arguing in the first frame (captioned "Problem"), and in the second frame, the male pushes the female out of a window (captioned "Solved.")  Due to its encouragement of violence against women, the t-shirt generated protests and petitions for its removal from Kmart stores across the United States in late 2006 and early 2007, including in Augusta, Maine, Oakland, California, Portland, Oregon,  and Toledo, Ohio.  While a spokesperson for Kmart's parent company Sears Holdings Corporation said that the shirt was intended to be "light hearted", Meijer reported that they had pulled the shirts immediately after a protest.
