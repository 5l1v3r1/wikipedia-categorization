Mixed Doubles is a comedy sketch group. Mixed Doubles comedy sketch group was created in the summer of 2012. Members are Megan Smith, Rose Robinson, Paul Aitchison and Will Close. All 4 members met and trained at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts In 2012 the group formed for the Henley Fringe but under the name of "Beauty School Dropouts". The show comprised around 24 sketches and was created by the foursome over a number of weeks leading up to the festival. Thanks to its success and reviews*, the group decided to continue and develop, renaming themselves Mixed Doubles.  A further performance was scheduled for London in early November 2012 at The Etcetera Theatre, Camden. The London show subsequently had a sell out week in which it received positive feedback from reviewers** and the public alike. In February 2013 they received "The People's Choice Award" at the Dave Comedy Festival for their comedy short, "Modern Conversation".  Mixed Doubles performed at Edinburgh Fringe 2013 at Just The Tonic   and came runner up in Best New Comedy Sketch Act 2013.
