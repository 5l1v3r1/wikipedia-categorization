Sneezing powder refers to a group of powders or powder-like substances that induce sneezing when someone is exposed to them. This is usually done as a practical joke or prank to an unsuspecting victim. Sneezing powders containing Veratrum album alkaloids have been linked to poisoning, including upset stomach, fainting, slowed heart rate and low blood pressure.  Children are especially vulnerable.  An example of a "sternutatory" agent is helenalin (the acetate is called angustibalin). The plant that this chamissonolid is comes from is actually eponymously called sneezeweed. It has known anti-tumor properties & can also be used as a tobacco replacement.
