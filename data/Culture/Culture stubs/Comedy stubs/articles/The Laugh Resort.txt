The Laugh Resort was one of the most popular stand-up comedy clubs located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. For several years it was the only competition to the Yuk-Yuks chain in downtown Toronto. Because of this fact well known visiting comedians frequently visited the club, and it became a home of Canada's independent and more alternative comics. The club moved from its location next to The Second City's historic Old Fire Hall to a central downtown location in the basement of the Holiday Inn on King Street in 2000, and closed in 2008 when the hotel chain was sold and the basement space was needed to build a new luxury restaurant. According to the club's website they are still looking for a new location.
