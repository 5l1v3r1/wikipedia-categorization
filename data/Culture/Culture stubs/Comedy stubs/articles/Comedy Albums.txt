Comedy Albums is a Billboard chart that lists the "top-selling spoken word and musical comedy albums" each week, as ranked by sales data compiled by Nielsen SoundScan.  The chart debuted as Top Comedy Albums in November 2004 when it was published for the first time exclusively in Billboard's websites.  The first number-one album on the Top Comedy Albums chart was A Decade of Laughs by Bill Engvall.
