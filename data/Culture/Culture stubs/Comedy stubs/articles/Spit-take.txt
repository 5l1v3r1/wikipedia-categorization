A spit-take is a comic technique or reaction in which someone spits a beverage out of their mouth when they react to a surprising statement.  In this context, the word "take" is used in the sense of taking in information.  It is similar in construction to the phrase "double-take." Spit take made it into the Oxford Dictionary,  not to be confused with the Oxford English Dictionary, in a 2014 update. Albert Brooks' short film, The Famous Comedians School, features a workshop on spit takes. Two characters sit at a table.  Character #1 has a cup of coffee in hand. Character 1: Did they ever find that missing toxic sludge? Character 2: Yes. (Character 1 sips coffee.) Character 2: Someone poured it into the coffee urn. (Character 1 spits the coffee all over the table.) In a spit-take, the reaction is usually one of surprise.  The "spit" action is overly dramatized; performers will add lots of noise and spray liquid from their mouth in an exaggerated fashion.
