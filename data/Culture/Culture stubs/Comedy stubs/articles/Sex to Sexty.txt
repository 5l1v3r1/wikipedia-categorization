Sex to Sexty was a sexually-oriented humor magazine published in Arlington, Texas by John W. Newbern, Jr. and Peggy Rodebaugh, with art direction (and cartoons, covers, etc.) by Lowell Davis (later to become known as a creator of bucolic art)  ), under the respective pseudonyms of Richard or Dick Rodman, Goose Reardon, and Pierre Davis.   The content was a mixture of risqué anecdotes; limericks (some by Gershon Legman) and other short humorous sexual poetry; and cartoons, the latter initially by Davis but soon expanding to include artists such as veteran good girl artists Bill Ward and Bill Wenzel. It ran from 1964 to 1983.  The company which published the magazine also published novelty records and paperback books under the Sex to Sexty title. The first serious discussion of the magazine was published by Taschen in 2008, titled, Sex to Sexty: The Most Vulgar Magazine Ever Made! ISBN 9783822852231 edited by Dian Hanson, with a preface by artist Mike Kelley.
