The Halifax Comedy Festival (often spelled in promotional materials as Ha!ifax Comedy Festival) is an annual comedy festival held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The festival is sponsored by the CBC which tapes and broadcasts the comedians' sets as a series of television specials, and is usually about one week long. Shows frequently take place at the Halifax Casino in The Schooner Showroom among other venues. Live tapings of CBC Radio's hit show The Debaters have become a part of the annual festival, frequently using comedians who are performing in the festival as the 'debaters'.
