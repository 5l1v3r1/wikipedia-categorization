UN Spanish Language Day is observed annually on 12 October.   The event was established by the UNESCO[not in citation given]  (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in 2010 to seeking "to celebrate multilingualism and cultural diversity as well as to promote equal use of all six of its official working languages throughout the organization". 12 October is a date observed in many Spanish-speaking territories as Día de la Raza or Día de la Hispanidad.
