Holiday Yezidis is one of the Yezidis religious holidays, which is preceded by a three-day post. Everyone must observe the Yezidi these days dedicated to Sultan Yazidis, who along with Sheikh Adi and Melek Taus is a triad. Lent begins on Tuesday and ends on Thursday, after which comes the holiday, i.e. "Eid". The Yezidis of Turkey, Syria and Iraq some two weeks before the post Yazidis have three-day fast in honor of Sheshams (Sheh Shams), and next week for three days in honor of the patron saint of the family "hudane Male."
