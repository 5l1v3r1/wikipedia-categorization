 Obama Day was a holiday celebrated in Kenya on November 2008 in honor of Barack Obama's victory in the United States presidential election, 2008.   Shortly after the U.S. election result was announced, Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki declared the holiday, because Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr., was Kenyan.
