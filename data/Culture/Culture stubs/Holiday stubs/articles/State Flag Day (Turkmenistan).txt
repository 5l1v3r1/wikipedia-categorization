The Day of the State Flag of Turkmenistan is an official holiday of Turkmenistan. It marks the day Turkmenistan approved its current national flag on February 19, 1992. On December 26, 1994, the President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov ordered the day to become a state holiday and a non-working day.   At a session of the Eldersâ€™ Council on 10 October 2017, a decision was made to combine State Flag Day with Constitution Day and to move in to May 18.
