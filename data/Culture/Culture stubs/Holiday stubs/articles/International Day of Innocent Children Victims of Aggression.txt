 The International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression is a United Nations observance each 4 June.  It was established on 19 August 1982. Originally focused on victims of the 1982 Lebanon War, its purpose expanded to "acknowledge the pain suffered by children throughout the world who are the victims of physical, mental and emotional abuse. This day affirms the UN's commitment to protect the rights of children."  The General Assembly, having considered the question of Palestine at its resumed seventh emergency special session, "appalled at the great number of innocent Palestinian and Lebanese children victims of Israel's acts of aggression"  decided to commemorate 4 June of each year as the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression.  31st plenary meeting 19 August 1982
