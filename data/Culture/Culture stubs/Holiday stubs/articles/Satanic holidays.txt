Satanic holidays have been described by both Satanists and by Christian authors, as well as by historians of witchcraft, who in turn relied on Christian accounts. In The Satanic Bible, Satanist Anton LaVey writes that "after one's own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween ". Other holidays are the two solstices and the two equinoxes. Five to six weeks after each of the solstices and equinoxes are the "legendary Satanic revels" (a reference to the cross-quarter days).   In the First Satanic Church, an "Annual Black X-Mass Show" is also held every December, hosted by LaVey's daughter, Karla LaVey. Christian authors have written dozens of anti-Satanic books with lists of alleged "Satanic ritual days".  According to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance, in some cases the authors appear to reference the works of other conservative Christian writers. Many of the authors appear to lack major direct knowledge of Satanism, often making claims without citation or substantiation.  In The Edge of Evil "Grand High Climax" is said to be a major holiday celebrated by Satanists on December 24.  Evangelical Christian author Jerry Johnston writes in this book that it is a celebration meant to juxtapose the Christian holiday of Christmas Eve, when the birth of Jesus Christ is celebrated. However this goal to blaspheme is not always prevalent.  Johnston claims that Grand High Climax is traditionally celebrated with a Black Mass, followed by great excesses of food, drink, sex, and merriment, but a rite called "Grand High Climax", and the details of the activities involved, is not a rite acknowledged by all Satanic groups. It was once part of the Satanic panic and beliefs about the Witches' Sabbath.
