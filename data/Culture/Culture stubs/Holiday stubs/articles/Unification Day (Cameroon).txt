 Unification Day is a holiday in Cameroon that is celebrated on 1 October, marking the anniversary of British Southern Cameroons' independence from the United Kingdom and unification with French Cameroun in 1961.  This is not to be confused with the anniversary of French Cameroun's independence from France, an event which occurred on 1 January 1960.
