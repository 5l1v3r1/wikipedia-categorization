 National Cat Day was founded as a way to bring awareness to the number of homeless cats.  It is a celebration that takes place on October 29th, (August 8th in Canada) every year in the United States.  The National Cat Day website states that the holiday was first celebrated in 2005 "to help galvanize the public to recognize the number of cats that need to be rescued each year and also to encourage cat lovers to celebrate the cat(s) in their life for the unconditional love and companionship they bestow upon us." The day is founded by Pet and Family Lifestyle Expert, Colleen Paige supported by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a nonprofit organization which also works to encourage pet adoption.  International Cat Day, August 8th, was created in 2002 by the International Fund for Animal Welfare.   World Cat Day is celebrated on February 17th in much of Europe, on March 1st in Russia. , and Cat Day is unofficially celebrated on February 22nd in Japan.
