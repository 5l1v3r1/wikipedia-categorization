 National Day is a holiday in Cameroon celebrated on 20 May. On the 20th  of May 1972, in a national referendum Cameroonians voted for a unitary state as opposed to the existing federal state.  The United Nations Trust Territory known as French Cameroun achieved independence from France on 1 January 1960, and British Southern Cameroons changed status from a Trusteeship under British administration to a federated state within Cameroon on 1 October 1961. The government chose 20 May as Cameroon's National Day to commemorate President Ahmadou Ahidjo's abolishment of the federal system of government in favor  of a unitary country in 1972. Even though it is considered a holiday, children all over the country go to schools and celebrate National Day usually by singing, carrying out parades or marches all around the different parts of their various cities. Speeches are made by the Head of State and other important personalities. The day is presided over by the head of state in Yaounde the capital of Cameroon. In the regional headquarters, it is presided by the governor who represents the government. The divisional officers preside over the day in their various divisions.
