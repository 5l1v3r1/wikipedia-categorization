 Beer Day Britain is Britain's National Beer Day. The date has been celebrated annually on 15 June since 2015.  The date was chosen because 15 June is also the date that Magna Carta was sealed in 1215  and ale is mentioned in clause 35 of Magna Carta, which states: Beer Day Britain was instigated by beer sommelier, writer and drinks educator Jane Peyton.  It took place for the first time in 2015. The main focus of the day is the National Cheers To Beer that takes place at 7Â pm when people also sing the Cheers To Beer anthem co-written by Jane Peyton.  There had been an earlier attempt to set up National Beer Day in 2009, when 43 Members of Parliament supported an Early day motion, as follows: "That this House welcomes the forthcoming National Cask Ale Week, the world's largest ale festival, from 6 to 13 April 2009, a week of campaigning across the United Kingdom to promote the importance and pleasures of drinking real ale in pubs; supports the aim of National Cask Ale Week to denote 6 April as National Beer Day; notes the economic strength of the cask ale industry as demonstrated by sales figures from the Small Independent Brewers' Association in November 2008; expresses hope that National Cask Ale Week will succeed in entering the Guinness Book of Records for the world's biggest toast, a record breaking attempt which will take place on 11 April 2009; and encourages hon. Members to support their local pub's participation in National Cask Ale Week."   However, this did not result in the repeated celebration of National Beer Day.
