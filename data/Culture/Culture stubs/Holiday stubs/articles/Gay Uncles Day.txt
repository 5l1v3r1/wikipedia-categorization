Gay Uncles Day, also known as Guncles Day, is celebrated on the second Sunday in August. It was first celebrated in the U.S. on a wide scale Sunday August 14, 2016. People celebrate it by posting photos of guncles with nephews and nieces using the hashtag #GunclesDay, #GayUnclesDay or #NationalGunclesDay.     The day highlights the diverse range of gay uncles who take care of nephews, nieces and other relatives, the definition of what it means to be ‘family’, and the growing acceptance of their role in today’s society. Gay Uncles Day started as a social media hashtag campaign #GayUnclesDay in August 2016. The idea came from a Florida-based Facebook user, C.J Hatter.
