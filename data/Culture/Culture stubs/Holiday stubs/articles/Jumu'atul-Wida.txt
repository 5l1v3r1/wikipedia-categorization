Jumu'atul-Widaa' (Arabic: جمعة الوداع‎ meaning Friday of farewell, also called al-Jumu'ah al-Yateemah Arabic: الجمعة اليتيمة‎ or the orphaned Friday Urdu: الوداع جمعہ‬ Al-Widaa Juma) is the last Friday in the month of Ramadan before Eid-ul-Fitr. Jumu'ah comes from the Arabic word for "gathering". Widaa' means "farewell". Jumu'ah (Friday) is the day on which Muslim men are required (women may attend, but are not required) to attend congregation in lieu of the mid-day prayer. Women may attend, but are not obligated. Evidence of this congregation found in the Qur'an in Verse 9 of Chapter 62 (The Congregation, Friday): O you who have believed, when [the adhan] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu'ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade. That is better for you, if you only knew.  Though Islam places no specific emphasis on any Friday as a holy day, some Muslims regard this one as the second holiest day of the month of Ramadan and one of the most important days of the year. Some Muslims spend a large part of their day on Jumu'atul-Widaa doing ibadah.
