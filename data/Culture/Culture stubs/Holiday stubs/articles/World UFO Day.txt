World UFO Day is an awareness day for people to gather together and watch the skies for unidentified flying objects. The day is celebrated by some on June 24, and others on July 2. June 24 is the date that aviator Kenneth Arnold reported what is generally considered to be the first widely reported unidentified flying object sighting in the United States,  while July 2 commemorates the supposed UFO crash in the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident.   The stated goal of the July 2 celebration is to raise awareness of "the undoubted existence of UFOs"  and to encourage governments to declassify their files on UFO sightings.
