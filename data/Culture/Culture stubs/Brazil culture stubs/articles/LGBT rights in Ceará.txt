Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Ceará, Brazil enjoy many of the same legal protections available to non-LGBT people. Homosexuality is legal in the state. On 7 March 2013, Ceará's state general attorney, Francisco Sales Neto, ruled in decision 02/2013 that all notaries statewide are obligated to accept same-sex marriages. The decision took effect on 15 March 2013.
