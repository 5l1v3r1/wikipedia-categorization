The International Architecture Biennial in São Paulo (BIA), Brazil, is an international competition to recognize art and innovation in architecture. The first BIA was held in 1973. The most recent competition is November 1 to December 4, 2011.  The BIA is held on alternating years from the São Paulo Art Biennial, another major international event hosted by the city. Both biennials are held in the Pavilhão Ciccillo Matarazzo building in the Ibirapuera Park (Parque do Ibirapuera). The large pavilion was designed by a team headed by Oscar Niemeyer and Hélio Uchôa.  The theme of the 2011 BIA is "Architecture for All -- Building Citizenship".
