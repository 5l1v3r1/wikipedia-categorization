A shabono (also xapono, shapono, or yano) is a hut used by the Yanomami, an indigenous peoples in the extreme southern Venezuela and extreme northern Brazil. Used as temporary homes, traditionally constructed mainly of thatched palm leaves and wood, shabonos are built in clearings in the jungle, using the wood cleared to build a palisade with a thatched roof that has a hole in the middle. In traditional villages, multiple shabonos, each conical or rectangular in shape, surround a central open space. Each family unit has its own area within a given shabono separated by a wooden post. These would be a home for around 50 people.
