Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil enjoy many of the same legal protections available to non-LGBT people. Homosexuality is legal in the state. On 17 April 2013, The General Magistrate of Justice of Rio de Janeiro, Judge Valmir de Oliveira Silva, published a legal ruling authorizing same-sex marriage in the state if local judges agree. Same sex weddings are poised to begin in the coming days.  According to the ruling (25/2013), a couples' request must be registered by civil registry officers, who have to give 15 days for the district to decide if they agree. If they don't agree, the marriage cannot proceed.
