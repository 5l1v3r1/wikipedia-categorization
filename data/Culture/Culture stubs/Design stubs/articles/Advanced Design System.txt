Advanced Design System (ADS) is an electronic design automation software system produced by Keysight EEsof EDA,  a division of Keysight Technologies. It provides an integrated design environment to designers of RF electronic products such as mobile phones,  pagers, wireless networks, satellite communications, radar systems, and high-speed data links.  Keysight ADS supports every step of the design process—schematic capture, layout, design rule checking, frequency-domain and time-domain circuit simulation, and electromagnetic field simulation—allowing the engineer to fully characterize and optimize an RF design without changing tools. Keysight EDA has donated copies of the ADS software to the electrical engineering departments at many universities, .
