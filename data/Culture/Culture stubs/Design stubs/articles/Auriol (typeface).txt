Auriol is a display typeface created by George Auriol in 1901 for the G. Peignot et Fils foundry in Paris.  George Auriol has been called the "quintessential Art Nouveau designer" according to Steven Heller and Louise Fili.  The letterforms he designed for his namesake typeface originated in Française-légère and Française-allongée, two other fonts he designed for G. Peignot et Fils. All three typefaces are distinguished by brush-like, unconnected strokes influenced by Japanese calligraphy. Auriol became a popular typeface in Europe and America in the early 20th century and was widely used as display type in books, posters, and in the applied arts. It also was adopted for signage at Paris Métro stations.  In 1979, during the revival of interest in the Art Nouveau period, Matthew Carter expanded the range of weights for Auriol by creating bold and black versions based on the original designs.  Auriol is currently a trademark of Linotype GmbH, a subsidiary of Monotype Corporation,  and is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
