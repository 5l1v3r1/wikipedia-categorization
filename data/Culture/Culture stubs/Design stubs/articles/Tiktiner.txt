Tiktiner is a clothing designer based in the French Riviera whose collections were distributed in France, elsewhere in Europe and in the United States. Tiktiner celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008. For many decades Tiktiner embodied the joie de vivre garments commonly worn in Cannes, St. Tropez and Nice, and appeared on the covers of Life and Elle magazines.  Two complete collections were created every year: blouses, swimsuits, coats and dresses, some of which were sold in Harrods and Bergdorf Goodman.
