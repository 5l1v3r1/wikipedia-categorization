The name Tanishq was chosen by Titan's first managing director Xerxes Desai.  The name was formed by combining the first two letters from Tata and नष्क "NISHK" (meaning gold coin or necklace in Sanskrit), although the क k has been modified into a क़ q.  According to another sources, the name is formed with the two words Tan (body) and Nishk (gold ornament) in the Sanskrit language, a name synonymous to superior craftsmen or absolute design.
