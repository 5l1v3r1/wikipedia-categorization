Cardboard modeling or cardboard engineering is a form of modelling with paper, card stock, paperboard, and corrugated fiberboard.  The term cardboard engineering is sometimes used to differentiate from craft of making decorative cards. It is often referred to as paper modelling although in practice card is generally used. Originally this was a form of modelling undertaken because of the low cost involved. Card, a means of cutting and glue are all that is needed. Some models are 100% card, while others use items of other materials to reinforce the model. After World War II cardboard models were promoted by a number of model companies. One company, ERG (Bournemouth) Ltd. produced a book "Cardboard Rolling Stock and How to Build It" and Superquick are still well known for their range of printed and pre-cut kits.  Books of printed models to cut out and make have been around a long time[when?]. Also special printed cards were available from which models could be made. In the UK Micromodels were well known for very small card models. Models to cut out were also a feature of paperboard folding cartons. For many years breakfast cereal makers had models to cut out on their packets.  The hobby has been revived through the use of IT based printers, especially the ink-jet and laser colour printers. Using a vector graphics package it is possible anyone to create their own models from scratch. Pre-printed models may be downloaded from the internet. A web ring  lists some of these while others offer a range of models from the simple to the complex.
