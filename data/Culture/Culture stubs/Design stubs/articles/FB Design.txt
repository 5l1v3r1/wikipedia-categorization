FB Design is a company established in 1971 by Fabio Buzzi, with the purpose of studying and building high-performance motor boats. For years the most important business of the company was the competition.  In 40 years of activity FB Design has won 52 Offshore World Championships, 7 Harmsworth Trophy 7 times and set 56 world speed records both UIM and APBA in US. When powerboat racing declined, the company's experience in fast racing boats was used to switch the production to the military field.  Now FB Design has developed a full range of military boats, its customers are the top Military and Coast Guard Organisations worldwide. It has an impressive series of patents, related to hulls, drives, propellers, gearboxes, waterjets and gas turbines. Even if FB Design production is now mainly oriented to the military, the company is still making very fast leisure boats for very demanding customers that want at the same time very high performances and reliability. FB Design is the only yard in the world whose craft have set world endurance and speed records in every existing class, with all types of hulls.
