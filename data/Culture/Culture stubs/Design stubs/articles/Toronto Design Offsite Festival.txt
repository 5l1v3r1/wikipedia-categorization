The 7th annual Toronto Design Offsite Festival (TO DO) is the city of Toronto's not-for-profit design week showcasing Canadian designers, held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, January 16 to the 22, 2017. The 2017  festival will feature over 100 exhibitions and events taking place across the city. Over 80% of the events in the festival are free and all are open to the public.   Events in the 2017 Festival include the TO DO Festival Party, Outside the Box exhibition, Living Well exhibition, TO DO Talks Symposium, Come Up To My Room exhibition and the consumer fair the Interior Design Show. In January 2016, TO DO had direct participation from 400+ designers and artists, 99,000+ visitors, 58+ million press impressions,  66+ million brand impressions and launched its annual Symposium on design.  In 2015, the festival added an annual self-produced exhibition component entitled White Out, TO DO Talks located at various locations around the city, and Outside the Box an exhibition where correspondents from cities across the continent curate original works from local designers and then ship them to Toronto for exhibition.  Outside the Box was also exhibited in New York City for WantedDesign NYC in May 2015.  The well-established alternative design exhibition, Come Up To My Room, is one of the events under the TO DO umbrella.    In 2013, the festival added an awards component, the TO DO Awards presented by Herman Miller, with jury and people's choice categories and the TO DO Festival opening party, a celebration of the launch of festival week. The juror's choice for "Best in Festival" that year went to Mason Studio for "Cloud Sourcing" , a design installation that consisted of cloud-like objects made from tissue paper creating a calming space.
