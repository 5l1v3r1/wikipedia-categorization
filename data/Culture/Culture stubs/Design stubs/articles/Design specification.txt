A design specification is a detailed document providing information about a designed product or process. For example, the design specification must include all necessary drawings, dimensions, environmental factors, ergonomic factors, aesthetic factors, maintenance that will be needed, etc. It may also give specific examples of how the design should be executed, helping others work properly (a guideline for what the person should do).
