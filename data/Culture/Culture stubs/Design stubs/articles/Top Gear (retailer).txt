Top Gear was a boutique established in the 1960s by James Wedge and Pat Booth on the Kings Road, London.  It was an influential shop which Barbara Hulanicki was "most envious of",  and acquired a reputation for selling Mod clothing to the "rich and influential".  Customers included Marianne Faithfull, Mick Jagger and The Beatles.  The carrier bags had a distinctive bullseye design â€“ which became a popular Mod icon used by The Who.
