An experience model is a description of a typical userâ€™s perception or understanding of how a system works.  Experience models are visually represented by abstract diagrams or metaphors drawn from familiar objects, behaviors or systems. User interfaces implement a variety of experience models to enable users to quickly grasp what is happening in the system, where the user is, and what the user can do next. A software experience model may represent the relationship of one application to another, an application in relationship to various navigation mechanisms and other system or application components.
