The concept of the "Greenpeace Design Awards" was originally developed by Gjoko Muratovski in conjunction with Greenpeace Australia Pacific, and managed together with Greenpeace International, School of Art, Architecture and Design (University of South Australia), UniLife Inc, and the Kerry Packer Civic Gallery. The international poster design competition was launched on 1 March 2009, and within months attracted the participation of over 1500 creatives from 77 countries.   The Awards are an extension of the Greenpeace ‘brand’ and they have established a new link between Greenpeace and the global creative community. The Awards had an international judging panel that consisted of wide range of industry professionals and academics. The iconic "Ape Guevara" poster for the "Greenpeace Design Awards" was designed by the Greenpeace Design Awards Director - Gjoko Muratovski.  The Greenpeace Design Awards were established in Australia in November 2008, in recognition of the role visual communication has played in Greenpeace's non-violent direct action.  The awards "acknowledge the achievements of the most innovative and creative individuals whose work best reflects environmental concerns in a visually striking and iconic way". The theme of the competition was "Be a part of the action".  Entrants to the awards had the opportunity for their work to be considered for use in major Greenpeace Australia Pacific campaigns in a variety of media including campaign posters, T-shirts, banners, flyers or other media.  The judging panel for the awards was made up of creative professionals working in the fields of graphic design, illustration, photography and visual communication. Oscar Soria and other Greenpeace representatives were also on the judging panel.  Award categories were divided into Shortlisted, Highly Commended and Winners.
