In terms of knowledge representation, a living graph (also referred to as a "lifeline", "living timeline"  or "fortune line". ) is a graph similar to a chronology timeline which places events along a vertical axis to reflect changes over time. The vertical axis can be used to represent many factors, such as relative importance, degrees of success/failure, danger/safety or happiness/sadness. In this sense they have been described as being "timelines with attitude".
