MetaLab is an interface design firm located in Victoria, British Columbia.  Their clients include Google, Disney, CBS, other Fortune 500 businesses, as well as startups such as Slack. It is the owner of Ballpark, an online invoicing platform, and Flow, a task management solution for teams. MetaLab also founded Pixel Union, which is a theme supplier for platforms including Tumblr, Shopify, and WordPress. The company, founded in 2006 by Andrew Wilkinson, has received praise on numerous design blogs, including Best Web Gallery.  In March 2010, Andrew Wilkinson (MetaLab founder) wrote a blog post claiming that Mozilla "literally copied images straight off of our site" for use in the design of their FlightDeck editor.   The story, which was picked up by TechCrunch,  caused Mozilla to tell Wilkinson that "[the] design which used [MetaLab's] siteâ€™s design elements was a development build and according to [Mozilla] the design has been changed in newer builds." Wilkinson then requested a public apology.
