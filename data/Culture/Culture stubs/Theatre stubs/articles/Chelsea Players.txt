CP Theatre Productions was a London-based theatre production company. It was a registered charity and had been in continual existence since the 1960s, until 2010. It was formerly known as Chelsea Players and was the resident company at the Chelsea Theatre on the Kings Road for 25 years until 2001. It performed everything from staples such as Shakespeare and NoÃ«l Coward to more contemporary theatre during the latter years, including Trainspotting, Mark Ravenhill's Some Explicit Polaroids and Patrick Marber's Closer. The company produced up to six shows each year in London theatres including the Barons Court Theatre, Landor Theatre, the White Bear Theatre, Old Red Lion Theatre and Putney Arts Theatre.  It staged work at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe since 2003, including the European premiere of Australian comedy Milo's Wake, written by Majery and Michael Forde and the London version was directed by Jane Hammond.  New writing productions, including premieres of plays by Lindy Henny, Michael Hubbard and Claire Simpson, were staged in London and Edinburgh.
