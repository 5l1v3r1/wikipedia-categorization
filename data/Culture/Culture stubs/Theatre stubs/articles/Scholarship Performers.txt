The Scholarship Performers are a theater group in Rhode Island, United States that is dedicated to providing scholarships in the Burrillville area of the state. These scholarships are given in memory of Nicholas O'Neill, who died at the age of 18 in The Station nightclub fire. He was the youngest victim. The Nicky O' Fund celebrates Nick's life as a talented musician, playwright, performer, and songwriter. The fund is devoted to awarding annual scholarships to graduating high school seniors, to encourage young adults to pursue their music and performing arts dreams. The Scholarship Performers started out as an afternoon discussion and has since become a union of talented adults and young adults who share the common goal of promoting the arts and raising college scholarship funds. Currently, only the Burrillville area receives scholarships from this group; however, there are hopes that these scholarships will spread to other towns in the state of Rhode Island. The Encore Repertory Company in Woonsocket, Rhode Island has a Nicky O Scholarship Fund as well.
