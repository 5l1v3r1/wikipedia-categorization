Walter Plinge is a pseudonym, traditionally used in London theatres when a part has not been cast, an actor is playing two parts, or an actor does not want his or her name in the programme. It has been claimed that Plinge was a real London publican, honoured by a group of actors with the borrowing of his name. However, there are no birth records of anyone with the surname Plinge in England or Wales since 1837.  The name has also been used occasionally in American theatre, as has the more popular George Spelvin.   Similar pseudonyms are David Agnew at the BBC and Alan Smithee in Hollywood. A Sir Walter Plinge is also the resident ghost of Imperial College Union's Concert Hall, and is regularly thanked in programmes by the ICU Dramatic Society (DramSoc) for watching over them.
