Commonwealth Shakespeare Company (CSC) was formed in 1996 by artistic director Steven Maler and associate Joan Moynagh to bring free, outdoor Shakespeare to the people of the city of Boston.  Since 1996, CSC has produced one full Shakespeare production each summer starting with A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1996 at Copley Square.  All subsequent productions have taken place in Boston Common, first at the Parkman Bandstand and now at the Parade Ground.  In addition to the annual Boston Common productions, CSC presents several free play-reading events during the year: Theatre in the Rough, Shakespeare and Law, as well as Shakespeare and Leadership. CSC has actor-training programs for both high school students and pre-professional actors with its Summer Academy. Throughout the year, CSC partners with area high schools and Boys & Girls Clubs to provide in and after-school theater activities to inner-city youth. In 2013, CSC became the theatre in residence at Babson College. Shakespeare at Fenway (2014) - the first live theatre at Fenway Park featuring local and national actors  Happy Days (2014) - starring Brooke Adams and Tony Shalhoub Our American Hamlet (2017) The CSC Apprentice Program is an intensive summer training program for young professionals who are pursuing a career in theatre. Apprentices are given understudy roles for mainstage productions, plus their own production of one of Shakespeare's plays.
