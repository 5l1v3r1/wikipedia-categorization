Interactive street theatre is a combination of street theatre and interactive art. There are different kinds of interactive street theatre. The biggest difference between “normal interactive art” and "interactive street theatre" is that the presentation.  The presentation of is always outside in a public place and most of the time on a festival. The audience are people how just walk by and stop and participate. You can participate but if you don’t want you can just watch. It is temporary, only a few hours. And it is easier to participate than in a gallery or a museum. People who might not have ever to a theatre or museum can now participate in an interactive street theatre. Some interactive art installations visitor can "walk" in, on, and around them. And to “play” with the object of the installations. Another form is that spectators themselves become part of the artwork. And a third option is that spectator become active and work to gather to great a collective art piece.
