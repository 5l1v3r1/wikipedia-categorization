The Junction Theatre Company was South Australia’s first professional community theatre company, founded in 1984.  Junction Theatre Company created touring works in schools, factories and other workplaces, with an aim to “create theatre of a high artistic quality which is accessible to those sections of the community who have not traditionally participated in theatre as an accessible option for entertainment, learning and expressing issues”   In its early days Junction Theatre was one of the country's main proponents of work supported by the program of funding Art and Working Life,  along with companies such as Melbourne Workers Theatre in Victoria. The Art and Working Life funding program supported projects created in partnership with Trade Unions. Through the use of its own venue, it also became known as having an important role in facilitating the work of smaller companies in South Australia   Junction Theatre Company’s first Artistic Director was Malcolm Blaylock.  The subsequent and artistic director was Geoff Crowhurst, who was in the role until the closure of the company in 2001. Geoff Crowhurst was considered “A master of making theatre work for the good of whole communities”,   and had an Arts South Australia Ruby Award category posthumously named in his honour for individuals who make "an outstanding contribution to community cultural development”   Productions by Junction Theater Company include:
