 A peanut gallery was, in the days of vaudeville, a nickname for the cheapest and ostensibly rowdiest seats in the theater, the occupants of which were often known to heckle the performers.  The least expensive snack served at the theatre would often be peanuts, which the patrons would sometimes throw at the performers on stage to convey their disapproval.  Phrases such as "no comments from the peanut gallery" or "quiet in the peanut gallery" are extensions of the name.  In 1943 the Howdy Doody children's radio show adopted the name for its live audience of children.   Howdy Doody is most remembered for its later transition to television, which continued the Peanut Gallery audience, now on camera. In recent times, the term has taken on new meanings with the advent of social networks and online chat rooms. "Peanut gallery" may also refer to the stream of open comments visible on certain types of blogs.  A similar term was introduced to Brazilian football by coach Luis Felipe Scolari. He called Palmeiras' complaining audience that sat in the closest seats "Turma do Amendoim" ("peanut gang").
