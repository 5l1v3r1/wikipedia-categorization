A loading bay is a room in a theatre which is usually quite large. It generally has a bay door (a large metal door which rolls up, at least the size of the opening on a standard semi-trailer) at opposite sides of the room, one for a truck and the other for access to the stage.  Sometimes sets and equipment for a traveling show are delivered through a bay, other times, the bay could be used for delivery of supplies and lumber for set construction. In a smaller theaters, the bay may serve as a theater, green room, or scene shop. In most union work, teamsters and grips who unload trucks and move equipment are different from the carpenters, electricians, and other stagehands who assemble a show. By Union rules, generally teamsters are not permitted to work on the actual performance, and the stagehands are not allowed to even enter trucks. This exists primarily because loading and unloading trailers is one of the most dangerous jobs in theatre and performance.
