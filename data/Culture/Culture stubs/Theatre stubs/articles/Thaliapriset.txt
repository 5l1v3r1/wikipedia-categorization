Thaliapriset (Svenska Dagbladets Thaliapris) or The Thalia Award is regarded to be one of Sweden's finest theatre awards  (together with the Eugene O'Neill Award and The Gunn WÃ¥llgren Award) and is given each year to an actor, director or a theatre personality of the stage.  It was instituted, and is handed out since 1951, by the daily Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet (one of Sweden's biggest daily newspapers). Throughout the years, some of the greatest stage actors have received the award.
