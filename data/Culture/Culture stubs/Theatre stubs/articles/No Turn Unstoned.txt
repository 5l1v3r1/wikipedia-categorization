No Turn Unstoned is a collection of "the worst theatrical reviews in history" compiled by the actress Dame Diana Rigg. The first edition, published by Elm Tree Books in 1982, did not sell well, but over the years it attained a near-cult status and a paperback edition was released in 1991. Rigg wrote to her many friends and acquaintances in the theatre and film industries and asked them to share their worst-ever reviews. She also researched theatre criticism and surviving comments from as far back as Ancient Greece. During the early 1990s, Dame Diana toured university campuses, reading excerpts from the book. All of the proceeds from the speaking tour, and the book itself, were donated to a theatrical charity.
