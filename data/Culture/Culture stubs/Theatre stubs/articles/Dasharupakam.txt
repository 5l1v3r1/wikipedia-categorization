Dasharupakam (Daśarūpakam) is a treatise on Sanskrit dramaturgy, written by Dhananjaya in the 10th century AD. The author is indebted to Bharata’s Natyashastra. The Dasharupakam comprises four chapters, termed as Aloka.  Dasharupakam's main contribution to Sanskrit dramaturgy is a detailed analysis of the different types of heroines (Nayikabheda), and a critical delineation of erotic sentiment (Shringara Rasa).  The writer has confined himself to a deep understanding of the ten types of Sanskrit dramas based upon the elements of Vastu (plot), Neta (heroes/heroines), and Rasa (the emotive aspect of plays). The influence of Dasharupakam is very evident on later Sanskrit dramaturgists . The most famous commentary on the work, known as Avaloka, was written by Dhanika, a younger brother of the author.
