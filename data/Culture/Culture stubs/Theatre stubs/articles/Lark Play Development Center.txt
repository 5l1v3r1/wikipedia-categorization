The Lark Play Development Center is a non-profit organization that seeks to help playwrights improve and produce their plays. Headquartered in Manhattan, New York, they function in countries throughout the world. The Center was founded in 1994 with the stated mission of "discover(ing) and develop(ing) new voices for the American theater."  John Clinton Eisner, a founding member, continues to serve as the organization's leader. Originally, the company presented plays in full production at various New York venues such as Theatre Row and Manhattan Class Company, but it soon located itself at Chelsea Playhouse, sharing space with three other non-profits.  Recently, they moved into their own space at 311 West 43rd Street in Manhattan.  Initially, the Lark Play Development Center produced plays that were classical as well as original, including Shakespeare, and sent Theater for Young Audiences tours to nearby schools. In 1997, John Clinton Eisner reassessed the Lark Play Development Center's methods and practices for supporting new plays making several changes that would significantly alter the companyâ€™s operations, transforming the organization. Today, the company no longer produces classic works or tours in schools, focusing instead on supporting playwrights as they develop their works.  The Center has received a variety of recognition. The Center's blog has received the Aristos Award  and the Center has received a Mellon grant, a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Body of Work and an Obie Award.  Over the past 3 years over 100 plays developed by the Lark Play Development Center went on to 122 presentations around the world.  This year, the Lark was written up by Playbill.com,  The Brooklyn Rail,  Broadway.com,  Variety,  the Wall Street Journal,  and the Moscow Times
