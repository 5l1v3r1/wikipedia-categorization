The Scottish Theatre Forum is a website dedicated to the performing arts in Scotland and designed for use by anyone interested in amateur or professional theatre in the country. It was founded in February 2006  and is owned by Mark Grieve. The forum and its members have been involved in charity work, including organising a production of We Will Rock You in 2007 to raise money for Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children,  and helping with the fundraising appeal for Dunfermline's Alhambra Theatre.
