Isabella is a stock character used in commedia dell'arte, in the class of innamorata (female lover).  She is generally portrayed as headstrong, sensuous, and articulate. She is typically depicted as Pantalone's daughter and he often tries to control her life by arranging meetings with inappropriate overaged gentlemen suitors. Men constantly fall hopelessly in love with her. She is frequently the innamorata of the play. She is typically a prima donna. She is also known as an amore, as is her male co-star. Most of the commedia dell'arte plays are about getting the lovers Fabrizio and Isabella together. Both are of wealthy upbringings and high class, generally of Tuscan descent. Both innamorati are more in love with the idea of love than each other, as well as with themselves, but, by the end of the play, are united either by being able to express their true feelings for one another or joining in marriage.  Isabella is named in honor of the actress and poet Isabella Andreini who played the character with the commedia troupe I Gelosi. Poses: 1.
