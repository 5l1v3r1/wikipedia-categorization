In theatre, methexis (Ancient Greek: μέθεξις; also methectics), is "group sharing". Originating from Greek theatre, the audience participates, creates and improvises the action of the ritual. In philosophy, methexis is the relation between a particular and a form (in Plato's sense), e.g. a beautiful object is said to partake of the form of beauty.
