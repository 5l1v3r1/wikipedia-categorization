The Australian Performing Group (APG) was a Melbourne-based experimental theatre repertory ensemble formed in an official capacity in  1970 from the La Mama theatre group. Created from a dissatisfaction with Australia's theatrical climate, the APG focused primarily on producing new works from then emerging Australian writers such as Barry Oakley, Jack Hibberd, Kris Hemensley, Bill Garner, John Romeril, Steve J. Spears and David Williamson.
