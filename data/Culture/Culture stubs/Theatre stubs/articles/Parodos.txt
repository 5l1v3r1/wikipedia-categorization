Parodos  (also parode and parodus; Ancient Greek: πάροδος, "entrance," plural parodoi), in the theater of ancient Greece, is either a side-entrance, or the first song sung by the chorus after its entrance from the side wings. The parodos is an entrance affording access either to the stage (for actors) or to the orchestra (for the chorus) of the ancient Greek theater. The parodoi are distinguished from the entrances to the stage from the skene, or stage building. The two parodoi are located on either side of the stage, between it and the theatron, or audience seating area. The term eisodos is also used. A "parodos" is also the ode sung by the chorus as it enters the orchestra. Usually the first choral song of the drama, the parodos typically follows the play's prologue.  In trench construction The banked earth on the rear lip of the trench was called the parados, which protected the soldier's back from shells falling behind the trench.
