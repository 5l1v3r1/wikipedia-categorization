An oshiguma is an impression of the kumadori (face make-up) of kabuki actors on a piece of cloth, usually silk or cotton, created as an artwork and memento. Oshigumas are customarily made after the performance of a kabuki play, though not necessarily after every performance, and given as highly valued souvenirs of the event.  A single oshiguma may have face-impressions from one or several actors, usually all from the same show, illustrating the make-up designs for major characters in the play.  It may also include autographs, dates and additional inscriptions; sometimes other graphic elements are added to the design. The same term can also be used to describe an artistic depiction of kabuki make-up created by other means, but intended to emulate the appearance of a face-print.
