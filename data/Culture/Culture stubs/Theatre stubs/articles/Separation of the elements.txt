Separation of the elements is an aesthetic principle formulated by the German modernist theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht. The principle bears primarily on the theatrical register, though it has implications for the dramatic and performative as well. The principle of the "separation of the elements" stands in diametric opposition to that of the "integrated work of art" proposed by Wagner.
