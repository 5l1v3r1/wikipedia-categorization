The Corcadorca Theatre Company is an independent theatre company which was founded in Cork, Ireland in 1991. The company has sought to develop new writing through its biennial Corcadorca Playwright Award, and by commissioning new work from more established writers (including, for example, Disco Pigs by Enda Walsh, and Bruen's Twist by Eamonn Sweeney). The company has also served as a development base for a number of actors, including Cillian Murphy (Disco Pigs, Batman Begins, Girl with a Pearl Earring). The name of the company is from the Irish Corca Dhorcha, or "dark" Corca, a play on words of Corca Dhuibhne, the Dingle Peninsula, portrayed (jokingly) as a backward area of country bumpkins in Brian Ó Nualláin's An Béal Bocht.
