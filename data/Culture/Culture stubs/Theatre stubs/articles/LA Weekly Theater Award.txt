LA Weekly Theater Award was an annual critics' award system established in 1979, organized by the LA Weekly for outstanding achievements in small theatre productions in Southern California.   Nominees were typically announced in January for Equity 99-seat productions from the previous year, with awards handed out in March or April. The 35th annual awards ceremony was held in April 2014.   In December 2014, the LA Weekly announced that it was discontinuing the awards, citing the publication's desire to focus on events that would promote its profitability.
