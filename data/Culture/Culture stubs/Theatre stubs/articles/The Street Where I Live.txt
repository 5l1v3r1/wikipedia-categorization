The Street Where I Live is a non-fiction work by Alan Jay Lerner. In it, he describes the genesis of three of his most famous musicals: Gigi, My Fair Lady and Camelot.  It is auto-biographical, but not strictly speaking an autobiography as he mentions his seven marriages only briefly, and refers to his other works only in passing.  Lerner was generous to his collaborators, except for Stanley Donen, who directed the film version of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's story The Little Prince, and treated the music score with what Lerner felt was contempt.  Lerner also expresses dissatisfaction with rock music, which he considered "a belch".
