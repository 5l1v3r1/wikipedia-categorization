Saturday's Voyeur is an annual musical satire produced by Salt Lake Acting Company. Each year a new show is written to parody contemporary life, politics, and religion in Utah. Saturday’s Voyeur was created in 1978 by Nancy Borgenicht and Allen Nevins, who continue to co-write the show each year. The name Saturday’s Voyeur is itself a parody of the Mormon production Saturday’s Warrior, by Lex de Azevedo. With Mormonism being prevalent in Utah culture it often becomes a dominant topic in the annual production. Poking fun at the doctrine, customs, and church figures of the Mormon religion through musical satire is used as comic relief for non-Mormons and Mormons alike.  Saturday's Voyeur is considered SLAC's annual fundraiser and the theater is converted to cabaret style, where patrons are permitted to bring their own food and beverages.
