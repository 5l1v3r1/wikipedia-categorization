Puppetry of the Penis is a performance show. The show was initially conceived as the title of an art calendar by Australian Simon Morley, showcasing 12 of his favourite penis installations (known as Dick Tricks). On New Year's Eve in 1997 he had a garage full of calendars to sell, and with requests for live demonstrations mounting he finally decided to create an act with fellow Aussie David "Friendy" Friend. The theatrical contortion of the male genitalia (penis, scrotum, and testicles) into various positions along with comedic narration has since spread internationally. It is humorously called "Dick Trick" or "genital origami," referring to the flexibility of the human penis, testicles and scrotum. The act was first performed on the international stage at the 1998 Melbourne International Comedy Festival in Australia. The show involves two nude men who bend, twist, and fold their penises and scrotums into various shapes. The show has appeared in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Europe, Canada, the U.S., South Africa and Argentina. It has also been the subject of Australian comedian Mick Molloy's 2000 documentary Tackle Happy. The duo has recruited teams across Australia, the UK and America, allowing performance demands to be met. Due to the overwhelming success of the show the business was expanded to cater for private parties around Australia. A Puppetry of the Penis TV special has aired in Australia on One.  Their tricks include: In 2002 the show was banned by Wanganui in New Zealand, and Cairns and Bundaberg councils in Queensland.   In 2004, Chicago Citizens for Community filed a complaint saying that the play was illegal, but Chicago Police refused to ban it.  In 2012, the Advertising Standards Bureau received a complaint about a poster advertising the show in Brisbane.
