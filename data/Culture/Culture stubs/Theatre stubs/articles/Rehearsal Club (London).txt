  The Rehearsal Club was a London club providing support to actresses, ballet dancers and music hall chorus girls. The club provided a space to rest, read, eat and socialize between morning and evening performances.  It was founded in 1892 by the Rev. John Fenwick Kitto, vicar of St Martin in the Fields,  with the support of Prince Christian, who became the club's President.  It seems to have been based at different times at 29 Leicester Square  and at Cranbourne Street.
