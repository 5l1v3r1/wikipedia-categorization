The Hollow Crown is an anthology, devised by John Barton in 1961, which presents in dramatic form, speeches, documents, gossip and music, associated with the British monarchy from William the Conqueror up to Queen Victoria.  A videotape of a broadcast can be seen at The Paley Center for Media in New York City. The work has also been produced for the stage several times. According to Ian Richardson "every member of the Royal Shakespeare Company - present, past, or passed-on - has participated in it at one time or another". In 2002 Richardson joined Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir Donald Sinden and Dame Diana Rigg in an international tour   visiting Wellington, New Zealand, Sydney, Melbourne, Australia, returning to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. A Canadian tour in 2004 substituted Alan Howard for Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave for Rigg.
