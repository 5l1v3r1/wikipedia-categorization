The Jon Sims Center for the Performing Arts (JSCPA) was a multidisciplinary performing arts center in San Francisco, California that supported artistic voices of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities.  The Center provided resources to support and promote new and existing arts programs.  JSCPA was the "official" home to many groups, including City Swing with Gail Wilson, the original award-winning Vocal Minority (one of the nation's first openly LGBT mixed jazz/popular vocal ensembles), the Fakir Intensives Body Piercing Seminars and the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus (prior to the formation of a competing organization, Golden Gate Performing Arts, Inc. and the SFGMC defection from The Center.) At its height, the resources JSPCA provided artists included four performance spaces/rehearsal studios as well as funding for at least one artist-in-residence annually. The Center opened in 1978 following the formation of the Gay Freedom Day Marching Band and Twirling Corps (now the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band.  Founder Jon R. Sims, who died of AIDS in 1984, also began the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus.  The Center closed in November 2006 following a financial crisis that included the disappearance of $35,000 in grant money.  Longer term problems included the lack of a stable, long-term board and executive director, despite determined efforts to keep the institution alive.   The Sims Center was located at 1519 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. Beeler, P. Heidi. "About Us: History". Jon Sims Center for the Performing Arts.
