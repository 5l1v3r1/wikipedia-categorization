UK Theatre (formerly the Theatrical Management Association) was founded in 1894 as the Theatrical Managers Association, with Sir Henry Irving as its first president.  There are however records of the activity of a Theatrical Managers Association going back to at least 1866.    Irving was still president in 1901.  UK Theatre is the UKâ€™s association for companies and organisations involved professionally in the production and presentation of the performing arts. The association has presented the TMA Awards annually since 1991.
