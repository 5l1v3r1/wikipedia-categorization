The Millennium Dome Show was a multimedia, Cirque du Soleil-esque show created specifically for the year 2000 in the Millennium Dome. The show was directed by Mark Fisher and Peter Gabriel.    Mark Fisher designed the show and Peter Gabriel wrote the music, available in the album OVO. Micha Bergese was the Artistic Director. The Romeo-and-Juliet-like story told of a feud between the earth-people and the sky-people.  A young boy from the sky and a young girl from the earth fell in love, but the feud between their people made it difficult for them to meet.  Eventually the earth-people suffered a crushing defeat, which ultimately led them to unite with their sky enemies.  At the end of the show, the lovers flew together into a better future. The show opened on 1 January 2000 and was performed 999 times before closing on 31 December of that year.
