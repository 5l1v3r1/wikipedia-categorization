The Swedish Section of International Association of Theatre Critics (in Swedish: Svenska teaterkritikers förening, in French: L'association Suédois des Critiques d'Art Dramatique) is a member association of Sweden's working professional theatre critics since the 1950s. The association is part of the international organization AITC-IACT (The International Association of Theatre Critics). Each year the association also hands out a number of awards to favourites within the work of the performing arts of the stage, including the prestigious Swedish Theatre Critics' Award (given to an actor or director of the stage or to a specific theatre and/or ensemble), a Children and Youth Theatre Award (since 1985) and since 2004 also a Dance Award.
