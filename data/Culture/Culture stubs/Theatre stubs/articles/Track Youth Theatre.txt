  Track Youth Theatre is an amateur youth theatre group, based in Boroondara, Victoria, Australia. The group was founded by Ed Bailey, who directed the productions from 1980-2013 and plays piano as part of the band still. Directors since 2013 have been Melissa Dioguardi and Sophie Jevons. The 2016 production marked the group's 50th production. Apart from, The Hobbit, in 1981 and "Superheroes" by Peter Sala, all plays have been written by Ed Bailey.  The most recent Track Youth Theatre production is showing on September 1st and 2nd, 2017. 'Superheroes' was written by Peter Sala and directed by Sophie Jevons. This is the second time in Track Youth's history it will be performed but with some updated script edits. Track Youth Theatre originated from the amateur theatre group Toorak Players in 1980, as the Toorak Players Children's Workshop. Its first performance was a production of Sleeping Beauty, which they performed at the Pumpkin Theatre in Richmond. Due to the growing size of the group, the following year it performed at Kew High School's Renaissance Theatre, where it has performed ever since.  The latest production to be commissioned by Track Youth Theatre is an adaptation of 'Don Quixote' by Melbourne playwright, Hayley Lawson-Smith, due for performance in 2018, with original songs by Ed Bailey. Stephen Curry, an Australian comedian and actor, attributes his career path to the group - "The moment I commenced with the group in 1985, I knew I would never be the same."
