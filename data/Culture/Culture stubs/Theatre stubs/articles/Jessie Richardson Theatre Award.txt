The Jessie Richardson Theatre Award (commonly known as the Jessie Awards) is given to recognize achievement in professional theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia.     The Jessies are presented by the Jessie Richardson Theatre Award Society, at an annual ceremony.  The awards are named after Jessie Richardson, co-founder of the Playhouse Holiday Theatre, local actor, director and designer.    The rules for the Jessie Awards are set forth by the Jessie Review Committee each year, which applies for each season only.
