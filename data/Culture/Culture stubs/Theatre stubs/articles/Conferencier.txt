Conférencier is the proper term[neutrality is disputed] for the master of ceremonies appearing in European cabaret.  The term appeared in the 1920s and became synonymous with these persona who not only emceed cabarets, but were well known for their political and social commentary.  They became controversial in the eye of the Nazi regime, who eventually cracked down and banned such commentary, keeping a watchful eye over these conférenciers.   Their role was dramaticized in the well-known musical Cabaret, by composers Kander and Ebb.  However, their role in the art of the Weimar Republic and elsewhere in Europe during the inter-war period should not be underestimated.[neutrality is disputed]
