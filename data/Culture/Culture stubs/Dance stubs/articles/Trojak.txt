Trojak ("threesome", "trio", in Polish) is a Silesian folk dance. It is a double partner dance and performed in groups of three: one male dancer and two female dancers. The music of the dance has two parts: a slow one in 34 metre and a fast one in 24 metre. These parts are repeated several times, one after another. Ignoring the footwork, the figures may have the following arrangements.
