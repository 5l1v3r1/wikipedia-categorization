The Gay Gordons is a popular dance at c√®ilidhs and other kinds of informal and social dance in Scotland. It is an "old-time" dance, of a type popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in which every couple dances the same steps, usually in a circle around the room. The name alludes to a Scottish regiment, the Gordon Highlanders. In " Old Time Dancing" published in 1949 Englishman Victor Silvester states that "The Gay Gordons" was created between WWI and WWII and was part of a wider craze for march-style dances (such as the Dinkey One Step) . In an article published in the Folk Dance Problem Solver historian Ron Houston failed to trace an earlier reference to this dance  .  A standard ceilidh instruction: Repeat ad lib. In order to make the dance progressive, the ladies may leave their partners between bars 12-13 and move to the partner before them in the circle.  For Scottish country dancers, the grip in the first eight bars is allemande hold. A live demonstration was performed by the Royal Scottish Country Dancing Society  in 2007.
