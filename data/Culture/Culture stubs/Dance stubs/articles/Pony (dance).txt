The Pony was a dance made popular in the 1960s by the Chubby Checker song "Pony Time".  The beat is 1&2, 3&4, etc. In the dance the feet are kept comfortably together, while various arm and hand motions are possible. Movement around the dance floor may occur, but there is no line-of-dance. Couples, who generally face each other, do not touch  and turns and chase positions are possible. The Pony is mentioned in the Wilson Pickett song "Land of a Thousand Dances", in the Nick Lowe song "I Knew the Bride" and in The Go-Go's song "We Got the Beat." Cindy Wilson of The B-52's can be seen performing the Pony in the video for their 1980 song, "Give Me Back My Man", as well as in other films of the band performing between 1978 and 1980 (including their 1980 appearance on Saturday Night Live). The band completed the period effect by wearing early 60s-style outfits and hairstyles.
