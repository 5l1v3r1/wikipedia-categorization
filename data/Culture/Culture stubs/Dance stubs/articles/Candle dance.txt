The candle dance (Malay: Tarian Lilin, Indonesian: Tari Lilin) is a dance performed by a group of dancers to the accompaniment of a group of musicians. The dancers carry lit candles on plates held on the palm of each hand. The dancers dance in groups, rotating the plates carefully so that the plate is always horizontal, and the candles are not extinguished.  The dance is said to have originated in Sumatra.
