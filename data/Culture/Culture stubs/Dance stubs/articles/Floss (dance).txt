 The floss or flossing is a dance move in which a person repeatedly swings their arms, with clenched fists, from the back of their body to the front, on each side.   Media outlets have commented that the dance is harder to perform than it appears.  The name comes from the moves themselves, which involve "a lot of fast arm and hip swings, as though using a huge, invisible piece of dental floss".  Videos of the dance on social media became viral after Russell Horning  performed it during a Saturday Night Live live performance of Katy Perry's song "Swish Swish", in April 2018.  It has since become a trend among children and teens, and has been performed by celebrities in videos.   Flossing is featured in the 2017 video game, Fortnite, as a dance that can be performed by the characters while playing.
