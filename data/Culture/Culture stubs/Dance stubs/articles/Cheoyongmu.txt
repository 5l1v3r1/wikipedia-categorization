Cheoyongmu is a representative Korean mask dance based on the legend of Cheoyeong (처용, 處容), a son of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.  It is also the oldest surviving Korean court dance created during the Unified Silla period. Cheoyongmu also has been considered as a shamanistic dance because it was performed to drive off evil spirits at the end of the year.
