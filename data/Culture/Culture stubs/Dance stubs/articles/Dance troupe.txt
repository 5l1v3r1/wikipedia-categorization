A dance troupe or dance company is a group of dancers and associated personnel who work together to perform dances as a spectacle or entertainment. There are many different types of dance companies, often working in different styles of dance. In small companies several of these functions will be carried out by the same person without explicit job titles, while a ballet company, for example, is often larger and has a more defined set up.
