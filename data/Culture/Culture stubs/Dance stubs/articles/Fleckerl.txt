A fleckerl (Viennese German 'small spot') is a dance step, most commonly found in the Viennese Waltz.  Unlike the natural and reverse turns, the fleckerl does not move forwards along the dance floor but instead rotates on the spot.  Fleckerls can be danced clockwise or counter-clockwise (natural or reverse), and the basic shape lasts for six steps (two three-note bars).  When danced counter-clockwise, the leader crosses his left foot over his right for the first two pairs, and then crosses behind on the third. It is normal for a couple to move to the centre of the dancefloor to dance fleckerls, since this means that other dancers (who, in the Viennese Waltz, are continually moving around the floor at high speed) do not have to make avoiding maneuvres.
