Yove male mome (Bulgarian: Йове мале моме; Jove male mome, Jove malaj mome, "Jova, little girl"), also called Povela e Yova (Повела е Йова), is a fast Bulgarian folk dance. It is done to a 7+1116 = 1816 compound meter with alternating (sub-)bars of 7+11, in their turn divided into common chetvorno and kopanitsa rhythms. Some dancers count it as 3-2-2, 2-2-3-2-2 or SQQ-QQSQQ, "S" meaning "slow", and "Q" meaning "quick". It originates from the traditional dance Jove from the Sopluk region of Bulgaria. Yove male mome is a complicated line dance performed in a curved line or open circle, with each dancer holding their neighbors by the belt. Dancers may also hold hands if belts are not available.  One common version has 5 patterns of 4 bars each.  Musical renditions of the song often feature the traditional Bulgarian gaida. The dance is popular among international folk dancers around the world. Its choreography was first introduced outside of Bulgaria by US folkdance instructor Dennis Boxell in Stockton, California, 1966.
