Flash dancing was a form of tap dance (tap was also called jazz dance at the time) that evolved in the 1920s–1930s, which combined dance with acrobatics.   Prominent flash dance crews of the time include the Nicholas Brothers, The Four Step Brothers and the Berry Brothers.  During the 1920s–1930s many films and TV shows were released featuring the style.
