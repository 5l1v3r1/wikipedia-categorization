The bump is a type of dance introduced in 1970s. Two partners, generally one male and one female, bump their hips against each other to the beat of the song. Sometimes the dance can be more suggestive, with the female dancer bumping her hip against the male dancer's crotch area. For this reason, the bump is often believed to be the precursor to the erotic dance grinding.
