Motif description is the term that has been used for a form of dance notation; however, the current preferred terminology is Motif Notation.  It is a subset and reconception of Labanotation sharing a common lexis. The main difference between the two forms is the type of information they record. Motif description was created by Ann Hutchinson-Guest as a way to notate and record the essence of a movement sequence without the rigidity of Labanotation.   Many (though not all) of the symbols are the same though the structure and grammar are slightly different. Motif description is often used as an alternative to Labanotation when information needs to be written down quickly.
