Release technique is a movement practice that focuses on breathing, skeletal alignment, joint articulation, muscle relaxation, and the use of gravity and momentum to facilitate efficient movement. Release techniques can be found in modern and postmodern dance, in therapeutic movement techniques such as Feldenkrais and Alexander Technique, and in yoga and martial arts.
