Pas de Basques and Highcuts is one of the first dances taught in Highland Dance. This dance is similar to the first step of the Sword Dance, but is danced to the front, without the use of swords. It is usually taught to young dancers who are not yet prepared to learn the entire Sword Dance.  Pas de Basques and Highcuts are only competed in by primary dancers. This is the first competition level for young dancers. This dance is also performed for first level examinations. Dancers wear the standard Kilt outfit to perform this dance.
