 The Progressive Double Two is a type of country and western dance popularized in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. It typically consists of 6- and 8-count dance patterns. The basic 6-beat pattern consists of two shuffle steps (counted as "1 and 2", "3 and 4") with the woman being led by an arching one quarter semicircle clockwise then counterclockwise followed by two walking steps (counted "5, 6").
