The Bankhead Bounce is a dance that originated in a neighborhood on the west side of Atlanta known as Bankhead.  The dance was popularized by a song of the same name, released in 1995 by rapper L. (Diamond) Atkins, featuring D-Roc and by the video for the song, "Benz or Beamer" by Outkast from the New Jersey Drive soundtrack in 1995. The dance was introduced to mainstream culture when it was performed by Michael Jackson at the 1995 MTV Music Video Awards. The dance is also performed by many of the performers towards the end of Patti Labelle's "When You Talk About Love" video, and in the video for TLC's Waterfalls.  The dance is performed by moving one's shoulders up and down with arms bent toward the chest.
