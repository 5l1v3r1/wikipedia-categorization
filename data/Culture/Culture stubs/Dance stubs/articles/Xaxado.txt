The xaxado (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʃaˈʃadu]) is a popular dance created in the Sertão of Pernambuco state, Brazil.  It was often practiced by cangaceiros of the region to commemorate victory in battle; it is also practiced as a traditional dance by the local population as a whole. The name xaxado comes from the noise made by the cangaceiros' sandals as they strike the sand during the dance.
