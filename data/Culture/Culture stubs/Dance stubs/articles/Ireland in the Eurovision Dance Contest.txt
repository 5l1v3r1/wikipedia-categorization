Ireland has taken part in two Eurovision Dance Contests. Its highest placed finish was third in 2007 and its lowest placed finish is eleventh was 2008. Like the Eurovision Song Contest, which Ireland has won a record seven times, Ireland decides upon its entry through a public vote on a special edition of The Late Late Show. Ireland made its debut at the 2007 contest. The couple representing the country was Nicola Byrne and Mick Donegan, performing Jive and Fandango dances. They were given the chance to represent their country after winning Celebrity Jigs 'n' Reels. Byrne and Donegan came third after receiving 95 points from all the other countries. The 2008 Irish representatives were Gavin Ã“ Fearraigh and Dearbhla Lennon, also from Celebrity Jigs 'n' Reels.  The couple were chosen on The Late Late Show in May 2008.  They finished in eleventh position at the contest in Glasgow, Scotland, on 6 September 2008.  The Third Eurovision Dance Contest has been cancelled indefinitely.
