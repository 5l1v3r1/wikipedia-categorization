Bobaraba is a national dance craze in Ivorian, South Africa and Mali inspired by DJ Mix and DJ Eloh's hit song Bobaraba, which means "big bottom" in the local Dyula language and in the Bambara language. -We made it as a tribute to women, because African women are defined by the shape of their bottomsIvorian footballers have adopted the moves and could be seen wiggling their bottoms in a curious on-pitch dance after each goal scored during the recent Africa Nations Cup. In search for the "big bottom", women are reportedly using "bottom enhancers" in the form of injections or cream at black markets. However, doctors have warned of the possible dangers of some of the concoctions on sale.
