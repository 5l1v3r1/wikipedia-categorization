   Bangarra Dance Theatre is an Indigenous Australian contemporary dance company.  It was founded in 1989 by South African woman Cheryl Stone and Carole Johnson, an African-American and founding director of National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA). Bangarra is the Wiradjuri word meaning "to make fire".  Stephen Page has been the artistic director since 1991. Bangarra's first full-length show Praying Mantis Dreaming was produced in 1992, and productions have followed annually since 2000. All have been successful within Australia and some have toured the United States and the United Kingdom. The group also made significant contributions to the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics. The company has received the Helpmann Award for Best Ballet or Dance Work multiple times.
