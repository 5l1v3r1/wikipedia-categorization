The cabbage patch dance is a dance involving putting the hands together in the form of fists and moving them in a horizontal, circular motion.    The Gucci Crew II had a song describing the dance,  as well as Dr. Dre and DJ Yella (of the rap group N.W.A.) in 1987.  The dance they made was featured in the song "The Cabbage Patch." It soon became very popular, showing up in many dance clubs in America. The dance's name is derived from the popular line of dolls "The Cabbage Patch Kids" or the use of "cabbage" as slang for paper money. There are many on-line videos showing how to do the dance.   The dance was originally celebratory and often associated with being super cool and rad.
