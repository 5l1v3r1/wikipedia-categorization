Noemi Lapzeson (28 June 1940, Buenos Aires, Argentina â€“ 11 January 2018, Geneva, Switzerland) was an Argentine dancer, choreographer and educator. She received a Guggenheim Fellowship for the field of choreography in 1999.   In 2002 Lapzeson was the first recipient of the Swiss Prize for Dance.  Lapzeson as a child began to study the dance method of Jacques Dalcroze (1865-1950).  When she was 14 her mother brought her to study with Ana Itelman.    She won a scholarship from the Juilliard School.  There she studied classical dance, but she returned to contemporary dance in order to study under American teacher Martha Graham. By the age of 19 she danced and was a teacher at Graham's dance company in New York. Lapzeson helped to create the London Contemporary Dance School in 1968.
