The Odzemek (in slovak Odzemok) is a Slovak solo traditional dance for men which always has an improvised character. It has a rather fast tempo and it is traditionally danced in Slovakia and also Moravian Wallachia. The name Odzemok comes from the words 'od zeme,' which means 'from the ground.' Composers such as Antonín Dvořák composed these dances. The first dance from the Slavonic Dances opus 72 is an odzemek.
