Teškoto or Teshkoto (Macedonian: Тешкото, "the hard one"), is a folk dance from western Macedonia, specifically from the Mijak ethnographic region. It is a war dance, with origins in antique history.  This folk dance has inspired many artists and poets (for example Blaze Koneski's poem Teškoto).  The famous Bulgarian singer Veselin Marinov has a song with the same name.
