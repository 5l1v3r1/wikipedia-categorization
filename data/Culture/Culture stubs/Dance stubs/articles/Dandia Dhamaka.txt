Dandia Dhamaka (dD) is an Indian Dandiya Raas dance competition.  In 2001, students from the University of Michigan created an organization called the RAAS Association to coordinate Dandia Dhamaka.  Dandia Dhamaka showcases the South Asian traditional dance form of raas, a traditional, yet expressive form of Indian folk dance involving wooden sticks called dandias, representing the swords of Durga. The dancers hit each other's sticks to the beat of the music.  The women wear traditional dresses such as colorful embroidered choli, ghagra and bandhani dupattas (traditional attire) that shine with mirror work and heavy jewellery. The men wear special turbans and kedias, but this varies regionally.  The 2013 competition was held on January 26, 2013 at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Dandia Dhamaka has held mixers on the Friday night that teams have arrived at the competition. These mixers allow teams to participate in team building activities so teams can interact with their own teams and their competing teams. Dandiya Raas
