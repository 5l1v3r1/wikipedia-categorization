CALLERLAB is the international association of modern Western square dance callers, and is the largest square dance association in the United States. After some initial work started in 1971, it was officially established in 1974 by several members of the Square Dance Hall of Fame.    Callers from all over the world, including Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, and England, are members of the organization.
