Step into Dance is an inclusive dance programme for secondary schools in London and Essex.    The programme is run by the  Royal Academy of Dance and funded by the Jack Petchey Foundation.   The programme began in 2007 after Jack Petchey approached the RAD with an idea to set up an extra-curricular dance programme for young people in London.  Initially targeting particular boroughs in London, Step into Dance launched with a pilot of 30 schools. In 2008 Sue Goodman joined as Artistic Director, bringing a focus on performance and high quality choreography. Since then the programme has grown year by year, with 200 schools participating in 2015/16.  The programme is one of the Jack Petchey Foundation's flagship projects, alongside several other major initiatives for young people that the organisation fund, including The Speak Out Challenge and The Achievement Awards.  As of July 2016 the Foundation had donated over 3 million pounds to the programme and over 30 thousand students have participated.  In March 2014, Step into Dance launched its Young Ambassador Scheme.
