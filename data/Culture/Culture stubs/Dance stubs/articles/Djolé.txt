Djolé (also known as Jolé or Yolé) is a mask-dance  from Temine people in Sierra Leone. It is played traditionally with a large square drum called sikko. Although a mask depicts a female, it is carried by a male.  Djolé is played usually during big feasts which involve many villages to celebrate a good harvest, the end of the Ramadan or a marriage.  Nowadays the rhythm has been rearranged to be played with the djembé and is very popular in particular in Guinea.
