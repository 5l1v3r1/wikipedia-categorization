An L-kick, also called aú batido, is a movement in breakdancing, capoeira and other martial arts and dance forms. It is executed by throwing the body into a cartwheel motion, but rather than completing the wheel, the body flexes while supported by one hand on the ground.  One leg is brought downwards and forwards in a kicking motion while the other remains in the air (giving rise to the name). The L-kick is usually considered a power move in breakdancing, although it is sometimes held in a freeze before returning to standing. Variations include a shotgun kick, in which the non-kicking leg is bent dramatically towards the body so that the legs resemble a shotgun shape, an elbow L-kick where the kick is supported by the elbow and forearm placed on the ground rather than just a hand, and a capoeira switch where L-kicks are performed with first one leg then the other, in different directions and without landing the cartwheel motion. The move was introduced to the b-boy world by Chris Gatdula aka Cristyle of the acclaimed dance group Jabbawockeez. The aú batido, also called aú quebrado, aú malandro o aú Amazonas, is an acrobatic kick in capoeira where one arm is used to support the body high in the air while one of the legs performs a high kick directed at the opponent's head or torso. This movement can be used as both offensively and defensively, the latter being usually when attempting to perform a cartwheel and the opponent attacks. The aú batido was used successfully in mixed martial arts by Anthony Pettis, who has a capoeira background and showed the move against Shane Roller in WEC 50.
