Gaga is a movement language and pedagogy developed by Batsheva Dance Company director and teacher Ohad Naharin. It is used in Israeli contemporary dance  and has two educational tracks which are taught in Israel and several other countries: Gaga/Dancers is intended for trained dancers and comprises the daily training of the Batsheva Dance Company; Gaga/People is designed for the general public and requires no dance training.   Many dancers have stated that after taking Gaga classes, their passion for dance has been re-ignited; they have found new ways to connect to their inner beast without being self-conscious about how it looks and finding how to listen to their bodies/self.  Gaga students improvise their movements based on somatic experience and imagery described by the teacher, which provides a framework that promotes unconventional movement.  The imagery is intended to guide the performer's movement and expressivity by focusing attention on specific body regions. For example, "Luna", "Lena", "Biba", "Tama" and many more words are used to experiment in a performers body while dancing.  Mirrors are avoided in Gaga training to facilitate movement guided by sensing and imagining.
