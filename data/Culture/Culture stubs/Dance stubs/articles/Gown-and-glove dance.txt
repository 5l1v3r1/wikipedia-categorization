The Gown-and-glove dance is considered a very traditional form of the striptease. The performer, usually female, is dressed elegantly in an evening gown with a back zipper and elbow length opera gloves. She then removes the gloves one at a time, in a slow teasing manner, before similarly removing the gown. This type of dance is exemplified by actresses like Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946) and Natalie Wood in Gypsy (1962) and by current neo-burlesque performers like Dita Von Teese and Vienna La Rouge.
