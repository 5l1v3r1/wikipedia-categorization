Fusion dance is a type of contemporary partner dance that combines different dance styles to create a new aesthetic. It is typically an improvised, lead-follow approach to dancing that does not conform to any particular defined dance styles.  Fusion dancing may involve creating a new dance style, combining existing styles, or both. Fusion dance may employ any dance technique, or arbitrary combination of techniques, associated with any type of dance. It usually incorporates dance partnering techniques such as connection, extension-compression, and frame, and may also utilize other techniques such as ballet technique, contact improvisation, and popping. Fusion dancing emphasizes musicality. The music style may influence a fusion dancer's choice of dance style. For example, a dancer might employ popping in response to hip hop music. "Fusion festivals" are held at various locations. These are typically three-day events in which various dance styles are taught during the day and social dances are held in the evenings. Some festivals emphasize specific dance styles, such as Argentine tango, slow lindy hop, West Coast Swing, or blues dancing, whereas others encompass all dance styles.[original research?]
