In Arab culture, the zaffa (Arabic: زفـّـة‎ / ALA-LC: zaffah), or wedding march, is a musical procession of bendir drums, bagpipes, horns, belly dancers and men carrying flaming swords. This is an ancient tradition, possibly predating Islam. When the procession reaches its destination, there is usually a party, more loud noises, and then dinner.
