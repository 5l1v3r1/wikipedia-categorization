Crossovers are classic moves from Balboa (dance). The pattern is back - together - forward with a quick - quick - slow rhythm, or the down-hold rhythm. Lead: Crossovers can be done where both are going to the same side, or they are alternating. Crossovers also include swivels and fall off the log. See also Lollies (dance), Throwouts (dance).
