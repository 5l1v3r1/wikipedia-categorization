American Indian Dance Theatre is a professional performing arts company presenting the dances and songs of Native Americans in the United States and the First Nations of Canada.  The group was founded in 1987 with Hanay Geiogamah as director and Barbara Schwei as producer. Raoul Trujillo served as choreographer and co-director. The group includes members from many different tribal backgrounds. It made its New York City debut in 1989 in Manhattan's Joyce Theater. In 1990 and 1993, the group was featured in PBS' Great Performances segments. In 2006 American Indian Dance Theater joined a multicultural consortium called the "Cultural Roundtable" at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, created to bring multicultural theatre to audiences in venues in downtown Los Angeles. Other performance groups belonging to the Cultural Roundtable include the Latino Theater Company, Playwrights' Arena, Robey Theatre Company, Culture Clash and Cedar Grove OnStage.
