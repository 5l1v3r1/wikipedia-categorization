 "Cupid Shuffle" is a song by Cupid from his 2007 studio album Time for a Change. It has spawned a popular line dance and has drawn comparisons to DJ Casper's "Cha Cha Slide." In the United States, the song peaked at #66 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #21 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, both in the August 18, 2007 issue. The song was first featured in Acclaim's online music video game Dance! Online. A rap remix version featuring Unk and Fabo was released to rhythm radio in August,  and a Hurley remix was released to underground club in October,  with a Solitair remix released to rhythm club,  as well. Two official remixes, the main remix, the Rap Remix, features rappers DJ Unk and Fabo of D4L. The 2nd remix, the Latin Remix, features rappers Pitbull and Baby Bash. In August 2009, two EPs of club mixes for the song were released on iTunes. In 2012, Cupid chose the song for his audition to the third season of the American music competition show The Voice, broadcast on NBC. Although he gave a different version of the hit, none of the four judges pressed their "I Want You" button and he was automatically eliminated from further competition in the show. But after turning their chairs, judge Cee Lo Green recognized Cupid and asked him to perform another song to prove that "he can sing".   *sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alonesales+streaming figures based on certification alone
