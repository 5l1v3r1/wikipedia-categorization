La Raspa originated in Veracruz  and is a dance often performed during celebrations and at dance schools. The name may be derived from the [Old High German|Old Germanic] verb "raspere", meaning "to grate upon". It either referred to the way the ratchet-like sound of the Güiro is produced by rubbing a scraper over its indentations or to the scratching movements – similar to a scraping chicken – the dancers perform during the folk dance.  The Mexican Hat Dance is a combination of two tunes: Jarabe Tapatío and La Raspa.
