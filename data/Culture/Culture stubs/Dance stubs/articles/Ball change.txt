Ball change is a dance move that consists of two steps: a partial weight transfer on the ball of a foot (placed e.g., behind), followed by a step on the other foot. Kick ball change is a dance move that consists of a kick followed by the ball change. Normally it uses a split-beat count: 1&2 or 1a2 and has a syncopated feeling, i.e., the accent of the motion is on "two". The move consists of three distinct actions and can be started with any foot. Details of each of the three actions vary depending on dance and styling preferences. Heel ball change is a dance move popular in line dances. On count "1" the heel touches the floor forward. On count "&2" the ball change is done starting with the same foot. The whole move is done in place.
