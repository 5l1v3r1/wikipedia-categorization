Gheimeh (Persian: قیمه‎) is an Iranian stew (khoresh) consisting of mutton, tomatoes, split peas, onion and dried lime. The stew is garnished with aubergine or saffron flavored fried  potatoes and is usually served with rice. The word ultimately comes from a Turkic word qıyma 'minced meat', like the Urdu-Hindi keema, the Turkish kıyma, and the Greek κιμάς.   Iraqi qeema is made with finely diced meat and crushed split peas, and is prepared on a large communal scale at the annual Āshūrā commemorations.
