The Foundation for Democracy in Iran is a U.S. organization. Several of its Board Members are current or former CIA assets, including former CIA Director James Woolsey and former Defense intelligence operative Frank Gaffney, and others are openly affiliated with the Mossad intelligence agency, including Menashe Amir.  FDI was founded in 1995 by Kenneth R. Timmerman, Peter W. Rodman, Joshua Muravchik and American intelligence officials advocating regime change in Iran.  Recently,[when?] the group gained attention for a lawsuit it brought in the Southern District of New York for Manhattan alleging that Iran was behind the 9-11 terrorist attacks.  Its website delivers news and intelligence concerning Iran.  In 2005, the website reported sources said that Iran "is planning a nuclear weapons test before the Iranian New Year on March 20, 2006", whereas a 2005 assessment by the International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded "if Iran threw caution to the wind, and sought a nuclear weapon capability as quickly as possible without regard for international reaction, it might be able to produce enough HEU for a single nuclear weapon by the end of this decade" assuming no technical problems.
