Siáhnamá'í (Persian: سیاه‌نمایی‎, lit. 'portraying like black') is a term in the cinema of Iran to describe films allegedly presenting a dark image of Iran, and frequently used by the conservatives to denounce them.   Some Iranian critics, most notably Massoud Farasati, believe that films portraying "a gloomy and dark image of social conditions under the Islamic Republic, or an exotic and primitive image of Iranians in rural settings" only seek to win awards in the Western film festivals. Some Iranian diaspora and government officials also hold such a reading. Not all Iranian critics, however, agree on this point. Houshang Golmakani is among critics who do not maintain this idea.   Many notable filmmakers in Iran are accused of having such an agenda, like Asghar Farhadi and Jafar Panahi.  Panahi has answered the accusations in Taxi (2015), saying “There are realities they don’t want shown... They don’t want to show it, but they do it themselves”.
