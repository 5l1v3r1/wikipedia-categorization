Aghazadeh (Persian: آقازاده‎, lit. 'born to Agha or noble-born')  is a term that entered the colloquialism in Iran in the 1990s  to describe the children of elite who emerge as the men of means and influence, usually in a way that resembles familial nepotism and corruption.  This includes utilization of the positions within the hierarchy to gain inside information and preferential status which results in replication of wealth and power across generations  and means "fewer top positions are available to talented people without family connections".  The phenomenon is exemplified with family members of high-ranking officials such as Hashemi Rafsanjani, Nategh Nouri and Vaez Tabasi.  In 2017, "good genes" (Persian: ژن خوب‎), a new term  was coined and became synonymous with Aghazadehs and "the privileges they enjoy".
