Phonographic Performance Ireland CLG (PPI) controls the public performance, broadcasting, and other rights in hundreds of thousands of different recordings on thousands of different labels in Ireland.  These include not only Irish recordings but also most recordings available worldwide. A "public performance" occurs whenever recordings are played to anyone outside the family or domestic circle for profit. The list of recordings in PPI's repertoire is constantly increasing as new titles are released.
