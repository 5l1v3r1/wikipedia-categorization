Lithuanian National Radio and Television (Lithuanian:  Lietuvos nacionalinis radijas ir televizija; LRT (help·info)) is the national public broadcasting company of Lithuania based in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The company broadcasts two national channels, an international channel (broadcast from the Sirius 4 satellite) and a high-definition TV station. LRT also broadcasts three national radio channels. LRT has provided regular radio service since 1926 and television broadcasting since 1957. As of 2018, LRT employs about 670 people. LRT was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on 1 January 1993. The Lithuanian Radio and Television Council oversees the operations of LRT according to the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public and the Lithuanian Radio and Television Law. LRT is funded by the state budget (about 75%) and (until 2015) television commercials. A television licence fee or tax that every television purchaser would have to pay is being discussed since 1996 as the future source of income for LRT. In May 2007 LRT started a project of converting all of its films, including some five thousand hours of cinefilm and some 30,000 hours of video tapes to digital. The oldest entry dates back to 1895.
