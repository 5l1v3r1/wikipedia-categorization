The Mongolian National Broadcaster (MNB; Mongolian: Монголын Үндэсний Олон Нийтийн Радио Телевиз; Mongolian for Mongolian National Public Radio and Television; shortened as МҮОНРТ) is the official, state-funded broadcaster in Mongolia. Broadcasting started in Ulaanbaatar in May/June 1931 and was organized by the Minister of Trade and Industry, Gombyn Sodnom.  During the early 1960s, local radio broadcasting for Ulaanbaatar was introduced, and a second national radio channel was established.  Four additional longwave transmitters were opened: 1965 in the western city of Ölgii, 1978 in Altai, Dalanzadgad and Choibalsan. In 1981 the Mörön transmitter started broadcasting on mediumwave. The international shortwave service started in 1964 and was renamed "Voice of Mongolia" in 1997. The Ölgii station also carries local programming in Kazakh. In 2011 Р3 was launched as a youth programme. Television broadcasts started in September 1967, and a second channel was launched in July 2011. The transmitters are operated by RTBN (Radio and Television Broadcasting Network; Mongolian: РТС, Радио Телевизийн Үндэсний Сүлжээ). MNB's television services (Mongolian: Монголын Үндэсний Олон Нийтийн Телевиз) consist of three channels. MNB's radio services (Mongolian: Монголын Үндэсний Олон Нийтийн Радио) consist of three dosmetic networks and one international service. Since its foundation the MNB had been working to develop its international relations and co-operate with international broadcasters. In January 1997 it became a full member of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. As well as broadcasting domestically produced material, it also has program exchanges with Russian Public TV, NHK, CNN, ZDF and Deutsche Welle. MNB was criticized after the 2008 State of emergency for broadcasting biased news favoring the ruling Mongolian People's Party, despite being a neutral channel. They accepted the allegations.
