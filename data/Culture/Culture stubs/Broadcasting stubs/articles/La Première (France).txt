La Première is a network of radio and television stations operating in France's overseas departments and territories around the world. La 1ère network includes: La 1re also offers free streaming television just like what they do with the radio on the internet. The television broadcast on the website is only for those who live in the overseas territories/departments. The service was first established in 1954 as the Radiodiffusion de la France Outre-Mer (RFOM). It was renamed a year later as the Société de radiodiffusion de la France d'outre-mer (SORAFOM). This was replaced in 1964, following the creation of the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française, by the Office de coopération radiophonique (OCORA). In August 1974, OCORA became a part of the reformulated FR3: a network of regional television stations in mainland France. FR3's overseas operations were known as FR3 DOM-TOM and, unlike the arrangement in metropolitan France, were in charge of both television and radio. In December 1982 France's overseas broadcasting operations were removed from FR3 and invested in the current organization, the Société de Radiodiffusion et de télévision Française pour l'Outre-mer (RFO). In July 2004 Réseau France Outre-mer (RFO) was reunited with the French mainland's public broadcasters when it was merged into the France Télévisions network. On 30 November 2010 Réseau France Outre-mer have been renamed Réseau Outre-Mer 1ère.
