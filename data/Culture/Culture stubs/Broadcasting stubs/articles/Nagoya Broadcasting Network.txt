Nagoya Broadcasting Network Co., Limited (名古屋テレビ放送株式会社, Nagoya Terebi Hōsō Kabushiki-gaisha), Nickname: Mētele (メ～テレ Mētere)  is a TV station joining All-Nippon News Network (ANN) in Nagoya.  It is broadcast in Aichi Prefecture, Gifu Prefecture, and Mie Prefecture. It also serves Toyama Prefecture as its default ANN station.  The station is well known among anime fans for its close association with the anime studio Sunrise, including participating in the production of such works as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zambot 3, and Yoroiden Samurai Troopers. The license for channel 11 in the Tōkai region began its search on November 24, 1959. Initially, the station's license name was Chūkyō Television Broadcasting (unrelated to Chūkyō TV, which NBN had swapped networks in 1973). The first tests (still under the Chūkyō name) were held on March 10, 1962. On March 13, the station changed their name to Nagoya Television Broadcasting. Eventually service tests were conducted on March 25 and regular transmissions commenced on April 1. Initially, the station was affiliated to two networks: NTV and NET (the current TV Asahi). It was one of the founding members of the Nippon News Network in 1966. Color transmissions began in December of that year. The station became a sole affiliate of NNN when Chūkyō TV began broadcasting on April 1, 1969. When CTV began to show interest in joining NNN in 1972, NBN gradually introduced ANN network programming. The network switch wasn't officialized until April 1, 1973. Bi-lingual transmissions commenced in 1986. In the following year, the station adopted the Nagoya TV branding. The current brand, Mētele (メーテレ Mētere) and hybrid sheep-wolf mascot (Wolfy) were introduced on April 1, 2003. JOLX-TV JOLX-DTV
