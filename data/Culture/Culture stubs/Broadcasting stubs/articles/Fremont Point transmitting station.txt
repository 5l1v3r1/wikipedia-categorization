  The Fremont Point transmitting station is a facility for FM and television transmission at Fremont, Vingtaine du Nord, Saint John, Jersey. It serves the whole of the Channel Islands, either directly or via the relay stations  at Mont Orgueil, Alderney, Saint Brelade, Saint Helier, St Peter Port, Torteval and Les Touillets - the last of which is a high power relay which covers most of Guernsey.  Its antennas are mounted on a 139 metres (456Â ft) tall tower built of lattice steel. That transmitter was previously located at Lichfield in Staffordshire.  It is owned by Arqiva. DAB radio on VHF Band 3 is now transmitted from this site. The transmitter was constructed by the then Independent Television Authority to bring Independent Television to the Channel Islands in the form of the ITV franchise Channel Television. The BBC had already been transmitting their BBC Television Service (renamed BBC One from April 1964) to the Channel Islands from the "Les Platons" transmitter site since October 1955.  Channel Television commenced broadcasting from the transmitter on 1 September 1962.  On 24 July 1976 the transmitter became the main transmitter site in the Channel Islands and commenced broadcasting in UHF 625 line for the first time, not only for Channel Television but also for BBC One and BBC Two (BBC Two launched in the Channel Islands on the same day, with the Channel Islands being the last region to get BBC Two). Colour television also commenced for the first time on 24 July 1976 from the transmitter. The Channel Islands were the last region to get colour television due to the technical difficulties in providing a UHF link from the UK mainland to the Channel Islands.   Since 17 November 2010, Fremont Point broadcasts digital television only, replacing the old analogue services. Only 3 of the 6 digital multiplexes are available from this transmitter. Analogue television was broadcast from the transmitter from September 1962 until 17 November 2010.
