A Mobisoap is a mobile phone displayed soap opera, intended for viewers of soap operas who wish to watch them when without access to a television or a computer, usually whilst travelling or at work. Mobisoaps are delivered to the user in short format (a format intended for small files), with each episode having a duration of roughly 3 minutes and screening 2 to 3 times a week. This '3 minute delivery' format is similar to that of the 'Music release' format (a format for sending music files between devices) which has been developed recently. Although delivered in short format, each episode follows a story and script structure, and usually contains rapid plot events and character developments.
