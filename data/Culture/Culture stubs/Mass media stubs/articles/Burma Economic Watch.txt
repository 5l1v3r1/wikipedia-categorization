Burma Economic Watch is a periodial produced by the Macquarie University of Sydney, Australia. It aims to provide reliable and current data, analysis and commentary on the economy of Burma. Given that information on the economy of the country given the political situation is difficult to obtain and often unreliable, the periodical is produced by an editorial team of scholars devoted to the study of Burma and its economy.
