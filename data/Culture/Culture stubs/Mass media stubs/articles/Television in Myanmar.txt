Television broadcasting in Burma began in 1979 as a test trial in Yangon.  Regular television service was first formally launched in 1981.  Most television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. TV Myanmar and Myawaddy TV are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language programming in news and entertainment. Other special interest channels are Channel 7 and (Myawaddy Movie), Myanmar International, the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via Internet, MRTV-4 with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specializing in broadcasting foreign movies.  On October 29, 2012, an unknown Burmese company became a joint venture with Channel 3 (Thailand).
