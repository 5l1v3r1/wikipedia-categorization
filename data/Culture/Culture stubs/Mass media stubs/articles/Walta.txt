Walta, also known as Walta Media and Communication Corporate S.C., previously synonymously called Walta Information and Public Relations Center S.C., or simply Walta Information Center is an Ethiopian privately owned media conglomerate that is owned and operated by the EPRDF (Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front), the ruling party alliance in Ethiopia.  Walta is therefore affiliated with the current Ethiopian government and cannot currently be considered independent.  Walta, located in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, was founded in 1994 and supplies the Ethiopian News Agency and other media with local and national news. According to Walta itself, it is gathering, organizing, analyzing and disseminating news and is also providing image building and public relation support activities, therefore showcasing its lack of independence.  As part of the media conglomerate, there is an online medium in English, Amharic and Arabic with local, national and international news and a TV station, Walta TV, broadcasting mainly social and political news in Amharic over satellite.
