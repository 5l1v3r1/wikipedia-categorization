An almond present (Danish: mandelgave, Norwegian: mandelgave, Icelandic: möndlugjöf, Swedish: mandelgåva) is a small present traditionally given in some Nordic countries to the person who gets the whole almond put in the rice pudding served for Christmas. The tradition may originate from the somewhat similar king cake tradition on Epiphany, observed in, e.g., France.
