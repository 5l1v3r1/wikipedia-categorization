Nagarvadhu or Nagar Vadhu (Devanagari: नगरवधू) ("bride of the city") was a tradition followed in some parts of ancient India. Women competed to win the title of a Nagarvadhu, and it was not considered a taboo.  The most beautiful woman was chosen as the Nagarvadhu. A Nagarvadhu was respected like a queen or Goddess, but she was a courtesan or prostitute; people could watch her dance and sing.  A Nagarvadhu's price for a single night's dance was very high, and she was only within the reach of the very rich – the king, the princes, and the lords.
