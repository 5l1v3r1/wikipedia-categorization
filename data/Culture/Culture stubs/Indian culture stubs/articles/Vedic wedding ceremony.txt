Vedic wedding ceremony is the traditional Hindu wedding that includes Vedic yajna â€“ rituals around agni, particularly the seven vows before the fire, with the hymns from the Vedas.   The roots of this tradition are found in hymn 10.85 of the Rigveda, which is also called the "Rigvedic wedding hymn".   The Arya Samaj movement popularized the term Vedic wedding among the Hindu expatriates during the colonial era.
