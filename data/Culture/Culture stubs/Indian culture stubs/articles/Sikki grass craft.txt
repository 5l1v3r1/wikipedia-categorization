Sikki grass crafts are various handicrafts that are made from a special kind of grass known as sikki found in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India.  The art of making items from sikki grass is an ancient one in the province of Bihar. Sikki is dried and the flower head is cut off. The resulting fine golden fibre is used in weaving to make toys, dolls, and baskets (dolchi). Items are sometimes painted.  Boxes made of sikki known as pauti are given to daughters by parents on the occasion of their  wedding. The boxes are used to hold sindoor, ornaments, and jewellry.
