  In India, a cultural festival, cultfest, culfest or college fest is an annual cultural event at a college or university organised by the student community, involving participants from other colleges as well.      Professional performing artists are also typically invited, and a number of competitions are held for students. Fests are usually funded through sponsors, although some colleges have begun exploring the idea of crowdfunding.  Most college culfests last between two to five days. The events in a culfest can be broadly classified into four sections: Literary events usually include quizzes, word games, creative writing and some form of public speaking or debate. These include such competitions as music, dance, fine arts and drama. One or more professionally staged entertainment programs may be scheduled. Video games and board games may be played.
