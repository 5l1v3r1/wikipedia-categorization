  Harivaṃśapurāṇa was composed by Acharya Jinasena in 783 AD.    It is divided into 66 cantos and contains 12,000 slokas. The book aims to narrate the life of Neminatha, the twenty-second Tirthankara in Jainism. According to the Jain sources, Krishna is the first cousin of Tirthankara Neminatha. Therefore, Krishna’s adventures too occupy a significant portion of the book.
