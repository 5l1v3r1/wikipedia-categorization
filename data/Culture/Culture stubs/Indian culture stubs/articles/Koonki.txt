Koonki (or Kunki) is a specially trained elephant used in Mela shikar to capture wild elephants. They are used to chase the wild elephants, help in lassoing and dragging them to the depot. They are particularly trained to follow the "foot commands" from their mahouts and to move silently during the entire capturing operation.  Following are the commands that phandis use to drive an elephant.
