Shrimati or Shreemati (Sanskrit: श्रीमती), abbreviated Smt., is a widely accepted Indian honorific (akin to Mrs. in English language) used when referring to a married woman in some Indian languages including Sanskrit, Hindi,  Kannada, Bengali, Odia, Malayalam and Telugu, and sometimes in English as well (in an Indian context). The equivalent title for men is Sri or Shree which is a shortened version of Shriman or Shreeman.  The clear pronunciation in English would be "shreemati" and "shreeman".
