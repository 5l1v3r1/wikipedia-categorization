Mithqāl (Arabic: مثقال‎) is a unit of mass equal to 4.5 grams which is mostly used for measuring precious metals, such as gold, and other commodities, like saffron. The name was also applied as an alternative term for the gold dinar, a coin that was used throughout much of the Islamic world from the 8th century onward and survived in parts of Africa until the 19th century.   The name of Mozambique's currency since 1980, the metical, is derived from mithqāl.  The word mithqāl (Arabic: مثقال‎; “weight, unit of weight”) comes from the Arabic thaqala (ثقل), meaning “to weigh”. Other variants of the unit in English include miskal (from Persian or Urdu مثقال; misqāl), mithkal, mitkal and mitqal. In India, the measurement is known as mithqaal. It contains 4 mashas and 3½ raties (rata'ii; مثقال).  It is equivalent to 4.25 grams when measuring gold,  or 4.5 grams when measuring commodities.  It may be more or less than this.  The mithqāl in another more modern calculation is as follows: Nakhud is a Baha'i unit of mass used by Baha'u'llah.  The mithqāl had originally consisted of 24 nakhuds, but in the Bayán, the collective works of the Babist founder the Báb, this was reduced to 19.
