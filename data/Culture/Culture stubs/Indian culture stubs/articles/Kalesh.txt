Kalesh is an ancient Hindi word which means 'to cause agitation' or 'to cause unrest' by 'devilish' ways. This is often used by the youth in a casual way to signify "mischief". Kalesh is generally accompanied by the word "मचेगा " (machega). Though there are no clear indications about the origin of the word, there have been suggestions that it might have originated from Sanskrit. It is generally used by the older generation in India to cite day to day experiences. For example: हमारी बहू ने हमारे घर में कलेश मचा दिया है | (The new girl in our house has totally disrupted the happiness of our house) or अब मचेगा कलेश | (The fun begins now!). Kalesh has been overused in the Hindi media (both print and television) and in Hindi commercials, sitcoms and serials.  The most popular Kalesh (कलेश) that is encountered is "ग्रेह कलेश" (House destruction).
