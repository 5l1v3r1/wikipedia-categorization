Tulisa, the Wood-Cutter's Daughter is an Indian legend from the Somadeva Bhaṭṭa. The tale concerns a woodcutter's daughter who hears a voice at a fountain "Will you be my wife". On the third time she refers the voice to her father a woodcutter to whom the voice promises great wealth. The voice turns out to be that of a serpent king whom Tulisa meets at night but never sees. Soon after the daughter's marriage her father becomes rich, arousing the jealousy of neighbours. After many turns the story culminates with Tulisa and her husband prince Basnak Dau clothed in royal robes. The tale was published in the West in German as Tulisa and Basnak Dau in Hermann Brockhaus' selections from the Somadeva Bhaṭṭa (Leipzig 1843) and widely distributed through Ausland magazine (also 1843),  and published in English in sources such as Household Tales from the East in The Dublin University Magazine in 1869.  Later commentators saw common elements with Cupid and Psyche.
