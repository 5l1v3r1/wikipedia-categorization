Deul or Deoul is a local term in West India and Bengal for the tower of a Hindu temple â€” what would be called a shikara elsewhere in north India.  In Odisha, as deula, the term can refer to temple towers, or to the whole temple. The term is also used for a style of temple architecture of Bengal, where the temple lacks the usual mandapa beside the main shrine, and the main unit consists only of the shrine and a deul above it; in other respects they are similar to the Kalinga architecture of Odisha,  and some smaller temples in Odisha also take this form. The type arose between the 6th and the 10th centuries and was revived in the 16th-19th century.  The later representatives of this style were generally smaller and included features influenced by Islamic architecture.  The towers of ek-ratna temples resemble the earlier deul style, as do the central towers of pancharatna and  navaratna styles.  The earliest temple still standing of the rekha deul pre-muslim style is Siddheshvari temple at Barakar.
