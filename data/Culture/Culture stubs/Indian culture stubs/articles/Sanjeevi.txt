Sanjeevi is the name of the mountain with auspicious and medicinal plants on it. In Hinduism, this mountain is said to be very sacred. Lord Hanuman brought this mountain from Dronagiri to cure Lakshman and Rama and the Vaanara army who had fainted and wounded in the war. According to Hinduism, Sanjeevi means medicine that cures, auspicious, strong and giant. There is much relation between this hill and the Indian epic Ramayana. When Lord Rama and Laxman fainted as a result of being hit by Indrajit's Brahmaastra arrow, Jambavan advised Lord Hanuman to bring four medicinal plants from the Sanjeeevi hills in Himalayas for restoring the strength of Lord Rama, Laxman and the Vaanara army who had been wounded in the war against Ravana. However Lord Hanuman could not identify the plants, therefore he brought the entire hill. Once in vicinity of the hill the warriors wounds healed and they became strong. Lord Hanuman once again carried the hill for the second time during the final battle of the Ramayana. Present day this Sanjeevi hills is located at Rajapalayam, a township in Tamil Nadu, India. It is believed that fragments which fell from the Sanjeevi hills while being carried by Lord Hanuman created Sirumalai & Sathuragiri.
