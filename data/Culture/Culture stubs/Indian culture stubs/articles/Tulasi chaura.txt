Tulasi chaura (Odia: ତୁଳସୀ ଚଉରା) also known as Tulasi Vrindavan(Odia: ତୁଳସୀ ବୃନ୍ଦାବନ) is a small podium-like stone or cement construction in front of Hindu houses in the Indian state of Odisha containing Tulasi. Tulasī or Holy Basil is an aromatic plant in the family Lamiaceae which is native throughout the Old World tropics and widespread as a cultivated plant and an escaped weed.  and considered as a holy plant by the Hindus and is worshiped as Brunda debi (Vrunda devi) or Brundabati. Every morning after bath the Odia people worship the plant by pouring water and take few leaves as prasada. Tulasi is a sacred plant for Hindus. Water mixed with tulsi petals is given to the dying to raise their departing souls to heaven.  In Pana Sankranti a tiny hole is made in a small earthen pot filled with Pana and hung in  a stick so that the drops of Pana fall on the roots of Tulasi which signifies the beginning of Asadha in rainy season. Chatua, Guda (jaggery) and yogurt are served as prasada in the Tulasi chaura on that day.
