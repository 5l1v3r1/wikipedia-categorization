Taranga is the typical headscarf worn by Kashmiri Pandit women until the late 1960s.  Now its only place is as a ritual and by tradition to be worn in the classical way on the bride's head as a bridal gear on her wedding day. This headwear has a very significant and historical importance and relevance, as it was an appreciation reward from Jagatguru Adi Sankaracharya during his stay in Kashmir.
