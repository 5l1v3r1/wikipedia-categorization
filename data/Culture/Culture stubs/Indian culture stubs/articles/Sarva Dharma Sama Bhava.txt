Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava is an Hindu concept embodying the equality of the destination of the path's followed by all religions (Although the path's themselves may be different).  The concept was embraced by Ramakrishna and Vivekenanda,  as well as Mahatma Gandhi.   Although commonly thought to be among the ancient Hindu vedas, the phrase is actually attributed to Gandhi, having been used first in September 1930 in his communications to his followers to quell divisions that had begun to develop between Hindus and Muslims toward the end of the British Raj.   The concept is one of the key tenets of secularism in India, wherein there is not a separation of church and state, but an attempt by the state to embrace all religions.   Sarva dharma sama bhav has been rejected by a small portion of highly conservative Hindu's who claim that religious universalism has led to the loss of many of Hinduism's rich traditions. :60 Sarva dharma sama bhav is often mistranslated as "All religions are the same", although it's true meaning is closer to "All path's lead to the same destination [In a religious sense]".
