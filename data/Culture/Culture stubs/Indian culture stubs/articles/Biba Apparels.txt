   Biba Apparels is an Indian fashion brand founded by Meena Bindra in 1988 from her home in New Delhi, India.    It has more than 150 brand outlets and 225 multi-brand outlets.  Biba recorded sales of INR 600 crore in 2014-15.  In 1982, Meena Bindra started the company from her home in New Delhi. She took 8000 rupees loan to start a small business.    Some years later, Bindra allowed her sons, Sanjay and Siddharth, to help her to manage the business. In 2010, Sanjay left Biba and started his own apparel business, Seven East.  Biba opened its first standalone store in Mumbai in 2004.  Kishore Biyani’s Future Group acquired a 6.5% stake in Biba in 2007. Future group divested from Biba Apparels in 2013.  In 2014, Biba Apparels acquired a minority stake in the designer label Anju Modi.  Biba, in October 2014, launched its own e-commerce portal biba.in, to leverage the country's fast growing e-commerce space.  In order to tap the value segment market and the youth segment of tier 2 and 3 cities, a new line of Indian wear under brand Rangriti was launched by Biba in 2014.  In 2002, BIBA tied up with Mukta Arts to replicate designer costumes from four of its movies Taal, Yaadein, Pardes and Badhai Ho Badhai, thus tapping the Merchandising movie memorabilia of the Indian market.  It made its first stint in Bollywood merchandising with its integration in Na tum Jaano Na Hum, followed by many others including blockbuster movies such as Devdas, Hulchal and Baghban.   In October 2012, BIBA joined hands with designer Manish Arora by taking up a 51% stake in the brand Indian by Manish Arora. This fashion apparel brand launched in 2009 and offers apparels such as salwar kameez, sarees, lehengas, kurtis, tunics, and T-shirts.  With its design collaboration with Rohit Bal, a niche collection, BIBA by Rohit Bal, was launched in 2013 to be retailed at select BIBA stores.  The collection’s main focus was embroidery, gold and silver cutwork, and elegant Mughal block print patterns.
