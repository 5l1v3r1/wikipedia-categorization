In India and Pakistan, a punkah wallah or punkahwallah  (Hindi: पङ्खावाला, paṅkhāvālā)  is a manual fan operator.   The most desired were deaf because they were always within earshot of confidential conversations. A punkah is a type of ceiling fan used in the Indian subcontinent before the electric fan.  The punkhawallah was the servant who worked it, often using a pulley system. The word pankha originated from pankh, the wings of a bird which produce a draft when flapped. In modern use, a person selling,  repairing or making fans, both handheld and electric, would also be known colloquially as a punkha wala, since the term means fan guy or the guy with the fans.
