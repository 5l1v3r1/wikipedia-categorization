This text gives an encyclopedic account of the Jain tradition.  The text is widely quoted. A widely used quote from Carl Sagan's Cosmos, page 140 is:  "Some foolish men declare that a Creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill-advised, and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was He before creation? . . .How could God have made the world without any raw material? If you say He made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression . . . Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning and end. And it is based on the principles . . . - The Mahapurana (The Great Legend), Jinasena (India, ninth century)",  A number of Jain and non-Jain texts have been influenced by the Mahapurana. Mahapurana was the model for Saiva Siddhanta Periyapuranam which gives biographies of the 63 individuals.
