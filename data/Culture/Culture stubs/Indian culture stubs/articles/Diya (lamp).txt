  A Diya, diyo, deya,  divaa, deepa, deepam, or deepak is an oil lamp used in the Indian subcontinent, notably India and Nepal, usually made from clay, with a cotton wick dipped in ghee or vegetable oils. Diyas are native to the Indian subcontinent often used in Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Zoroastrian religious festivals such as Diwali  or the Kushti ceremony.  Clay diyas are often used temporarily as lighting for special occasions, while diyas made of brass are permanent fixtures in homes and temples. Diwali: The lightening of Diyas forms a part of celebrations and rituals of the festival. The houses are decorated with small diyas being placed at boundaries and entrance of houses.  In fact, the name of Diwali is derived from the Sanskrit word Deepavali, which means the row of lights ("deep" means Diya and "avali" means row).  Karthikai Deepam: Diyas, also known as deepam in Tamil Nadu, can be lighted, especially during the Karthikai Deepam. A diya placed in temples and used to bless worshippers is referred to as an aarti. A similar lamp called a butter lamp is used in Tibetan Buddhist offerings as well. Death: The lighting of diya is also part of the Hindu religion rituals related to death.
