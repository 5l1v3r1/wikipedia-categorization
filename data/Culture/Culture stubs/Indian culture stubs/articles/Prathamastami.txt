Prathamastami is a rite held in Odisha for the life and prosperity of the eldest child who is offered a lighted lamp ovation by the senior female relatives followed by elaborate rituals during which the Mantras are recited. The celebration falls on the dark half eighth day - Ashtami -  of the month of Margashirsha according to the Purnimanta calendar followed in North India, occurring after the eight day of Kartik Purnima. The ritual involves Aarathi of the eldest child by mother and relatives in  which the maternal uncle sends the items necessary for the ritual, and  Ganesha, Shashti devi and the family deity are worshipped. The main delicacy of the day is Enduri Pitha.  'The social significance of this festival is that the first-borns are brighter and it is ultimately they who take up the burden of the family after the death of the parents. According to psychologists the first-borns are mostly healthy, obedient and tradition-bound. Therefore, the family tradition is maintained through them. For such obvious reasons the eldest child is honoured to occupy the respectable place in the family after the death of the parents.' This day is also known as Saubhagini Ashtami, Kaal Bhairav Ashtami and Paap-nashini Ashtami.  Template:BK Odisha Reference Yearbook 2015
