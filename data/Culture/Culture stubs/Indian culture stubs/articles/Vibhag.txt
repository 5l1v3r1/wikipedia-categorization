Vibhag represent a duration of rhythmic phrasing in Indian classical music made up of a certain number of beats. They are the rough equivalent of bars in western music, but instead of always being equal subdivisions of the tala (the rhythmic cycle - think 12 bar blues), they can be uneven. In certain traditions of Indian music, any number of beats may form a vibhag. Usually the beats will be in two, three, or four.  They should be designated either with a clap or a wave of the hand.
