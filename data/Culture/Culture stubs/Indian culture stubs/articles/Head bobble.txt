The head bobble, or Indian head shake refers to a common gesture found in South Asian cultures, most notably in India. The motion usually consists of a side-to-side tilting of the head in arcs along the coronal plane.  A form of nonverbal communication, it may mean "Yes", "Good", "OK" or "I understand", depending on the context.   In India the gesture is common in certain parts, especially in Maharashtra, South India.   In India, this particular headshake can also be acknowledgment or encouragement. In the Western world, people often use a nod for the same purpose. It is not always associated with yes or no, and is used in place of no when the person does not want to say no.  The meaning of the Indian head bobble depends on the context of the conversation or encounter.
