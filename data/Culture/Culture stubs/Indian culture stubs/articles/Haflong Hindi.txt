Haflong Hindi (Hindi: हफ़लौंग हिन्दी) is the lingua franca of Dima Hasao district of Assam state of India.  It is a pidgin that stemmed from Hindi and included vocabulary from several other languages, such as Bengali, Dimasa and the Zeme Naga dialect. It is named after Haflong, which is the headquarters of Dima Hasao district. The dialect is largely intelligible to Hindi speakers, and features simplified grammar with loanword infusions.  In contrast to printed forms of Hindi, the Haflong variety lacks person and number agreement in the verb and ergative marking of the subject when transitive clauses are in a preterite or perfect tense.
