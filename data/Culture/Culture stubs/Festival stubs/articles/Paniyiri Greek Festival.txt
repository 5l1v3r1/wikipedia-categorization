The Paniyiri Greek Festival is held in May each year in Musgrave Park, Brisbane, Australia. The festival was started in 1976, and is the longest running cultural festival in Queensland, and the longest running Greek festival in Australia.  It was initiated by Father Gregory Sakellariou, with the aim of bringing the Greek community together and sharing their culture with the people of Brisbane.  The festival is famous for its food, music and Hellenic dancing.  Crowds of up to 60,000 people flock to the two-day festivities, and over a thousand volunteers help in the running of Queenslandâ€™s largest festival.  In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Paniyiri Greek Festival was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an "event and festival".
