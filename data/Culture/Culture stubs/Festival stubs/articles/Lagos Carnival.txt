  The Lagos carnival also known as the Fanti or Caretta Carnival of Lagos,  is the most prominent in West Africa. The carnival is usually held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, a colorful folk festival which holds annually in Lagos. The origins of the carnival dates back to the Lagos colonial period when the Brazilian former slave returnees came back to reside in Lagos in the 19th century. The carnival was re-instated in 2010.  The event is usually centered on Lagos Island, filled with troop displays of beautiful costumes and various forms of entertainment including music and dancing. The carnival portrays an eclectic mixture of Nigerian, Brazilian and Cuban heritage of the city.
