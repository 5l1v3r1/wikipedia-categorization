It is a celebration of an ancient town in a modern world with events including crafts, food, live and classical music, fireworks, dog show, continental market, literature, countryside exhibits and much more. It takes place over the August Bank holiday weekend. The festival is organised and run by around 20 volunteers who meet once a month throughout the year.
