  Aye Write is a book festival which takes place in Glasgow in late February or early March.   Since 2007 it has been an annual fixture. The first Aye Write festival was in 2005.   It was originally intended to occur once every two years, but during the second festival in 2007 it was announced that from then on it would be annual.  The 2016 line-up includes Christopher Brookmyre, Limmy and Stuart Cosgrove.  People who have taken part in the festival include: Edwin Morgan, William McIlvanney, Ian McEwan, Iain Banks, Denise Mina, Louise Welsh, Jackie Kay, Andrew Motion, Lynne Truss, Jenny Colgan, John Burnside and others.  The Clare Maclean Prize for Scottish Fiction was awarded for the first time at the 2008 festival, in memory of Claire Maclean, the partner of Prof. Mike Gonzalez, with a Â£3000 first prize. It is open to any book written by a Scottish author (or someone working in Scotland) in the previous twelve months.
