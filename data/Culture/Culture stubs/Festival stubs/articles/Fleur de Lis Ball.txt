The Fleur de Lis Ball is a cotillion (or debutante ball) in St. Louis, Missouri, for the adolescents of affluent St. Louis Catholic society.  It was started in 1958 by a group of Catholic upper-class women.  It teaches etiquette and ballroom skills to teenage girls and boys.  Four years of classes end with the Fleur de Lis Ball itself, which benefits Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital.  The ball is a very formal event, with long white gowns and gloves, and the girls are escorted and presented to the Archbishop of St. Louis.
