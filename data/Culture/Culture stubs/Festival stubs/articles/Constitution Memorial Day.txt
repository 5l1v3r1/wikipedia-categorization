Constitution Memorial Day (憲法記念日, Kenpō Kinenbi) is a national holiday in Japan. It takes place on May third in celebration of the promulgation of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. It is a part of the collection of holidays known as Golden Week.  A holiday since the current Japanese constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, Constitution Memorial Day is often chosen as a day to reflect on the meaning of democracy and Japanese government.   For instance, in 2003, a number of newspapers featured editorials regarding the constitution's embattled Article 9.
