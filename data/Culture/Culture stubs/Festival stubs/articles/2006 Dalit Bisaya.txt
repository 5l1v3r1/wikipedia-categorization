The 2006 Dalit Bisaya (officially Dalit Bisaya: A Cebu Visayan Cultural Festival) was a series of exhibits, cultural shows, and a symposium, sponsored by the Kapunongang Bisaya sa Manila and hosted by the University of San Carlos (Cebu City, Philippines). It ran from December 1 to 3, 2006, with the activities held in SM Cebu and campuses of the host university. The tagline was Panaghiusa Pinaagi sa Kultura (Unity through Culture). Various groups have thought of holding a Bisaya or Cebuano-Visayan cultural festival in Cebu. In 1999 the Kapunongang Bisaya sa Kadak-ang Manila under Gen. Lisandro Abadia ang Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan discussed a plan for it. Later in 1999 and 2000 another and a larger group led by Atty. Napoleon Rama and Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. made detailed plans for a Visayan concert in Cebu and adopted a plan to form the Kulturang Bisaya Foundation to support its cultural activities. The 2006 Dalit Bisaya was orchestrated by a group composed of Jesus Alcordo, Dr. Magdaleno Albarracin, Dr. Jose Abueva, Dr. Francisco Nemenzo, Baltazar Endriga and Yolanda Bacani.
