The Cavalcade of Scaër (French: La Cavalcade de Scaër; or The Cavalcade) is a carnival festival that takes place in the town of Scaër, a commune in the Finistère department of Brittany in northwestern France. Every odd year since 1923, during the Pentecost weekend (Sunday and Monday), about 5,000 inhabitants of Scaër welcome about 50,000 spectators for The Cavalcade carnival, which the town owes its nickname French: "Scaër la Joyeuse" ("Scaër the Merry").
