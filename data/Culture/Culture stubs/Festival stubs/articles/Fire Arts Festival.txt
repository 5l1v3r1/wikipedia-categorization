The Fire Arts Festival was a recurring event held in Oakland, California. It was organized by The Crucible arts education center as its main fundraising event. The festival featured open-air exhibits of fire art and performances. The festival was held in July. The first Fire Arts Festival was held in 1999. At this time the festival occurred on only one night. A one-night event was also held in 2000 and 2002. (There was no festival in 2001 or 2003.) The 2004 festival was the first to span more than one evening, spanning five days and nights. From 2004 to 2009 the festival occurred annually and spanned 4-6 days. The last festival (2009) was held in a new location, on the former Oakland Army Base just north of Grand Avenue, with three times as much space as the old West Oakland site. The website for The Crucible states that the festival will return in future years.
