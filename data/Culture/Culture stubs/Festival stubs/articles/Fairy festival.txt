A Fairy Festival, Faery Festival or Fairy Fayre is an outdoor gathering typically including costuming, handicrafts, music or other entertainment and food. Fairy Festivals are sometimes considered a form of Renaissance fair, although they lack historical basis and the depiction of fairies is generally based on Victorian Romanticism rather than historical lore.
