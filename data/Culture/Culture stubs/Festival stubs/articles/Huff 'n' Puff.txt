Huff-'n'Puff is one of the longest continuously held hot air balloon festivals in North America, having been held every year since 1976. It is held each second weekend of September in Topeka, Kansas by the Great Plains Balloon Club. The festival is located at Tinman Circle on the east side of Lake Shawnee, and weather permitting there are two flight launches each day: a morning flight at 6:00 am and an evening flight at 6:00pm followed by a Balloon Glow at 7:30 pm. Approximately 30 balloon crews, mostly from the region around Topeka, participate each year.
