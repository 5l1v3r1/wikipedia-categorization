The Montana Pride Celebration was a locally organized gay pride celebration held annually in Montana, United States, from 2004 to 2013.  The three-day event was usually held during a weekend in June.  Events typically included a parade, festival, dances and musical events. Because of Montana's relatively small and dispersed population, Montana Pride served as a single event for the state as a whole, rotating among the state's larger towns from year to year.  The celebration was held in Missoula in 2004; Helena in 2005 and 2006; and  Billings in 2007.   The 2007 activities took place the weekend of June 15–17.  The Montana Pride celebration continued in Billings in 2008, Kalispell in 2009 & 2010, Bozeman in 2011 & 2012, and Butte in 2013. In March 2014, the Montana Pride Network collapsed and canceled the pride celebration in Butte for 2014. Montana's Big Sky Pride has since taken over and did hold a celebration in June 2014 in Butte, 2015 in Missoula, and June 17–19, 2016 is the first celebration of Pride to be held in Great Falls.
