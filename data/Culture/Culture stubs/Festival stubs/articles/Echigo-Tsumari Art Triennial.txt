The Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial is an international modern art festival held once every three years in the Niigata prefecture, Japan.  The festival was created by the Tokyo commercial gallery Art Front Gallery (AFG) and is directed by Fram Kitagawa.   It was first held in 2000 for a "grand" two-month exhibition in "communities, rice fields, vacant houses, and closed schools across a 760 square kilometer (187,800 acre) region."  In 2009 the pieces included a silver "croquette" house serving a croquette of locally harvested potatoes, a herb shop, a giant grasshopper slide, and a sculpture of a giant man.
