 Revision is a demoparty which takes place on Easter in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. It is the successor of the Breakpoint party series, and retains many of the organizing staff.  The event was established in 2011, after Breakpoint had announced its end in 2010. The party hosts around 800 people from around the world each year.   It is currently the largest pure-demoscene event in the world.   Revision, like its predecessors, always takes place on Easter weekend; the dates of the event thus follow Computus.
