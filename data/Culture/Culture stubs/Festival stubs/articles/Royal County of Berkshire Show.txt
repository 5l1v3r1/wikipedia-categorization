  The Royal County of Berkshire Show is an annual agricultural show in Berkshire, England that started in 1909 at Enborne Gate Farm, Newbury, as a horse show and has now grown to be a biggest such event in England.  The Newbury and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1909 to run the show and continues to do so.   There were three breaks in the 20th Century when no show took place. Between 1914 and 1918 during the First World War, between 1928 and 1935 during the farming depression and again during the Second World War  1939 to 1945. Since then the Show has grown to become one of the leading agricultural shows in the country. The show takes place over two days in September at the permanent showground near Chieveley.
