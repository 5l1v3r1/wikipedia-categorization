Pascua Florida is a Spanish term that means flowery festival or  feast of flowers. It usually refers to the Easter season. Pascua can, depending on context, refer to Easter, Christmas, Epiphany, Pentecost, or the week after holy week. For the connection to the name of the state of Florida, see Spanish Florida and Juan Ponce de León. Pascua Florida Day is usually celebrated on April 2 (the day on which Ponce de León first spotted Florida) unless it falls on a weekend, in which case the governor may declare either the preceding Friday or the following Monday as the state day.  According to the 2007 Florida Senate Statutes, the Governor of Florida may issue an annual proclamation designating April 2 as the state day and designating the week of March 27 to April 2 as "Pascua Florida Week" and calling upon public schools and citizens of Florida to observe the same as a patriotic occasion.
