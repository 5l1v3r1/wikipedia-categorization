The Bedford River Festival is held biennially in Bedford, England, on the banks of the River Great Ouse. It was founded in 1978 to celebrate the completion of a navigable route, by water, between Bedford and the coast  and is held over a weekend, normally in July (originally it was held annually on the late May bank holiday). It is the main tourist-attracting event in the town.  It has several events and attractions over the two days, usually including bands on the main stage, 2 community stages and acoustic stage, a road parade, boat shows/races, a raft race for local teams and a firework display. Along with the normal attractions of the fun fair, the River Festival also hosted the sports village, where local sports clubs could come and demonstrate their wares.  Bedford council describe the festival as the second largest free outdoor event in the United Kingdom, after the Notting Hill Carnival.
