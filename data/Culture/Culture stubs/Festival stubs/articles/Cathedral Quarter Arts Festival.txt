The Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival is an annual festival of music, comedy, theatre, art and literature that takes place in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The festival, now in its 13th year, primarily takes place in the first weeks of May in an area of Belfast known as the Cathedral Quarter, so-called because of its proximity to St. Anne's Cathedral. Regarded these days for its socially inclusive agenda and its eclectic programming blend of "big names", emerging acts and fringe performances, The Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival began life in May 2000 attracting an audience of just over 5,000. The Festival now regularly attracts over 60,000 people to over 150 events in Belfast's city centre.  This year's festival will take place between 3 May - 13 May in venues across the Cathedral Quarter.
