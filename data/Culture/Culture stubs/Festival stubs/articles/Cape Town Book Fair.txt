The Cape Town Book Fair is an international book fair in Sub-Saharan Africa that started through a joint venture between the Publishers Association of South Africa (PASA) and the Frankfurt Book Fair. It was established in 2006 to harness the momentum created by the Harare Book Fair and fill the gap left by the discontinuation of that book fair. The Cape Town Book Fair has since proved hugely popular with the general public. This year the Fair will be held in conjunction with the 29th International Publishers Association (IPA) Congress, allowing the Cape Town Book Fair to attract visitors from all over the world who are interested in the bestselling authors, poets and literary products from Africa, truly cementing its reputation as the biggest book fair in Sub-Saharan Africa.
