Ray City Old Fashion Plow Day is an annual antique tractor show held in Ray City, Georgia, United States. The event was started in March 2006 by Greg Harrell. The event is free to all the public and is located in Southern Georgia's Berrien County. Each year the event nearly doubles in spectators and participants. In 2009, the event consisted of over 75 tractors and 14 teams of mules and horses plowing in the fields, plus ATV & craft vendors, a NASCAR simulator, bounce houses for children, bluegrass music, a country comedian, tractor barrel racing, mule and wagon rides and other events. The 2010 event featured Ga Ag Commissioner Gary Black as grand marshal, over 50 vendors, including a mechanical bull, a beauty pageant, baking contest sponsored by Harveys Supermarkets, food from hamburgers to gator tail, antique cars, pony rides, Kubota RTV ride and drives, barrel racing demonstrations and more. With a crowd of over 5000 people, the 2010 show was a very successful event. Each year new attractions are added to help teach ag history to attendees.
