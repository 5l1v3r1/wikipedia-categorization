The Bay Area Circus Arts Festival (formerly the Berkeley Juggling and Unicycling Festival) was an annual 3-day event in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, held by the Berkeley Juggling Collective. It features workshops, casual instruction, and mini-competitions in various types of circus arts, including unicycling, hat-tossing, whip cracking, tumbling and multiple styles of juggling (contact, pin, diabolo, endurance, etc.).  The event is free for everyone and many people learn to juggle or unicycle at the festival.  A highlight of the multi-day festival is its vaudeville-style variety show, featuring local, national and international artists performing in live stage performances.  Past performances have included acrobatics, hoop dancing, aerial/silk dance, puppeteering, as well as the arts featured in the festival.    Past festival dates:
