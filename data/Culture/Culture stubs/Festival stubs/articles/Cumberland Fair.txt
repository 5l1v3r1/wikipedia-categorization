The Cumberland Fair is an annual farmer's fair held in Cumberland, Maine at the Cumberland Fairgrounds. It is put on by the Cumberland Farmers' Club and is usually held the last week in September. The annual Maine State Pumpkin and Squash Weigh-off is held at the fair and has been held there for the past 27 years. The winner of the event receives $500. An adult is limited to one entry in the giant squash and pumpkin weigh-off.  The 2015 winner of this event was Edwin Pierpont who harvested a 1,046 pound pumpkin.  The very first Cumberland Fair was held for two days on October 10–11, 1868 in the center of town in back of what is now Greely Junior High School. The land was provided by Capt. Enos Blanchard. On show were foods, handicrafts, vegetables of all shapes and sizes and also steers, especially in the traditional ox-pull. Horse racing was also featured.
