  The Chester Literature Festival is a literary festival held in Chester, UK every October since 1989. The festival is produced by and staged at Storyhouse Chester's new theatre, cinema and library. The annual autumn festival, packed with writers, books and ideas, is wide-ranging, presenting leading novelists, poets, actors, politicians, performers and theatre directors, but also explores the wider worlds of literary biography, history, travel, politics, wild life, food and popular culture.  The 2017 festival takes place 8 - 23 November.
