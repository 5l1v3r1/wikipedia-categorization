West Pride is a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender cultural festival in Gothenburg, Sweden, started in June 2007. The annual event is arranged by the Gothenburg Municipality and Västra Götaland region, in cooperation with RFSL and other LGBT organisations. It takes places at the city's foremost cultural institutions such as Gothenburg City Theatre, the Röhsska Museum and the Museum of World Culture. Gothenburg Film Festival shows queer films during the festival. In 2017, the city supported the event by displaying 1,000 rainbow flags.  Parade participants in 2017 carried signs urging acceptance of refugees and immigrants, and uring other European and Middle Eastern countries to accept LGBTQ people.
