The Oud Limburgs Schuttersfeest (abbreviated as OLS, literally translated Old Limburgian Shooters' Festival) is an annual shooting tournament during which shooting associations (Dutch: schutterijen; Limburgian: sjötterie) from across the region of Limburg, nowadays split in a Dutch and Belgian part, compete against each other.  The winner organizes the event the following year and takes home "De Um", the highest prize for a shooter (schutter). Each schutterij, or shooting association participates in the tournament with 6 members. Utilising an approximately 15 kg. carbine, with self-made bullets of lead, participants are required to shoot square blocks (called bölkes) from a stick. This is to be executed across 20 meter of distance. Ten "schutter" unions unite approximately 170 schutterij guilds, with a total of approximately 10,000 members in the Netherlands and Belgium.  The OLS is recognised and protected as Intangible cultural heritage of Flanders and the Netherlands.
