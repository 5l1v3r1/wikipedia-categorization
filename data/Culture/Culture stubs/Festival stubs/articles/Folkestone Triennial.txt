The Folkestone Triennial is an arts festival held every three years in Folkestone, England. Site-specific artworks are commissioned for what are often unusual locations around the town,  a number of works remaining in place permanently after the end of each festival.  Artists who have exhibited at the Triennial include Tracy Emin, Cornelia Parker, Martin Creed and Bob and Roberta Smith. During 2014, graffiti artist Banksy contributed Art Buff to the town, announcing that it was "part of the Folkestone triennial. Kind of".  The Folkestone Triennial was curated by Andrea Schlieker in 2008 and 2011,  and Lewis Biggs in 2014 and 2017.
