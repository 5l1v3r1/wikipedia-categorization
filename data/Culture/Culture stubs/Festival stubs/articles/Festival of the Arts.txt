The Festival of the Arts, or simply Festival is a three-day arts festival in Grand Rapids held on the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of June.  First held in 1970, after the 1969 installation of Alexander Calder's La Grande Vitesse, known as "The Calder" locally, Festival was quite small with only two stages and a few food booths.  Since then, Festival has greatly expanded, featuring multiple stages and food booths.  For three days, nearly 20,000 community volunteers play host to over half a million people  that enjoy food, art, and live performances.  The 2007 Festival featured 25 food booths, five stages, several hands-on art involvement activities, and several art exhibitions. According to the Library of Congress, Festival is the largest all volunteer arts festival in the United States.  Various local non-profit organizations run food booths at Festival. The dishes range from fair food such as elephant ears to ethnic food. Coordinates: 42°58′09″N 85°40′14″W﻿ / ﻿42.96907°N 85.67059°W﻿ / 42.96907; -85.67059
