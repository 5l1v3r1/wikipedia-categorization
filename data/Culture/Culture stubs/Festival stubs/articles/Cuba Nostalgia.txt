Cuba Nostalgia is an annual 3-day festival in Little Havana, a neighbourhood in Miami, Florida, where Cuban-Americans celebrate Cuba before it was taken over by the Castro regime.   The festival has also hosted a database to reconnect those who escaped from Cuba as children during Operation Peter Pan.
