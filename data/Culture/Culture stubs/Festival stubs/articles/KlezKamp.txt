KlezKamp was a yearly Klezmer music and Yiddish culture festival which took place in late December in New York State. Founded in 1985 by ethnomusicologist and award-winning record and radio producer Henry Sapoznik,  the program was designed to create an innovative and intensive environment where senior practitioners of the Yiddish folk arts—klezmer music, Yiddish song, Yiddish language, literature and poetry, the culinary and visual arts—pass on their life skills to newer generations. Held every December at the Hudson Valley Resort, a hotel in New York's historic Catskill region, it attracted some 500 people from around the world who came to study with a veritable "Who's Who" of contemporary Yiddish life and culture.  The last Klezkamp was held in 2014, although many similar programs, such as KlezKanada, emerged from it.
