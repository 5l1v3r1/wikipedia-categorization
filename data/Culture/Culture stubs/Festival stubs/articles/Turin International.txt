The Turin International was a world's fair held in Turin in 1911  titled Esposizione internazionale dell'industria e del lavoro. It received 4,012,776 visits and covered 247 acres.  The fair opened on 29 April,  was held just nine years after an earlier Turin fair which had focused on the decorative arts, and at the same time as another Italian fair in Rome, also with an arts focus. This fair deliberately distinguished itself by focusing on industry and labour.  The fair was held in the Parco del Valentino (as were the three previous Turin fairs in 1884, 1885 and 1902 and the subsequent 1924 Turin fair).  Participating countries were Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Peru, Russian Empire, Kingdom of Serbia, Siam, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, United States and Uruguay. The Art Nouveau Hungarian pavilion was designed by Emil Töry, Maurice Pogány and Dénes Györgyi;  the Brazilian pavilion incorporated paintings by Arthur Timótheo da Costa;  the Siamese pavilion was designed by Mario Tamagno and Annibale Rigotti and had a multi-colored roof with a gold dome  and the Ottoman pavilion was designed by Léon Gurekian.
