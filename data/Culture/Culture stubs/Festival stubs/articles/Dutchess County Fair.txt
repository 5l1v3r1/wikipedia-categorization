The Dutchess County Fair is held annually in Rhinebeck, New York, usually during the last full week in August. The fair was started in 1845 mainly as an old-fashioned agricultural event in which farmers would come and show off their livestock and crops. Currently, the fair hosts approximately half a million people per year, and is the second largest county Fair in New York State.
