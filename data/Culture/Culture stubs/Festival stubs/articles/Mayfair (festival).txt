Mayfair Festival of the Arts is a multidisciplinary arts festival   (visual arts, performing arts, garden arts, children's art, art education) formally produced by Mayfair Inc, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The festival is held annually in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Mayfair Festival of the Arts has been a Lehigh Valley tradition since 1986 and it is making a comeback at Cedar Crest College.[tone] Cedar Crest College is taking Mayfair "back to its roots"  by giving festival-goers the same experience that they had and loved decades ago.[tone] The event is planned to be held on Cedar Crest's campus and to feature food and craft vendors, artists, music, and live performances  over Memorial Day weekend, May 25-27, 2018.
