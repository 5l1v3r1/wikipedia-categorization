The Up Your Alley Fair, most commonly referred to by locals as Dore Alley Fair or simply Dore Alley /ˈdɔːri/ is a leather and fetish event held in San Francisco, California on the last Sunday of July on Folsom Street between 9th and 10th Streets and on Dore Street from Howard Street to half a block southeast of Folsom Street. The streets are lined with vendors' booths, and a sound stage (for dancing) is located at the 10th Street end of Folsom Street. The first Up Your Alley Street Fair was held in 1985 on Ringold Street between 8th and 9th Streets. The event was moved to its current location on Folsom Street at Dore Street in 1987. Among the original rationales for this fair was to illustrate, in the face of redevelopment pressures, that the South of Market neighborhood was already home to a community and that this community was still active and organized in spite of the AIDS epidemic.  Run by the same non-profit organization that produces the much larger Folsom Street Fair, the world's largest BDSM fetish and leather event, Up Your Alley Fair draws several thousand fetish enthusiasts and onlookers and serves not only as a "warm-up" event for the organizers but also as a less tourist-focused event for locals. This fair is one of many large neighborhood street fairs San Francisco has weekly towards the end of summer, ending with the Castro Street Fair the first weekend of October.  Treasure Island Media, Hot Desert Knights and Titan Media are regular attendants.
