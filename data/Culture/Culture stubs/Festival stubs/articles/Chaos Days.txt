Chaos Days (German: Chaostage) was an annual punk gathering, often violent, held in Hanover, Germany starting in 1982 and reviving in the mid-1990s. In 1982, after several punk meetings in Wuppertal, which are considered forerunners of Chaos Days, the first Chaos Days occurred in Hanover.  The gathering was intended to protest a police plan to create a reference library of photographs of punks.  Thereafter, "official" Chaos Days were held in 1983, 1984, and 1985. The most well-known Chaos Days took place in 1994 and 1995   and resulted in huge riots and the destruction of cars and buildings.  A whole supermarket was damaged and alcoholic beverages were stolen by punks. These "chaos days" were the main topic of TV debates and newspapers for several weeks. Popular bands like WIZO spontaneously played a show there, and Terrorgruppe wrote a now-classic song about it ("Wochenendticket", named after a train ticket that most punks used in order to get to Hanover from all across the country). Chaos Days USA Chaos Days were organized in the United States in 1995 and 1996, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area during the same period of time as the German Chaos Days. Chaos Days USA were criticized for the same reasons as the German Chaos Days; critics[who?] claimed that Chaos Days had "No social value".
