The Orange Blossom Carnival is an annual celebration held every April in Adana, Turkey. It is an inspiration to the blossom scent that covers the orange tree lined streets during early April. While some of the carnival celebrations occur at organized, large-scale events, others are simply spontaneous street celebrations.  The carnival begins in early April and has the simple slogan "Nisan'da Adana'da" (In April In Adana). It is one of the first annual carnivals in Turkey.  The Orange Blossom Carnival of Adana is accompanied by many concerts, shows and processions notable for vibrant colors.
