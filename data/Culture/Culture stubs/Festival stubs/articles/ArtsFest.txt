  ArtsFest was an annual arts festival held in September in Birmingham, England. Between 1997 and 2012 ArtsFest brought together free short demonstrations of dance, music, film and theatre to concert halls, theatres, and open-air stages in various parts of central Birmingham. The main location was Centenary Square with events in Chamberlain Square, Victoria Square, Brindleyplace, Eastside, the Custard Factory, and many others. ArtsFest was organised by Birmingham City Council and sponsored by commercial and non-commercial organisations. In early 2013 Birmingham City Council announced the festival had been cancelled with immediate effect.
