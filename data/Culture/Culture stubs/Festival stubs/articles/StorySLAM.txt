The StorySLAM is a live storytelling competition in the vein of poetry slams  organized by The Moth, a non-profit literary society from New York City, since 2001. Storytellers (slammers) have 5 minutes each to tell a story, based on a theme chosen for the event.  No notes are allowed: stories must be told and not read.   The events, held in cities around the United States, now also include a competition;  participants are judged by teams of audience members.  The organization also holds a biannual Grand Slam competition.   Notables performing at StorySLAMs include Moby, Lily Taylor, and Frank McCourt.
