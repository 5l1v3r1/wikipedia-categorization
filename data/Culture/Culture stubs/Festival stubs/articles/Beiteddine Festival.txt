The Beiteddine Festival (Arabic: مهرجان بيت الدين‎) is an annual summer festival that takes place in Beiteddine Palace in Beiteddine, Lebanon.  It was launched amidst war and destruction in the middle of the 80's. It came as an act of faith in Lebanon's cultural specificity and its power of creativity and artistic freedom. It was a call for normality in the middle of the chaos and madness of the civil war.  It was established in 1984 with local artistic performances and it gradually started having regional and international performances. Over the years it has included concerts or performances related to classical music, dance, theatre, opera, jazz, and modern world music. The festival takes place in the large 200-year-old Beiteddine Palace in the Chouf Mountains, in Lebanon.
