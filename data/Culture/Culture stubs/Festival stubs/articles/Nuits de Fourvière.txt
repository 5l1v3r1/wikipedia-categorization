The festival has taken place every summer since 1946 in the Théâtre antique de Fourvière, and in the Odéon de Lyon (since 1952) in the 5th arrondissement near the Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvière.   The festival was first managed by the Charbonnières-les-Bains casino, then by the Rhône department starting in the early 1990s. Since 1 January 2005 it has been managed by Grand Lyon.  It is tradition for spectators to throw their seat cushions toward the stage at the end of the performance to show their appreciation.
