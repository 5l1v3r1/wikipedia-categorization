A Star Spangled Salute is live coverage of the EQT Flashes of Freedom Fireworks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This special is shown on WPXI, an NBC affiliate. A Star Spangled Salute has aired on WPXI Channel 11 since July 4, 1990. The fireworks have been provided by Zambelli Fireworks. Before July 4, 1994, the fireworks show was on July 3 instead of the 4th. Some of the hosts of A Star Spangled Salute have been Chris Long, David Johnson, Bob Bruce, and Darieth Chisolm. The fireworks show usually start at around 9:37Â p.m. if not a little earlier than that. The music for the Pittsburgh fireworks has been produced by KDKA (AM). Up until 2003 the music was produced by WDVE. Then in 2004 the Three Rivers Regatta combined with the event and WSHH produced the music from 2004 to 2007. Before WSHH took over the music it was a rockish type of music, in line with WDVE's format. When WSHH took over, the music had more of a patriotic tone to it. For 2009 and the foreseeable future the new radio station providing the music for the fireworks is KDKA (AM). KDKA provides a mix of classic rock, modern pop, and patriotic tunes to use for the fireworks. The location for fireworks are about a mile down from The Point in the Ohio River. The fireworks are set up and launched from a series of three barges in the middle of the Ohio River. The areas that people can watch the fireworks from are Point State Park, Mount Washington, West End Overlook, and the North Side.
