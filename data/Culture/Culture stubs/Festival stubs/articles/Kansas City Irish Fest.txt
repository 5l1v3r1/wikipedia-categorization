Kansas City Irish Fest celebrates Celtic pride in Kansas City dedicated to promoting the culture, music, character and history of Ireland and of the Irish people who call Kansas City home. Voted by visitors as the "Best Ethnic Festival" in Kansas City in 2011, 2010 and 2009, and the "Best Festival" in Kansas City in 2008 & 2007,   Founded in 2003 and located in the heart of Kansas City at Crown Center Square, Kansas City Irish Fest hosts more than 90,000 people each Labor Day weekend. The KC Irish Fest annually presents dozens of musicians, dancers, comedians and entertainment from around the world on 8 stages.
