The State Fair Meadowlands (formerly the Meadowlands Fair) is a carnival held every summer at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It derives its name from State Fair Stores, which run the carnival. It should also not be confused with the New Jersey State Fair, Sussex County Farm and Horse Show in Augusta, New Jersey. The fair is held in the parking lot that surrounds the MetLife Stadium and runs for two weeks in late June and early July. It attracts over 300,000 visitors per year.  Other than the rides, there are free shows and events at the fair such as pig racing, a petting zoo, a circus, and a magic show. The fair also displays fireworks on select nights. At around 11:30 PM on June 22, 2017, which was the opening night for the 2017 season of the fair, gunshots were fired on the fairgrounds. Guests ran away from the area where the shots were being fired off. Thankfully, no one was shot or injured.   Coordinates: 40°48′51″N 74°04′30″W﻿ / ﻿40.81421°N 74.07491°W﻿ / 40.81421; -74.07491
