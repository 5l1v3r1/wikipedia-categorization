Wicked Faire was a yearly adult-themed fair with programming geared towards ages 16 and up.   The last Wicked Faire, Wicked Faire: Reborn , was February 2-4, 2018 in Piscataway, NJ.  This event was created by and run by Widdershins, INC, d/b/a Jeff Mach Events.  In January 2018, former volunteers and employees of Wicked Faire and other events organized by Jeff Mach Events (JME) accused JME founder Jeff Mach of sexual misconduct and questionable practices surrounding volunteer and employee compensation and event safety.   A new company, Silver Phoenix Society, attempted to purchase the intellectual property from Widdershins. Tammy Shipps, the president of Silver Phoenix and one of the panel presenters at Wicked Faire: Reborn, purchased the IP on March 13, 2018.
