The Chicago 1992 World's Fair was planned to be held in Chicago as the first World's Fair to take place in the United States since the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans. The Bureau of International Expositions approved Chicago's bid to host a World's Fair in 1982, but three years later the city withdrew its offer to host the event following the evaporation of political support and concerns that the event would not be able to recoup its expenses.
