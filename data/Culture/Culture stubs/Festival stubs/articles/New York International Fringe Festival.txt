The New York International Fringe Festival, or FringeNYC, is a fringe theater festival and one of the largest multi-arts events in North America.  It takes place over the course of two weeks every August, spread on more than 20 stages across several neighborhoods in downtown Manhattan, notably the Lower East Side, the East Village, and Greenwich Village. Attendance in 2009 topped 75,000 people. Unlike most Fringe festivals, FringeNYC uses a jury-based selection process.   Around 200 shows, out of a much larger pool of applicants, are selected for inclusion each year. The festival was founded in 1997 by Aaron Beall, John Clancy, Jonathan Harris (also known as Ezra Buzzington), and (current Artistic Director) Elena K. Holy, and is produced by The Present Company. Notable shows that premiered at FringeNYC include Urinetown, Dog Sees God, the musical adaptation of Debbie Does Dallas, and the American English-language premiere of The Black Rider. Other feature shows included Charlie Victor Romeo, which premiered at New York Lower East Side theatre Collective:Unconscious. FringeNYC includes many component events, such as FringeU (educational events), FringeART (art events), FringeAL FRESCO (free outdoor performances), and FringeJR (children's events). At the conclusion of the festival around 20 shows are selected to participate in the FringeNYC Encore Series which runs for an additional two weeks in September.
