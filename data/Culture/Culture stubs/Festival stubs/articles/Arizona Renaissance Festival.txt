The Arizona Renaissance Festival is a Renaissance-themed amusement park and Renaissance fair in Arizona located in Apache Junction east of the Phoenix metro area near Gold Canyon. The Renaissance Festival usually runs from late winter to mid spring every year, as the winters and springs in the area are actually very mild and pleasant. The fairgrounds feature a 14-stage theater, a 30-acre (120,000 m2) circus, regularly scheduled jousting tournaments and a feast.  Also provided is the Artisan Marketplace, an outdoor arts and crafts market located throughout the park in which merchants from around the nation sell many different kinds of hand-made or period-themed goods. Other staples of the park include a petting zoo, several live performances, and a selection of food such as 'steak on a stake', sausages, turkey legs, and others.
