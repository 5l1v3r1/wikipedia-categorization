Pride Fest is a locally organized gay pride celebration held in Bismarck, North Dakota and Mandan, North Dakota. The three-day event is held in mid-summer, usually in a public park. The first Pride Fest was held in 2004.  Unlike other, larger pride events, the Pride Fest does not include a parade or other large-scale events, but continues the trend of smaller, more personal pride events in cities with noticeable, but not large, gay populations. Individual events at the Pride Fest include karaoke, a dance, information booths, and a Pride Fest Program Event, featuring awards and entertainment. The Bismarck-Mandan Unitarian Universalist Fellowship was awarded the 2005 Pride Award.
