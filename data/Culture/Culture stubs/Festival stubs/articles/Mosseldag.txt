Mosseldag or Day of the Mussels  is an annual event in the Dutch town of Yerseke. The event takes place on the third Saturday of August.  Annually, around 50,000 people  visit the event. They come from the close region, but also from Belgium, Germany and France. Mosseldag is known for eating mussels, a local delicacy, and other seafood. You can go freely on a trip over the Eastern Scheldt with a mussel fishing boat (or watch the fleet go by), walk along the fair and watch the tattoo and fireworks in the evening.
