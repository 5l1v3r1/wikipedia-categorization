Coordinates: 46°28′N 6°51′E﻿ / ﻿46.467°N 6.850°E﻿ / 46.467; 6.850 The Fête des Vignerons is a traditional festival which takes place in Vevey, in Switzerland. It has been organised by the Confrérie des Vignerons (Brotherhood of Winegrowers) in Vevey since 1797. The organising committee is free to choose how often the festival takes place, but the maximum number of times is five times in a century. Up to now, the interval between two festivals has varied between 14 and 28 years. The next festival will take place in 2019, which will be 20 years after the preceding one (1999). The festival features a show celebrating the world of winemaking; many performances take place in the market place near the shore of Lake Geneva,      and festivities also take place in the town itself.
