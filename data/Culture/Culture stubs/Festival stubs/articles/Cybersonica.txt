Cybersonica is an annual multimedia festival for electronic music, sound, art and technology in London, England.  The festival was established around 2002, supported by the Arts Council England and other sponsors. It invites sonic and digital artists to submit new pieces for commissioning, with four new pieces to be selected in 2007. In 2007 Cybersonica kicked off the festival at Tate Britain's Late at Tate evening on 6 April, bringing numerous live performances, sonic artworks, audiovisual artists, DJs and short films to the venue. Among its participants are Brian Duffy's Modified Toy Orchestra, The Sancho Plan, Martyn Ware, the founding member of Heaven 17 and The Human League, with his 3D sound system from The Illustrious Company, which he runs with Vince Clarke, body>data>space, Future Shorts and others. In Spring 2007 Cybersonica hosts Soundwaves, a six-week exhibition at Kinetica Museum in Old Spitalfields Market. Throughout the years, the Cybersonica festival has attracted headline artists and witnessed the debut of Guitar Hero II during its 2006 gathering.
