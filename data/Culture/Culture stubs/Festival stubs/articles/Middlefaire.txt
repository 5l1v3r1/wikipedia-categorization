They are arranged in a 17th-century English village.   The fair site is located at 8581 State Highway 171 at the intersection of County Road 1458, five miles north of Hillsboro.   All three fairs feature a variety of merchandise and entertainers typically singers, belly dancers, skits, musicians, pub sings, sword fights, jousting, pirate battles with historic working cannons, and other entertainments.   Flush toilets and camping are available on site.  Entertainers and merchants typically dress to fit the theme of the particular faire. While the site is primarily mid 17th century, this is not strictly adhered to, especially with the fantasy-themed Magical & Medieval Fantasy Faire
