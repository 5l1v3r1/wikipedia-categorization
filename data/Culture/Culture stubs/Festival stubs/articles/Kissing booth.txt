A kissing booth is a carnival attraction where the person running the booth kisses customers for money, often to raise funds for charity.   Domestic animals may also be used for comedic purposes.  Marnie Stern ran a kissing booth at some of her concerts.   When one person kisses many people, it can spread germs, including mononucleosis, oral herpes virus, the cold, and the flu. An allergic reaction can occur if one of the two kissers has recently eaten a food that the other person is allergic to.
