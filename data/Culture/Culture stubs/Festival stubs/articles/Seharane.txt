The Seharane was celebrated by Kurdish Jews as a multi-day nature festival starting after the last day of Passover commemorating the day chametz could be brought to the temple as a Firstfruits offering (Leviticus 2:12). It coincided with Mimouna. Communities would leave their villages and camp out for several days, celebrating with eating and drinking, nature walks, singing and dancing. The tradition has an at least 2,000-year-old continuity; it is influenced by the Akkadian spring festival of Akitu and it was modified into Seharane which is also celebrated in the spring, a day after the Jewish holiday of Passover. Its observance was interrupted after the relocation of this community to Israel in the 1950s. In recent years it has been revived but, because of the already-widespread celebration of Mimouna in Israel, the celebration of the Seharane was moved to Chol HaMoed Sukkot. This, though, has marked a decline of the Seharane activity because it has  traditionally been celebrated in spring since ancient times. Traditionally, the Seharane has been a secular activity but there are special prayers dedicated to the holiday as well as an Inauguration of a Torah scroll and marriage celebrations.
