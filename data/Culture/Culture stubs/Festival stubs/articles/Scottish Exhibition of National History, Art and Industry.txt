  The Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry was held in Glasgow in 1911. It was the third of 4 international exhibitions held in Glasgow, Scotland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exhibition followed the lead of the previous two exhibitions (Glaswegian exhibition (1888) and Glasgow International Exhibition (1901)) and took place at Kelvingrove Park. It ran from 2 May to 4 November  1911, and recorded over 9.3 million visits.  The fair was held close to the River Kelvin structured around the Stewart Memorial and included a Palace of History (based on the Falkland Palace,  a Palace of Industry, Concert Hall and an Aviation Building.  Entertainments included boat trips, an aerial railway and a Highland Village (from which a cairn marking the village remains).  The land used is now a park.  Profits from the fair were used to fund the establishment of a Chair of Scottish History and Literature at the University of Glasgow the post was originally filled by Robert Rait and is now occupied by Edward J. Cowan.
