New Year's glasses are novelty eyeglasses in the numerical shape of the coming year usually worn during New Year's Eve parties.  They were invented and patented   by Richard Sclafani and Peter Cicero in 1990, although other companies have produced similar versions.  New Year's glasses' inspiration and popularity arose from the fact that the two digits in the middle of the year number (9 and 0 from the years 1990-2009) had holes suitable for looking through or mounting lenses into.  New Year's Glasses are often sold at New Year's Eve events and parties. Street vendors in NYC are known to sell the glasses with extremely high markups. In 2015, the average cost of glasses in Times Square was upwards of $25.  New Year's glasses can restrict vision due to the large frame. The large frame can also cause discomfort.
