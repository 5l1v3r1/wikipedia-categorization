The Minneapolis Aquatennial is an annual outdoor event held in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, during the third full week of July.   Originating in 1940, the Minneapolis Aquatennial celebrates the city's famous lakes, rivers, and streams. Advertised as The Best Days of Summer the festivities previously included some 70 events, including sand castle building, beach volleyball, a tennis invitational, a triathlon, parades, Subway Block Party and the final Target Fireworks.  The annual "Milk Carton Boat Races," featured various divisions of boat races with boats constructed of milk cartons.  The fireworks display is one of the largest in the country, and larger than the city's Fourth of July celebration. Minneapolis celebrated its centennial in 1956 in conjunction with the  Aquatennial.  The city's sesquicentennial was July 18–27, 2008, the year Minnesota celebrated 150 years of statehood.  The Queen of the Lakes Scholarship Program is a week-long candidate program for women ages 18–22 that is held in Minneapolis in conjunction with the Minneapolis Aquatennial every July. The Queen of the Lakes and two Aquatennial Princesses are chosen to represent the festival and city of Minneapolis all over the state, nation and world.  Fifty young women representing communities throughout the state of Minnesota participate in this once-in-a-lifetime program.
