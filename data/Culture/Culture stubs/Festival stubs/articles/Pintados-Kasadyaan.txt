The Pintados Festival is a cultural-religious celebration  in Tacloban based on the body-painting traditions of the ancient tattooed "pintados" warriors.   In 1986, the Pintados Foundation, Inc. was formed by the people of Tacloban to organize this festival in honor of Sr. Santo Ni√±o.   Years later, it was merged with the Kasadyaan Festival which is always held on June 29.
