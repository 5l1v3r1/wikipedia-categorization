The Royal Institution of South Wales is a Welsh learned society founded in Swansea in 1835 as the Swansea Philosophical and Literary Society with objectives: In 1838, the Society received its Royal charter as the Royal Institution. The Annual Report of the Swansea Literary and Scientific Society was an annual magazine first published by 'Swansea Literary and Scientific Society' in 1850. In addition to reports on the society's activities it contained articles on scientific subjects, history, and antiquarianism.   It later published a journal known as Minerva until 2006. This has now been renamed The Swansea History Journal (thus avoiding confusion with an arts magazine called Minerva).
