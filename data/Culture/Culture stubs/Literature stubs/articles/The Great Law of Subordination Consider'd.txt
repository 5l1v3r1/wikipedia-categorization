The Great Law of Subordination Consider'd; Or,the Insolence and Unsufferable Behaviour of SERVANTS in England Duly Enquired is a 1724 pamphlet by Daniel Defoe.  Similarly to Every-body's Business, Is No-body's Business (1725), it focuses on issues related to servants.  It also revises themes which its author had already dealt with in An Essay Upon Projects (1697).
