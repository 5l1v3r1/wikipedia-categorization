Fictional encyclopaedism is a term used in literary studies      and is not to be confused with fictional encyclopedias such as the Encyclopedia Galactica, Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Fictional encyclopaedism is a style of fiction writing; a literary technique. James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick are examples of fictional encyclopaedism due to their didactic tone and reach for infinite inclusiveness and encyclopedic range of topics with essay-like text. Peter Wilkins stresses the conveyance of vast amount of information and the attempt at nearly exhaustive coverage of subject matter .
