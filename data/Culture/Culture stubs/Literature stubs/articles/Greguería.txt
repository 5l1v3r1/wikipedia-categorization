A greguería is a short statement, usually one sentence, in which the author expresses a philosophical, pragmatic, or humorous idea in a witty and original way.  A greguería is roughly similar to an aphorism or a one-liner joke in comedy.  It is a rhetorical and stylistic device used in Spanish and Latin American literature. Ramón Gómez de la Serna is considered the father of the greguería, which he defined as humor plus metaphor. Gómez de la Serna first used the greguería in about 1910.
