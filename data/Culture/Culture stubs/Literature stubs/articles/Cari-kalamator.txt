Cari-kalamator  (Persian: کاریکلماتور‎) is the name of the Parviz Shapour's writings. The first time the term was used was in the Khoosheh Journal's editorial in 1968. in that Journal, Ahmad Shamlou said: this word is derived from "caricature" and "kalameh" (in Persian: کلمه) (it means word). Shapour's writings are cartoons that have been expressed through words.
