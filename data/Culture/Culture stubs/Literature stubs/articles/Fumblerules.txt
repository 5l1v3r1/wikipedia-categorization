A fumblerule is a rule of language or linguistic style, humorously written in such a way that it breaks this rule.   Fumblerules are a form of self-reference. The science editor George L. Trigg published a list of such rules in 1979.  The term fumblerules was coined in a list of such rules compiled by William Safire on Sunday, 4 November 1979,   in his column "On Language" in the New York Times. Safire later authored a book titled Fumblerules: A Lighthearted Guide to Grammar and Good Usage, which was reprinted in 2005 as How Not to Write: The Essential Misrules of Grammar.
