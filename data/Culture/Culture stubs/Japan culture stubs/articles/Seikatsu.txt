In Japanese social science, seikatsu (生活) is similar to livelihood; the conscious and non-submissive activity of ordinary people in shaping their lives.  Its agents are seikatsusha (生活者), referring to ordinary people as distinct from the more rarefied concepts of "citizen" (shimin, 市民) or "member of the nation" (kokumin, 国民).  The study of seikatsu is an interdisciplinary field of the social sciences.
