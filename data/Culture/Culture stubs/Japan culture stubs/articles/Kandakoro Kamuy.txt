Kandakoro Kamuy is the Ainu kamuy (god) of the sky.  He is the prime originator of Ainu mythology, responsible either directly or indirectly for the creation of all things.  While Kandakoro Kamuy is believed to be a powerful kamuy, he is not presented as a supreme being.  He is also in many ways a background figure:  while his presence was necessary for the creation of the world, he plays only a small part in subsequent events, often as a mediator.   He is considered the overseer and master of the sky, much as Chikap Kamuy is the overseer of the land. He appointed Moshirikara Kamuy to shape the earth, preparing it for inhabitation by humankind.
