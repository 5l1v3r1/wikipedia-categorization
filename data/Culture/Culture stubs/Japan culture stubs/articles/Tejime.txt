Tejime (手締め), also called teuchi (手打ち), is a Japanese custom of ceremonial rhythmic hand clapping, typically accompanied by enthusiastic exclamation by the participants,  performed at the end of a special event to bring the occasion to a peaceful, lively close. Tejime may be performed at the conclusion of such events as a celebration, meeting of shareholders, or the close of bargaining or other business negotiations.  Tejime observes fulfillment, realization, and completion.  Tejime begins by a call from the leader, typically "ote wo haishaku" (お手を拝借), after which the participants, just before clapping their hands, usually yell "iyō'o" (イヨーオ), "yo" (ヨッ) or "mō itchō" (もう一丁) in order to synchronize timing. Tejime is an abbreviated form of teuchi de shimeru (手打ちで締める), "teuchi" meaning "to strike a deal" or "to come to an agreement" and shimeru (締める) meaning "to tie" or "to fasten" (in this case, "to close"). Teuchi is used synonymously with tejime, with the former preferred in the Kansai Region. There are various ways of clapping hands. The main types are: For example, in the case of sanbon-jime, the ceremony would go like this: Other types of tejime include Ōsaka-jime (大阪締め) and Hakata te ippon (博多手一本), which is performed during the Hakata-Gion Yamakasa Festival (博多祇園山笠), held in Fukuoka in July.
