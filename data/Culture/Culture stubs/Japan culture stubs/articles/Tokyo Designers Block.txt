Tokyo Designers Block (TDB) is one of Tokyo's main recurring design events. It is a 5-day exhibition showcasing hundreds of international and domestic designers of all backgrounds. Works are displayed all through Tokyo's fashionable districts, in shop windows, exhibition spaces and galleries.  TDB is the brainchild of Teruo Kurosaki, president of Aoyama design shop Id√©e, who got the idea following a visit to London's designersblock. "TDB is not a design event nor a trade show of product designs; we are willing to make fun of design and try the best how design can do to the society in Tokyo."
