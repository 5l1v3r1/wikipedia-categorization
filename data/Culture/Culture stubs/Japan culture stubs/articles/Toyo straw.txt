Toyo straw is a type of shiny smooth straw made chiefly in Japan with shellacked rice paper. This material is commonly used for straw hats and fedoras.  These straws are smooth to feel and turn to a shiny, viscose white or a golden copper when the product is finished. Soft to touch and light to wear and normally finished with a plastic glaze. Hats made from Toyo straw are mostly machine-made, and so they are generally sold in the medium to low price range.  See straw hats
