The Inariyama Kofun (稲荷山古墳) is a keyhole-shaped kofun (tomb), zenpō-kōen-fun, located in Gyōda, Saitama. It is one of the nine kofun clustered in the city. To avoid confusion, it is occasionally called the Saitama Inariyama Kofun, for kofun with the same name are found in other regions. The full length of the tomb is 120 m, the second largest in the prefecture after the Futagoyama Kofun. The width and height of the front, rectangular section are 74 m and 10.7 m, respectively. The diameter and height of the rear, circular section are 62 m and 11.7 m, respectively. The Inariyama Sword was excavated here in 1968 and has a gold-inlaid inscription of more than 115 Chinese characters, which was deemed an important historic discovery. The sword is held in Saitama Prefectural Museum of the Sakitama Ancient Burial Mounds (埼玉県立さきたま史跡の博物館) as a national treasure of Japan. From Hanyū IC on the Tōhoku Expressway, drive north for 12 km.
