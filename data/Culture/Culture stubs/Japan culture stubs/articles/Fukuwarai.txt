Fukuwarai (福笑い), or in English, "Lucky Laugh", is a Japanese game played around the Lunar New Year. The game is usually played by children, but adults may play also. The game is similar to that of Pin the Tail on the Donkey except for being performed on a table. The players of Fukuwarai put parts of the face (such as the eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth) onto a blank face. Recently, there have been computer and online games created to simulate Fukuwarai.
