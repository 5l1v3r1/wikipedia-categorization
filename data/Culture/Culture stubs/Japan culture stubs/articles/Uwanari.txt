Uwanari (嫐, meaning both "second wife" and "jealousy") was a kabuki play of the Kabuki Jūhachiban, first performed in 1699. It is no longer extant. Uwanari-uchi (後妻打ち, "beating the second wife") was a long-standing custom in which the ex-wives, second wives, and concubines of husbands beat each other.[clarification needed] This goes back to the Heian period and lasted until the Edo period.
