Bunjinbana (文人花, "literati flowers") is a style of ikebana that is inspired by traditional Chinese landscapes. It developed from the Bunjinga (文人画 "literati painting") movement among different Japanese artists of the late Edo period, who however all shared an admiration for traditional Chinese culture and paintings.      Morimono (盛り物) is counted as a sub-form of bunjinbana by some school.   Media related to Bunjinbana at Wikimedia Commons
