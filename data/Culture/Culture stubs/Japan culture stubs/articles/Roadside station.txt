A Roadside Station (道の駅, Michi no eki) is a government-designated rest area found along roads and highways in Japan. In addition to providing places for travelers to rest, they are intended to promote local tourism and trade.  Shops may sell local produce, snacks, souvenirs, and other goods. All roadside stations provide 24-hour access to parking, public toilets and facilities for sharing information. As of May 2016, there are 1093 Roadside Stations across Japan: 117 in Hokkaido, 150 in the Tohoku-area, 167 in the Kanto-area, 76 in the Hokuriku-area, 125 in the Chubu-area, 138 in the Kinki-area, 101 in the Chugoku-area, 84 in the Shikoku-area, 135 in the Kyushu- and Okinawa-areas.
