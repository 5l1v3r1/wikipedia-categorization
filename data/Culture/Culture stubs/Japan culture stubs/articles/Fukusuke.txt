Fukusuke (福助) are traditional china dolls associated with good luck in Japan. A Fukusuke doll is the depiction of a man kneeling seiza style, with a large head and a topknot. It was originally a doll enshrined in tea houses or brothels in the Edo period to bring good luck. In those days, it was considered that Fukusuke would bring "perennial youth, wealth and honor."  A fukusuke doll can be seen on the album cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles.
