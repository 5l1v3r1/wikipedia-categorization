A getabako (下駄箱) is a  shoe cupboard in Japan, usually situated in the genkan, an entryway or porch of the house. In Japan, it is considered uncouth to not remove one's shoes before entering the house.   Near the getabako is a slipper rack,  and most people in Japan wear slippers around the house, except for rooms which have tatami flooring, as they are bad for the floor. The getabako is usually made of wood and bamboo, and there are many sold all over the world. The word getabako is from geta (下駄, Japanese clog) and hako (箱, "box").  Usually there are big getabako in schools and kindergartens, and each student has his own section. Sometimes students store personal things there as well, or use them to leave love letters.
