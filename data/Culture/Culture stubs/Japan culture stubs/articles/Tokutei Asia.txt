 Tokutei Asia (特定アジア, tokutei Ajia, abbr.  Toku-A (特ア), literally "specific-Asia") is a term used on Japanese Internet forums for East Asian countries which have obvious negative views of Japan or where anti-Japanese sentiments are still strong, or the regions which have political tensions and disputes with Japan, namely, South Korea, North Korea, and China.  Taiwan is usually considered to be a Japanophile country with its colonial relations with Japan in the late 19th and the 20th century. Hong Kong and Macau, which are part of China, but to varying degrees govern their own affairs, are not included within the term.  The term "Tokutei Asia" is used for Japanese internet users who don't like South Korea, North Korea and China. Some people feel bad impression to this term. Therefore, use of this term is limited to specific right wingers.
