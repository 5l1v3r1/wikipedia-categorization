The kaco is a type of shamanistic drum of the Ainu people, primarily those of Sakhalin Island.  The instrument is made of a wooden branch of willow or larch bent into an ellipse with a membrane of musk deer skin; the drum beater is covered in dogskin.  The word kaco may be a loan-word from the Orok language.  The drum may be more formally called senisteh, a word referring to charms in general.
