Giri choco (義理チョコ, literally, "obligation chocolate") is chocolate given by women to men on Valentine's Day in Japan. It is a relatively inexpensive type of chocolate women give to male co-workers, casual acquaintances, and others to whom they have no romantic attachment.   Men generally reciprocate by giving women cookies and other gifts on White Day, celebrated on March 14.
