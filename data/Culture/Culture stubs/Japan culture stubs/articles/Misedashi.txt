Misedashi (店だし,  making business public) in Japan is a ceremony where a shikomi (an aspiring geiko ) becomes a maiko (an apprentice geiko) and officially begins their career. After the ceremony is over the maiko will be guided through the streets by an otokoshi-san (male dresser) to their teachers and other okiya to thank them for their support and let them know they have debuted. The maiko is usually 15 years when the ceremony takes place. Because the debut is considered one of the most important moments of a geisha career, only the most formal attire is worn.
