The following list includes societies that have been identified as matrilineal or matrilocal in ethnographic literature. "Matrilineal" means property is passed down through the maternal line on the death of the mother, not that of the father. The Akans of Ghana, West Africa, are matrlineals. Akans are the largest ethnic group in Ghana. They are made of the Akims, Asantes, Fantis, Akuapims, Kwahus, Denkyiras, Brongs, Akwamus, Krachis etc. "Matrilocal" means new families are established in proximity to the brides' extended family of origin, not that of the groom. Note: separate in the marriage column refers to the practice of husbands and wives living in separate locations, often informally called walking marriages. See the articles for the specific cultures that practice this for further description. Charles Becker  1993
