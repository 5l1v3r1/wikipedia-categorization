The collections belong to Gothenburg University Library. The library collects and organizes material on gender issues. This includes everything from academic theses to small leaflets and debate articles. The collections also comprise a manuscript collection with texts and photographs. Parts of these have been digitized and are now freely available on the Internet. A wide range of women’s journals, from the 19th century onwards, are also digitized. KvinnSam produces four databases: GENA, GREDA and JÄMDA have all been developed in collaboration with the Swedish National Secretariat for Gender Research. The references in the databases are indexed with keywords chosen from a special list, in which the gender aspect is implicit. The keyword “journalists” implies female journalists, for male journalists you write “journalists: men”.
