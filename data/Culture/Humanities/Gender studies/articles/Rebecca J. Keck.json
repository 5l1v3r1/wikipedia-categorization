She would rent rooms in a local hotel or storefront for visits of two days to two weeks, and take out large advertisements in advance to advise her customers of her upcoming personal consultations. She traveled her entire circuit every two months, so that patients could see her for follow-up treatment. At its height, her practice served between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, and she would typically see 350 patients per week.<sup id=\"cite_ref-History_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-History-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Flyer1894.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Flyer1894.jpg/220px-Flyer1894.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"307\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Flyer1894.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"309\" data-file-height=\"431\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Flyer1894.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The first page of a 4-page booklet describing Mrs. Dr. Keck's medical services, published in 1894.</div></div></div>\n<p>Mrs. Dr. Keck moved her family to <a href=\"/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa\" title=\"Davenport, Iowa\">Davenport, Iowa</a>, on the Mississippi River, in 1875 as her business expanded.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Finger&#39;s_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Finger&#39;s-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> As was common for Midwestern women physicians in her day, she used both Dr &amp; Mrs so that her married and professional status could both be understood by the public. She only treated chronic conditions and according to the testimonial letters she published in her advertising, the majority of her customers were working people and farm families who could not afford the high cost of private doctors' fees and who received her medical remedies and treatment advice by mail order.\n</p><p>Rebecca Keck considered herself to be a fully qualified physician by virtue of her long years of experience treating her family, neighbors and public customers. She owned a large medical library<sup id=\"cite_ref-will_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-will-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> and advertised herself as an Eclectic practitioner. The <a href=\"/wiki/Eclectic_medicine\" title=\"Eclectic medicine\">Eclectic School of medicine</a>, which grew out of the sectarian medical reform movements of the 1830s, was an active and publicly accepted school of medicine in the mid 19th century in the Midwest that competed with <a href=\"/wiki/Homeopathy\" title=\"Homeopathy\">homeopathy</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Allopathic_medicine\" title=\"Allopathic medicine\">allopathic</a> (or regular, scientific) medical approaches. Eclectic treatments combined an emphasis on botanical remedies with a willingness to use regular medical techniques in certain cases.\n</p><p>There is no evidence that Rebecca Keck ever graduated from an Eclectic medical school although most of them were open to women by the 1870s. She did not enroll for regular medical training at the University of Iowa's new medical school which opened for men and women in 1871. Either she could not afford the time and money required (because of her six children and her family's bankruptcy in 1873) or she did not consider a professional degree to be necessary for her practice as a physician.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fame_grows\">Fame grows</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebecca_J._Keck&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Fame grows\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With the exception of <a href=\"/wiki/Lydia_Pinkham\" title=\"Lydia Pinkham\">Lydia Pinkham</a>, Mrs. Dr. Keck appears to be the only woman to have earned substantial wealth on her own behalf in the lucrative but highly competitive and bruising profession of selling <a href=\"/wiki/Patent_medicine\" title=\"Patent medicine\">patent medicine</a> in 19th century America.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Stage_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Stage-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Like Mrs. Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck began her career because of family bankruptcy caused by the Panic of 1873. Unlike Mrs. Pinkham, Rebecca Keck not only believed herself to be a practicing physician, but became the top executive of the family's business and ran it herself, with the assistance of her two oldest daughters, Belle Alexander and Charlotte Dorn, while her husband played only a peripheral role and her only son contributed even less to the operations.\n</p><p>It is difficult to know Mrs. Dr. Keck's exact income, but she was able to purchase her infirmary in 1879 for $12,000 in cash,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gazette_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gazette-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and at the time of her death, her life insurance payout of $15,520 was one of the largest made in the United States for the week of May 17, 1905.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Insurance_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Insurance-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While extremely unpopular with members of the medical establishment in Iowa and Illinois, Rebecca Keck enjoyed glowing front page editorial endorsements from newspapers in the cities where she practiced.

As she pushed back against the new governmental regulations, Mrs. Dr. Keck became locked in a highly publicized, adversarial relationship with the secretary of the new Illinois State Board of Health, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Henry_Rauch\" title=\"John Henry Rauch\">Dr. John H. Rauch M.D.</a>, that lasted for at least a decade.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tribune_17-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tribune-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> When local doctors tried to block Mrs. Dr. Keck from practicing in McLean County, Illinois in early 1878, the <i>Bloomington Daily Leader</i> called hers the first test case of the new legislation, \"the beginning of a long and tedious litigation\" between the \"regulars\" and the \"irregulars.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> The lasting stigma of these accusations was probably an important reason why her accomplishments faded quickly and completely from public view after her death, and her career remains little known today.\n</p><p>Criminal charges were brought against Mrs. Dr. Keck in at least five different counties in Illinois for <a href=\"/wiki/Practicing_medicine_without_a_license\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Practicing medicine without a license\">practicing medicine without a license</a> between 1878 and 1889, but she was ably defended by her lawyer W.

Grateful patients wrote to her when they were cured of chronic lung infections, piles, eczema, general debility, deafness and a host of other issues, and she published their testimonial letters in her advertisements.,<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-flyer_27-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-flyer-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Fraudulent testimonial letters were a common feature of 19th century patent medicine advertising.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Young_28-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Young-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, United States Census records from 1880 show that many of these people actually existed as presented in print by Mrs. Dr. Keck.<sup id=\"cite_ref-US_Census_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-US_Census-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> However, in over a thousand ads that survive to be studied today, less than a hundred different individuals are named, and there is no way to verify the facts presented about their illnesses, particularly the accuracy of the diagnoses, and there is no way to know for sure what percentage of her thousands of other patients did and did not get cured.\n</p><p>Regular allopathic medical practice during the 1870s and 1880s often involved \"heroic\" treatments with harsh, mineral medications containing lead, mercury (calomel) and arsenic, as well as toxic vegetable compounds containing strychnine, castor oil (derived from ricin), belladonna and other poisonous substances we would consider extremely dangerous today.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Starr_29-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Starr-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Clumsy, unsanitary surgical procedures were also common, so it is not impossible that Mrs. Dr. Keck's herbal tonics and sensible nursing advice were actually better for her patients than the regular doctors' remedies in some cases.\n</p><p>It is unlikely that Mrs. Dr. Keck ever hurt anyone. Alert opponents in the medical profession would have been quick to pounce on any provable instance if she had ever actually harmed a patient with her treatments. While a number of outright quacks were taken to court by angry patients seeking reparations for botched treatments in Davenport during the years she practiced, no such accusation against Mrs. Dr. Keck shows up in the public record.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Alexander_30-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Alexander-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The only parties who sued her during her career were male doctors with M.D. credentials. In every instance, they were seeking to solidify institutional boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first preventing her from getting a license and second by preventing her from practicing medicine without one. No evidence that she harmed a patient was ever produced in any of these cases.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rebecca_J._Keck&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Bibliography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Beatty, William K.
