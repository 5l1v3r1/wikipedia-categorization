Wilhelmina Johanna Canters (21 July 1969 â€“ 6 September 2002),  known as Hanneke Canters, was a Dutch feminist philosopher and academic.  Canters studied Theology and Philosophy at the University of Groningen. She went on to study the philosophy of religion with feminist philosopher and theologian Professor Grace Jantzen at King's College, London University. Canters was awarded a Master of Arts degree. Following this Canters won a scholarship to study for a doctorate at the University of Sunderland under the supervision of Dr. Pamela Sue Anderson and others. Her thesis was a study of the Belgian feminist philosopher and former Lacanian psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray, in particular her book Elemental Passions. Eventually, her thesis was supervised by Jantzen and successfully examined. Canters developed a terminal illness not long after and died in Leiden in September 2002.  Her thesis was published as a joint work by her former supervisor Professor Jantzen in 2006, who then died of cancer as well.
