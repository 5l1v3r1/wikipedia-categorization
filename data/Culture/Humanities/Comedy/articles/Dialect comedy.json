They relied on the exaggerated and highly stylized portrayal of stereotypes, usually based on <a href=\"/wiki/Ethnic_humor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ethnic humor\">ethnic humor</a>. The genre has its roots on the vaudeville stage and in the minstrel shows that became popular in the 19th century. The ethnicities of the actual actors portraying the dialects did not have to match the characters; while much Jewish dialect comedy was created and portrayed by actual Jews, other dialect comedies, such as those involving <a href=\"/wiki/Blackface\" title=\"Blackface\">blackface</a>, were often not.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg/220px-Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"276\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg/330px-Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg/440px-Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"636\" data-file-height=\"798\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Amos_%27n%27_Andy_male_cast_1951.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Cast of the Amos N Andy television show in 1951</div></div></div>\n<p>\tOne of the most notable dialect comedies was <a href=\"/wiki/The_Goldbergs_(broadcast_series)\" title=\"The Goldbergs (broadcast series)\">The Goldbergs</a>, the brain child of creator/star, <a href=\"/wiki/Gertrude_Berg\" title=\"Gertrude Berg\">Gertrude Berg</a> about a Jewish family living in the Bronx. After its debut in 1929, the series had several incarnations in radio, television and a musical on Broadway. Berg continued to play the character of Molly Goldberg until 1955. In an article in the May 1936 issue of Radio Mirror, in a piece called <i>Ghetto guides the Goldbergs</i>, writer Dan Wheeler describes Berg\u2019s \u201cdouble life.\" Berg, the successful actress and business woman takes the reporter to a Jewish Ghetto on New York\u2019s lower East Side where she spends a few hours a week, Gabbing in Yiddish with the old Yentas of the neighborhood about their children and pouring over the vegetable carts that line the streets. This is her inspiration for her characters; Berg emphasized both realism and being a positive role model in portraying the lead character as a <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_mother_stereotype\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jewish mother stereotype\">Jewish mother</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Probably the most enduring program in this genre, <a href=\"/wiki/Amos_N_Andy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Amos N Andy\">Amos N Andy</a> had two feet planted firmly in the <a href=\"/wiki/Minstrel_show\" title=\"Minstrel show\">minstrel</a> tradition. In 1928, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white performers took their blackface act, Sam N Henry, which they did not have the rights to and changed it to Amos N Andy, which became one of the most popular shows of the time. In 1948 Variety proclaimed the show \u201ca national habit, almost as familiar as radio itself.\u201d\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Upon transitioning the show to television, Gosden and Correll took on the role of producers and hired a black cast including Alvin Childress (Amos), Spencer Williams (Andy) and Tim Moore (as King Fisher); Gosden and Correll had appeared as their characters in blackface on-screen in the 1930 talkie film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Check_and_Double_Check\" title=\"Check and Double Check\">Check and Double Check</a></i>, which received poor reception.\nBy the time of its final broadcast in 1960, the show had been renamed Amos N Andy Music Hall.\n</p><p>\t<a href=\"/wiki/Life_with_Luigi\" title=\"Life with Luigi\">Life with Luigi</a> premiered on CBS in 1948 and centered around Luigi Basco, an Italian immigrant living in Chicago. Many of the plots were either about Luigi attending \u201ccitizenship classes\u201d and the wacky immigrants he meets there or about his cranky landlord trying to convince Luigi to marry his overweight daughter. The TV version premiered in 1952 and was cancelled shortly after. It was cancelled due to the bumbling helpless portrayal of a character often referred to as \u201cthe little immigrant\u201d who didn\u2019t understand how banks work even though there are probably banks in Italy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG/220px-J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"279\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG/330px-J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG/440px-J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"740\" data-file-height=\"937\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:J._Carrol_Naish_Life_With_Luigi_1950.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>J.

It was the first series to feature an African American woman in the main role. Beulah drew much of the same criticism from the black community as Amos N Andy. The show was criticized for its portrayal of the \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Mammy_archetype\" title=\"Mammy archetype\">Mammy</a>\u201d or the happy go lucky black servant who wanted nothing more from life than to serve white folks. When it first hit the radio waves, the character of Beulah was voiced by her creator, <a href=\"/wiki/Marlin_Hurt\" title=\"Marlin Hurt\">Marlin Hurt</a>, a white male; the character was originally introduced nationwide as a supporting character on <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" title=\"Fibber McGee and Molly\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a></i> before getting her own show. After Hurt's unexpected death in 1946, the character of Beulah was played by Bob Corley, another white man. In 1947, African American actress Hattie McDaniel took over, followed by two beautiful African American sisters Lillian Randolph and later Amanda Randolph. The TV version of Beulah was portrayed by Ethel Waters and Louise Beavers.\n</p><p>\tJewish performers such as <a href=\"/wiki/George_Burns\" title=\"George Burns\">George Burns</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Benny\" title=\"Jack Benny\">Jack Benny</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Milton_Berle\" title=\"Milton Berle\">Milton Berle</a> had shows that were arguably forms of dialect comedy. Each of these comedians used cultural markers of Jewishness such as incorporating <a href=\"/wiki/Yiddish\" title=\"Yiddish\">Yiddish</a> words and phrases into their dialogue and referencing places that were known for being Jewish neighborhoods such as New York\u2019s East side. Comedians like Berle and others had come out of the same vaudeville tradition as the minstrel performers and as such did their shows in a classic variety format which included characters who were often based on racial and ethnic stereotypes. As late as the 1990s, the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld\" title=\"Jerry Seinfeld\">Jerry Seinfeld</a> was seen as having a distinctly New York Jewish flavor to it, which initially hindered his show <i><a href=\"/wiki/Seinfeld\" title=\"Seinfeld\">Seinfeld</a></i> (which later became a smash hit) from being picked up as a series.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SeinfeldMemo_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SeinfeldMemo-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Often overlooked in modern times were regional dialects that were not directly based on ethnic humor. <a href=\"/wiki/Hillbilly\" title=\"Hillbilly\">Hillbilly</a> humor was a somewhat common form of dialect comedy during the radio era, with shows such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Lum_and_Abner\" title=\"Lum and Abner\">Lum and Abner</a></i> using the genre to full effect. Southerners (especially haughty aristocrats from the South and their distinctive accents) were another target of dialect comedy, with one of the most famous examples being fictional U.S. Senator <a href=\"/wiki/Senator_Claghorn\" title=\"Senator Claghorn\">Beauregard Claghorn</a> from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Town_Hall_Tonight\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Town Hall Tonight\">The Fred Allen Show</a></i>.\n</p><p>Occasional use of dialect comedy continued even after <a href=\"/wiki/Political_correctness\" title=\"Political correctness\">political correctness</a> led to the dramatic decline of its usage in the 1950s. <a href=\"/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Jim%C3%A9nez_(character)\" title=\"Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)\">Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez</a>, a fictional Bolivian immigrant who was created by non-Hispanic comedian <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_Dana\" title=\"Bill Dana\">Bill Dana</a>, remained popular as a guest act well into the 1960s; Dana never intended the character to be offensive and <a href=\"/wiki/Kill_off\" title=\"Kill off\">killed him off</a> in the late 1970s, complete with a mock funeral.
