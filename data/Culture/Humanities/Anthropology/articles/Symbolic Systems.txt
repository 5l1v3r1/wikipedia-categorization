Symbolic Systems is an academic program at Stanford University with an interdisciplinary concentration on "the science of the mind" including courses in computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.   The program is analogous to cognitive science departments at other schools.  The program offers both bachelor's and master's degrees. The undergraduate major is split into concentrations such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, decision making and rationality, and neuroscience. Student advisors and the student-led Symbolic Systems Society provide support and organize events for the major.  Each year, the program hosts a "Distinguished Speaker", which in the past have included Daniel Dennett, Steven Pinker, Edward Snowden, and Marvin Minsky.
