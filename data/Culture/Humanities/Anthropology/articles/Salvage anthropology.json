As Euro-Americans removed sacred objects from their communities, they placed spiritual items into an educational context. Although the collectors believed they were using these objects to showcase the memory of a \u201cvanishing\u201d people, the objects were taken from actual people, many of whom believed that public display was disrespectful and potentially harmful to viewers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Many American Indians also believed that exhibiting sacred objects stripped the items of their spiritual power.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  By creating new meanings for the objects on display, in attempts to externally preserve a culture, anthropologists and collectors diminished the meaning that items held for the people who had created them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Collection_Methods\">Collection Methods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Salvage_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Collection Methods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Nineteenth- and early-twentieth century salvage anthropology often was undertaken through disrespectful and disingenuous methods.

By the late 1980s, it was estimated that museums, other institutions and private collectors possessed between 300,000 and 2.5 million bodies of American Indians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Many objects were also obtained without the consent of their owners. Alanson Buck Skinner, who collected for the <a href=\"/wiki/American_museum_of_natural_history\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"American museum of natural history\">American Museum of Natural History</a> from 1910 to 1914, was known as \u201cThe Little Weasel,\u201d because of his collection techniques. Skinner used deception to acquire objects from the <a href=\"/wiki/Menomini\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Menomini\">Menomini</a>, claiming that the objects would be held in a \u201csacred place\u201d with many other Menomini objects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  By thus removing objects from native cultures, American anthropologists took on the power to interpret and create narratives for the objects, rather than allowing them to remain part of Native cultural memory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Salvage_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 32em; -webkit-column-width: 32em; column-width: 32em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">J.
