D. Alexander, used the notion of the <i>inclusive fitness of individuals</i> rather than <i>the inclusive fitness of genes</i>. Dawkins (above) pointed to this as an error. The source of the confusion can be traced to discussions in Hamilton's early papers on inclusive fitness. In his 1963 paper Hamilton refers, unambiguously, to selection pressures on genes;\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>[T]he  ultimate  criterion  which  determines  whether  G  [a  gene]  will  spread  is  not whether the behaviour is to the benefit of the behaver but whether it is to the benefit of the gene G; and this will be the case if the average net result of the behaviour is to add  to  the  gene  pool  a  handful  of  genes  containing  G  in  higher  concentration  than does the gene pool itself.\u201d (1996 [1963], 7)<sup id=\"cite_ref-H1963_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-H1963-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, in his paper published in 1964, actually written before the 1963 paper (Hamilton 1996), Hamilton had included a subsidiary discussion on what the genetic theory might imply for how we look at the fitness of individuals:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Actually,  in  the  preceding  mathematical  account  we  were  not  concerned  with  the inclusive fitness of individuals as described here but rather with certain averages of them which we call the inclusive fitness of types. But the idea of the inclusive fitness of an individual is nevertheless a useful one. Just as in the sense of classical selection we may consider whether a given character expressed in an individual is adaptive in the sense of being in the interest of his personal fitness or not, so in the present sense of selection we may consider whether the character or trait of behaviour is or is not adaptive in the sense if being in the interest of his inclusive fitness.\u201d (Hamilton 1996 [1964], 38)<sup id=\"cite_ref-H1964_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-H1964-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is clear here that the formal treatment is of the selection pressures on types (genes or traits), whilst the notion of individual inclusive fitness may serve as a guide to the adaptiveness of the trait; just as consideration of effects of a trait on an individual's fitness can be instructive when considering classical selection on traits. At the same time, it is understandable that Alexander took the inclusive fitness of individuals as a heuristic device.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Context-based_or_discrimination-based_expression_mechanisms\">Context-based or discrimination-based expression mechanisms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Darwinian_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Context-based or discrimination-based expression mechanisms\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In his 1964 paper, Hamilton 'hazards' \u201cthe  following  unrigorous  statement  of  the  main  principle  that  has emerged from the model\u201d;\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The  Social  behaviour  of  a  species  evolves  in  such  a  way  that  in  each  distinct behaviour-evoking situation the individual will seem to value his neighbours\u2019 fitness against  his  own  according  to  the  coefficients  of  relationship  appropriate  to  that situation.\u201d(1964 [1996], 49)<sup id=\"cite_ref-H1964_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-H1964-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>He uses the terms 'hazards', 'unrigorous', and 'will seem' deliberately, since his formal analysis makes clear that the model specifies the evolutionary selection pressure, rather than specifying what mechanisms govern the proximate expression of social behaviors. He also clearly points to social behaviors being evoked in distinct situations, and that individuals may encounter potential social recipients of different degree of relationship in different situations. If one ignores the cautious qualifying words however, the passage might readily be interpreted to imply that individuals are indeed expected to make an active assessment of the degree of relatedness of others they interact with in different situations. Later in the paper, Hamilton again discusses the issue of whether the performance (or expression) of social behaviors might be conditional on; (a) discriminating factors which correlate with close relationship with the recipient, or (b) actually discriminating which individuals 'really are' in close relationship with the recipient:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The  selective  advantage  which  makes  behaviour  conditional  in  the  right  sense  on the  discrimination  of  factors  which  correlate  with  the  relationship  of  the  individual concerned  is  therefore  obvious.  It  may  be,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  a  certain social  action  performed  towards  neighbours  indiscriminately,  an  individual  is  only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of  his  neighbours  who  really  were  close  relatives  and  could  devote  his  beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive  fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we  suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.\u201d (1996 [1964], 51)<sup id=\"cite_ref-H1964_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-H1964-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>For certain social behaviors, Hamilton suggests there may be selection pressure for more discerning discrimination of genetic relatedness, were the mutation to occur. But 'in fact' the same net result of accurately targeting social behaviors towards genetic relatives could be achieved via a simpler mechanism of being expressed in proximity to the actor's 'home'. Hamilton is thus agnostic as to whether evolved social behaviors might be expressed via straightforward proximate mechanisms such as location-based cues, or whether more specific discriminatory powers might govern their expression. He does suggest that the distinct social contexts within which various social behaviors are expressed are factors to consider. Other theorists have discussed these questions of whether proximity, context or more discriminatory expression may govern behaviors:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Animals cannot, of course, be expected to know, in a cognitive sense, who their relatives are, and in practice the behaviour that is favoured by natural selection will be equivalent to a rough rule of thumb such as \u2018share food with anything that moves in the nest in which you are sitting.\u2019 If families happen to go around in groups, this fact provides a useful rule of thumb for kin selection: \u2018care for any individual you often see\u2019.\u201d (Dawkins 1979, 187)<sup id=\"cite_ref-D1979_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-D1979-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>If, for example, animals behave with an equal degree of altruism to all their \u201cneighbours\u201d\u2026 and if <i>on average</i> animals are related to their neighbours, then I would regard this as an example of kin selection.

In sum, inclusive fitness theory does imply that; <i>the evolutionary emergence</i> of social behavior can occur where there is statistical association of genes between social actors and recipients; but that <i>the expression</i> of such evolved social behaviors is not necessarily governed by actual genetic relatedness between participants. The evolutionary criterion and the proximate mechanism must thus not be confused: the first does require genetic association (of the form br&gt;c), the second does not.\n</p><p>Darwinian anthropology's central premise that human behavior <i>has evolved to maximize the inclusive fitness of individuals</i> is thus not a logical derivative of the theory.

For example, on the basis of his observations, Barnes suggested:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>[C]learly, genealogical connexion of some sort is one criterion for membership of many social groups. But it may not be the only criterion; birth, or residence, or a parent\u2019s former residence, or utilization of garden land, or participation in exchange and feasting activities or in house-building or raiding, may be other relevant criteria for group membership.\u201d(Barnes 1962,6)<sup id=\"cite_ref-B1962_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-B1962-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Langness' ethnography of the <i>Bena Bena</i> also emphasized a break with the genealogical perspective:\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p><i>The sheer fact of residence in a Bena Bena group can and does determine kinship.</i>  People do not necessarily reside where they do because they are kinsmen: rather they become  kinsmen because they reside there.\u201d  (Langness 1964, 172 emphasis in original)<sup id=\"cite_ref-L1964_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-L1964-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>By 1972, Schneider<sup id=\"cite_ref-S1968_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-S1968-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-S1972_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-S1972-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> had raised deep problems with the notion that human social bonds and 'kinship' was a natural category built upon genealogical ties (for more information, see <a href=\"/wiki/Kinship\" title=\"Kinship\">kinship</a>), and especially in the wake of his 1984 critique<sup id=\"cite_ref-S1984_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-S1984-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> this has become broadly accepted by most, if not all, anthropologists.<sup id=\"cite_ref-C2000_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-C2000-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The darwinian anthropology (and other sociobiological) perspectives, arising in the early 1970s, had not unreasonably assumed that the genealogical conceptions of human kinship, in place since Morgan's early work<sup id=\"cite_ref-M1870_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-M1870-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> in the 1870s, were still valid as a universal feature of humans. But they emerged at precisely the time that anthropology, being particularly sensitive about its own apparent 'ethnocentric' generalizations about kinship (from cultural particulars to human universals) was seeking to distance itself from these conceptions. The vehemence of Sahlins' rebuttal of sociobiology's genetic relatedness perspective in his 1976 <i>The use and abuse of Biology</i>, which underlined the non-genealogical nature of human kinship, can be understood as part of this 'distancing' trend.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alternative_approaches\">Alternative approaches</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Darwinian_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Alternative approaches\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The lack of success of darwinian anthropology created space for alternative approaches to analyzing human social behaviors from a biological perspective. Alexander's initial point (above) that the inclusive fitness framework had been scarcely applied to human kinship and social patterns has remained largely valid. But the move away from genealogical kinship in anthropology has continued to be a major barrier to any potential resolution. This section reviews a range of approaches to synthesizing ideas from  evolutionary biology to observations and data about human social behaviour across contemporary human populations. Whilst some of these approaches include the inclusive fitness approach, others may seek to demonstrate fit to other theories from evolutionary biology, or to demonstrate that certain proximate mechanisms of social behaviour are both compatible with the inclusive fitness approach, and also with the broad variety of ethnographic data on human kinship patterns.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Evolutionary_psychology\">Evolutionary psychology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Darwinian_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Evolutionary psychology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology\" title=\"Evolutionary psychology\">Evolutionary psychology</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Human_behavioural_ecology\">Human behavioural ecology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Darwinian_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Human behavioural ecology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Human_behavioral_ecology\" title=\"Human behavioral ecology\">Human behavioral ecology</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nurture_kinship\">Nurture kinship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Darwinian_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Nurture kinship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Nurture_kinship\" title=\"Nurture kinship\">Nurture kinship</a></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism\">Criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Darwinian_anthropology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Theories in evolutionary biology relevant to understanding social behavior may not be limited to frameworks such as inclusive fitness theory.
