In anthropology, anthropopoiesis is the self-building process of social man and of a whole culture, particularly referred to what concerns modifications of socialized body. The concept found applications mainly in French and Italian contemporary literatures. In accordance with theoretic background which supports the idea, man is an unfinished being or better his behaviour is not strongly prefixed by genetic heritage. Human beings become fully finished only by means of culture acquisition. Anthropopoiesis is both anthropogenesis (man “reborne” as social creature) and manufactoring of ”mankind patterns and fictions”. Therefore social and cultural practices build up the man by means of ritual and institutional constraints. An example could be circumcision, a practice widely existing in many rites of passage amongst Islamic and Jewish believers and also amongst traditional cultures and communities. Besides, Christians ascribe a clear meaning to the sacred garment and to the tonsure; they are convinced that some sacramental rites mark indelible dispositions. All that affects the body and through this one the perception of one’s own identity and social status.
