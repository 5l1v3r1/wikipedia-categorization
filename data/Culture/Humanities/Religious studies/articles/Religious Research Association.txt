The Religious Research Association is a scholarly association of researchers and religious professionals.   It was created in 1951 as the Religious Research Fellowship, although it existed informally as far back as the 1920s as a partnership between the Institute of Social and Religious Research and the Federal Council of Churches.  Since 1958, it has held an annual lecture series in the name of H. Paul Douglass.  Since the 1970s, it has met annually with the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.  It publishes the Review of Religious Research four times a year (September, December, March and June).   It contains articles, book reviews and reports on research projects.
