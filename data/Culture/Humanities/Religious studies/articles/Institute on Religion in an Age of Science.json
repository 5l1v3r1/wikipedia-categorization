Our quest is informed and guided by the deepening and evolving understandings fostered by scientific inquiry.\n</p><p>\u201cFrom here, our quests for meaning take us in divergent directions. For some, the natural world and its emergent manifestations in human experience and creativity are the focus of exploration. Some go on to encounter and celebrate the sacred in such explorations. For some, understandings of the natural world are interwoven with understandings inherent in various religious traditions, generating additional paths of exploration and encounter. As a result, we articulate our emerging orientations with many voices that are harmonious in that we share a common sense of place and gratitude.\n</p><p>\u201cWe acknowledge as well a shared set of values and concerns pertaining to peace, justice, dignity, cultural and ecological diversity and planetary sustainability. Although we may differ and hence debate as to how these concerns are here addressed, we are committed to participating in their resolution.\u201d\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institute_on_Religion_in_an_Age_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>IRAS evolved from the ideas of two pioneer groups. The first was a group of scientists from the Committee on Science and Values of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences\" title=\"American Academy of Arts and Sciences\">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>. The second group was an interfaith, religious coalition which hoped to revitalize religion for today's needs. Members of both groups saw what some perceived as a battlefield of conflicting ideologies to be a place of opportunity for a constructive relationship to emerge.\n</p><p>In 1954 the scientists accepted an invitation to present their views to the religious group at a seven-day conference on Religion in an Age of Science on Star Island. On November 9, 1954, members of the two groups established the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science to work toward these goals.\n</p><p>Presidents of the Institute have included <a href=\"/wiki/Harlow_Shapley\" title=\"Harlow Shapley\">Harlow Shapley</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_Hefner\" title=\"Philip Hefner\">Philip Hefner</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ursula_Goodenough\" title=\"Ursula Goodenough\">Ursula Goodenough</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Varadaraja_V._Raman\" title=\"Varadaraja V.
