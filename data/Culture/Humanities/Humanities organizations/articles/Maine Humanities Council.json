It is one of <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_state_humanities_councils\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of state humanities councils\">56 humanities councils</a> in the United States and its territories.\n</p><p>The organizational mission states: \"The Maine Humanities Council engages the people of Maine in the power and pleasure of ideas, encouraging a deeper understanding of ourselves and others, fostering wisdom in an age of information, and providing context in a time of change. The Council uses the humanities to provide cultural enrichment for all Mainers and as a tool for social change, bringing people together in conversation that crosses social, economic and cultural barriers.\"\n</p><p>The Council's <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070613145027/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/index.html\">programs</a> are statewide. They include literacy and reading and discussion initiatives for child care providers and preschoolers (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070714063623/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/btr-home.html\"><i>Born to Read</i></a>), adult new readers (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070630164534/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/new.html\"><i>New Books, New Readers</i></a>), rural Mainers and summer and year-round communities (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070714064609/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/talk.html\"><i>Let's Talk About It</i></a>), and health care professionals (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070613145027/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/index.html\"><i>Literature &amp; Medicine: Humanities at the Heart of Health Care</i></a>, which was created by the Council and has traveled to other states, becoming a national model). The Council also offers a program for Maine teachers that introduces new content and new topics (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070617064406/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/teach.html\"><i>Teachers for a New Century</i></a>). The Council also offers <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/letters.html\">Letters About Literature</a>, a national program from the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress that encourages young people to write letters to their favorite authors, living or dead. In 2006, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060621062933/http://mainehumanities.org/letters/national.html\">Lacy Craven</a>, a Maine participant in this program, was a national winner.\n</p><p>In 1997, the Council incorporated into its organizational structure the Harriet P. Henry Center for the Book. The National Center for the Book was established in the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_of_Congress\" title=\"Library of Congress\">Library of Congress</a> in 1977 to promote books, reading, libraries, and literacy. The Maine Humanities Council established the Harriet P. Henry Center for the Book as one of the Maine state affiliates of the national program. It is one of only eight state humanities councils to be awarded this responsibility.\n</p><p>While most of the Council's work is in direct public humanities and educational programs that bring people together around books, it is also a grantmaker.  Since 1976, the Council has distributed over $4 million in grants to Maine libraries, museums, historical societies, colleges, schools, literacy groups, adult education programs, towns, and other organizations.\n</p><p>In 2002, the Council's Literature &amp; Medicine program was named as a Patient Quality Initiative by the Maine Hospital Association. The program then received the 2003 Helen &amp; Martin Schwartz Prize for Excellence in Public Programming from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.statehumanities.org\">Federation of State Humanities Councils</a>. The Council's national awards include a 1998 Award of Merit from the American Association of State and Local History for the Century Project and the 1998 Helen &amp; Martin Schwartz Prize for Excellence in Public Programming given by the Federation of State Humanities Councils for the Odyssey Project. Most recently, the Council received three national awards for its <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070812210616/http://www.mainehumanities.org/taxingmaine.html\">Taxing Maine</a> program: the Award of Merit and the WOW award from the American Association for State and Local History and the 2007 Helen &amp; Martin Schwartz Prize from the Federation of State Humanities Councils. \"Taxing Maine\" is now available on the Council's <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://mainehumanities.org/podcast\">Humanities on Demand</a> podcast.\n</p><p>The Council is located on Brighton Avenue in Portland, Maine.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1312\nCached time: 20180902153540\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.061 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 59/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 3940/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 14/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.018/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   47.540      1 Template:More_citations_needed\n100.00%   47.540      1 -total\n 66.87%   31.790      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:3059791-0!canonical and timestamp 20180902153540 and revision id 844471293\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3_%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86_%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2009"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_additional_references"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Humanities_organizations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Organizations_based_in_Portland,_Maine"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1975_establishments_in_Maine"},{"sortkey":"","*":"National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles needing additional references from September 2009"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Library of Congress"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"List of state humanities councils"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Endowment for the Humanities"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Portland, Maine"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:More citations needed"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":["http://www.mainehumanities.org","https://web.archive.org/web/20070613145027/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/index.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20070714063623/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/btr-home.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20070630164534/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/new.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20070714064609/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/talk.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20070617064406/http://www.mainehumanities.org/programs/teach.html","https://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/letters.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20060621062933/http://mainehumanities.org/letters/national.html","http://www.statehumanities.org","https://web.archive.org/web/20070812210616/http://www.mainehumanities.org/taxingmaine.html","http://mainehumanities.org/podcast"],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Maine Humanities Council","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6736377"}]}}
