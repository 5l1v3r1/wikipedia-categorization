The Hypogeum of Torre del Ram is an archaeological site of de Torre del Ram, in Cala en Blanes (Ciutadella de Menorca), is a Bronze Age funerary hypogeum, which was used as a collective tomb by a family or a small community. Even though it was emptied in later centuries to be reused as a cattle shelter, which caused the loss of all the information about the interred population, grave goods and chronology, its resemblance with other prehistoric tombs of Menorca dates it to between 1700 and 1400 BC. A stepped corridor leads to the tomb's rectangular chamber, which has a stone bench that surrounds its internal perimeter. Part of the stone gallery, which used to cover the corridor and the entrance, is still preserved, which was built with the cyclopean[further explanation needed] technique.  The corridor is 2.60 m long, while the dimensions of the chamber are: 8.80 m long, 2.50 m wide and 1.95 m high.  The walls of the internal chamber present several engravings representing three sailing ships and other undetermined figures. Some authors claim the importance of these elements, since they could date back to the Bronze Age.  However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period.
