One World Archaeology is a book series focussing on archaeology and education about the past.  One World Archaeology is one of five book series associated with the World Archaeological Congress (WAC). Editors and contributors to these series waive any royalties, allowing all royalties to be used to further the work of the WAC. "Publications in the One World Archaeology series contain selections of the papers presented at the WAC Congresses, held every four years. This series developed as an outcome of the inaugural World Archaeological Congress held in Southampton, England in 1986. The subject matter of this series is wide-ranging, reflecting the diverse interests of WAC. WAC gives place to considerations of power and politics in framing archaeological questions and results. WAC also gives place and privilege to minorities who have often been silenced or regarded as beyond capable of making main line contributions to the field."  The other four series are Worlds of Archaeology, Indigenous Archaeologies, Global Cultural Heritage Manual Series, and Research Handbooks in Archaeology
