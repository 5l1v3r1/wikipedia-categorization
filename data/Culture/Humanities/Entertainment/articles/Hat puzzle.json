Next, if player 1 had seen a blue hat on player 2 &amp; a red hat on player 3, then player 1 would have known immediately that his own hat must be red.

Similarly, those players wearing a white hat will wait <i>W</i>\u22121 seconds before guessing correctly that they are wearing a white hat.  So all players make a correct guess at the same time.\n</p><p>If <i>B</i> &lt; <i>W</i> then those wearing a black hat will see <i>B</i>\u22121 black hats and <i>W</i> white hats, whilst those wearing a white hat will see <i>B</i> black hats and <i>W</i>\u22121 white hats.  Since <i>B</i>\u22121 &lt; <i>B</i> \u2264 <i>W</i>\u22121, those players wearing a black hat will be the first to speak, guessing correctly that their hat is black.

B faces the wall, C faces B, and D faces C and B. The fourth man, A, is put behind a screen (or in a separate room). The jailer gives all four men party hats. He explains that there are two black hats and two white hats, that each prisoner is wearing one of the hats, and that each of the prisoners see only the hats in front of him but neither on himself nor behind him. The fourth man behind the screen can't see or be seen by any other prisoner. No communication among the prisoners is allowed.\n</p><p>If any prisoner can figure out what color hat he has on his own head with 100% certainty (without guessing) and tell the jailer, <i>all four prisoners go free</i>.

So if D observes that B and C have hats of the same color, D would deduce that his own hat is the opposite color. However, if B and C have hats of different colors, then D can say nothing. The key is that prisoner C, after allowing an appropriate interval, and knowing what D would do, can deduce that if D says nothing the hats on B and C must be different; able to see B's hat, he can deduce his own hat color.\n</p><p>In common with many puzzles of this type, the solution relies upon the assumption that all participants are totally rational and intelligent enough to make the appropriate deductions.\n</p><p>After solving this puzzle, some insight into the nature of <a href=\"/wiki/Communication\" title=\"Communication\">communication</a> can be gained by pondering whether the meaningful silence of prisoner D violates the \"No communication\" rule (given that communication is usually defined as the \"transfer of information\").\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Four-Hat_Variant\">Four-Hat Variant</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Four-Hat Variant\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In a variant of this puzzle, the prisoners know that there are 3 hats of one color and only 1 hat of another (e.g. 3 black and 1 white), and the 3 prisoners can see each other i.e. D sees B &amp; C, B sees D &amp; C, and C sees D &amp; B.

What is the plan to achieve the goal?\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_solution_5\">The solution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: The solution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The prisoners pair off. In a pair (A,B) of the prisoners A says the color he can see on the head of B, who says the opposite color he sees on the head of A. Then, if both wear hats with the same color, A is released (and B is not), if the colors are different, B is released (and A is not). In total, 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.  This assumes the pair can communicate who is A and who is B, which may not be allowed.\n</p><p>Alternatively, the prisoners build two groups of 5. One group assumes that the number of red hats is even, the other assumes that there is an odd number of red hats. Similar to the variant with hearing, they can deduce their hat color out of this assumption. Exactly one group will be right, so 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.\n</p><p>Note that the prisoners cannot find a strategy guaranteeing the release of more than 5 prisoners. Indeed, for a single prisoner, there are as many distributions of hat colors where he says the correct answer than there are where he does not. Hence, there are as many distributions of hat colors where 6 or more prisoners say the correct answer than there are where 4 or fewer do so.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Countably_Infinite-Hat_Variant_without_Hearing\">Countably Infinite-Hat Variant without Hearing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Countably Infinite-Hat Variant without Hearing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In this variant, a <a href=\"/wiki/Countable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Countable\">countably infinite</a> number of prisoners, each with an unknown and randomly assigned red or blue hat line up single file line.  Each prisoner faces away from the beginning of the line, and each prisoner can see all the hats in front of him, and none of the hats behind.  Starting from the beginning of the line, each prisoner must correctly identify the color of his hat or he is killed on the spot.  As before, the prisoners have a chance to meet beforehand, but unlike before, once in line, no prisoner can hear what the other prisoners say.  The question is, is there a way to ensure that only finitely many prisoners are killed?\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_solution_6\">The solution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: The solution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>If one accepts the <a href=\"/wiki/Axiom_of_choice\" title=\"Axiom of choice\">axiom of choice</a>, and assumes the prisoners each have the (unrealistic) ability to memorize an <a href=\"/wiki/Uncountable_set\" title=\"Uncountable set\">uncountably infinite</a> amount of information and perform computations with uncountably infinite <a href=\"/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory\" title=\"Computational complexity theory\">computational complexity</a>, the answer is yes. In fact, even if we allow an <a href=\"/wiki/Uncountable_set\" title=\"Uncountable set\">uncountable</a> number of different colors for the hats and an uncountable number of prisoners, the axiom of choice provides a solution that guarantees that only finitely many prisoners must die provided that each prisoner can see the hats of every other prisoner (not just those ahead of them in a line), or at least that each prisoner can see all but finitely many of the other hats. The solution for the two color case is as follows, and the solution for the uncountably infinite color case is essentially the same:\n</p><p>The prisoners standing in line form a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 is taken to represent blue, and 1 is taken to represent red.  Before they are put into the line, the prisoners define the following <a href=\"/wiki/Equivalence_relation\" title=\"Equivalence relation\">equivalence relation</a> over all possible sequences that they might be put into:  Two sequences are equivalent if they are identical after a finite number of entries.  From this equivalence relation, the prisoners get a collection of equivalence classes.  Assuming the axiom of choice, there exists a set of representative sequences\u2014one from each equivalence class. (<a href=\"/wiki/Almost_everywhere\" title=\"Almost everywhere\">Almost every specific value</a> is impossible to compute, but the axiom of choice implies that <i>some</i> set of values exists, so we assume that the prisoners have access to an <a href=\"/wiki/Oracle_machine\" title=\"Oracle machine\">oracle</a>.)\n</p><p>When they are put into their line, each prisoner can see all but a finite number of hats, and can therefore see which equivalence class the <i>actual</i> sequence of hats belongs to. (This assumes that each prisoner can perform an <i>uncountably infinite</i> number of comparisons to find a match, with each class comparison requiring a <i>countably infinite</i> number of individual hat-comparisons).  They then proceed guessing their hat color as if they were in the <i>representative</i> sequence from the appropriate equivalence class.  Because the actual sequence and the representative sequence are in the same equivalence class, their entries are the same after some finite number <i>N</i> of prisoners.  All prisoners after these first <i>N</i> prisoners are saved.\n</p><p>Because the prisoners have no information about the color of their own hat and would make the same guess whichever color it has, each prisoner has a 50% chance of being killed. It may seem paradoxical that an infinite number of prisoners each have an even chance of being killed and yet it is certain that only a finite number are killed. However, there is no contradiction here, because this finite number can be arbitrarily large, and no probability can be assigned to any particular number being killed.\n</p><p>This is easiest to see for the case of zero prisoners being killed. This happens <a href=\"/wiki/If_and_only_if\" title=\"If and only if\">if and only if</a> the actual sequence is one of the selected representative sequences. If the sequences of 0s and 1s are viewed as binary representations of a real number between 0 and 1, the representative sequences form a <a href=\"/wiki/Non-measurable_set\" title=\"Non-measurable set\">non-measurable set</a>. (This set is similar to a <a href=\"/wiki/Vitali_set\" title=\"Vitali set\">Vitali set</a>, the only difference being that equivalence classes are formed with respect to numbers with finite binary representations rather than all rational numbers.) Hence no probability can be assigned to the event of zero prisoners being killed. The argument is similar for other finite numbers of prisoners being killed, corresponding to a finite number of variations of each representative.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Countably_Infinite_Hat_Problem_with_Hearing\">Countably Infinite Hat Problem with Hearing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Countably Infinite Hat Problem with Hearing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This variant is the same as the last one except that prisoners can hear the colors called out by other prisoners.  The question is, what is the optimal strategy for the prisoners such that the fewest of them die in the worst case?\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_solution_7\">The solution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: The solution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>It turns out that, if one allows the prisoners to hear the colors called out by the other prisoners, it is possible to guarantee the life of every prisoner except the first, who dies with a 50% probability.\n</p><p>To do this, we define the same equivalence relation as above and again select a representative sequence from each equivalence class.  Now, we label every sequence in each class with either a 0 or a 1.  First, we label the representative sequence with a 0.  Then, we label any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an even number of places with a 0, and any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an odd number of places with a 1.  In this manner, we have labeled every possible infinite sequence with a 0 or a 1 with the important property that any two sequences which differ by only one digit have opposite labels.\n</p><p>Now, when the warden asks the first person to say a color, or in our new interpretation, a 0 or a 1, he simply calls out the label of the sequence he sees.  Given this information, everyone after him can determine exactly what his own hat color is.  The second person sees all but the first digit of the sequence that the first person sees. Thus, as far as he knows, there are two possible sequences the first person could have been labeling: one starting with a 0, and one starting with a 1.  Because of our labeling scheme, these two sequences would receive opposite labels, so based on what the first person says, the second person can determine which of the two possible strings the first person saw, and thus he can determine his own hat color.  Similarly, every later person in the line knows every digit of the sequence except the one corresponding to his own hat color.  He knows those before him because they were called out, and those after him because he can see them.  With this information, he can use the label called out by the first person to determine his own hat color.  Thus, everyone except the first person always guesses correctly.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ebert.27s_version_and_Hamming_codes\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ebert's_version_and_Hamming_codes\">Ebert's version and Hamming codes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Ebert&#039;s version and Hamming codes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Ebert's version of the problem states that all players who guess must guess at the same predetermined time, but that not all players are required to guess.  Now not all players can guess correctly, so the players win if at least one player guesses and all of those who guess do so correctly.  How can the players maximise their chance of winning?\n</p><p>One strategy for solving this version of the hat problem employs <a href=\"/wiki/Hamming_code\" title=\"Hamming code\">Hamming codes</a>, which are commonly used to detect and correct errors in <a href=\"/wiki/Data_transmission\" title=\"Data transmission\">data transmission</a>. The probability for winning will be much higher than 50%, depending on the number of players in the puzzle configuration: for example, a winning probability of 87.5% for 7 players.\n</p><p>Similar strategies can be applied to team sizes of <i>N</i> = 2<sup><i>k</i></sup>\u22121 and achieve a win rate (2<sup><i>k</i></sup>-1)/2<sup>k</sup>.  Thus the Hamming code strategy yields greater win rates for larger values of <i>N</i>.\n</p><p>In this version of the problem, any individual guess has a 50% chance of being right. However, the Hamming code approach works by concentrating wrong guesses together onto certain distributions of hats.  For some cases, all the players will guess incorrectly; whereas for the other cases, only one player will guess, but correctly.  While half of all guesses are still incorrect, this results in the players winning more than 50% of the time.\n</p><p>A simple example of this type of solution with three players is instructive.  With three players, there are eight possibilities; in two of them all players have the same colour hat, and in the other six, two players have one colour and the other player has the other colour.\n</p><p>The players can guarantee that they win in the latter cases (75% of the time) with the following strategy:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Any player who observes two hats of two different colours remains silent.</li>\n<li>Any player who observes two hats of the same colour guesses the opposite colour.</li></ol>\n<p>In the two cases when all three players have the same hat colour, they will all guess incorrectly.  But in the other six cases, only one player will guess, and correctly, that his hat is the opposite of his fellow players'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hat_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation journal\">Hardin, Christopher; Taylor, Alan D.
