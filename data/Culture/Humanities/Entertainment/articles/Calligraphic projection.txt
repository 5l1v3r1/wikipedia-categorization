Calligraphic projection is a system, often used for laser lighting displays, whereby one or more laser beams draws an image on a screen by reflecting the laser beam from one or more mirrors attached to a deflecting mechanism. Analog oscilloscopes have customarily employed this kind of vector graphics, as did a number of computer graphics terminals in the 1970s, such as the Tektronix 4014. Calligraphic projection is sometimes called Lissajous projection, after the mathematical figure (and mathematician).
