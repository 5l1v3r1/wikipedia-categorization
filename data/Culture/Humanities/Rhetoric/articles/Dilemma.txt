A dilemma (Greek: δίλημμα "double proposition") is a problem offering two  unrelated possibilities, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. Time and or the perception of time strongly influencing the decision-making. The dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device, in the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion. Applied incorrectly, it constitutes a false dichotomy, a fallacy.
