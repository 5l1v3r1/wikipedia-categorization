Rhetrickery is a term defined by Wayne C. Booth to describe the "whole range of shoddy dishonest communicative arts producing misunderstanding - along with other harmful results. The arts of making the worse seem the better course." (Booth, 2004, p 11). Booth views rhetrickeryâ€™s poisoning of both political and media cultures as being a key reason for the need for an increase in the teaching of rhetoric.
