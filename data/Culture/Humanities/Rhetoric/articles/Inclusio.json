Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new.  The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself.  An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Mark's treatment of the \"Cursing of the Fig Tree\" and the \"Cleansing of the Temple\" (Chapter 11).  By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a \"frame\" that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus' actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_the_Hebrew_Bible_.28the_Old_Testament.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_Hebrew_Bible_(the_Old_Testament)\">In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inclusio&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While this may not be evident to many of the Bible's modern day readers, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hebrew_Bible\" title=\"Hebrew Bible\">Hebrew Bible</a> is full of literary devices, some of which, having fallen out of favor over the years, are lost on most modern readers. <i>Inclusio</i>, of which many instances can be found in the Bible, is one of these, although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the <a href=\"/wiki/Hebrew_language\" title=\"Hebrew language\">Hebrew</a> source.\n</p><p>Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of <i>inclusio</i> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Jeremiah\" title=\"Book of Jeremiah\">Book of Jeremiah</a>. A rather far-flung example of <i>inclusio</i> in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section, chapters 1\u201324, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery\u2014that of almond rods and baskets of figs. <i>Inclusio</i> may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were entrusted. <i>Bracketing</i> can also be seen in The Lord's sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter\u2014which some claim was appended to it\u2014can be thought of as inside the <i>inclusio</i> formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05d4), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio\u2014those in which the section enframed is quite shorter\u2014are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads:\n</p>\n<table align=\"center\" dir=\"rtl\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05dc \u05e2\u05de\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e1\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05e8\u05e2 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n(<a href=\"/wiki/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"King James Version of the Bible\">KJV</a>: <i>For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</i>)\n<table align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The phrase \"\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5\" (<i>did not know</i>) is found at the beginning and the end of The Lord's analysis of his people. English translations do not preserve this structure.\n</p><p>Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible. An obvious example of inclusio is found in the first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 \"\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4' \u05db\u05d9-\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3\u05d5.\". Another, more disputed, example may be found in the <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Ruth\" title=\"Book of Ruth\">Book of Ruth</a>, where one finds a certain resemblance, if somewhat <a href=\"/wiki/Chiastic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chiastic\">chiastic</a>, between 1:1 and 1:22\u2014in the former Elimelekh leaves <a href=\"/wiki/Bethlehem\" title=\"Bethlehem\">Bethlehem</a> in favor of <a href=\"/wiki/Moab\" title=\"Moab\">Moab</a>, and in the latter Ruth and <a href=\"/wiki/Naomi_(Bible)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Naomi (Bible)\">Naomi</a> leave <a href=\"/wiki/Moab\" title=\"Moab\">Moab</a> in favor of Bethlehem.  Finally, it has been suggested that <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Genesis\" title=\"Book of Genesis\">Genesis</a> 2 contains inclusio, for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_Rabbinic_Literature\">In Rabbinic Literature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inclusio&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: In Rabbinic Literature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that \"Any psalm dear to David he opened with \"\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\" ('happy is he') and closed with \"\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\" ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At the end of the Mishnah tractate Kelim, R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: \"Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with [statements regarding] impurity and departed with [statements regarding] purity.\" Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the \u05e9\u05de\u05e2 (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.\n</p><p>Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio. In the opening mishnah of Taanit Chapter 1, R. Joshua notes that rain on the festival of Sukkot is \"not a sign of blessing\", and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is \"a sign of curse\". This characterization of rainfall as God's way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the inclusio is based on a wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a \"\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d4\" ('solid monument')and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because \"\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d3\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05de\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\" ('one soul may not be set aside in favor of another'). The use of the word \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 (nefesh) at the beginning and the end of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.\n</p><p>Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of BT Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_New_Testament\">In the New Testament</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inclusio&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: In the New Testament\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/New_Testament\" title=\"New Testament\">New Testament</a> also uses inclusio. The main teaching part in the <a href=\"/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount\" title=\"Sermon on the Mount\">Sermon on the Mount</a> starts and ends with the expression \u201cthe Law and the Prophets\u201d (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12). <a href=\"/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew\" title=\"Gospel of Matthew\">Matthew</a>\u2019s account of the first part of <a href=\"/wiki/Jesus\" title=\"Jesus\">Jesus</a>\u2019 public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 +9:35).\nAlso, Matthew\u2019s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus' name would be \u201cEmmanuel, that is, \u2018God with us,\u2019\u201d (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, \"I am with you always, to the end of the age\". This forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. \nThe <a href=\"/wiki/Letter_to_the_Hebrews\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Letter to the Hebrews\">letter to the Hebrews</a> uses <a href=\"/wiki/Jeremiah\" title=\"Jeremiah\">Jeremiah</a>\u2019s prophecy as an inclusio in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18.\nThere are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1324\nCached time: 20180902153144\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.048 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.071 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 87/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 3963/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 10/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.020/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   53.216      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   53.216      1 -total\n 67.02%   35.665      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:722906-0!canonical and timestamp 20180902153144 and revision id 811305106\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"it","url":"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusione_(letteratura)","langname":"Italian","autonym":"italiano","*":"Inclusione (letteratura)"},{"lang":"he","url":"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%95","langname":"Hebrew","autonym":"\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea","*":"\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05d6\u05d9\u05d5"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_April_2013"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Syntax"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Literature"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Bible_content"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Rabbinic_literature"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Rhetoric"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from April 2013"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bethlehem"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Book of Genesis"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Book of Jeremiah"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Book of Ruth"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chiastic"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gospel of Matthew"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hebrew Bible"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hebrew language"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jeremiah"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jesus"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"King James Version of the Bible"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Letter to the Hebrews"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Literary device"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Moab"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Naomi (Bible)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Testament"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sermon on the Mount"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Inclusio","byteoffset":1233,"anchor":"In_the_Hebrew_Bible_(the_Old_Testament)"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"In Rabbinic Literature","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Inclusio","byteoffset":4152,"anchor":"In_Rabbinic_Literature"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"In the New Testament","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Inclusio","byteoffset":7101,"anchor":"In_the_New_Testament"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Inclusio","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6014831"}]}}
