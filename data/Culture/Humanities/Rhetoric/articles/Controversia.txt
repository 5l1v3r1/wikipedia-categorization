A controversia is an exercise in rhetoric; a form of declamation in which the student speaks for one side in a notional legal case such as treason or poisoning.  The facts of the matter and relevant law are presented in a persuasive manner, in the style of a legal counsel.  The exercise was used in ancient Rome, where it was, with the suasoria, the final stage of a course in rhetoric at an academy.   Seneca the Elder was an expert rhetorician and, from memory, compiled a set of classical themes for this exercise: the Controversi√¶.
