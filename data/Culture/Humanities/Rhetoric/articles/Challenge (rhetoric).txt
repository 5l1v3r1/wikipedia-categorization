A challenge can serve as a dare or an exhortation, motivating a person or persons by "[a]n invitation or summons to a trial or contest of any kind" and thus to "a difficult or demanding task, esp[ecially] one seen as a test of one's abilities or character".  In this sense, speakers or writers can use challenges to  motivate - to convince people "to perform an action they otherwise [might] not".  A challenge can thus become a  tool of rhetoric: a rhetorical challenge.
