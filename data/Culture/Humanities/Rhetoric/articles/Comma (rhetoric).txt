In Ancient Greek rhetoric, a comma (κόμμα komma, plural κόμματα kommata) is a short clause, something less than a colon. In the system of Aristophanes of Byzantium, commata were separated by middle interpuncts. In antiquity, a comma was defined as a combination of words that has no more than eight syllables.[dubious  – discuss] ..   .
