Bloviation is a style of empty, pompous political speech particularly associated with Ohio due to the term's popularization by United States President Warren G. Harding, who, himself a master of the technique, described it as "the art of speaking for as long as the occasion warrants, and saying nothing".  The verb "to bloviate" is the act of creating bloviation.  In terms of its etymology, according to one source, the word is a "compound of blow, in its sense of 'to boast' (also in another typical Americanism, blowhard), with a mock-Latin ending to give it the self-important stature implicit in its meaning."  "Bloviation" in Ohio originally meant idle chatter.    Used to refer to a form of political speech, it appears in the Debates and Proceedings of the Convention for the Revision of the Constitution of the State of Ohio in the mid 19th century.
