In rhetoric, eunoia (Ancient Greek: εὔνοιᾰ, translit. eúnoia, lit. 'well mind; beautiful thinking')  is the goodwill a speaker cultivates between themself and their audience, a condition of receptivity.  In Book VIII of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle uses the term to refer to the kind and benevolent feelings of goodwill a spouse has which form the basis for the ethical foundation of human life.  Cicero translates εὔνοιᾰ with the Latin word benevolentia.  It is also a rarely-used medical term referring to a state of normal mental health.  Eunoia is the shortest English word containing all five main vowel graphemes.
