Castigat ridendo mores (Latin pronunciation: [kaˈstiːɡat rɪˈdɛndoː ˈmoːreːs]) (laughing corrects morals) is a Latin phrase that generally means "one corrects customs by laughing at them," or "he corrects morals by ridicule."  Some commentators suggest that the phrase embodies the essence of satire; in other words, the best way to change things is to point out their absurdity and laugh at them.  French New Latin poet Abbé Jean de Santeul (fr) (1630–1697) allegedly coined the phrase.
