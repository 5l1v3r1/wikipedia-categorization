 The dangibon (談義本) was a pre-modern Japanese literary genre. Texts were written in a humorous, satirical sermon-style with the purpose of educating the masses. It is type of gesaku. Masuho Zankō (増穂残口) and Issai Chozan (佚斎樗山) are credited with establishing the early foundations upon which the genre rests. In 1715, Masuho wrote Endō Tukugan (艶道通鑑), and in 1727 Issai wrote Inaka Sōji (田舎荘子). These two texts are early forerunners of the genre. However, the genre is not fully realized until several decades later. In 1752, Jōkanbō Kōa (静観房好阿) wrote Imayō Heta Dangi (当世下手談義, "A Clumsy Sermon in the Modern Manner"), which is identified as the first true example of the dangibon genre. The genre existed between the 1752 c. 1800, reaching "the height of their popularity in the 1750s."  It gradually evolved into the kokkeibon genre at the start of the 19th century.
