Satirical ostraca are a category of ostraca, (singular: an ostracon), that represent the real world in unrealistic, impossible situations–a satire. The common example portrayed which helped create this categorization, are animals which take reversed roles, for example a vertically–walking cat, with ducks on the end of leashes. The same role reversals can be seen on Satirical papyri. This concept is a prevalent feature in absurdist literature, such as in the works of Mikhail Bulgakov.
