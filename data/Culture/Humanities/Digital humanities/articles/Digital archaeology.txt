Digital archaeology is the application of information technology and digital media to archaeology.   It includes the use of digital photography, laser scanning, augmented reality, and 3D printing, among other techniques.  Computational archaeology, which covers computer-based analytical methods, can be considered a subfield of digital archaeology, as can virtual archaeology.
