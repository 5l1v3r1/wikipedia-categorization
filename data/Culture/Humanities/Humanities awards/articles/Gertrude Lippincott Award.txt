The Gertrude Lippincott Award is an annual award for the best English-language article in the field of dance studies. Previously it was awarded by the Society of Dance History Scholars; since 2017 it has been awarded by the Dance Studies Association.  The $500 award was named after modern dance teacher and mentor Gertrude Lippincott and honors exemplary dance scholarship. Ms. Lippincott was herself honored in 1973 with the National Dance Association's Heritage Award for her contributions to dance education. She was one of the founders of the Congress on Research in Dance and of the Modern Dance Center of Minneapolis. She was also an editor for the periodicals Dance Observer and Dance Magazine.
