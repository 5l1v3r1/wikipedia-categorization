  The Australian Teachers Of Media or ATOM is an independent, not-for-profit, professional association that promotes the study of media and screen literacy. The membership of ATOM includes a collective of educators from across all subject disciplines at all levels of education, the screen media industry and, increasingly, the general public interested in the media.   The national organisation is responsible for the ATOM Awards that have been presented annually since 1982. The awards celebrate the best of Australian screen content from the education sector and screen industry professionals, and now feature the 1 Minute Film Competition and ATOM Photo Comp. ATOM publishes Australia's longest running film publication, Metro Magazine and Screen Education; creates and distributes education resources including study guides; and hosts professional development for teachers and screenings. ATOM aims to foster and encourage a generation of students who are both multi-literate and technologically savvy.  Through the publishing of both Metro Magazine  and Screen Education and through convening the ATOM Awards and the ATOM Australian International Multimedia Awards,  ATOM actively promotes media literacy in Australia and internationally.
