Founder's syndrome  (also founderitis) is a popular term for a difficulty faced by organizations where one or more founders maintain disproportionate power and influence following the effective initial establishment of the project, leading to a wide range of problems for the organization.    The passion and charisma of the founder(s), sources of the initial creativity and productivity of the organization, become limiting or destructive factors.  The syndrome occurs in both non-profit and for-profit organizations. It may simply limit further growth and success of the project, or it may lead to bitter factionalism and divisions as the scale of demands made on the organization increases, or it may result in outright failure.  There are ways in which a founder or organization can respond and grow beyond this situation. An organization suffering from founder's syndrome typically presents many of the following symptoms: Coping with founder's syndrome requires discussion of the problem, a plan of action, and interventions by the founder, the board and or by others involved in the organization. The objective of the plan should be to allow the organization to make a successful transition to a mature organizational model without damage to either the organization itself or the individuals concerned.  Despite the negative symptoms listed above, according to one study focused on "knowledge-intensive technology" companies, founders with a hands-on management style are more likely to retain employees and see their firms thrive.
