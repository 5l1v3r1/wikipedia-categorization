Harkins (March 8, 1936 â€“ May 17, 2016)  was an American futurist who was an associate professor in the Department of Organizational Leadership, Policy and Development and faculty director of the Graduate Certificate in Innovation Studies program at the University of Minnesota (UMN). Harkins' contributions to the field of futures studies, include raising anthropologists' awareness of the field and expanding the scope of future studies to include the concept of "culture", starting with the American Anthropological Association's "Futuristics Sessions" which he co-chaired with Magorah Maruyama in the early 1970s.   Harkins co-authored StoryTech with George Kubik.
