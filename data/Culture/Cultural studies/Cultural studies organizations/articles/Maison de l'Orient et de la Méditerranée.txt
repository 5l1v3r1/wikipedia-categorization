The Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée (or MOM) is a research body in Lyon, France that specialises in the Mediterranean and the Middle East and the first steps of humanity. It is dedicated to its founder, historian Jean Pouilloux.  Anne Schmitt, CNRS, took over directorship from Rémy Boucharlat on 1 January 2011 and conducts research programs within the Archéométrie et archéologie laboratory - UMR 5138 of the MOM. Nathalie Donjon serves as secretary general since 2007 after being recruited in 1988 and attached to the CNRS research administration.  Founded in 1975, MOMs activity has been characterized by a multidisciplinary working approach. It employs 350 people: archaeologists, epigraphists, historians, with the help of physicists, chemists and geologists. Geographers, political scientists and architects are also employed. It is classed as a research federation involving five joint research units (UMR) of CNRS and two other university teams. This federation is linked to the University of Lyon 2 and is especially concerned with historico-morphological studies.  The MOM has also created an online application, an atlas of near east archaeological sites 14000 to 5700 BP, presenting work by a large number of archaeologists.
