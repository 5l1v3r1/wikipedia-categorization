The term can also be defined as <a href=\"/wiki/Biculturalism\" title=\"Biculturalism\">biculturalism</a>, which is the presence of two different cultures in the same country or region. As a general term, culture involves the behaviors and belief characteristics of a particular social, ethnic, or age group. Within culture, we have cultural effects, which are the shared behaviors and customs we learn from the institutions around us. An example of a cultural effect would be how an individual\u2019s personality is strongly influenced by the biological and social norms he is exposed to. Another cultural effect would be that in some societies it would be more <a href=\"/wiki/Acceptable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Acceptable\">acceptable</a> to dress or act in a certain way.\n</p><p>In regards to bicultural identity, an individual may face conflict assimilating into both cultures or finding a balance between both. An individual may face challenges assimilating into the whole, collective culture. Similarly, an individual may face difficulty balancing their identity within themselves due to the influence of both of their cultures. Being an individual with identity plurality can be hard mentally and emotionally. The different levels of biculturalism can be defined though the way people are able to simultaneously manage their two selves. The more they alternate between them, the more cognitive complexity they face, since they avoid cultural duality and do not practice handling both cultures at the same time. It is through identity integration that they will be able to solve the problem and alleviate the tolls that come with identity plurality <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Bicultural identity also may have positive effects on the individual, in terms of the additional knowledge they acquire from belonging to more than one culture. Furthermore, with the growing number of racial minorities in American society, individuals that identify with more than one culture may have more linguistic ability.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Biculturalism_and_personality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Biculturalism  and personality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Measuring_bicultural_identity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Measuring bicultural identity</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Bicultural_Identity_Integration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bicultural Identity Integration</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Bicultural_identity_and_language\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bicultural identity and language</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Cultural_frame_switching\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Cultural frame switching</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Cultural_perspectives\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Cultural perspectives</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#African_American_culture\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">African American culture</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Asian_American_culture\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Asian American culture</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Hispanic_American_culture\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Hispanic American culture</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Immigrant_experience\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Immigrant experience</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Integration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Integration</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Social_and_workplace_interactions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Social and workplace interactions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Family_dynamics_and_integration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Family dynamics and integration</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Academics_and_attitudes_towards_education\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Academics and attitudes towards education</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Biculturalism_and_personality\">Biculturalism  and personality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bicultural_identity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Biculturalism and personality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Culture affects the personality of an individual because the individual may react in a way that is reflective of the knowledge one acquires from one or more culture(s). Problems may arise when ideals in one culture are not connected to another culture, which may cause generalizations about personality. Personality is shaped by both cultures and thus generalizations should not be made based on one single culture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> One\u2019s culture also influences one\u2019s hormonal changes, one\u2019s interaction with violence and one\u2019s family values. For example, Hispanic American culture often requires older children to take care and/or help raise younger siblings, while mainstream American culture interprets parents as the sole caregivers. Another example of this difference would be religious preference and or practice. Cultures other than the American culture may often identify more with certain religions and are often more in tune with their religious beliefs.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Measuring_bicultural_identity\">Measuring bicultural identity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bicultural_identity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Measuring bicultural identity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bicultural_Identity_Integration\">Bicultural Identity Integration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bicultural_identity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Bicultural Identity Integration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One construct to measure bicultural identity is the Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) construct. It is a relatively new construct and was proposed in 2002 by Benet-Mart\u00ednez, Leu, Lee &amp; Morris. The BII looks at how the bicultural individual perceives his bicultural identities and whether they are compatible or oppositional. It also seeks to identify the big five aspects of an individual\u2019s personality, including aspects such as sociability, activity and emotionality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The BII seeks to find whether an individual has a cultural distance or conflict within one\u2019s cultures, which in turn helps indicate how biculturally competent we are.\n</p><p>Low BII bicultural individuals have difficulties in incorporating both cultures into a cohesive identity and tend to see both cultures as highly dissimilar. Bicultural individuals with high BII on the other hand, see their identities as complementary and themselves as part of a \u201cthird\u201d culture, which integrates elements from both their cultures.\nAccording to Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist, individuals respond in a more stable fashion when their cultural contexts are understood. \nResearchers wanted to examine how these differences could relate to other factors and the results are insightful. BII is significantly associated with the psychological and social adjustments of the bicultural. Low BII bicultural individuals are found to have inferior bilingual proficiency, experience more anxiety, depression and are more neurotic and less open than bicultural individuals with high BII.\nMore importantly, low BII bicultural individuals are not chameleon-like. They resist the frame switching and are more likely to respond in ways inconsistent with the cultural cues. In other words, when low BII Chinese-Americans are presented with American cues, unlike high BII bicultural individuals, they would not behave like Americans but instead, more like a Chinese.\nHowever, the identity struggle for bicultural individuals can be made less arduous. It is important to note that like other personality traits, BII is malleable to contextual factors. BII can be increased by asking bicultural individuals to recall positive cross-cultural exchanges or like in another study, make high-level construals. These findings can be useful in for example, helping immigrants to cope with their new environment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bicultural_identity_and_language\">Bicultural identity and language</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bicultural_identity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Bicultural identity and language\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Language\" title=\"Language\">Language</a> is an essential aspect of any culture. Individuals are able to maintain key aspects of their culture by maintaining their culture\u2019s language. Language is important because it is an oral form of how people interact with other people within a society. Language reinforces the ties among the people who speak the same language, and thus encourages cultural bonding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Thus, by preserving the language within both of one\u2019s cultures, one can maintain one\u2019s integration within each culture. However, this can result in a difficulty in integrating one\u2019s cultures if each has a distinct, different language as it can prevent outsiders from understanding that particular culture.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultural_frame_switching\">Cultural frame switching</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Bicultural_identity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Cultural frame switching\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The concept of cultural frame switching (CFS) or <a href=\"/wiki/Double_consciousness\" title=\"Double consciousness\">double consciousness</a> made popular by <a href=\"/wiki/W.E.B_Du_Bois\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"W.E.B Du Bois\">W.E.B Du Bois</a> addresses how an individual switches between cultural frames or systems in response to their environment.

Thus, CFS can be connected to cultural accommodation, which is seen when bilinguals respond to situations with the language that applies best to the situation present. \nIt is evident that language can have an effect on an individual\u2019s thinking process; this is because the language itself primes the individual\u2019s cultural values, attitudes and memory which in turn affects behavior. Thus, language has a powerful effect on the way in which an individual responds to change.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

These occurrences may affect an individual\u2019s perception of their African American culture. \nIn America, Black and White differences are the most significant groupings largely because of American history.

Hispanic Americans are very racially diverse. Hispanics constitute 16.5% of the total United States population. \nHispanic Americans often are very religiously oriented and focus on family values and the importance of intergenerational connections. This may cause difficulty in integration with American culture, as the Hispanic community often emphasizes the importance of helping one\u2019s family and advancing as a family rather than simply individual success, which is more prominent within American Culture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Similarly, Hispanics may have difficulty associating with American Culture because of the language culture, as most Hispanics can speak Spanish. The ability to speak Spanish is valued greatly within Hispanic culture, as it is greatly used during social gatherings and amongst extended family. The Spanish language is a significant part of Hispanic culture, and because of the vast amount of racial differences within Hispanic Americans, the way in which Spanish is spoken within the different racial groups is often different.

Immigrants need to reconcile both their current host cultures and their culture of origin, which is where they grew up. Immigrants culturally evolve through a process of adaptation and assimilation. Immigrants are usually influenced by more dominant values that they have learned in their native cultures. Immigrants encounter a major upheaval by moving far away from home and sometimes may never find themselves connected to either culture. Immigrants face many <a href=\"/wiki/Stress_(psychological)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stress (psychological)\">stresses</a>, which can raise their risk for <a href=\"/wiki/Substance_abuse\" title=\"Substance abuse\">substance abuse</a> and other psychological stressors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Developing a bicultural identity is involves blending two cultures together and learning to be competent within their two cultures. Immigrants and children of these individuals may be more at risk for victimization, poverty, and the need for assistance from the government. Immigrant parents for example may struggle to find a balance in their new lives and may be so busy keeping up with the demands that may be less involved in the community and in turn less involved with their child\u2019s education.\n</p><p>With immigrants, language barriers may also bring hardship in terms of communication with natives of their less dominant culture. Immigrants may not adapt fully because of the language barriers holding them back from even simple conversation. <a href=\"/wiki/Acculturation\" title=\"Acculturation\">Acculturation</a> is the process in which a bicultural individual or immigrant adopts the social norms of the mainstream society. The cultural gap between immigrant parents and their children may widen due to acculturation because younger generations find it easier to adapt to the new culture.

Children of immigrant parents may enjoy more <a href=\"/wiki/Mainstream\" title=\"Mainstream\">mainstream</a> culture, but may also want to stick to their families\u2019 roots in order to please their caregivers. Immigrants and bicultural families do have more positive roles as well. They have strong commitments to family and have a dream for a better life.

Others may be perceived negatively, or their judgments may in turn alter the way that one behaves in certain situations.

Thiese scenarios are contingent on an individual's success with <a href=\"/wiki/Acculturation\" title=\"Acculturation\">acculturation</a> strategies.\n</p><p>A bicultural individual's integration into a workplace also depends on the cultural makeup of his or her team.
