Perspectives on Terrorism is an open-source, peer-reviewed academic journal covering terrorism and counter-terrorism published jointly by the Terrorism Research Initiative (headquartered in Vienna, Austria) and the Institute of Security and Global Affairs at Leiden University, The Hague, the Netherlands. It was established in 2007 as an alternative to the conventional subscription fee-based journals in the field and continues publication as of 2018, releasing six issues per year. James J. F. Forest (University of Massachusetts, USA) and Alex P. Schmid (International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, The Hague) serve as the Editors-in-Chief; Robert Wesley was a founding editor.  The journal's editors state that the open-source nature allows exposure of research published in the journal to a broader audience than traditional academic journals.  The website receives 100,000 annual visitors.  Email subscribers and website visitors discuss its research articles at the journal's Twitter feed. The journal has been abstracted and indexed in Scopus since 2017.  All content is available via JSTOR.
