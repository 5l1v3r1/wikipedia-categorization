The Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST) describes itself as an "international security affairs research institute based at the University of Chicago."      Formerly known as the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism, and the Chicago Project on Suicide Terrorism, it was founded in 2004 by Robert Pape, professor of political science at the University of Chicago and author of Dying to Win, a book about suicide terrorism.  It compiles, maintains and publishes the Suicide Attack Database, a comprehensive database of suicide terrorism around the world since 1982. . CPOST frequently works closely with the United States government, particularly the Department of Defense.  The work of CPOST has been covered in the New York Times,   the Washington Post,  the Boston Globe,  Foreign Policy,  and ABC News.  CPOST members have appeared on C-SPAN shows discussing terrorism  as well as on CNN.  CPOST recently released its first report titled "The American Face of ISIS" in partnership with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.    Pape et al. reported major differences in the numbers of suicide terrorist incidents by year between CPOST and the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).  For 2008 and 2013 they reported the following:     Pape et al. quote GTD officials as claiming that their “researchers, past and present, have ensured that the entire database uses the same standards for inclusion and is as comprehensive as possible.”  Pape et al. disagree, noting that the difference between the GTD and CPOST counts is easily explained by a change in GTD methodology that occurred 11/1/2011.   Meanwhile, they claim their CPOST methodology has been consistent since their first recorded incident in 1982.  They conclude, “American policy makers and the public deserve the best data available on terrorism, one of the most important national security issues of our time.”
