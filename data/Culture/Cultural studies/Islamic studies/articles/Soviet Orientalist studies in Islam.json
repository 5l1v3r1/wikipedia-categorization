Reisner (Michael von Reusner, 1868\u20131928), ethnic German historian of law and publicist produced a detailed Marxist analysis of the <a href=\"/wiki/Koran\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Koran\">Koran</a> from the perspective of <a href=\"/wiki/Social_studies\" title=\"Social studies\">social studies</a>. His interpretation of Islam can be found in two articles on \u201cThe Koran and Its Social Ideology\u201d, published in 1926 in a Soviet literary journal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In these studies Reisner maintained that Islam was the religion of the Arab merchants of <a href=\"/wiki/Mecca\" title=\"Mecca\">Mecca</a>. He distinguished between the big merchants, that is, the rich families of Mecca, and the less affluent and poor merchant families. Due to the disunion of the <a href=\"/wiki/Tribes_of_Arabia\" title=\"Tribes of Arabia\">Arab tribes</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_route\" title=\"Trade route\">trade caravans</a> were constantly running the risk of being raided by nomads. These <a href=\"/wiki/Convoy\" title=\"Convoy\">caravans</a> were organized as joint ventures of rich and less affluent trade families of the <a href=\"/wiki/Quraysh_(tribe)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quraysh (tribe)\">Quraysh</a> tribe, but the poorer merchants invested, and therefore risked, a higher percentage of their capital than the rich families. For this reason the idea of a union of the <a href=\"/wiki/Arab_tribes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arab tribes\">Arab tribes</a> under one <a href=\"/wiki/Monotheism\" title=\"Monotheism\">monotheistic religion</a> was developed by the poorer families of the Quraysh, for only such a union would eliminate the raids. Their speaker became Muhammad, who himself hailed from one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Banu_Hashim\" title=\"Banu Hashim\">less privileged Quraysh clans</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Reisner maintains that the Koran portrayed <a href=\"/wiki/Allah\" title=\"Allah\">Allah</a> as \"a rich, powerful and smart <a href=\"/wiki/Capitalism\" title=\"Capitalism\">capitalist</a>\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> In <a href=\"/wiki/Medina\" title=\"Medina\">Medina</a>, Muhammad acted not so much as a prophet and preacher but as a skillful organizer. He was successful not because people were eager to join a new religion but because they longed for a <a href=\"/wiki/Sharia\" title=\"Sharia\">law</a> that would unite them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The Koran, Reisner continues, only guarantees the <a href=\"/wiki/Right_to_property\" title=\"Right to property\">right to property</a> and creates a \u201cWorld Trade Company of Believers\u201d (mirovaia torgovaia kompaniia veruiushchikh) under God\u2019s own leadership.

In his contribution to the 1930 special issue of <i>Ateist</i> on the origins of Islam, Beliaev argued that Islam emerged from the merchant environment of Mecca.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The pagan religion served the purpose of trade, and the authority of the gods in the <a href=\"/wiki/Kaaba\" title=\"Kaaba\">kaaba</a> grew with the wealth of the merchants. Islam emerged in the late 6th century as a movement of the less wealthy, \u201cintermediary and lower Meccan bourgeoisie\u201d against this \u201c\u2018aristocracy\u2019 of avaricious traders and pitiless usurers.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In contrast to Reisner, however, Beliaev did not see anything progressive, liberating, or even revolutionary in this initial Islam: for instance, Islam did not stand up against slavery. Beliaev compared the image of God in the Koran to that of a despot and slave owner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to Beliav, a similar struggle was taking place in Medina, where some clans became dependant upon others, and especially upon the <a href=\"/wiki/Judaism\" title=\"Judaism\">Jewish</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_tribes_of_Arabia\" title=\"Jewish tribes of Arabia\">clans</a>, whose wealth was based on \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Usury\" title=\"Usury\">usury capital</a>\u201d (rostovshchicheskii kapital). The gradual dissolution of the ancient tribal and clan structures in Muslim Medina must not be ascribed to the religion of Islam but rather to the development of Meccan trade capital, and in general to the transition to private property in slaves, cattle, and other possessions. \u201cWith an eagerness and love for detail that is characteristic for the petty bourgeoisie, the boring, depressing and dull Suras of the Medinan period lay down the regulations for property and inheritance as well as buying and selling\u201d.In Medina Muhammad changed the <a href=\"/wiki/Qibla\" title=\"Qibla\">prayer direction</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Jerusalem\" title=\"Jerusalem\">Jerusalem</a> to Mecca; \u201cpraying to the Muslim God, they bow down before the only god that they respect, namely capital.\u201d When the \u201cmedium wealthy\u201d traders finally took over Mecca, they reached their goal: together with the rich \u201cQuraysh of the Center\u201d they found themselves at the helm of the \u201ctrade capitalist organization of the Hijaz\u201d which eventually united the tribes of Arabia. The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Beliaev\u2019s scenario; after Muhammad\u2019s death they easily committed <a href=\"/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam\" title=\"Apostasy in Islam\">apostasy</a> and had to be forced back to Islam by the first caliph, <a href=\"/wiki/Abu_Bakr\" title=\"Abu Bakr\">Abu Bakr</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ditiakin\">Ditiakin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Ditiakin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>V. Ditiakin, an expert on the history of Marxism, took as his starting point the works of Marx and Engels instead of Islamic tradition, nor Western Oriental studies or even Reisner. Ditiakin conceded that Marx and Engels had only limited sources at their disposal and never devoted a special study to Islam; nevertheless he believed they came to important insights on this topic.\n</p><p>According to Ditiakin, Marx and Engels understood that <a href=\"/wiki/Pre-Islamic_Arabia\" title=\"Pre-Islamic Arabia\">pre-Islamic Arabia</a> was characterized by two different environments, that of nomadic <a href=\"/wiki/Bedouin\" title=\"Bedouin\">Bedouins</a> and that of settled urban traders. As the correspondences of the two thinkers show, the Bedouins could hardly be characterized as bearers of high culture, whereas the population of the southwestern Arabian peninsula was a \u201ccivilized\u201d Oriental high culture. Obviously, Engels had access to publications on <a href=\"/wiki/Petroglyphs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Petroglyphs\">petroglyphs</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Yemen\" title=\"Yemen\">Yemen</a>, which, in his mind, reflected \u201cthe ancient, national Arabic tradition of monotheism\u201d. However, in the centuries immediately before Muhammad the old culture of Yemen was destroyed by incursions of the <a href=\"/wiki/Ethiopia\" title=\"Ethiopia\">Ethiopians</a>, and consequently also the Arabian trade route to the north via Mecca was in decay. This decline of trade in the period before Muhammad was, as Engels wrote to Marx in 1853, \u201cone of the chief factors in the Muhammadan revolution\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To quote Engels again, \u201cit seems that Mohammad\u2019s religious revolution, like <i>every</i> religious movement, was <i>formally a reaction</i>, an alleged return to the old, the simple\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> \u201cthe movement [of Muhammad] has seemed to me to have the character of a Bedouin reaction against the settled but degenerate fellahin of the towns, who at that time had also become very decadent in their religion, mingling a corrupt nature-cult with corrupt Judaism and Christianity.\u201d The decline referred to by Engels was thus economic and religious.\n</p><p>According to Ditiakin, Engels\u2019 statements led to the apparent contradiction that the uncivilized Bedouins, who were defeated and driven out of their country by foreign invaders, created an \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Ideology\" title=\"Ideology\">ideological system</a>\u201d that would ultimately rescue Arabia and soon rule over\na huge part of the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> In Ditiakin\u2019s mind, this apparent contradiction can only be solved by the following line of reasoning: The cradle of Islam was characterized by a coexistence of the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouins and the formerly highly developed trade economy of the \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Fellah\" title=\"Fellah\">urban fellahs</a>\u201d, which was however in decline, but still \u201cpotentially\u201d stronger than the Bedouin culture. A series of \u201crevolutionary blows\u201d was necessary to dissolve the contradictions between the two, and to free the trade formation from its restrictions. These blows came in the form of foreign invasions, as Engels had\nsuggested in 1853: \u201cThe expulsion of the <a href=\"/wiki/Habesha_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Habesha people\">Abyssinians</a> took place about forty years before Mohammed and was obviously the first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness, which was also spurred by Persian invasions from the North, pushing forward almost to Mecca\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For Ditiakin, Islam had a Bedouin character, and Bedouin lifestyle had a huge impact on the new religion. Due to the course of the Islamic expansion, however, the emergent religion of Islam was soon adapted to the foundations of urban economy. Accordingly, Islam eliminated the relics of the clan-based society and became the ideology of an urban society. The old nomadic and Bedouin cultural heritage of Islam, however, turned out to be strong enough to prevent Islam from becoming dominant in Europe.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Ditiakin came to the conclusion that Muhammad\u2019s fight against the Quraysh of Mecca was \u201ca revolution of the dying Bedouin culture against developing trade capital\u201d\u2014seemingly the exact contrary to Reisner\u2019s trade capitalism theory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bedouin_theory\">Bedouin theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Bedouin theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Another interpretation of the role of the Bedouins was brought forward by the Kazakh communist and historian Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov (1889\u20131938).<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> In 1928, during his brief directorate of the Moscow Oriental Institute, Asfendiarov published his first booklet on the \u201cReasons for the Emergence of Islam\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Asfendiarov regarded Islam as the product not of the merchants of Mecca, as Reisner did, but of the Arab nomads. To him, the Islamic expansion was a huge emigration wave of about one million nomads from the <a href=\"/wiki/Hijaz\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hijaz\">Hijaz</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Najd\" title=\"Najd\">Najd</a> regions of Arabia to the outside world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Asfendiarov maintained that Islam emerged as the last huge expansion of Semite tribes from Arabia. However, Asfendiarov insisted that this expansion resulted from changes in the nomadic economy, not from climate change.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to him, the Arabs were beyond the formation of \u201cprimitive patriarchal nomadism\u201d; rather, they possessed a \u201cdeveloped\u201d, modified cattle breeding economy. By the 7th century, Arabia suffered from a scarcity in land for cattle breeding. The Byzantine and Persian empires in the North, and the Persian and Ethiopian interventions in Yemen, resulted in an isolation of Central Arabia, as well as in a heightened competition for the available pastures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Due to this scarcity and competition, Arab tribes now occupied the oases and towns of the Hijaz, like Mecca and Medina, which had hitherto been inhabited mainly by Jews and other settled populations. The Arabic tribes that conquered these settlements took over the agricultural and merchant activities that had been in place.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Some Bedouin tribes, like the Quraysh, therefore turned into trading tribes. Due to the increased mutual raiding and warfare among cattle-breeders, more and more Arab nomads lost their livestock, settled around these settlements as pauperized and dependant clans, and took on agricultural work to make a living.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For all of these reasons, the tribal economy of 7th-century Arabia constituted more than just a primitive patriarchal society, for the majority of transhumant cattle-breeders was supplemented by Arab traders and Arab agriculturalists (or \u201csemi-agriculturalists\u201d, as Asfendiarov had it,<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> for they still had connections to the nomadic way of life). Taken together, these three social groups still made up one single economic formation, one that was characterized by a certain amount of economic specialization with all ensuing social contradictions, especially a marked distinction between rich and poor. What they all had in common was their tribal organization, which did not evolve into a community- or neighborhood-based social organization. The tribal organization, according to Asfendiarov, was not simply a \u201cresidue\u201d (perezhitok) of the past that was doomed to vanish, but rather a very functional element necessary for survival in all three economic environments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> He concluded that the Orient was characterized not by a historical sequence of primitive-patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist society, as in the West, but by one tribal formation that combined elements from all three formations. According to Asfendiarov, this tribal formation was retained at least until the 16th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Islam, in Asfendiarov\u2019s mind, was nothing but the event that triggered off the social expansion of the Arab tribes, uniting the tribes to break the isolation of Arabia. It was an \u201cunconscious impulse\u201d, an \u201calmost secondary reason\u201d for the movement of the tribes. Islam should therefore be understood as an economic movement of the tribes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Accordingly, Asfendiarov strongly criticized Reisner\u2019s view that Islam embodied the interests of the Meccan traders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Peasant_theory\">Peasant theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Peasant theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A completely new interpretation of the rise of Islam was brought\nforward by the economist Mikhail L. Tomara. Tomara\u2019s article in the Ateist special issue of 1930, entitled \u201cThe\nOrigin of Islam and Its Class Basis\u201d,<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> points at the role of peasants\nand agriculture in 7th-century Arabia. Tomara listed up a vast\nnumber of witnesses, taken partly from al-\u1e6cabar\u012b (d. 923), but\nmostly from European travellers like Niebuhr, Burton and Palgrave,\nand especially from Aloys Sprenger\u2019s <i>Das Leben und Werk des Mohammed</i>\n(1861\u20131865), showing that Arabia\u2019s agricultural and horticultural\npopulation vastly exceeded its Bedouin population, not to speak of\nthe merchants.\n</p><p>In Tomara\u2019s mind, agriculture was mainly taken up\nby impoverished Bedouins; under the general climate change in\nArabia, Bedouins whose pastures dried up would either emigrate or, when the emigration was blocked as was the case before Islam,\ndig wells and settle down to pursue agriculture with the help of\nartificial irrigation. The continuous transformation of pasture land\ninto fields led to an intensified struggle between the Bedouins and\nthe peasant population. Tomara assumed that the agriculturalists\nconsisted mainly of clients (<i>maw\u0101l\u012b</i>, sing. <i>mawla</i>) of powerful\nclans, manumitted slaves and other dislocated people. Poor agriculturalists\nwould become dependent on usurers and often lose their\nhouse, land, and cattle, thus being forced to work as hired pastors\n(Russ. <i>batraki</i>) for rich neighbors. Tomara thus distinguished three\n\u201cclasses\u201d: nomads, well-to-do peasants, and impoverished peasants\nwho lived a semi-transhumant or even transhumant life (obviously,\nwhile herding the Bedouins\u2019 cattle).<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Incidentally, he provided no source for his assumption that impoverished peasants sold their labor as pastors.\n</p><p>Tomara further maintained that trade was only slightly developed\nin 7th-century Arabia, and therefore Islam cannot be credited to it:\n\u201cIslam was born in the trade city of Mecca, but only as an expression\nof the dissatisfaction of the poor strata of the city; and it turned\nout to be unsuccessful there. Trade capital, as a fierce opponent of\nIslam, defeated Islam and drove it out of Mecca\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Subsequently,\nIslam found a solid class basis in Medina, an exclusively agricultural\ntown. The Koran\u2019s endorsement of charity, so Tomara, the use of\nalms to support the poor, to manumit slaves, and to relieve debtors\nfrom their financial burdens, shows clearly that Islam emerged as\nthe religion of the urban poor. The poor emigrants (muh\u0101jir\u016bn) from\nMecca joined the urban poor of Medina and broke the power of\nthe rich Medinan landowners who had opposed Muhammad at\nseveral occasions. As indicated in Koran 59:7, Muhammad allotted\nagricultural lands in and around Medina to his poor supporters as\nwell as to people who flocked to him from other agricultural communities\nin Arabia. The increasing need to reward peasant supporters\nled to the expulsion, and later annihilation, of the Jewish clans of Medina, for they held the best arable land in and around the oasis.\nBy contrast, Muhammad did not invest much energy into the fight\nagainst the Quraysh, for there was no peasant land to gain from\ndry Mecca; the few famous battles like Badr (in 624) were mere\nskirmishes, and the later battle at Uhud and the Meccan siege of\nMedina show that Muhammad was clearly on the defensive against\nhis hometown. Tomara found support for his \u201cpeasant theory\u201d in\nthe Koran; its ban of interest, in his mind, expressed the interests\nof agriculturalists who suffered from exploitation by usurers. Also,\nhe suggested that the Koranic inheritance laws reflect the ongoing\nsplitting-up of agricultural land in Medina.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Tomara\u2019s\nscenario; they were unreliable as warriors,75 and they accepted Islam\nonly superficially. Also, \u201cif Islam was the religion of the nomadic\ncattle-breeders, then Paradise would have been depicted [in the\nKoran] as infinite steppes of high grass, similar to the way how\nAmerican Indians imagined their reward in the Hereafter as hunting\ngrounds in prairies with plenty of bisons and other wild animals.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Accordingly, in the War of Apostasy (ridda) after Muhammad\u2019s death\nthe Bedouin tribes tried to reclaim the pasture lands they had lost\nto the poor Medinans and to agriculture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> But this rebellion was\ncrushed by Ab\u016b Bakr, and the nomads found themselves forced to\nemigrate. As both the Sassanid and the Byzantine empire were now\nin political and economical disarray, the Bedouins found an easy\noutlet by emigration to Persia, Syria, and Egypt.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> In result, and\nsomewhat surprisingly, the Islamic expansion under the first caliphs\nwas mainly undertaken by nomads driven out of their territories by\nIslam itself. Thus, in its beginnings Islam was the ideology of the\npeasants, and only later, under the Abbasids after 750, did Islam\nbecome \u201cthe ideology of trade capital in the form of Mu\u2019tazilism, and the ideology of the feudal classes of Persia in the form of\nShi\u2019ism.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tomara\u2019s interpretation thus does not ignore the role of nomadic\nBedouins and urban traders, and even assigns them meaningful roles\nin the emergence and spread of Islam. Their functions, however,\nwere mainly defined in the negative. Because Tomara\npointed out the crucial role of the poor agriculturalists in and around\nthe towns, his concept would be regarded by his opponents as a\nmere \u201cpeasant theory\u201d.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Klimovich\">Klimovich</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Klimovich\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Liutsian I. Klimovich (1907\u20131989), in his first major scholarly article, entitled \u201cOn the Origin of\nIslam\u201d,<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> made references to a\nconsiderable number of Western Orientalists (like Dozy, N\u00f6ldeke,\nMuir, Weil, von Kremer, Lammens, and Sprenger) and largely followed Mikhail Reisner\u2019s theory that Islam emerged from Meccan trade\ncapitalism. The opposition of the poor merchant families was directed\nagainst the rich clans and their pagan cult at the kaaba. This opposition\nmanifested itself first in the movement of the Arab Hanif\nmonotheists which was later to develop into Islam. Klimovich maintained\nthat this movement was originally atheist, progressive and\nrevolutionary in character; when Muhammad became its figurehead\nthe movement took on religious traits, yet without losing its progressive\ncharacter right away.<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> After the hijra to Medina Muhammad\nturned into a dexterous politician for whom Islam was nothing but\na means to gain power. Similarly, the Arab tribes that joined the\nmovement were only interested in booty, not in religion. After a\nseries of battles the reactionary merchants of Mecca decided to\nembrace the new religion, because they understood that Islam would\nprovide them with a new instrument for ruling over the Arab tribes.\nIt is at the hands of these rich merchant families, according to\nKlimovich, that Islam finally turned from a revolutionary movement\ninto an instrument for oppression and spiritual enslavement of the\nMuslim masses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> It seems that with his insistence on the \u201cprogressive\u201d character of early Islam Klimovich intended to develop a new and specific strategy for anti-Islamic propaganda, one that would pull the carpet from underneath the believers\u2019 feet.\nAfter graduating in 1929 Klimovich returned to his hometown\nKazan, where he was a member of the local branch of the League\nof the Militant Godless (Soiuz Voinstvuiushchikh Bezbozhnikov, SVB).<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\nThat same year he published his first two books. In Sotsialisticheskoe\nstroitel\u2019stvo na vostoke i religiia,<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> Klimovich maintained that the Muslim\nperiphery of the Soviet Union was witnessing an ongoing revival of\nIslam. Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, reformist\nmullahs tried to convince the Muslim masses that Islam was perfectly compatible with socialism.\n</p><p>Klimovich warned that this was a deception,\nfor socialism was based on Marxism, <a href=\"/wiki/Materialism\" title=\"Materialism\">materialism</a>, and the\n<a href=\"/wiki/Hegel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hegel\">dialectical method</a>, and diametrically opposed to religion and its\n<a href=\"/wiki/Idealism\" title=\"Idealism\">idealism</a>. Atheist propagandists, however, were often helpless in their\ndiscussions with the believers. What Klimovich considered necessary,\ntherefore, was basic information on Islam for the anti-religious\nactivist. This was the purpose of his second book of 1929, Soderzhanie\nkorana (\u201cThe Contents of the Koran\u201d).<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> This book was\nbasically a compilation of quotations from the Koran. Klimovich\nexplained the book\u2019s structure, the Koranic image of God, as well\nas its narratives on the creation of the world, Judgment Day, Paradise,\nand Hell. Above all, he emphasized internal contradictions in the\nKoranic message and the scientific inaccurateness and simplicity\nof the scripture.\n</p><p>Klimovich\u2019s Koran book still followed Mikhail Reisner\u2019s view that\nIslam emerged from Meccan merchant capitalism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> The Koran,\naccording to Klimovich, was an \u201cArabic law book\u201d which demanded\ndiscipline in the interest of the merchant corporation, whose codex\nit represents. Besides trade, a second \u201cway\u201d demanded in the holy\nbook of Islam is endurance and obedience to God, the Prophet and\nhis family, as well as to the \u201cpeople in power\u201d, which, in Klimovich\u2019s\nmind, clearly reflected the reactionary turn of Islam. The third \u201cway\u201d\nof Islam is jih\u0101d, the call to fight and kill the unbelievers. As martyrs\nwould directly go to heaven, Klimovich regarded jih\u0101d as \u201ca lottery\nin which one cannot lose\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Existence_of_Muhammad\">Existence of Muhammad</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Existence of Muhammad\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In November 1930 Klimovich came up with what he probably believed to be a fatal blow to Islam and at the same time a revolution within Islamic studies. That month he gave a lecture in the Communist Academy (probably in Kazan), asking the provocative question, \u201cDid Muhammad Exist?\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-49\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> This lecture amounted to a wholesale refutation of Islamic historiography on the early Muslim community. According to Klimovich, no contemporary sources on Muhammad\u2019s life have come down to us; the earliest known reports and biographies of the prophet, like that of Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q/Ibn Hish\u0101m, were written by Muslim authors of the mid-8th and 9th centuries. By that time, however, the Muslim scholars themselves had no reliable information on Muhammad\u2019s life at their disposal; all they had was the Koran, and therefore their biographies and the \u1e25ad\u012bth material is nothing but a late illustration and commentary on the Koran.<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> In fact, by that time the language of the Koran itself was so incomprehensible even to Arabs that the new additional\nsources were necessary to make sense of it at all.<sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> In result, the time gap between Muhammad\u2019s alleged lifetime and the first written\nsources was so huge that we cannot suppose that any of the information given in these sources is authentic. According to Klimovich,\nalso references to Muhammad in Christian sources were anything\nbut convincing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> Klimovich concluded that nothing is known for\nsure about the historical Muhammad, and that it is even likely that\nhe never existed. Quite consequently, Klimovich assumed that the\nKoran was not Muhammad\u2019s work but the product of a whole\ngroup of authors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> Muhammad was created by later historians as\na myth, designed to explain the emergence of the Islamic community\nout of the Hanif movement. The prophet was an invention to cover\nup early Islam\u2019s character as a social protest movement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-54\">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"During_the_Stalinist_Era\">During the Stalinist Era</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: During the Stalinist Era\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the Stalinist Era and the domination of Feudalism theory, Klimovich understood he had to withdraw from his view that Islam had initially been a progressive social protest movement. The starting point could no longer be the Koran, the Arabic tradition, or the critique of \u201cbourgeois\u201d Orientalism; instead, one had to start with the works of Marx and Engels. In a lecture held at the KUTV in May 1933,<sup id=\"cite_ref-55\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-55\">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> 120 Klimovich basically listed up all quotes by Engels on Islam which Ditiakin had already published in 1927, without, however, giving any credit to Ditiakin. As we have seen, Engels remarked that religion was a \u201cfantastic\u201d reflection on life, that Islam was the \u201creaction of the Bedouins\u201d as well as the \u201cfirst act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness\u201d, a \u201creturn to the old\u201d. Taking these quotes together, Klimovich concluded that Islam had to be classified as reactionary.\n</p><p>Klimovich now contended that Islam resulted from a process of \u201cfeudalization\u201d and centralization of the Arabic tribes, which was reflected in the centralization of the religious cults in the Kaaba. Put in these terms, Islam emerged as the \u201cideology of feudal lords (Russ. feodalov)\u201d, representing exploitation and inequality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-56\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-56\">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Feudalism_theory\">Feudalism theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Soviet_Orientalist_studies_in_Islam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Feudalism theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This theory remained dominant throughout the Stalinist era and afterward because it confirmed the official Soviet doctrine.

At the same time, the tone of the debates became\neven more aggressive. One of the earliest contributions to this develop\nment was a review essay written by one Kh. Naumov in 1932,<sup id=\"cite_ref-58\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-58\">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> which appeared in <i>Revoliutsionnyi Vostok</i>.\n</p><p>Naumov\u2019s review essay attacked\nEvgenii Beliaev, who had recently published a textbook with Russian\ntranslations of Western European Orientalists.<sup id=\"cite_ref-59\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-59\">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> Naumov attacked Beliaev harshly not only for \u201cpopularizing\u201d the\nachievements of bourgeois Orientalists but also for presenting the\nthree economic environments distinctly, and for adding them up\n\u201cmechanically\u201d. Instead of being separated, he insisted, \u201cthe three\nsystems were distinct parts of a unified economy of Arabia in those\ndays, with the trade regions having a dominant role on the basis\nof their feudal relations\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-60\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-60\">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> Naumov\nnowhere explained this relationship between trade and feudalism,\nnor did he provide any sources.\n</p><p>Naumov quoted Engels to the effect that \u201call religion (\u2026) is\nnothing but the fantastic reflection in men\u2019s minds of those external\nforces which control their daily live\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-61\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-61\">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup> This quote alone sufficed\nhim to maintain that \u201cthe Koran is the distorted fantastic expression\nof the reality of those times\u201d. Consequently, it is wrong to regard\nthe Koran as a source for early Islam. Naumov went on to explain\nthat it is also inacceptable to make a distinction between Muslims\nand non-Muslims, as Beliaev had done when he mentioned that the\nMuslims of Medina were attacking the caravans of pagan Mecca.\nMaking a distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims, so Naumov,\nmeans to take over the position of \u201cmissionaries\u201d who sort out the\nnon-believers (as we will see, the accusation that Orientalists become\nmissionaries, that scholarship serves religion, was becoming a convenient\nand widespread instrument of defamation in the 1930s).\nNaumov also attacked many other Marxist Orientalists, including\nLiutsian Klimovich for his view that Islam was a \u201csocial revolution\u201d\nof the \u201cprogressive elements of Arabic trade capital\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-62\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-62\">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Naumov\u2019s leveling of Muslims and non-Muslims, his disregard for\nreligion as a special factor, can probably best be characterized as an\nultra-leftist position.
