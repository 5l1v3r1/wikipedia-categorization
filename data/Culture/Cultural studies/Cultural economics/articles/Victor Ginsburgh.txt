Victor Alexandre Ginsburgh (born 1939 in Rwanda-Urundi) is a Belgian economist of Austrian origin. Victor Ginsburgh studied at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and mastered in econometrics. He earned an economics Ph.D. in 1972. He has been an Economics professor at Université Libre de Bruxelles since 1975; he is now an honorary professor. He is former co-director of the European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics (ECARES). He has been visiting professor in several US universities (Yale, University of Virginia, Chicago University), as well as in France (Paris and Marseille), and Belgium (Louvain and Liège). He is also member of the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE), Université catholique de Louvain. He wrote and edited a dozen books (including The Structure of Applied General Equilibrium, Cambridge, MA., MIT Press, 1997, with M. Keyzer, and How Many Languages Do We Need, Princeton University Press, 2011 with Shlomo Weber) and is the author or coauthor of over 180 papers on topics in applied and theoretical economics, including industrial organization and general equilibrium analysis. His more recent interests go to the economics of languages, as well as to art history and art philosophy, two fields in which he tries to put to use his (self-taught) knowledge of economics. He has published over 50 papers on these topics, some of which appeared in the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, Games and Economic Behavior, the Journal of Economic Perspectives and the European Economic Review. He is also one of the editors of the Journal of Wine Economics published by the American Association of Wine Economists.
