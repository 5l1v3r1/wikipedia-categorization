Self-expression values are part of a core value dimension in the modernization process.  Self-expression is a cluster of values that include social toleration, life satisfaction, public expression and an aspiration to liberty. Ronald Inglehart, the University of Michigan professor who developed the theory of post-materialism, has worked extensively with this concept. On the Inglehartâ€“Welzel Cultural Map self-expression values are contrasted with survival values, illustrating the changes in values across countries and generations.   The idea that the world is moving towards self-expression values  was discussed at length in an article in the Economist.  Self expression is to say something that you truly believe is important in a form of communication, such as art, speech and dance. It is to reveal yourself in a way that is special to yourself.  The emergence of the post-industrial society has brought about a wave of cultural change.  In the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and a growing share of East Asia, a majority of the people are no longer employed in factories, but work in the service sector instead.  There has been a shift from a mechanical environment to one where ever more people spend their days dealing with other people, symbols, and information, which means that workers in the knowledge sector must exercise their own judgment and choice. This shift has had major consequences: The destandardization of economic activities and social life diminishes social constraints in unprecedented ways. The shift in post-industrial societies is thus one of emancipation from authority.  Industrialization can lead to fascism, communism, theocracy or democracy. But post-industrial society brings socio-cultural changes that make truly effective democracy increasingly probable. Knowledge societies cannot function effectively without highly educated workers, who become articulate and accustomed to thinking for themselves. Furthermore, rising levels of economic security bring growing emphasis on self-expression values that give high priority to free choice. Mass publics become increasingly likely to want democracy, and increasingly effective in getting it. Repressing mass demands for liberalization becomes increasingly costly and detrimental to economic effectiveness. These changes link economic development with democracy.  The most thorough assessment of self-expression values is carried out in the World Values Survey. Five "waves" have been conducted so far, each adding additional countries to the survey. Subsequent data analysis by Inglehart revealed that a large percentage in the variability in the data could be explained by using a set of measures that tapped just two dimensions: a traditional to secular-rational axis, and a survival to self-expression axis. The factor scores were originally based on 22 variables,  but this was reduced to  only 10 (5 for each dimension) for the purposes of data availability. The self-expression axis has the following factor loadings.  Despite comprising only five variables, the correlates for this dimension across the WV survey are very strong. Below is a partial list.  Positive answers indicate survival values, the opposite of self-expression values.
