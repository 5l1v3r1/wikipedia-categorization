The CADRE Laboratory for New Media was founded in 1985 at San José State University.  It is currently coordinated by percussionist and media artist Andrew Blanton. It was previously coordinated by G. Craig Hobbs as well as Joel Slayton, professor emeritus of SJSU, and director from 1991 to 2011. In Stephen Wilson's 2002 book, Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, And Technology, Wilson describes the focus of the CADRE labs as "the development and testing of emerging technology applications in art, design, education, and communications in the context of critical discourse." Wilson, Stephen (2002). Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, And Technology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT. p. 870. ISBN 9780262232098.  Founded in 1984, CADRE is the second oldest media lab in the United States and has a long and notable list of alumni. CADRE offers BFA and MFA degrees in Digital Media Art.  CADRE has published SWITCH, an online journal of new media, since 1995. SWITCH and CADRE were early centers of the net.art movement that coincided with the Dot-com bubble in nearby Silicon Valley. The CADRE labs have historically worked closely with the ZeroOne Biennial, one of the foremost new media art exhibitions in the world. In 2006, CADRE, along with SJSU served as the academic hosts for the ISEA symposium and ZeroOne Festival held in San Jose.  CADRE students collaborated on several artist residencies and several current and former students had their artworks in the festival.
