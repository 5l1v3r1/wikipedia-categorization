Redface is the term being used by some to describe the wearing of feathers, warpaint, etc. by non-natives which propagate American Indian stereotypes, analogous to the wearing of Blackface. In the early twentieth century, it was often Jewish performers, coping with their own limited access to mainstream society, who adopted blackface or redface.  In the early days of television sitcoms, "non-Native sitcom characters donned headdresses, carried tomahawks, spoken broken English, played Squanto at Thanksgiving gatherings, received "Indian" names, danced wildly, and exhibited other examples of representations of redface".  The copying from minority cultures by members of a dominant culture is cultural appropriation, which is not universally viewed as a negative activity with regard to "artistic borrowing".  However, redface has been used to describe non-native adoption of indigenous culture, no matter how sympathetic, such as the painters in the Taos Society of Artists during the early 20th Century portraying themselves in their own works wearing native clothing.  While now often associated with the behavior of sports fans for teams with Native American names or mascots,  redface also includes other instances such as "Indian" Halloween costumes, or headdresses as a fashion accessory.
