Modern primitives or urban primitives are people in developed and culturally altered post-colonial nations who engage in body modification rituals and practices while making reference or homage to the rite of passage practices in "primitive cultures".  These practices may include body piercing, tattooing, play piercing, flesh hook suspension, corset training, scarification, branding, and cutting. The motivation for engaging in these varied practices may be personal growth, rite of passage, or spiritual or sexual curiosity. Roland Loomis, also known as Fakir Musafar, is considered the father of the modern primitive movement.  The 1989 RE/Search book Modern Primitives is largely responsible[clarification needed] for the promotion of the concept of modern primitivism.
