{"parse":{"title":"Cross-cultural competence","pageid":22005607,"revid":796843632,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Cross-cultural competence</b> refers to the knowledge, skills, and affect/motivation that enable individuals to adapt effectively in cross-cultural environments. Cross-cultural competence is defined here as an individual capability that contributes to <a href=\"/wiki/Cross-cultural_communication\" title=\"Cross-cultural communication\">intercultural</a> effectiveness regardless of the particular intersection of cultures. Although some aspects of cognition, behavior, or affect may be particularly relevant in a specific country or region, evidence suggests that a core set of competencies enables adaptation to any culture (Hammer, 1987).\n</p><p>Cross-cultural competence is not an end in itself, but is a set of variables that contribute to intercultural effectiveness. Whereas previous models have tended to emphasize subjective outcomes, by focusing primarily on adjustment, outcomes of interest here include both subjective and objective outcomes. Objective outcomes, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Job_performance\" title=\"Job performance\">job performance</a>, have been addressed\nin previous research, but to a lesser degree than the subjective outcomes. Research indicates that the outcomes are linked, with personal and interpersonal adjustment linked to work adjustment, which has in turn been linked with job performance (Shay &amp; Baack, 2006). However, these relationships are small, and some research has demonstrated that subjective outcomes can diverge from objective outcomes (Kealey, 1989), with expatriates sometimes showing relatively poor adjustment but high\neffectiveness in their organizational role.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cross-cultural_competence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_competence\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cultural competence\">Cultural competence</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Intercultural_competence\" title=\"Intercultural competence\">Intercultural competence</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Transcultural_Psychiatry\" title=\"Transcultural Psychiatry\">Transcultural Psychiatry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Acculturation\" title=\"Acculturation\">Acculturation</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cross-cultural_competence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Text of this article has been taken from a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090327055720/http://www.hqda.army.mil/ari/pdf//SR_2008-01.pdf\">US Army document</a>, with a claim the source is public domain.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1331\nCached time: 20180905201201\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.000 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 12/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:22005607-0!canonical and timestamp 20180905201201 and revision id 796843632\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Culture_terminology"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Cultural_competence"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Acculturation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cross-cultural communication"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cultural competence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Intercultural competence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Job performance"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Transcultural Psychiatry"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["https://web.archive.org/web/20090327055720/http://www.hqda.army.mil/ari/pdf//SR_2008-01.pdf"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Cross-cultural_competence","byteoffset":1499,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Cross-cultural_competence","byteoffset":1621,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Cross-cultural competence","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5188097"}]}}
