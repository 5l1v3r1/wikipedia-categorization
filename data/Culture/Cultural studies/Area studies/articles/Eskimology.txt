Eskimology /ˌɛskəˈmɑːlədʒi/ or Inuitology is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and ethnology of people speaking Eskimo–Aleut languages and Eskimo (Inuit–Yupik)–Aleut peoples in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the Chukchi Peninsula on the eastern tip of Siberia of Russian Federation to Alaska of the United States, Northern Canada (incl. Nunavik and Nunatsiavut), and Greenland of Denmark.  Originally, a Eskimologist or Inuitologist was primarily a linguist or philologist who researches Eskimology scholar.[clarification needed] Eskimology traces its beginning to the pioneering work of Hans Egede (1745) and David Crantz (1767) in Greenland.  Eskimology has traditionally had a particular focus on Greenland studies owing to the long-standing relationship between Denmark and Greenland established in the early 18th century, and the academic discipline of Eskimology is today centered at the University of Copenhagen. The term "Eskimology" was not common until 1967, when a genuine department was established and officially named the Department of Eskimology. From the late 1960s, Eskimology changed its focus toward increasingly contemporary and global political issues.
