The J.R.R. Tolkien Lecture on Fantasy Literature is a free public lecture delivered annually at Pembroke College, Oxford University. The series was founded by Pembroke postgraduate students Will Badger and Gabriel Schenk in memory of J.R.R. Tolkien, who was Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke from 1925 until 1945. The aim of the series is to stimulate more serious study of fantasy literature at Oxford University and beyond. The lecture can be on any subject dealing with fantasy, science fiction, horror, or related speculative genres.  The Pembroke College Middle Common Room announced the series in 2012,  and the first lecture was delivered on 18 January 2013 by fantasy writer Kij Johnson.   The latest lecture was given by Victoria 'V.E.' Schwab in 2018.  Science Fiction critic, writer, and publisher Cheryl Morgan regularly blogs about the lecture series on her website.      Fantasy author Juliet E. McKenna has also written about the series.
