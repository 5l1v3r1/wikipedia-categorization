(Annotation) The whole series of minimalist novels written over the course of 6 years (between 1993–1998) based on the experiment started by the author while studying in Germany, which later continued in Georgia. The cycle of parody texts began with the first novel the 9th Symphony. The prototypes were the author’s friends, Georgians living with him in a small cottage in one of the German villages. While searching for new forms to express his ideas, the author had started an unintentional linguistic experiment – personal feelings and concrete stories connected with friends were developed by mixing them with the author’s favorite literary characters and plots. Notably, these were times when the author practically did not have any information on postmodernist literature.
