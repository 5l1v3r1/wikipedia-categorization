Jennifer Camille Dempsey EdD (born March 3, 1973) is an American cultural theorist, educator, educational technologist and media strategist.  Her major interest is in exploring how the transition from literacy to virtuality is influencing culture and changing human consciousness. She created a theory for virtuality culture through a theoretical expansion of Walter Ong's literacy and orality culture model. Dempsey's work investigates the ubiquitous and multimodal nature of the virtuality cultural phenomenon that is mediated by contemporary technology and not explained by pre-existing cultural conventions. Through examining the theoretical underpinnings of orality and literacy culture, her dissertation explores the cultural shift that is just beginning to restructure human consciousness through the ways that society is connecting, exploring and communicating.  Dempsey has also examined the contrasts between virtuality culture features and those related to traditional literacy and orality types, including the gap between the theory of secondary orality and virtuality culture. She has proposed three ways that contemporary technology creates human presence related to virtuality culture, which are defined in her dissertation. Finally, this dissertation describes the broad implications for the evolution of virtuality culture in areas such as education, technology, literacy, philosophy, politics, linguistics, ethics, history, the arts and cultural studies.  Dempsey was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania. In 1991 she graduated from Tech Memorial High School. In 1995 she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1999 Dempsey earned a Master of Arts degree in Art & Art Education from Teachers College, Columbia University. In 2014 Dempsey earned a Doctorate of Education in Instructional Technology from Duquesne University.
