An analysis of modern society\u201d (Rheinfelden/Berlin: Sch\u00e4uble, 1994). This work integrated topics of social policy, civil society, theory of modernisation and general philosophy. His methodological thinking had been and still is influenced by historical and dialectical materialism, systems theory and the theory of civilisation. Against this background he undertook several studies, especially in the area of European integration.\n</p><p>Based on Herrmann\u2019s experience gained from the work at the Platform of Social NGOs <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.socialplatform.org\">[5]</a> and the European Social Action Network (ESAN), he took an increasingly critical position towards the subtle mechanisms of the process of European integration.\n</p><p>At a very early stage Herrmann discussed and theorised processes he saw as \u201cpolitics bypassing the nation state\u201d (see European Integration between Institution Building and Social Process. Contributions to a Theory of Modernisation and NGOs in the Context of the Development of the EU; New York: Nova Science, 1998 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=6WtMgD-pQSUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=European+Integration+between+Institution+Building+and+Social+Process&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-0FNzbsvEZ&amp;sig=SnRfRB96LiA_jp0y3AN1SkHScXc&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAGoVChMInYqmqOytyAIVyKWICh19SwqU#v=onepage&amp;q=European%20Integration%20between%20Institution%20Building%20and%20Social%20Process&amp;f=false\">[6]</a>) and which became later known under the term \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Multilevel_governance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Multilevel governance\">multilevel governance</a>\u201d.\n</p><p>The close cooperation with the European Foundation on Social Quality and later International Association for Social Quality www.socialquality.eu, namely with Laurent van der Maesen, pushed his analytical interest towards the search for alternatives. His thorough research, geared against political voluntarism and based in a systematic analysis of forms of government and the respective social policy gave important impulses for the debates on social quality thinking.\n</p><p>Research visits in \u2013 amongst others \u2013 Australia (at the Cairns Institute <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.jcu.edu.au/cairnsinstitute/\">[7]</a>), Austria, France, Germany, Hungary (there at the ELTE - E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd university <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.elte.hu/en\">[8]</a>  in connection with <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zsuzsa_Ferge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Zsuzsa Ferge (page does not exist)\">Zsuzsa Ferge</a>), Sweden, Taiwan (on invitation of the Institute of Humanities and Social Science) and Turkey (at ODT\u00dc - Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.metu.edu.tr/\">[9]</a> , supported by T\u00dcB\u0130TAK - T\u00fcrkiye bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma) strengthened his critical attitude towards traditional approaches of social policy. Increasingly important had been his orientation on a critique of political economy.\n</p><p>Beyond the contacts mentioned before, further cooperation is important and three references are crucial.\nTogether with the Austrian political scientist and one of the founders of quantitative world systems research, <a href=\"/wiki/Arno_Tausch\" title=\"Arno Tausch\">Arno Tausch</a>, Herrmann elaborated some publications. This acquainted Herrmann more with <a href=\"/wiki/World-systems_theory\" title=\"World-systems theory\">world-systems theory</a>. It also meant strengthening his orientation on a critique of political economy. With Herrmann\u2019s cooperation with the French Marxist economist <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paul_Boccara&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Paul Boccara (page does not exist)\">Paul Boccara</a> he linked his work closely with the question of the general role of the state. The common work contributed not least to Herrmann\u2019s orientation on the work of the French regulationist approach.\n</p><p>Based on this work he had been able to strengthen the attempts of locating the work on <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_Quality&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Social Quality (page does not exist)\">Social Quality</a> within the framework of world systems theory. Currently his work focuses on establishing a political economic perspective as essential part of the social quality approach. Of special importance is the regulationist theory which is at the same time developed further by being applied within a different framework.\n</p><p>Moreover, Herrmann is correspondent to the Max Planck Institute for Social Policy and Social Law <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.mpisoc.mpg.de/2285/en\">[10]</a> (previously Max-Planck Institute for Foreign and International Social Law) in <a href=\"/wiki/Munich\" title=\"Munich\">Munich</a>, Germany. This allowed him to study more closely the ambiguity of social and human rights law \u2013 issues he discussed in particular in his collaboration with <a href=\"/wiki/Hans_F._Zacher\" title=\"Hans F. Zacher\">Hans F. Zacher</a>. Especially with reference to Zacher he worked on the consideration of the \u201cpre-legal\u201d determination of law, thus allowing nit least an integration with political economy.\n</p><p>His academic work is not least expressed in his engagement as member of the scientific council of the German branch of attac <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150714051300/http://www.attac-netzwerk.de/das-netzwerk/wissenschaftlicher-beirat/startseite/\">[11]</a> and in the EuroMemo Group <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.euromemo.eu\">[12]</a>  \u2013 a network of economists that is looking for alternative policies.\n</p><p>The different connections, Herrmann established over time, based on the wide range of topics, linked him since 2011 also to the work of the Eurasian Center for Big History and System Forecasting at the Moscow State University, in particular collaborating with <a href=\"/wiki/Andrey_Korotayev\" title=\"Andrey Korotayev\">Andrey Korotayev</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Leonid_Grinin\" title=\"Leonid Grinin\">Leonid Grinin</a>, Russia, the All-Russian Centre of Living Standard <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040505045234/http://www.vcug.ru/\">Moscow</a>, and the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://eng.rea.ru\">[13]</a>, Moscow.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_activities\">Current activities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Peter_Herrmann_(social_philosopher)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Current activities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After his move to <a href=\"/wiki/Rome\" title=\"Rome\">Rome</a>, Italy, Herrmann developed independently, but also as member of the scientific council of EURISPES [www.eurispes.eu] (Istituto di Studi Politici, Economici e Sociali), his research. Important contacts for further developments could be established to the University La Sapienza <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://en.uniroma1.it\">[14]</a>, Rome, the university Pontificia Universit\u00e0 San Tommaso d\u2019Aquino \u2013 Angelicum <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.pust.it\">http://www.pust.it</a> of the Vatican www.vatican.va, the Hungarian academy of science <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://mta.hu/english/\">http://mta.hu/english/</a>, namely Ferenc Bodi.

While he sees it in part as challenge around social security and employment law. his main interest aims on clarifying the meaning of ongoing processes for the existing mode of production.\n</p><p>In 2015 he donated his books (as far as they had not been lost during the various moves) to EURIPSES [www.eurispes.ie], hoping that they will be in this way available for the wider public for research.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Peter_Herrmann_(social_philosopher)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://williamthompsonucc.wordpress.com\">[18]</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.reserachgate.net/profile/Peter_Herrmann\">[19]</a><sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\"><span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot\" title=\"Wikipedia:Link rot\"><span title=\"&#160;Dead link since March 2018\">permanent dead link</span></a></i>&#93;</span></sup></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/esosceu/videos\">[20]</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1267\nCached time: 20180910212814\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.060 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.097 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 169/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 1862/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 552/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 11/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\nLua time usage: 0.030/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.13 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   81.382      1 -total\n 65.83%   53.577      1 Template:Dead_link\n 43.28%   35.222      1 Template:Fix\n 38.85%   31.617      2 Template:Category_handler\n 34.07%   27.728      1 Template:Authority_control\n  3.83%    3.116      1 Template:Fix/category\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:48115990-0!canonical and timestamp 20180910212814 and revision id 851561623\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_with_dead_external_links"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","hidden":"","*":"Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_March_2018"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","hidden":"","*":"Articles_with_permanently_dead_external_links"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","*":"Social_philosophers"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","*":"Cultural_academics"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","*":"Futurologists"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","hidden":"","*":"Place_of_birth_missing_(living_people)"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","hidden":"","*":"Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","*":"German_sociologists"},{"sortkey":"Herrmann, Peter","*":"Living_people"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles with dead external links from March 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Andrey Korotayev"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Arno Tausch"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bielefeld"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"China"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cuba"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hamburg"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hans F.
