The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust (1990) has been called "the most recognized reference book on the Holocaust".   It was published in an English-language translated edition by Macmillan in tandem with the Hebrew language original edition published by Yad Vashem (יד ושם), the Holocaust Remembrance Authority in Israel. All its contributors are reputable Holocaust scholars and academics.
