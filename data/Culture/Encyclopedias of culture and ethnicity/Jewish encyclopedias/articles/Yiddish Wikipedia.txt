Yiddish Wikipedia is the Yiddish-language version of Wikipedia. It was founded on March 3, 2004,  and the first article was written November 28 of that year. The Yiddish Wikipedia now has 14,486 articles. There are 31,591 registered users (including bots); 44 are active, including 2 administrators. Like all Wikipedias it generates hits from Yiddish words typed in Google, with Wikipedia articles appearing at the top of the results for that word. In accordance with the norms for the Yiddish language, it is written almost exclusively in Hebrew script, and not in Latin script. The Yiddish Wikipedia reached 6,000 articles on March 8, 2009. The 6,000th article is יהושע העשיל תאומים-פרענקל, a rabbi. The 7,000th article is חנינא סגן הכהנים, a page about the tanna Hanina Segan ha-Kohanim created on December 24, 2009. Combined, the different Hasidic groups form the largest Yiddish-speaking community in the world today. Most new articles are about Hasidic rabbis.
