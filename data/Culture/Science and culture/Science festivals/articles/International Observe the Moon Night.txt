International Observe the Moon Night (InOMN) is an annual public outreach event sponsored by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission and other NASA and astronomical organizations that encourages observation, appreciation, and understanding of our Moon and its connection to planetary science and exploration. Everyone on Earth is invited to join the celebration by hosting or attending an InOMN event â€” and uniting on one day each year to look at and learn about the Moon together.  First organized in 2010, there are usually over 500 events annually in over 40 countries, hosted by universities, observatories, NASA Centers, schools, museums, parks, libraries, and amateur astronomers.    Some events are offered both in person and via internet streaming video. The date is selected to enhance visibility of lunar topography.  The event grew out of two events during the International Year of Astronomy, 2009: "We're at the Moon!", sponsored by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite teams to celebrate the arrival of the LRO and LCROSS at the Moon, and "National Observe the Moon Night" in the US.
