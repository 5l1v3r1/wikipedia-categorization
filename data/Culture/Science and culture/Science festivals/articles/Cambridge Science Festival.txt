The Cambridge Science Festival is a series of events typically held annually in March in Cambridge, England and is the United Kingdom's largest free science festival.  The festival attracts more than 30,000 visitors to over 250 events.  University researches and students open their lecture halls and laboratories to the general public, and hold Talks, Exhibitions and Demonstrations, mostly free of charge.  Started in 1994 by scientists of the University of Cambridge and backed by local businesses, the festival was inspired by National Science Week and is aimed making science and engineering more accessible, showcasing research performed at Cambridge University, and encouraging young people to pursue careers in engineering and science.   The 21st festival ran from 9 to 22 March 2015 and featured themes based on light science and technology to mark UNESCO's International Year of Light.
