Sleek Geek Week is an annual event in which Dr Karl Kruszelnicki (Julius Sumner Miller Fellow at the University of Sydney) and Adam Spencer travel to several destinations around Australia, presenting free talks on the topic of popular science. Sleek Geek is part of National Science Week in Australia. In 2005, the inaugural University of Sydney Sleek Geeks Science Eureka Schools Prize was launched as part of University of Sydney Eureka Science Awards. The competition is sponsored by the Faculty of Science at the University of Sydney, with additional support from Abbeyâ€™s Bookshop, Sydney and Microsoft. The competition encourages secondary school students to tell a scientific story via a short video piece, in a manner that is enjoyable and accessible for the general public. Entries are to take the form of a 1-3 minute video piece and a 250-word description of the video content.
