Brighton Science Festival is a yearly science festival held in Brighton, on the UK's South Coast since at least 2007. The festival is the brainchild of organiser Richard Robinson.   Traditionally the festival has been held in February, but since 2017 the festival has been split across the year, with one set of events held in February and another set in September.
