Mathematical maturity is an informal term used by mathematicians to refer to a mixture of mathematical experience and insight that cannot be directly taught. Instead, it comes from repeated exposure to mathematical concepts. It is a gauge of mathematics student's erudition in mathematical structures and methods. The topic is occasionally also addressed in literature in its own right.  Mathematical maturity has been defined in several different ways by various authors. One definition has been given as follows:  ... fearlessness in the face of symbols: the ability to read and understand notation, to introduce clear and useful notation when appropriate (and not otherwise!), and a general facility of expression in the terse—but crisp and exact—language that mathematicians use to communicate ideas. A broader list of characteristics of mathematical maturity has been given as follows:  Finally, mathematical maturity has also been defined as an ability to do the following:
