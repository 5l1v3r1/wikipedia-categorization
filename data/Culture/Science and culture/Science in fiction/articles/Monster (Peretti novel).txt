Monster is a novel written in 2005 by Frank E. Peretti. It tells a story of a horrifying predator who terrorizes the woods of northern Idaho.  The story deals with views on evolution, beneficial mutation, and natural selection. An unidentified man discovers a dead logger's body killed gruesomely by a deadly carnivore, he proceeds to cover it up by making it look like an accident. Reed Shelton, policeman and his introverted wife Rebecca Shelton are about to begin their vacation (something which Rebecca opposes). Some responses to Monster are:  Cindy Crosby in her review for Christianity Today said that "what's missing here is the genuine keep-you-up-all-night suspense and fast pacing that made Peretti's earlier books, such as This Present Darkness, such page-turners. Peretti relies on passages like these--"Screams! Savage screeches! Howls!"â€”to frighten the reader, rather than creating an atmosphere of terror. The sheer volume of pages, improbable storyline, and prose troubles will disappoint readers of Peretti's earlier books."   John Mort in his review for Booklist said that Peretti was "better off writing about the weight of sin, as he did in The Oath."   Dean Moore in his review for Memphis Reads said that "Monster begins with a weekend camping trip that goes horribly wrong. It escalates in subplots, suspense, and yes, even horror as the very well woven plot evolves. As one might expect with Frank Peretti, it could be called a "gentle" horror tale. However, "gentle" in this case does not mean dull. Peretti brings considerable writing skill to this book. You will find it difficult to put down. ... This book should appeal to Bigfoot fans as well as outdoors enthusiasts. The book is fast paced, exciting and positive. It includes a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end."
