The Everest Science Center Nepal, located in Sitagunj, Sunsari; approximately seven kilometers west of Biratnagar,Nepal, is the only science center in Nepal. The Center was founded in 2001 by Dr. Dilip Adhikari. The Center and its exhibits concentrate upon easily available materials to teach Nepal's rural population. Its annual science fair, known as Bigyan Mela is said to be attended by more than 15,000 people.  In addition to the Center's Botany, Zoology and Agriculture departments, it is home to Nepal's first Planetarium.It is mostly a family owned business that objectively caters the need to young students to think and explore beyond theoretical science education taught in Nepal's lower and higher secondary schools.
