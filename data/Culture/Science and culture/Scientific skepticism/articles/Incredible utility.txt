In United States patent law, incredible utility is a concept according to which, in order for an invention to be patentable, it must have some credible useful function.  If it does not have a credible useful function despite the assertions of the inventor, then the application for patent can be rejected as having "incredible utility".  The invention does not have to work the way the inventor thinks it works, but it must do something useful. Patents that have been held invalid for incredible utility include: A rejection based on incredible utility can be overcome by providing evidence that, "if, considered as a whole, [...] leads a person of ordinary skill in the art to conclude that the asserted utility is more likely than not true".
