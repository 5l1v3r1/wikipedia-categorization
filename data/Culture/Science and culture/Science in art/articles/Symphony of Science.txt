The Symphony of Science is a music project created by Washington-based electronic musician John D. Boswell. The project seeks to "spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes."  Boswell uses  pitch-corrected audio and video samples from television programs featuring popular scientists and educators. The audio and video clips are mixed into digital mashups and scored with Boswell's original compositions. Two of Boswell's music videos, "A Glorious Dawn" and "We are All Connected", feature appearances from Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, and Stephen Hawking. The audio and video is sampled from popular science television shows including Cosmos, The Universe, The Eyes of Nye, The Elegant Universe, and Stephen Hawking's Universe. Unruly Media, a video tracking service, first charted "A Glorious Dawn" on September 21, 2009. A month later, the video had received more than a million views and was ranked in the music category on YouTube as one of the top rated videos of all time.   On November 9, 2009, Third Man Records released a 7-inch single of "A Glorious Dawn" for the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan. Composer John Boswell had been experimenting with sampling and remixing for some time before creating his first YouTube videos. Boswell had worked with Auto-Tune in the past and thought people might be interested in hearing American astronomer Carl Sagan sing.  He first saw Cosmos in 2004 and soon after bought the set of DVDs. Boswell looked through these episodes for "profound quotes" that lacked music in the background.  Once he found these quotes, Boswell Auto-Tuned Sagan's voice and picked from the best ones.  After completing what became "A Glorious Dawn", Boswell posted the video on YouTube in September 2009 and to his surprise, the video went viral within a week.    To date, the video has received nearly ten million views and is ranked as one of the top rated videos of all time in the music category.  John Boswell attended Gonzaga Preparatory School  and graduated from college with a degree in economics. Soon after, Boswell started Colorpulse, an electronica music project, and began to focus on production.  He released an album in 2010, titled Escaping the Tangle, which included some of these productions. Boswell lives in Bellingham, Washington.   His current music project, Symphony of Science, "aims to spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes"  and to "deliver scientific knowledge and philosophy in musical form".  After his first few videos, Boswell began seeking permission to use the clips he uses in his project.  In addition to Symphony of Science, Boswell is also working on a project called Remixes for the Soul, which he works on, in addition to Symphony of Science, under the moniker of melodysheep. Boswell's first video in the Symphony of Science series is 3 minutes, 34 seconds long and features Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking. Samples include clips from Cosmos (1980) and Stephen Hawking's Universe (1997).   On September 21, 2009, Unruly Media, a viral video tracking service, began to chart the popularity of the video.   At the end of the first week of October, the video had received 800,000 views  and, by the end of the month, more than a million. By the end of 2010, the video had surpassed 5 million views. The title takes its name from the chorus spoken by Carl Sagan, remixed from an episode of Cosmos.  Third Man Records released a 7-inch recording of "A Glorious Dawn" on November 9, 2009, in honor of the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan.   The one-sided single was created by United Record Pressing in a unique "Cosmos Colored Vinyl", limited pressing of 150 copies; it was then re-pressed on regular vinyl in a larger run.  The flipside is etched with a copy of the diagram found on the Voyager Golden Record.  Some of the videos used for lyrics are: The second video in the series is 4 minutes, 12 seconds in length and features Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye. It was released on October 19, 2009.

The sixteenth installment, released September 12, 2012, is titled "Our Biggest Challenge (Climate Change Music Video)". It features Bill Nye, David Attenborough, Richard Alley and Isaac Asimov. The song speaks the stark realities of climate change, however the message is that if we can come together, we can overcome this challenge. The refrain is sung mostly by Richard Alley while the last three lines are sung by Isaac Asimov: On February 26, 2013, Boswell released the seventeenth installment, "The Secret of the Stars," which explores the beauty of Einstein's concept of relativity, its applications to time, speed, energy and mass, and its effects on the movement and light of stars. The music video features Michio Kaku, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Greene, Lisa Randall, and Brian Cox. Michio Kaku performs the chorus with Brian Cox, who sings only the first and fourth lines: Note: in actual fact, the process of nuclear fusion in stars turns mass into energy rather than vice versa. This lights up the stars: the stars get lighter and produce energy. On August 27, 2013, Boswell released the eighteenth installment, "Monsters of the Cosmos", which explains the black hole phenomenon and how they are both terrible and beautiful, destroying stars but creating galaxies. The music video features Morgan Freeman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, and  Lawrence Krauss. Morgan Freeman performs the chorus with Lawrence Krauss: An anomaly of gravity so strange. Nothing is more seductive. There are monsters out in the cosmos that can swallow entire stars. That can destroy space itself completely invisible. Anything that strays too close will be pulled in millions and millions of black holes zipping around our galaxy, nothing there to light them up. Millions and millions of black holes zipping around our galaxy, nothing there to light them up.  On July 28, 2015 the nineteenth installment of Symphony of Science, titled "Waves of Light," was released. The video explains the way that we are able to look at the history of the universe through the power of light. The music is sung by Brian Cox. Its chorus is On October 24, 2015, the twentieth installment of Symphony of Science, titled "Beyond the Horizon",  was released. It was created in collaboration with the Planetary Society, and is sung by Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse Tyson,  Emily Lakdawalla, and Carl Sagan.  Not strictly part of the Symphony of Science series as this was made for the BBC science show Bang Goes the Theory, it nevertheless uses the same formula of pitch correction of spoken words over an original music track. It celebrates the tantalising questions that science throws up, as well as being an entertaining showreel for the show itself. In addition to the four presenters - Liz Bonnin, Dallas Campbell, Jem Stansfield, and Yan Wong -  there are guest spots for Jim Al-Khalili and Tara Shears. The clips are all taken from the TV show or its website.  The chorus is sung by Yan Wong: "Symphony of Bang Goes The Theory" on YouTube. While not strictly part of the Symphony of Science series, Boswell uses the same formula of pitch correction of spoken words over an original music track.  Made for the Public Broadcasting Service's PBS Digital Studios, various clips from present and past PBS programming are sampled to make these songs. Sampled from various clips from Fred Rogers' program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, the title takes its name from the chorus spoken by Rogers: "Mister Rogers Remixed: Garden of Your Mind" on YouTube. Sampled from various clips from Bob Ross' program The Joy of Painting, the song contains three choruses spoken by Ross.  The title takes its name from the second of these: "Bob Ross Remixed: Happy Little Clouds" on YouTube. Sampled from various clips from Julia Child's various programs on PBS, including The French Chef, Cooking with Master Chefs: Hosted by Julia Child, and Baking with Julia, the song contains two choruses spoken by Child.  The title takes its name from the second of these: "Julia Child Remixed: Keep On Cooking" on YouTube. Sampled from various clips from LeVar Burton's program Reading Rainbow, the song contains three choruses spoken by Burton.  The title takes its name from the first of these: "Reading Rainbow Remixed: In Your Imagination" on YouTube. Musician Carrie Brownstein found the idea behind Symphony of Science "quite beautiful and amazing in both its sincerity and aims". She also enjoyed the "hip-hop stylings" of the camera angle on Bill Nye while he is moving his hands around and expressing himself on "We Are All Connected".  Writer Nick Sagan, son of Carl Sagan, was impressed with "A Glorious Dawn", giving it a favorable review and stamp of approval. Sagan writes, "John Boswell over at Colorpulse Music is a mad genius, sampling both Cosmos and Stephen Hawking's Universe series into three minutes and thirty-four seconds of pure, concentrated awesomeness... Love it, love it, love it. Dad would have loved it, too."  Columnist Franklin Harris argues that Boswell's videos show that science can arouse the minds of artists just as much as religion and mythology have in the past. Harris calls the videos "art for the Information Age, inspired by science".  New Music Transmission, a podcast who featured Symphony of Science in 2009, gave "A Glorious Dawn" positive reviews and called Symphony of Science as "A thinking man's Pogo", referring to the Australian electro artist who was featured 2 weeks before.
