Lightning has long been used as a dramatic device in popular fiction.  A non-nuclear EMP (NNEMP) device appeared as early as 1965, in the Thunderbirds TV puppet show. By the early 1980s, a number of articles on nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) in the popular press spread knowledge of the EMP phenomenon into the popular culture.    Â  EMP has been subsequently used in a wide variety of fiction and other aspects of popular culture. Motion picture and electronic entertainment quite often depicts electromagnetic pulse effects incorrectly.  This problem has become so bad that it was addressed in a report for Oak Ridge National Laboratory by Metatech Corporation.   In addition, the United States Air Force Space Command commissioned science educator Bill Nye to make a video for the Air Force called "Hollywood vs. EMP" so that people who must deal with real EMP would not be confused by motion picture fiction.  That U.S. Space Command video is not available to the general public.
