The Rieskrater Museum, sometimes known in English as the Ries Crater Museum, focuses on meteors and their collisions with Earth. The museum is housed in a 16th-century barn in Nördlingen, Germany which was part of the medieval city's center.  The area (Nördlinger Ries) is the location of a meteor's impact with Earth c. 15 million years ago and it might have been a double impact (Steinheim crater is nearby).   It has been recognized as such since the early 1960s.  The museum's collection includes a genuine moon rock from Apollo 16 on loan from NASA in return for using the Nördlingen crater for training the Apollo 14 astronauts due to its similarities to a moon crater.    The museum is affiliated with the nearby Geopark Ries (UNESCO - International Network of Geoparks), whose mission is to protect the crater. The museum opened in May 1990 and received its millionth visitor on 15 December 2012.
