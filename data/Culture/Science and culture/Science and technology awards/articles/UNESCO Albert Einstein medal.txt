The UNESCO Albert Einstein Medal is awarded to outstanding scientific personalities who made a great contribution to science and international scientific cooperation. The medal was established by UNESCO to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Albert Einstein in 1979. The medal is awarded in gold, silver and bronze. The medal was designed by the French engraver Max Léognany. The medal's obverse features a portrait of Albert Einstein in his later years. On the reverse, a silhouette of Einstein’s head forms the backdrop for three of the mathematical equations that sum up his essential contributions to physics. First, his most famous equation - E = mc². The second equation represents Einstein's research into the photoelectric effect, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, hν = P + 1/2 mv². The third is related to his work on the general theory of relativity, Rμν + 1/2 gμνR =  κTμν. Below these is an autograph of a scientist. Medal executed in gold, silver and bronze.
