The Higginson Lecture is an annual lecture organised by and held at Durham University.  The series was set up in recognition of Sir Gordon Higginson. Each year a leading engineer is selected to make a presentation, from their own perspective, on a topical issue in engineering. Higginson gave the inaugural lecture himself in 1997. He then attended all of the lectures until 2009, 2 years before his death.
