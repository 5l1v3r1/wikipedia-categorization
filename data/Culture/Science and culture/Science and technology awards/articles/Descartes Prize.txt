The Descartes Prize is an annual award in science given by the European Union, named in honour of the French mathematician and philosopher, Ren√© Descartes. The prizes recognizes Outstanding Scientific and Technological Achievements Resulting from European Collaborative Research. The research prize was first awarded in 2000.  The research prize is awarded to teams of researchers who have "achieved outstanding scientific or technological results through collaborative research in any field of science, including the economic, social science and humanities."  . Submissions may be received by the research teams themselves or by suitable national bodies.  A science communication prize was started in 2004 as part of the Descartes Prize but in 2007 was separated to the Science Communication Prize.  Proposals (also referred to as submissions) received are judged and a shortlist of nominees are announced, from which five Laureates (finalists) and five Winners are announced at a prize ceremony in December each year.  Where a project coordinator was named, only that person was included here and none of the team members who are also "winners" or "laureates".  (Full project members are included on the Descartes Prize website individual award pages.) Where no project "coordinator" was named, the team members are individually named.
