The Pro Scientia Medal was established in 1988 by NSSC, National Scientific Student Council (in Hungarian OTDT, Országos Tudományos Diákköri Tanács), Budapest. Every two years 45-50 young Hungarian artist, researcher and/or scientist gets it, who achieved remarkable results with their scientific work while at university  (primarily at NSSC conferences). The prizes are awarded in 16 sub-sections, therefore the winners are from almost all discipline fields. There is a medal in the artistic and junior (for middle school students) field as well. Currently (as of April 2010) 519 people possess medals. The winners are grouped in the Society of Pro Scientia Medalists (SPSM), in Hungarian as Pro Scientia Aranyérmesek Társasága (PSAT).
