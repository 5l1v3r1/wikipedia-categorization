The Magnus Hirschfeld Medal is awarded by the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research (DGSS) for outstanding service to sexual science, granted in the categories "Sexual Research" and "Sexual Reform". It is named in honour of German sexology pioneer Magnus Hirschfeld (without the DGSS sharing his dated 'biologistic' sexual theory).
