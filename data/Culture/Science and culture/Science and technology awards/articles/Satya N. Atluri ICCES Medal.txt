Satya N. Atluri ICCES Medal is a Medal awarded annually by ICCES (International Conference on Computational & Experimental Engineering and Sciences)  and the Tech Science Press to an individual who has had a significant impact on the world of engineering, the sciences, and commerce, and the well-being of the society at large as a result. This Medal is presented at the Awards Banquet of the annual ICCES Conference.  The recipient of the Medal is invited to deliver a Plenary Lecture, on a topic of her/his choosing, at the ICCES conference. This Medal honors Professor Satya N. Atluri of UCI, who founded ICCES in 1986, and founded the journals, "CMES: Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences" (2000), "CMC: Computers, Materials, & Continua" (2004), "MCB: Molecular & Cellular Biomechanics" (2004), "SL: Structural Longevity" (2008), and "ACM: Advances in Computational Mechanics" (2008), all of which are published by Tech Science Press.  All these journals are in the frontier disciplines of engineering and the sciences, and especially at the interfaces of engineering and the sciences. Previously, Professor Atluri founded, and was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal, "Computational Mechanics", during 1986-2000. The ICCES conferences are held annually: Tokyo (1986); Atlanta (1988); Melbourne, Australia (1991); Hong Kong (1992); Big Island, Hawaii (1995); San Jose, Costa Rica (1997); Atlanta (1998); Los Angeles (2000); Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (2001); Reno, Nevada (2002); Corfu, Greece (2003); Madeira, Portugal (2004); Chennai, India (2005); Miami (2007); Honolulu (2008); Phuket, Thailand (2009), Las Vegas (2010), and Nanjing, China (2011). All these conferences bring together each year, about 500 of the worldâ€™s leading academic, industrial, and government researchers in multidisciplinary engineering, sciences, technologies, and pertinent policies. All aspects of theory, computation, and experimentation are emphasized at these conferences. It is in this spirit that the Satya N. Atluri ICCES Medal honors: 1. Either an individual for her or his multifaceted and exemplary contributions in the broadest sense, and for their impact on society, or 2. An engineering/scientific/technological achievement by a group of individuals, which by its global visibility, benefits the well-being of vast segments of people. The recent recipients of the Satya N. Atluri Medal include: 2011: Dr. Guangjing Cao, President, Three Gorges Dam Groups, China; ICCES 2011 Plenary Lecture.  2010: Dr. Ratan Naval Tata, Chairman, Tata Sons, Mumbai, India  2009: Dr. Subra Suresh, Director, National Science Foundation, formerly from MIT
