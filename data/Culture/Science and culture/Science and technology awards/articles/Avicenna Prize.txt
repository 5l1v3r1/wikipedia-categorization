The Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science is awarded every two years by UNESCO and rewards individuals and groups in the field of ethics in science. The aim of the award is to promote ethical reflection on issues raised by advances in science and technology, and to raise global awareness of the importance of ethics in science. The prize was named after the 11th century Persian physician and philosopher Avicenna (980-1038).  The Prize consists of a gold medal, a certificate, USD$10,000, and a one-week academic visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since it was founded, the award has been given to four individuals.
