The award is given each year to one that has made an outstanding contribution over a period of time to the scientific and technical advancement of the geosciences, particularly geophysics.  The award is made annually by the EAGE Board.  The Conrad Schlumberger Award was created in 1955, as a recognition of Conrad Schlumberger's outstanding contribution to exploration geophysics, by the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (then named The European Association of Exploration Geophysicists.)
