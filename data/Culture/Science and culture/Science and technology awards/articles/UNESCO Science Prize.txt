The UNESCO Science Prize is a biennial scientific prize awarded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to "a person or group of persons for an outstanding contribution they have made to the technological development of a developing member state or region through the application of scientific and technological research (particularly in the fields of education, engineering and industrial development)."  The candidates for the Science Prize are proposed to the Director-General of UNESCO by the governments of member states or by non-governmental organizations. All proposals are judged by a panel of six scientists and engineers. The prize consists of  US$ $15,000, an Albert Einstein Silver Medal, and is awarded in odd years to coincide with UNESCO's General Conference.
