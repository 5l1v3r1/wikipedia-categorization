Eyeball Records was an independent record label based in northern New Jersey, formed in 1995 by Alex Saavedra.  It released albums by artists such as Thursday, My Chemical Romance, and Murder by Death, focusing on indie/alternative rock and punk rock (particularly post-hardcore and pop punk). It had an imprint label named Astro Magnetics, which was owned by Eyeball manager Marc Debiak, Alex Saavedra and Thursday's Geoff Rickly. Eyeball Records shut down in 2012. On April 17, 2007, the music sharing blog Kinixtion was shut down after being sent a letter by Eyeball Records. The webmaster deleted the blog and sent an apologetic letter to the label. Eyeball Records also sent a letter to many peer labels in an effort to curtail copyright infringement of music.  Now That's What I Call Eyeball is occasionally included as a bonus sampler in some re-releases of My Chemical Romance's first studio album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.
