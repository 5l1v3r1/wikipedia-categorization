In Romani culture, a gadjo (feminine: gadji) is a person who has no Romanipen.  This usually corresponds to not being an ethnic Romani, but it can also be an ethnic Romani who does not live within Romani culture.  It is often used by Romanies to address or denote outsider neighbors living within or very near their community.  The exact origin of the word is not known. One theory considers that the word comes from the proto-Romani word for "peasant" and has the same root as the Romani word "gav" (a village).
