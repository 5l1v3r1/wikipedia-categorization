The Valencian linguistic conflict,      also known as Valencian sociolinguist conflict,  refers to the conflict between the use of the Spanish and Valencian language in Valencia.  During the Battle of Valencia (1978â€“1982) the term was used to refer to a controversy about the Valencian language and its relationship with the other dialects of the Catalan language.    This discussion is considered to be secondary when compared to the Valencian language controversy, the institutional diminishment of the Valencian language and the dominance of the Spanish language.   Valencian sociolinguist Rafael Ninyoles i Monllor coined the term linguistic conflict by the end of the 1960s  to refer to certain diglossic situations, such as the Valencian one.  In his late works, he described the process of the ongoing substitution of Valencian by Castilian by social elites and the resulting loss of prestige of the vernacular language.
