The Punjabi Language Movement (PLM) is a linguistic movement in Punjab, Pakistan aimed at reviving the Punjabi language, art, culture and literature in Pakistan.      The Punjabi people constitute the largest ethnic group in Pakistan though Urdu is the national language  and unlike Indian Punjab (where reading/writing Punjabi language is compulsory at every level from 2008  alongside a special Punjabi University at Patiala), Punjabi itself does not have an official status.  The PLM's ideologies are based on Punjabi nationalism.
