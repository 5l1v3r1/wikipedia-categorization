Anti-Finnish sentiment is the hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed against Finns, Finland, or Finnish culture.  During the 1960s and 1970s there was a significant influx of Finnish economic migrants into Sweden. Between 1950 and 1980 the number of Finns in Sweden increased from 45,000 to 250,000. Attitudes towards Finnish immigrants were quite negative is Sweden. Derogatory expressions "en finne igen" ("yet another Finn") "finnjävel" (equiavalent to "Finnish bastard") were commonly used.   An antology Finnjävlar was published, in which 15 Swedish-speaking Finns describe their lives and lives of their parents in Sweden.   The prominent role of Finnish immigrants in the 1907 and 1916 Mesaba Range strikes in Minnesota has led to blacklisting of Finns. It was the time of and-Finnish sentiment in the area, and one could see signs "No Indians or Finns allowed."
