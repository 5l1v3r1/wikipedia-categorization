The following is a list of anti-cultural, anti-national, and anti-ethnic terms, where "anti-cultural" means sentiments of hostility towards a particular culture, "anti-national" refers to sentiments of hostility towards a particular state or other national administrative entity, and "anti-ethnic" refers to ethnic hatred or sentiments of hostility towards an ethnic group.  The use of all of these terms is controversial, as they tend to be used prominently in local rhetorical appeals to fallacyâ€”namely the natural confusion between politically directed opposition and ethnically directed hostility, often deliberately disregarding this distinction for propaganda purposes. These discriminatory attitudes are similar in nature to various religion-based hostile movements, such as Christianophobia and Anti-Catholicism, based on the mixture of xenophobia and ideological/political opposition.  While religion related phobias are formally defined as negative attitudes towards religions, they can also include negative attitudes towards cultures that are associated with specific religions. The suffix -phobia has gained popularity in its non-clinical use to refer to various negative attitudes.
