A halting site (or caravan site) is a facility constructed for the accommodation of Irish Travellers and other nomadic groups. They are common in Ireland, mainly on the periphery of towns, where they are maintained by local authorities, and include spaces to park caravans and vehicles, electricity and sanitary services, and space to graze horses. Halting sites are often controversial due to opposition from local residents and a belief that such settlements harbour anti-social activity such as inter-clan violence, illegal dumping and other crime.
