ISIDORE is an online platform that allows research and access to human and social sciences digital data. ISIDORE was created in 2009 by the CNRS, using its 'Adonis large equipment' facilities, with participation from companies Antidot, Sword and Mondeca. It is now fully integrated to the Huma-Num research infrastructure  ISIDORE harvests metadata and indexes them as digital data by enriching them with scientific terms and references. It is edited as a website, a mobile interface,  modules dedicated to content management through WordPress, a programming interface and a SPARQL node that allows access to RDF. ISIDORE is one of the digital platforms engaged in the sharing of scientific open data. For better accessibility, it is edited in 3 languages: French, English and Spanish It currently contains over 4M items, dispatched in 96 collections from over 3550 sources, making it the largest open digital library in French, English and Spanish for human and social sciences.
