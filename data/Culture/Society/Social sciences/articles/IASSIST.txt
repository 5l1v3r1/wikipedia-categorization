The International Association for Social Science Information Services and Technology (or IASSIST) is an international organisation that provides professional development, communication and conferences for data librarians, archivists, and social science aligned information specialists.   Each year the IASSIST Fellow program sponsors members from developing nations to attend events and professional development to further the advancement of information management.   The first IASSIST conference was held in 1977 in Cocoa Beach, Florida   with 29 representatives from Canada and the United States.
