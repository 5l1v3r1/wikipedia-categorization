The South Australia Proof of age card is an identity photo card available to residents of South Australia over the age of 18. It is available to drivers and non-drivers  primarily as an identity document and to access places restricted to persons over the age of 18. A key convenience of the card is that it can be obtained through an online application if the applicant has a drivers licence.
