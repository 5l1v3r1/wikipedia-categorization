The Science Media Centre of Canada (SMCC) was formally opened on September 27, 2010. It is located in Ottawa. The purpose of the centre is to serve journalists with accurate information on scientific matters. The centre has a Research Advisory Panel of 20 Canadian scientists who will make their expertise available in a simple and understandable manner. In order to secure objectivity, the centre has an Editorial Advisory Committee of eight journalists. The centre is bilingual. The ultimate goal of SMCC is an "increased public engagement with science issues through media coverage of science that is more informed, more accurate and more incisive." Science Media Centres exist in other countries; UK, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The Science Media Centre of Canada is independent with respect to the other centres.
