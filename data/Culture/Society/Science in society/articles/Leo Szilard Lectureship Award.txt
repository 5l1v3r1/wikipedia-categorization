The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award (originally called the Leo Szilard Award)  is given annually by the American Physical Society (APS) for "outstanding accomplishments by physicists in promoting the use of physics for the benefit of society".  It is given internationally in commemoration of physicist Leo Szilard.   "In the year's of Szilard's life and activity it became clearer than ever before how great the responsibility of scientists is to the society.  And, to a large extent, it is due to Szilard that this awareness began to spread in the scientific community." - Andrei Sakharov  It is often awarded to physicists early in their careers who are active in areas such as environmental issues, arms control, or science policy. As of  2015[update] the recipient is given $3,000 plus $2,000 travel expenses and is expected to lecture at an APS meeting and at educational or research laboratories, to promote awareness of their activities.  The award is given yearly and was first presented in 1974.
