Punternet, also known as Punternet.com, is a review site that allows customers to rate their experiences with call girls (customers are referred to as "punters" on the website).    The site offers free membership. Free members can submit reviews and access site features and a limited search function.    The site was sold in August 2017 and the new owners dropped the discussion boards from the site.  They also changed the site's policy to allow male and transgender service providers to advertise and be reviewed (previously this was limited to female escorts only).  The site has been met with criticism, most notably in 2009 from Harriet Harman.  Harman, who was the Minister for Women and Equality at the time, asked then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to ban the website, as it was based in California.  The web owners thanked Harriet for increasing web traffic to their site.
