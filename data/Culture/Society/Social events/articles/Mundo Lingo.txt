Mundo Lingo are free language social events that happen independently in various metropolises in different countries.  They usually take place in the late evening during the week (7pm to midnight) in a specific bar. They gather many men and women of all ages and all nationalities that wish to learn or improve one or more languages.  Each participant receive flags to stick to his clothes.  They are supposed to indicate their native language at the top, and the rest below (generally the languages they mastered and below the one they wants to learn). Then, people are free to chat with each other while having drinks.  The first Mundo Lingo event was an initiative of UK born Benji Moreira when he was an immigrant in Buenos Aires (Argentina). It took place on July 7, 2011 and was aimed for local Argentines to learn foreign languages and for internationals to practice Spanish. After a while, around 50 people per week were attending and the flag system was introduced. In 2014 the event grew increasingly popular and was exported to Cologne, London, Montreal, and then Melbourne.
