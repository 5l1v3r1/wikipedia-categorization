Mutual combat occurs when two individuals intentionally and consensually engage in a fair  fight,  while not hurting bystanders or damaging property.  In some cases, mutual combat may nevertheless result in killings.  In 2012, MMA fighter Phoenix Jones hit the headlines for engaging in mutual combat.  A video of the fight went viral.  The Seattle Police Department later defended their officers for not intervening.  The same year, Gabriel Aubry and Olivier Martinez engaged in mutual combat and were not charged.  In 2014, after Zac Efron had engaged in a fight in Skid Row, law enforcement officials did not make any arrests because they viewed it as mutual combat.  Mutual combat has been used to deny damage claims,  as a legal defense,  and to drop charges against fighting students.
