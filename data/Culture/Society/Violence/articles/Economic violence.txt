Economic violence is a type of violence committed by individuals or groups preying on economically disadvantaged individuals. In some circumstances the individuals may be service workers such as undocumented workers and food service workers,    in others they may be spouses,  or closeted gays.  The World Health Organization defines it as being a form of collective violence, committed by larger groups towards individuals.  The term is frequently associated with, or credited to, feminist theory, who term it as a broader form of violence beyond use or threats of physical force, to include sexual, psychological and economic violence.  In Argentinian law, it is defined as a form of domestic violence.
