The creation and maintenance of these boundaries should not be exclusionary.  Politicians, economists and ecologist must work with citizens across cultural, organizational, institutional, political and geographic boundaries.  However, which citizens should be involved, and to what extent and in what manner they should participate are questions that need to be addressed.\n</p><p>Knowledge bases, roles of experts, and state and local power dynamics are changing in ways that impel us to learn new ways of coexisting.
