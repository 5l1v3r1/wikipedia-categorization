Media Lab Asia (MLAsia) was founded in 2001 as a not-for-profit research entity as a result of cooperation between the MIT Media Lab and the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of the Government of India. The objectives of MLAsia are to bring the benefits of Information and communications technology (ICT) to the people in Asia and around the world. Media Lab Asia started with the projects such as World Computer (affordable computing and access devices), Bits for All (low cost, high bandwidth connectivity) and Tomorrow's Tool (rurally relevant applications). It later switched to application development, including ICT for Healthcare, Education, Livelihood and Empowerment of Disabled. Since then, MLAsia has taken up 75 development projects. After development, the new technology is taken from the lab to pilot testing, and then for large scale deployment through a scheme of provider/user membership. MLAsia utilizes a way of growth by working with a network of  research academic and private organizations for undertaking development work. It serves as a research hub for the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The other partners are a combination of academic and industry R&D institutions, NGOs and governmental agencies. The projects are sponsored by corporate bodies, non-profits and the government. The list of project partners has grown to more than 58.
