Funzing is an online sharing economy marketplace that facilitates people to host and attend events and experiences in their leisure time based on their hobbies, passions or skills. Funzing was founded in Israel in 2014 by Avigur Zmora, the former CEO of Playtech.  Funzing is currently active in London, Manchester, Tel Aviv and Singapore.  The online community marketplace promotes diversity in people’s free time activities, experiences vary from supper clubs, tours, workshops to one-off lectures and classes.     According to co-founder Yaron Saghiv, the idea about the online sharing economy came out of several friends’ frustration at being bored by going to the same places every time they wanted to spend quality free time in a social setting. Thus, they devised the platform which allows anyone with creative potential to showcase their skills to the world while entertaining others and earning some money along the way.     Funzing was founded in Israel in 2014. It was the brainchild of Avigur Zmora, former CEO of Playtech, who went on to set up the company together with Eran Alon, Noa Moscati and Yaron Saghiv. The initial investment capital to start Funzing was raised from venture capital firm Inimiti and amounted to $1.5 million.  Currently, there are over 2,000 registered hosts on the Funzing system, and more than 35,000 individuals have attended events as of June 2016.
