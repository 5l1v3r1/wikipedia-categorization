Wordia is an online visual dictionary which has the published aim of 'redefining the dictionary'. It asks members of the public and celebrity 'orators' to upload videos explaining what words mean to them. The videos are then published on the site alongside the traditional textual definition sourced from the Collins English Dictionary.  The site was founded in 2008 by TV producer Ed Baker, backed by the online entrepreneur Michael Birch  and launched at the house of Doctor Johnson, the man behind the first modern dictionary.  Its founders and others have extolled the benefits of having different dictionaries for different audiences.    Some parties in the UK have argued Wordia's democratic approach will undermine the quality of the definitions.
