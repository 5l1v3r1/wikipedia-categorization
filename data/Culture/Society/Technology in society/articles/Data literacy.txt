Data literacy is the ability to read, understand, create and communicate data as information. Much like literacy as a general concept, data literacy focuses on the competencies involved in working with data.  As data collection and sharing become routine and data analysis and big data become common ideas in the news, business,  government   and society , it becomes more and more important for students, citizens, and readers to have some data literacy.  Data literacy focuses on the ability to understand and build knowledge from data, and to communicate that meaning to others. It is related to other fields, including: As guides for finding and using information, librarians lead workshops on data literacy for students and researchers, and also work on developing their own data literacy skills.   Resources created by librarians include MIT's Data Management and Publishing tutorial, the EDINA Research Data Management Training (MANTRA), the University of Edinburgh’s Data Library and the University of Minnesota libraries’ Data Management Course for Structural Engineers.
