Technological rationality or technical rationality is a philosophical idea postulated by the  Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse in his 1941 article, "Some Implications of Modern Technology", published first in the journal Studies in Philosophy and Social Sciences, Vol. IX. It gained mainstream repute and a more holistic treatment in his 1964 book One-Dimensional Man.  It posits that rational decisions to incorporate technological advances into society can, once the technology is ubiquitous, change what is considered rational within that society.
