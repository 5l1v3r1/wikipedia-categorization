The Longo Maï Co-operatives are a network of agricultural co-operatives with an anti-capitalist ideological focus. Founded in 1973 in Limans the network has spread in Europe and to Central America. Following the events of May 68 groups of students from Austria and Switzerland who held anarchist ideologies collaborated to raise funds to allow them to buy land upon which to start to farm collectively.  In 1973 they purchased 270 hectares of land at Limans near Forcalquier. The communities ideological leader was Roland Perrot, a military deserter from the war in Algeria. Perrot knew Jean Giono and had experienced the free commune in Contadour in the 1930s.  The ideological focus of the community is anti-militarist and pacifist, anti-capitalist and egalitarian.  Activities focus upon self-sufficiency, community life, craft and agricultural production, the joint management of energy, water and respect for the environment. Longo Maï has been involved with various international solidarity efforts with a particular focus on resistance against dictatorships. The ten Longo Mai co-operatives operate in a network: The head office of the cooperative is in Basel, from which are organised campaigns to collect donations (about five million francs a year in the 1990s). The cooperative also has media operations
