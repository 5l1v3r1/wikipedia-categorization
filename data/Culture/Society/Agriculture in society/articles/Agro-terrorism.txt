Agroterrorism, also known as agriterrorism, is a malicious attempt to disrupt or destroy the agricultural industry and/or food supply system of a population through "the malicious use of plant or animal pathogens to cause devastating disease in the agricultural sectors".  It is closely related to the concepts of biological warfare and entomological warfare, except carried out by non-state parties. A hostile attack, towards an agricultural environment, including infrastructures and processes, in order to significantly damage national and international political interests. Clemson University's Regulatory and Public Service Program listed "diseases vectored by insects" among bioterrorism scenarios considered "most likely".   Because invasive species are already a problem worldwide one University of Nebraska entomologist considered it likely that the source of any sudden appearance of a new agricultural pest would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine.  Lockwood considers insects a more effective means of transmitting biological agents for acts of bioterrorism than the actual agents.  Insect vectors are easily gathered and their eggs easily transportable without detection.  Isolating and delivering biological agents, on the other hand, is extremely challenging and hazardous.
