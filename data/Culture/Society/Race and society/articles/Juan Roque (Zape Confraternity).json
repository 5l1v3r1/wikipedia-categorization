As the Spanish and Portuguese control in colonial Latin America spread, Africans were stereotyped as slaves. However, there were exceptions.  Africans and <a href=\"/wiki/Mulattos\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mulattos\">mulattos</a> played active roles in the early 16th century, acting as <a href=\"/wiki/Conquistadors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conquistadors\">conquistadors</a>.  Juan Garrido, Juan Garc\u00eda, and Juan Valiente were all successful conquistadors, who became part of the Spanish communities as the conquest was completed.\n</p><p>By the 17th century, Africans lived in colonial Latin America, with distinctive organizations and communities that blended African culture with the laws and social expectations of the Spaniards.  In New Spain, Africans, who originated from modern day coastal <a href=\"/wiki/Sierra_Leone\" title=\"Sierra Leone\">Sierra Leone</a>, founded a brotherhood in Mexico City,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\nwhich became the <i>Zape</i> Confraternity. Documents describe how Africans rose from slavery to become influential members of the community.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_wealth_and_status_of_Juan_Roque\">The wealth and status of Juan Roque</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Juan_Roque_(Zape_Confraternity)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The wealth and status of Juan Roque\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brought to New Spain as a slave before 1600, Juan Roque left a comprehensive will and testament at his death. It reveals the importance of 'confraternities' to the African community in Mexico City, as well as the prominence some Africans were able to achieve. \n</p><p>Written before his death in 1623, this last will and testament provided for a lavish and expensive funeral and lists profitable real estate that helped ensure the survival of the <i>Zape</i> Confraternity in Mexico City for several decades after his death.  Both expensive and Catholic, Juan Roque\u2019s funeral provides evidence that Africans could establish themselves within communities in colonial Latin America.  He requested that he be buried either in the church of the Hospital of <a href=\"/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Immaculate_Conception\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Our Lady of Immaculate Conception\">Our Lady of Immaculate Conception</a> or the Sant\u00edsma Veracruz Church of which he was a parishioner.  \n</p><p>In addition, Juan Roque asked that the brotherhoods to which he belonged, like the <i>Zape</i> Confraternity, accompany his body to the burial and that fifty-five Masses be sung for his soul at different churches around Mexico City, as well as twenty Masses sung for his deceased wife, Isabel de Herrera.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McKnight87_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McKnight87-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>   \n</p><p>In her essay analyzing confraternities in New Spain, Nicole von Germeten points out that as a prominent and wealthy African in Mexico City, Juan Roque's lavish funeral \u201cwith all the trappings of baroque religiosity\u201d and membership in a confraternity like that of the Zape nation demonstrates the respectability of men of African descent in colonial Latin America.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  \n</p><p>He stated that his deceased wife was a free black woman, and when bequeathing his profitable real estate in the neighborhood of San Hip\u00f3lito, Juan Roque pointed to the status of his daughter, Ana Mar\u00eda, as a legitimate daughter from his marriage \u201caccording to the Most Holy Church\u201d to Isabel de Herrera and therefore a free black woman.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McKnight89_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McKnight89-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Designating  these Africans as free, gave them status within the community and helped the <i>Zape</i> Confraternity, as it made its case to regain the income from houses around San Hip\u00f3lito, following Ana Mar\u00eda dying childless.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Confraternities\">Confraternities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Juan_Roque_(Zape_Confraternity)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Confraternities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Before her death, Ana Mar\u00eda spoke to members of the <i>Zape</i> Confraternity confirming that her father had wished the brotherhood to receive the income from the real estate in San Hip\u00f3lito.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McKnight87_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McKnight87-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In colonial Latin America, confraternities were organizations that allowed Africans to achieve a sense of community after being taken from their homeland through the slave trade. These brotherhoods also facilitated the Africans\u2019 conversion to Catholicism: by providing a place of worship, a Christian community, and financial support for members' funerals.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>   The confraternities provided social welfare for Africans in New Spain and limited health care, when Africans were denied access to other assistance.\n</p><p>The importance of the confraternity\u2019s ability to aid its members monetarily, is clearly evident In the court documents detailing the Zape Confraternity\u2019s battle to receive the income of Juan Roque\u2019s houses in San Hip\u00f3lito. Juan Roque\u2019s exact description of the location of the houses, in his last will and testament, attempted to ensure that his daughter. and eventually the confraternity, received the benefits of the properties.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ana_Maria\">Ana Maria</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Juan_Roque_(Zape_Confraternity)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Ana Maria\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Several witnesses said that Ana Mar\u00eda was adamant that her father wished the houses to go to the brotherhood, should she die without children.  Even when one of the elder members of the confraternity urged her to agree with her husband and sell the houses, Ana Mar\u00eda refused, because her father \u201ccharged her that if she did not have children she should not dispose of the houses, but give them the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception (the <i>Zape</i> Confraternity), of which he was a member and founder, so that the blacks of the Zape nation would administer them and take care of their earnings.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span
