Die schwarze Schande or Die schwarze Schmach ("the Black Shame" or "the Black Disgrace") were terms used by the German right-wing press to agitate for opposition to the use of African troops in the occupation of the Rhineland following the defeat of the German Empire in the First World War. The campaign reached its peak between 1920 and 1923, but did not stop until 1930. Along with phrases like  "the black scourge" and "black horror", these terms were used by campaigners in different countries beyond Germany, such as the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. E. D. Morel was one of the major promoters of the Black Shame in the United kingdom.
