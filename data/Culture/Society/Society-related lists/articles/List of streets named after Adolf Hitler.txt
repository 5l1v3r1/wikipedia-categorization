This is a partial list of streets and squares named after Adolf Hitler during the era of Nazi Germany. The zeal with which German municipal authorities attempted,  immediately after the seizure of power, to play their part in the "National Rising" (German: Nationale Erhebung) is shown by the practice of conferring honorary municipal citizenship on Hitler, and even more by naming a street (Straße), a square or place (Platz), a promenade (Anlage), an avenue (Damm, Allee), a stadium (Kampfbahn), or a bridge (Brücke) after the new chancellor.  As early as March and April 1933, a wave of renamings swept through Germany's cities.  Most of the examples in the list come from this period. Before 1931, there are records of a street named Rua Adolpho Hitler in the Campo Belo district of Santo Amaro, Brazil. Its name was changed in 1931 to Rua Almirante Barroso, but when Santo Amaro was merged into São Paulo on the next year, the street was again renamed to Rua Gil Eanes, due to a homonym street in Brás. The street still retains Gil Eanes’s name.
