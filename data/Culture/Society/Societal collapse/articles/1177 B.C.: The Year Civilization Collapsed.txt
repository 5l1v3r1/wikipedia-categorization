1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed is a nonfiction ancient history book written by Eric H. Cline and published in 2014 by Princeton University Press. The book focuses on his hypothesis for the Late Bronze Age collapse of civilization,  a transition period that affected the Egyptians, Hittites, Canaanites, Cypriots, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Assyrians and Babylonians; varied heterogeneous cultures populating eight powerful and flourishing states intermingling via trade, commerce, exchange and "cultural piggybacking", despite "all the difficulties of travel and time".  He presents evidence to support a "perfect storm" of "multiple interconnected failures", meaning that more than one natural and man-made cataclysm caused the disintegration and demise of an ancient civilization that incorporated "empires and globalized peoples".   This ended the Bronze Age, and ended the Mycenaean, Minoan, Trojan, Hittite, and Babylonian cultures.  Before this book, the leading hypothesis during previous decades attributed the civilization collapse mostly to Sea Peoples of unknown origin.     This book has won the following awards:
