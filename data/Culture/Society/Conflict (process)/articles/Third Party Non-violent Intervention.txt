Third Party Non-violent Intervention (sometimes called TPNI) refers to the practice of intervening from the outside in violent conflicts with the aim of reducing violence and allowing "space" for conflict resolution. Two common forms of intervention are as an intermediary in a negotiating capacity or, physically, by interposing one's body between two factions. TPNI work is sometimes categorized into four main areas: Examples of groups that espouse this practice are Christian Peacemaker Teams, International Solidarity Movement, Muslim Peacemaker Teams, Meta Peace Team,  Peace Brigades International and Nonviolent Peaceforce.
