Societal marketing is a philosophy or mindset that informs marketing decisions whereas social marketing is a distinct branch within the marketing discipline. Societal marketing is concerned with the consideration of the social and ethical aspects of marketing planning. Social marketing is concerned with facilitating social change. A key difference is that the greater 'social good' is the <i>principal</i> consideration in social marketing while social benefits are one of a number of considerations in societal marketing.  \n</p><p>On the other hand, social marketing is a sub-branch of marketing that began in 1971, with the publication of an article by Kotler and Zaltman, emphasising a planned approach to achieving social change. It is primarily concerned with encouraging pro-social behaviours (e.g. recycling, sun-safety, safe driving practices) and discouraging anti-social behaviours (e.g. littering, drink-driving). <sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> It is defined as an \"adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on persuasion, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its <a href=\"/wiki/Advertising_campaign\" title=\"Advertising campaign\">campaigns</a> can either encourage <a href=\"/wiki/Merit_good\" title=\"Merit good\">merit goods</a>, as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Demerit_good\" title=\"Demerit good\">demerit goods</a> promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social marketing is that is planned to influence individual behaviour to improve well-being. It includes more than just <a href=\"/wiki/Advertising\" title=\"Advertising\">advertising</a> in traditional mass media, and may extend to educational programs and formal enforcement regimes in the case of road safety campaigns.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> It planned campaigns, implemented by governmental and non-governmental organisations. A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.\n</p><p>The societal marketing concept was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial <a href=\"/wiki/Marketing_strategies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marketing strategies\">marketing strategies</a>. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to influence social change. Social marketing applies a \"customer orientated\" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like Anti-Smoking-Campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Corporate_social_responsibility_.28CSR.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Corporate_social_responsibility_(CSR)\">Corporate social responsibility (CSR)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Societal_marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Unlike societal marketing, CSR has existed for many years.

CSR social and environmental concerns are integrated into all business operations. CSR is mainly run by companies, while social marketing mainly by Government or Non profits organizations. One example of CSR among companies is what <a href=\"/wiki/H%C3%A4agen-Dazs\" title=\"H\u00e4agen-Dazs\">H\u00e4agen-Dazs</a> is doing with their \"microsite\" to raise awareness to the general public about the preservation of the honeybee.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Branding\">Branding</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Societal_marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Branding\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Corporations are the one who are striving during the whole time for improvements. They are turning to all kind of forms of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corporate_societal_marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Corporate societal marketing (page does not exist)\">corporate societal marketing</a> programs to help build and repair their brand images.\n</p><p>Corporate Social Marketing, or CSM, usually refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social related objective, such as charity founding, among its goals. Typical examples are releasing a certain percentage of the final sale product to a charity related to the product, or sponsoring events that encourage social well-being such as the Olympic Games. Corporate Social Marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goal is to improve the image the public has of the company. A company that appears committed to improving the lives or others, the environment or other worthy causes is seen in a better light than one who doesn't, and more and more business are hoping to benefit from that.\n</p><p>So, it can be so, that CSM programs are becoming extremely popular because the leaders believe that it is a good business to be viewed as a socially responsible company.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> However, even though past research suggests that CSM may be effective in improving <a href=\"/wiki/Brand_equity\" title=\"Brand equity\">brand equity</a> and increasing market share, there are limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives.\n</p><p>An example of his is how corporate social initiatives adversely affected purchase intentions if consumers perceived that the company would forgo product quality in order to be socially responsible.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Depending on the nature of the CSM program, the intent of the corporation may not be as obvious to the consumers. This happens if the benefits to the corporation are not apparent or conflicts with what the consumer already believes about a specific firm or industry.\n</p><p>Since firms exist to make a profit, consumers may spend considerable energy in an attempt to infer motives related to the profit-oriented goals. As an example, a consumer may be suspicious of a tobacco company that undertakes a campaign to prevent underage smoking. If this is successful, the company would be affected and the cigarette sales will be lowered. So, in this situation, consumers' suspicions may lead them to infer motives that would actually protect the companies financial condition \u2013 as they are trying to improve their image to sell more cigarettes to adults. However, if a tobacco company undertook a CSM Campaign, that would sustain their business consumers may be able to infer profit motives more easily and then have a more favorable attitude toward the partnership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the attitude of the consumers could be better if they knew more about the motives of the companies and they were more obvious.\n</p><p>Another aspect that may cause suspicion with consumers is the amount of harm that a company has already done, either because of unsafe products or harmful production practices. It is logical that consumers are more suspicious to companies that sell harmful products. Again examples are the tobacco companies and alcohol companies as well. They will meet resistance from consumers when they undertake socially-oriented campaigns aimed at mitigating the effects of their products.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> That is why when different industries are separated, two very general dimensions are used \u2013 the harmful nature of the products and the harmful nature of the production methods.\n</p><p>This classification can briefly show how consumer are influenced by the various CSM efforts. Companies that work in this \"dangerous\" industries are not that successful always, because the consumers may be suspicious of any societal efforts the company attempts to undertake. Consumers will infer less society-serving motives and more self-serving motives for corporate societal marketing programs undertaken by firms that operate in mixed or sin industries.\n</p><p>Based on how easily consumers could infer profit-driven motives, are classified the types of CSM campaigns: Positively tied to product sales, positively tied to product sales, not directly tied to sales but aimed at sustaining the company's business, completely unrelated.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticisms\">Criticisms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Societal_marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Criticisms\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Societal marketing has been the subject of a number of criticisms: \n</p><p>A key issue concerns the question of who decides what is in the public\u2019s best interests. The moral agenda implicit in the societal marketing concept is underdeveloped and often implicit. <sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Gaski argued that marketers should step away from their classic goal of <a href=\"/wiki/Customer_satisfaction\" title=\"Customer satisfaction\">customer satisfaction</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Profit_maximization\" title=\"Profit maximization\">profit maximization</a> while respecting the minimum governmental standards imposed by law and enter this <a href=\"/wiki/Public_policy\" title=\"Public policy\">public policy</a> area, since marketers themselves would have to decide what actions are consistent with public welfare. Marketers might have neither the competence nor the right to determine the \"public interest.\" Instead, it should be the customers who decide what is good for them, or their political representatives and dictate that to the industry. <sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some scholars have argued that societal marketing is not a distinct concept, but rather it is a mere extension of the marketing concept. Others have pointed out that the literature in the field is vague, poorly defined and underdeveloped. <sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> The societal marketing concept has become an excellent strategy for promotions with social dimensions and for exploring consumers' behavioural response to such corporate 'doing good'.\n</p>\n<dl><dt>Future development of the concept</dt>\n<dd></dd></dl>\n<p>Societal marketing is gaining the marketers and consumer attention  and there is every reason to expect it to continue to evolve in practice. It focuses on providing win-win opportunities to companies, consumers and society. But achieving the compelling benefits for each party involved is very complicated. So much more research is needed. To achieve a win situation for organization involved, is dependent largely upon how the key constituents react. In this context, anticipating consumer reaction is really challenging which can be affected by number of factors that often vary across different segments. The several research questions remain to be answered like how different factors affects reaction to societal marketing and how do the various factors interact? How can societal initiatives be designed to leverage positive reaction and mitigate negative ones? <sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For consumers to win, societal marketing must provide them with compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?\nDetermining whether there is a win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995):  Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? \nSocietal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, product image and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Societal_marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Sustainability_marketing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sustainability marketing\">Sustainability marketing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Social_marketing\" title=\"Social marketing\">Social marketing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Green_marketing\" title=\"Green marketing\">Green marketing</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Societal_marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> Handelman, Jay M. and Arnold, Stephen J., \"The Role of Marketing Actions with a Social Dimension: Appeals to the Institutional Environment,\" <i>Journal of Marketing,</i> Vol. 63, No. 3, July, 1999, pp 33-48</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Elliot, G.R., \"The Marketing Concept: Necessary but sufficient?
