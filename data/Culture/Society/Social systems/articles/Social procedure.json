It has been described as <a href=\"/wiki/Social_software_(social_procedure)\" title=\"Social software (social procedure)\">social software</a> and indeed does resemble software. \n</p><p>Social procedures include as a subset procedures which are at the foundation of our society, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Procedural_law\" title=\"Procedural law\">procedural law</a>.  Similarly many social procedures are explicitly designed to ensure fair treatment to individuals or corporations, as official records of parliamentary debates show. \n</p><p>Multiple social procedures can serve to achieve the same end. Justice, as an example, in the U.S. achieved through the use of 2 adversarial lawyers, a neutral judge, and a jury of peers. In Canada, the judge is less neutral. This subtle difference in programming has an effect on the justice outcome.\n</p><p>Though game theory is a highly technical subject with no special attention to sports, an example of a social procedure designed to help make a sporting system more fair is the <a href=\"/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Draft\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Major League Baseball Draft\">Major League Baseball Draft</a> whereby the teams which performed the worst in the last season get the first choice of players for the new season.\n</p><p>There is a project called A Formal Analysis of Social Procedures underway at the Tilburg Center for Logic and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) under the direction of E.
