The Center for the Study of Religion and Society (CSRS) is a research center at the University of Notre Dame in the United States that is dedicated to advancing social scientific understanding of religion in society through scholarly research, training and publications. The Center brings a variety of faculty, students and other researchers together into a community of scholars engaged in empirical investigations, intellectual interchange and teaching crucial for advancing the sociological study of religion.  Activities facilitated by CSRS include major data collection projects, seminars, colloquia, lectures, conferences, grant writing and the building of an infrastructure for survey, interviews-based, and participant-observation social research. The Center combines an emphasis on the insight and richness of cultural analysis with the strength of large-scale survey research.
