Multiconfessionalism is a term applied to countries which have a power sharing arrangement between people of different faiths, usually three or more significant confessional groups within the same jurisdiction. Examples of modern countries deemed multiconfessional are Lebanon   and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The "National Pact" is a formal agreement altering the 1926 Consitution, which laid the foundation of Lebanon as a confessionalist state. Instead of the minority wielding the most power, political power became more representative.
