These technologies are generally software based and are built more like a business application than a traditional PBX business <a href=\"/wiki/Communications_system\" title=\"Communications system\">communications system</a>. Service-oriented communications systems allow their services to participate in <a href=\"/wiki/Business_process\" title=\"Business process\">business processes</a>. They make their services available to other business applications within and SOA and allow for reuse of the services.\nThe goal of service-oriented communications is to enable business environments to build communications into their business processes, enabling more streamlined collaboration among people within the business. It typically assumes that certain services are provided in the context of an SOA service provider. This is often in the form of a suite of <a href=\"/wiki/Web_service\" title=\"Web service\">web services</a>, but may also be attached to other means of sharing the services such as an enterprise system bus (ESB).\n</p><p>The communications part of SOC\nEnterprise communications have traditionally been provided by closed, stand-alone PBX systems. Installed in a separate phone room or wiring closet, operated over a different wiring infrastructure, known only by the telecom manager, these systems ran independently from every other aspect of the business.\n</p><p>Today\u2019s business-savvy <a href=\"/wiki/Chief_information_officer\" title=\"Chief information officer\">chief information officers</a> (CIOs) are exploring ways in which <a href=\"/wiki/Information_technology\" title=\"Information technology\">information technology</a> can be better leveraged to improve the efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. In practice, CIOs are embracing the concepts of <a href=\"/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture\" title=\"Service-oriented architecture\">service-oriented architectures</a> and rethinking how the different business systems in use within the enterprise can be designed to allow each system to leverage the benefits of any other system.\nThe maturing of web service technology has provided a real framework for allowing one system to leverage the services of another according to the principles of a service-oriented architecture. Complex business systems can now work together to deliver solutions in highly customized ways to end users. Increasingly, applications are adapting to the specific needs of users rather than users being forced to adapt to the available functionality of applications.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Web_service_technology\">Web service technology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Service-oriented_communications&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Web service technology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As the Internet grew from a forum for sharing information to a marketplace for doing business, a technology matured that allowed computers to transact with each other more easily. Out of these Internet roots, web service technology was born.\n</p><p>The general goal of web services is to construct elements of <a href=\"/wiki/Business_logic\" title=\"Business logic\">business logic</a>, services, which can be very easily used by other applications. The services themselves hide the complexity of their business logic from the consumers through simple interfaces that allow the services to be reused in many different applications. The service and the consumer are described as being <a href=\"/wiki/Loose_coupling\" title=\"Loose coupling\">loosely coupled</a>, an approach that allows complex composite solutions to be developed through leveraging multiple web services.\n</p><p>There are a number of key elements to web service technology\u2026\n</p>\n<ul><li>XML (<a href=\"/wiki/Extensible_Markup_Language\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Extensible Markup Language\">eXtensible Markup Language</a>) is the core language of web service technology. It provides a platform neutral way to describe the data associated with any service transaction.</li>\n<li>SOAP (<a href=\"/wiki/SOAP\" title=\"SOAP\">Simple Object Access Protocol</a>) is the preferred means by which an application invokes a web service. The protocol itself is written in XML.</li>\n<li>WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) is the specification of the interface that a web service exposes to consumers. It describes the set of operations that the service makes available. The WSDL is also written in XML.</li></ul>\n<p>Advantages of web services\n</p>\n<ul><li>Loosely coupled\u2014the high degree of abstraction that exists between the implementation and the consumption of the service frees the web service client and the web service provider from needing any knowledge of each other beyond inputs and outputs</li>\n<li>Platform neutral\u2014web services can be provided by or invoked on most, if not all, platforms today, even legacy platforms</li>\n<li>Development language neutral\u2014people are developing web services using C/C++, C#, Java, <a href=\"/wiki/Visual_Basic\" title=\"Visual Basic\">Visual Basic</a>, Python and others</li>\n<li>Standards are architecture neutral\u2014these do not enforce <a href=\"/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Client\u2013server\">client\u2013server</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peer-to-peer\" title=\"Peer-to-peer\">peer-to-peer</a> or any other model, although practical implementation issues currently drive developers to client\u2013server</li>\n<li>Web services leverage existing standards\u2014standards that are already in place for conventional <a href=\"/wiki/Web_server\" title=\"Web server\">web server</a> applications, including HTTP, secure sockets and authentication</li>\n<li>Relatively lightweight\u2014so they can be easily deployed to small devices for example PDAs and <a href=\"/wiki/Smartphone\" title=\"Smartphone\">SmartPhones</a>.</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2174\nCached time: 20180912171926\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic
