Coyle (2008), in his article- Theory of Development Communication, articulates that where people have options to change their ways of life, communication becomes important in informing, persuading, listening, data gathering, educating, training and managing change.  Communication then becomes an instrument in facilitating changes in people in order for them to realize their full potentials. Through it, people would improve their ways of thinking, their ways of acting and their ways of living resulting in a higher quality of life. In agreement, McKee (1992) explicated that the central objective of policy sciences is helping people make better decisions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_67-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-67\">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Similarly, policy sciences are purposive as these are anchored on the fulfillment of the aim of improving policy making to provide, as highlighted by Flor (1991), as much \"lead time\" as necessary in the solution of societal problems.  Policy analysts or policy scientists have to be driven in their pursuit of effectively designing, formulating, analyzing, evaluating policies and most importantly of studying the policy making process in order to create a substantive impact on policymakers. Through communication, they would be able to exert a great influence in the decision making process of the policy makers who are responsible in making policies that would become the guiding principles in resolving concerns, dilemmas or issues with the end in view of effecting societal changes.\n</p><p>Communication is therefore central to development communication and policy sciences.  As Allen (1978), cited by Flor (1991), states:\n</p><p>\"Since communication permeates every facet of a person's behavior, the study of communication is no less than one way to study policy making. Communication is a useful concept, precisely because it is one more handle whereby we can effectively study policy making. Communication is one of those few variables through which any policy decision is dependent.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-69\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-69\">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> Awa (1989) adds that communication sparks participation. Apart from having good policies which will direct projects to the grass roots level, people's participation is becoming the central issue of our time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-70\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-70\">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Communication_and_policy_sciences_link_in_societal_change\">Communication and policy sciences link in societal change</span></h2>\n<p>Undeniably, development communication and the policy sciences are generally regarded as inextricable links in recognizing change in the society. Their engaged roles encourage and support research, practice, and education, and disseminate knowledge and information for the people through various means of communication. Such engagement leads to this further focus on these two's main target: Change. The Rome Consensus emphasized that for significant progress, development policies should integrate communication for development and strengthen communication capacity within countries and development organisations at all levels.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It has been widely established that mass media could fetch and cater education, essential skills, social harmony, and a desire to reach modernization. As stipulated in Walt Rostow's theory in Boado's<sup id=\"cite_ref-71\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-71\">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> (2000) article, societies progress through specific stages of development on their way to modernity, \"the age of high mass consumption.\" Meanwhile, Lerner suggested that exposure to media would generate empathy for modern culture, and a desire to move from long-established to contemporary ways.<sup id=\"cite_ref-72\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-72\">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> However, one needs to be made to understand the fallacy of the notion that communication is an all-embracing area.\n</p><p>Being the most used tool for development communication, mass media technologies have become the eyes and hands of the society in examining its social conditions, and to dissect and plot solutions through policy sciences, accordingly. In fact, in some instances, mass media technologies, including television, have been magic multipliers of development benefits. Educational television has been used effectively to supplement the work of teachers in classrooms in the teaching of literacy and other skills, but only in well designed programs which are integrated with other educational efforts. This insight regarding the integration of technology in the education set up basically creates a step-on-the-ladder of achieving change and development. Consequently, media play a significant role in the conduct of development communication projects. Communication media are agents of social change and indicators of national development.<sup id=\"cite_ref-73\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-73\">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Development_communication.2C_policy_advocacy.2C_and_governance\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development_communication,_policy_advocacy,_and_governance\">Development communication, policy advocacy, and governance</span></h2>\n<p>Since media and communication play a critical role in development, relevant communication policies are important for good governance to succeed. People engagement and participation in policy advocacy through dialogue are important to gain trust, acceptance, and cooperation from all stakeholders. According to Jan Servaes (2010), since public policies must be viewed as an integral part of the social and economic development process, the kind of advocacy that is ideal is that which is participatory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-74\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-74\">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> The focus in this approach is on 'listening' and 'cooperation' rather than on 'telling what to do' and presumes a dynamic two-way approach to communication.\n</p><p>In general, one can distinguish between (a) advocacy for policy design and decision-making aimed at ensuring political, social and legislative support for development issues (e.g. protection of the environment); and (b) advocacy for policy implementation which requires intensive efforts for mobilizing social forces, individuals and groups for development actions. Both are important and must be addressed. The aim in advocacy strategies is to foster political and public engagement as well as professionals in development issues through the process of social mobilization. There is no universal approach which can be used in all circumstances, flexibility is required in selecting appropriate strategies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-75\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-75\">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The communication media are critical in creating awareness, generating public interest and demand, and placing the issue on the public agenda and building social support. They can play two kinds of advocacy roles: (a) they can support development initiatives by the dissemination of messages that encourage the public to support development-oriented projects; and (b) they can provide decision makers with the information and feedback needed to reach a decision. Policymakers usually respond to popular appeal, to pressure groups, and to their own social network of policy- and decision-makers. Therefore, advocacy, political commitment, and supportive policies are often themselves a product of social support systems and empowerment of people. Advocacy should, therefore, be viewed in conjunction with social support and empowerment strategies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-76\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-76\">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Jan Servaez (2009) affirms that the importance of a free and balanced flow of information to an engaged civil society, through independent media and transparent government, has long been acknowledged. He sees that communication plays a pivotal role in improving governance in developing countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-77\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-77\">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup> Schramm (1964) stated that the task of mass media for information and the new media for education is to speed up and ease the long social transformation required for economic development, and, in particular, to speed up and smoothen the task of mobilizing human resources behind the national effort.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:3_78-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:3-78\">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Governance may be defined as: (1) the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced, (2) the capacity of the government to formulate and implement sound policies effectively, (3) the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic, political, and social interactions among them, and (4) the capacity for active and informed economic, social, and political dialogue among citizens within a public sphere.<sup id=\"cite_ref-servaes64_79-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-servaes64-79\">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Governance implies the ways through which citizens and groups in a society voice their interests, mediate their differences and exercise their legal rights and obligations. Good governance includes notions of greater participation by civil society in decision making, instituting the rule of law, anti-corruption, transparency, accountability, poverty reduction and human rights. Good governance links government to the notion of responsibility for and to the citizenry as opposed to the traditional idea of authority over a nation\u2014legitimacy emanating from popular assent to and participation in government, which is concerned with the welfare of its citizens.<sup id=\"cite_ref-servaes64_79-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-servaes64-79\">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The role of the media in promoting good governance is clear. All aspects of good governance are facilitated by a strong and independent mediascape within a society. Only when journalists are free to monitor, investigate and criticize the public administration's policies and actions can good governance take hold. Independent media are like a beacon that should be welcomed when there is nothing to hide and much to improve. Indeed, this is the concrete link between the functioning of the media and good governance\u2014the media allow for ongoing checks and assessments by the population of the activities of government and assist in bringing public concerns and voices into the open by providing a platform for discussion. Instead, all too often governments devise laws and informal means of keeping their activities hidden from public view or only available to media favorable to their viewpoint. In recent years, many governments have tried to co-opt journalists by paying part of their salaries or by giving them certain kinds of access on the condition that they will not report from other perspectives. If the media are to function in the public interest, governments have to protect the independent functioning of the media and allow various viewpoints to flourish in society.<sup id=\"cite_ref-80\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-80\">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Newspapers, radio and television are found to be effective media in information dissemination and education of people.

This environment develops trust between state and society which lays the foundation of good governance.\n</p><p>Development communication has brought to the fore the evolution of communication for development (C4D)which has mirrored broader shifts in theories and models of economic and social development. For much of the post-World War II period, C4D was informed by the 'modernization' paradigm, which sought to transform 'traditional' societies into modern, Western societies through the transmission of attitudes, practices and technologies. Correspondingly, communication initiatives adopted a diffusion approach, which uses communication to carry out a transfer of information. It is seen as a way to amplify voices, facilitate meaningful participation and foster social change.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:4_81-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:4-81\">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup> This includes large-scale media campaigns, social marketing, dissemination of printed materials, 'education-entertainment' and other forms of one-way transmission of information from the sender to the receiver. Proponents of diffusion theory recognised the limitations of mass media, however, in promoting sustained behavioral change. The theory also incorporated interpersonal communication: face-to-face communication that can either be one-on-one or in small groups. The objectives are to share information, respond to questions, and motivate specific behavioral practices. The belief is that while mass media allows for the learning of new ideas, interpersonal networks encourage the shift from knowledge to continued practice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-86\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-86\">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Similarly, the interpersonal communication skills of field workers is very important in attaining triumph in projects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-87\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-87\">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup> The interpersonal relationship of the project owner and the intended recipients will pave the way for participatory development\u2014a two-way, dynamic interaction between grass roots receivers and the information source mediated by the development communicators.<sup id=\"cite_ref-88\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-88\">&#91;88&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Criticism of the modernization paradigm grew in the 1970s and 1980s. The one-way flow of information and communication from the North to the South was criticized alongside calls for greater representation of voices from the South. At the same time, there was a push for more 'participatory' approaches to development. This triggered the emergence also of participatory development communication, which aims to empower the community towards collective decision-making and action through enhanced knowledge and skills to identify, prioritise and resolve problems and needs. Communication for development has thus come to be seen as a way to amplify voice, facilitate meaningful participation, and foster social change. The 2006 World Congress on Communication for Development defined C4D as 'a social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about seeking change at different levels including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating and learning for sustained and meaningful change'. Such two-way, horizontal approaches to communication include public hearings, debates, deliberations and stakeholder consultations, participatory radio and video, community-based theatre and storytelling,and web forums. Diffusion and participatory approaches have been increasingly integrated or adopted in parallel in C4D initiatives. Such combinations allow agencies to reach broad audiences through large-scale campaigns while promoting local community development, empowerment and ownership through participation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-89\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-89\">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, while the role of communication in supporting development, and stimulating economic growth has increasingly been recognized in international policy statements, communication is relatively under-prioritized in the 'good governance' agenda. Some attribute this to a lack of robust evidence demonstrating communication's impact on governance, others argue it is more fundamentally a question of whether giving support to communication \u2013 which typically encompasses the development of an independent media sector, improving access to information, and the strategic use of media and political communication tools to influence behavior and social change \u2013 is a legitimate area for donor funding, given the often highly political nature of such interventions. What is clear is that the available research on the role of communication in governance is fragmented across multiple disciplines with often conflicting priorities (including political science, communications, media studies, and development studies). At the same time, there has been a dearth of practical guidance available to policymakers on understanding and using communication in governance reform.<sup id=\"cite_ref-huma9_90-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-huma9-90\">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In spite of its relative under-prioritisation in development assistance, few dispute the power of communication, and in particular the catalytic role of the media, in influencing governance relationships and processes: communication is widely seen as vital for connecting states with society, facilitating inclusive political systems, giving 'voice' to poor and marginalised groups, and enabling citizen participation and social accountability. Communication advocates also argue that the strategic use of political communication tools and methodologies can influence the attitudes, opinions and behaviour of key stakeholders and secure the political will necessary for reforms to be successful on the ground. With the recent rise of the fragile states agenda, there has been increased academic and donor interest in how communication can contribute to state-building by improving state-citizen relationships and helping to (re)build social contracts in conflict-affected states.<sup id=\"cite_ref-huma9_90-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-huma9-90\">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The process of development is expedited by mobilizing human resources.

It is a pre-requisite and an instrument of effective policy making and public participation, facilitating information exchange and establishing consensus among divergent opinions and interests. It facilitates the building of know-how, decision making and action capacities at the heart of the delicate cooperation between government, civil society groups, and the private sector. Both internal and external factors influencing human communication require consideration. Internal factors include norms and values, attitudes and behaviour. External factors include the 'vehicles' that bring the material to the target audience. Five branches of strategic communication are particularly applicable to sustainable development:\n</p><p>Development and environmental communication: Breaking down complex information into understandable elements in a socio-culturally relevant way for different audiences is a prerequisite for consensus building and change. A particularly successful model is the problem-oriented, participatory and focused Strategic Extension Campaign (SEC) developed by FAO.\nSocial marketing: This involves gathering input from intended beneficiaries to design communication campaigns promoting socially beneficial practices or products in a target group. Audience segmentation is a crucial element.\nNon-formal and environmental education: These involve promoting awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behaviour for sustainable development and effective participation in decision-making.\nCivil society mobilisation: This involves listening as well as 'talking', and combines vertical and horizontal social interaction through community-controlled media.\nConflict management and negotiation: Mediation, conciliation or arbitration can help to address communication deadlocks and power imbalances, and increase trust.\nIn 2007, Coffey International Development of London published The Role of Communication in Governance: Detailed Analysis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-coffey2007_93-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-coffey2007-93\">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup> This paper analyses the positive and negative contributions of communication to governance. In theory, effective communication can help to promote good governance; however, a solid evidence base is lacking and a positive correlation should not be assumed. Existing studies suggest that it is not enough to create the means of communication; enabling factors must be in place so that voices can be heard and citizens can hold the government to account. Here below is the summary of this paper:\n</p><p>\"If good governance requires an inclusive public space based on informed dialogue and debate, a positive relationship between communication and governance seems plausible. However, communication can further poor governance (when used to protect the state rather than serve as a voice for the people, for example, or when subject to elite capture). In addition, it is difficult to establish a clear evidence base to support positive connections between communication and governance. There are also challenges relating to causality where the link between communication and governance is thought to be reciprocal; for example, communication may help to promote good governance, but a freer government may also promote participation and communication.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-coffey2007_93-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-coffey2007-93\">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Policy_engagement_in_development_communication\">Policy engagement in development communication</span></h2>\n<p>Policy engagement in development communication is essential.

The analyst performs proactive posture, focusing on development communication. Several methods were mentioned in the works of Flor (1991) such as: communication technology assessment, social cost benefit analysis, problematique analysis, scenario construction, and policy delphi.\n</p><p>One of the policy analysis methods discussed by Flor (1991) is the Communication Technology Assessment (CTA) technique which measures the impact of a particular technology to the individuals and society. The result of the assessment serves as the basis for qualifying which technology can be adopted, which ones are constructive, and which are deemed damaging to the society.<sup id=\"cite_ref-flor1991_8-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-flor1991-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> On the other hand, the <a href=\"/wiki/Collingridge_dilemma\" title=\"Collingridge dilemma\">Collingridge dilemma</a> questions the impact of technology assessment in general. It argues that we can only predict the effect of technology if they are extensively developed and widely used in the society. However, the implication of such wide testing and application can lead to difficulties in controlling and changing the technology that has already been embedded in the society.\n</p><p>According to Flor (1991), Scenario Construction and Analysis could be used in analysing communication policy. Scenario is a description technique that has been attracting a lot of attention from practitioners and from researchers. Several disciplines have been using scenarios for some time now, but recently the information system community has dedicated special attention to the possibilities that this description technique provides to enhance understandability of task-related descriptions and communicability among stakeholders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-110\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-110\">&#91;110&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Scenario construction is an assessment of what could happen in the future based on input assumptions. It is not a prediction of what will happen in the future, and is therefore an ideal tool to use to create thought provoking content in markets and sectors that have many variable influences. A scenario report can be deterministic or stochastic, historical or hypothetical. Analysis based on deterministic scenarios typically considers just a few scenarios which might be historical or hypothetical. Although, scenarios tend to be mostly quantitative, they can be used to develop alternative views of the future that are meant to offer strategic thinking about how a company might best respond to rapid changes in the business environment. These scenarios, developed through an internal and external review process, are qualitative and descriptive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-111\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-111\">&#91;111&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Research\">Research</span></h3>\n<p>The coinage of the terminology \"communication policy research\" was done by Harold D.
