How the World Was One: Beyond the Global Village is ArthurÂ C. Clarke's history and survey of the communications revolution, published in 1992.  The title includes an intentional pun; in English How the World Was Won would sound exactly the same. This work is based on an earlier work by Clarke entitled Voice Across the Sea, published in 1958.
