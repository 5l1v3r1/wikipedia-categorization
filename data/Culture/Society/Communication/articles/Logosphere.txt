In communication, logosphere is the interpretation of words' meanings based on language and context.  The word is derived from its Greek roots: logos the word and sphere here in the meaning of the universe. The universe of words as in universe of information. The term was later taken up by virtual reality enthusiasts to describe the logical universe.  The logosphere, in decades past, has been used in reference to the new world of communication created by the invention of the radio. French philosopher Gaston Bachelard proclaimed, "Everyone can hear everyone else and we can all listen in  peace." This "domain of world speech" should be called the logosphere, he reasoned.  Many academics today liken the term logosphere to "the sum-total of ideas, concepts and facts that inhabit the collective texts — digital, printed, handwritten, carved or otherwise — of the human race." What is accessible to whom within the logosphere is a point of interest for many communications researches and social scientists alike. The control of information — the logosphere — and how much of it is publicly available has been a point of socioeconomic oppression and revolution throughout history.
