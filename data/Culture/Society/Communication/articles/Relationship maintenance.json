The more prosocial behavior is evident in a relationship, the more likely for strong bonds to be formed, and the relationship to prosper and continue. Low levels of Prosocial maintenance behavior gives less reinforcement in the relationship, and thus more a weak foundation often leads to the relationships deterioration, or at least non-progression.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Specific prosocial maintenance behaviors that could be exhibited by prosocial standards are positivity, openness, assurances, social networking, task sharing, supportiveness, romance, humor, and joint activities. Each of these qualities equates to spending time together, and interacting either physically or emotionally.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Prosocial maintenance behavior does not value one source of positivity more than the other, although the individual might. Verbalizing your fondness for your partner through positive speech might be what your partner specifically craves in your relationship, while another partner might find more affection in your willingness to help with household chores together. This type of task sharing is also a part of what is known as <i>routine maintenance</i>, and a relatively equal effort by each party is a prosocial function that greatly adds to relationship satisfaction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As a contrast to prosocial behavior that is used to strengthen bonds and reinforce a relationship, <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour\" title=\"Anti-social behaviour\">anti-social maintenance behavior</a> is another strategic behavior pattern that can be used to maintain a current relationship. Its use of continuing a relationship at its current level, would be to decline invitations to opportunities to create new levels of a relationship. By declining these opportunities, this exemplifies an Antisocial behavior, which is generally deliberate in its implementation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modality\">Modality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_maintenance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Modality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Modes of communication vary from spoken to written, <a href=\"/wiki/Communication#Verbal_communication\" title=\"Communication\">verbal</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Nonverbal_communication\" title=\"Nonverbal communication\">nonverbal</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Face-to-face_interaction\" title=\"Face-to-face interaction\">face-to-face</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication\" title=\"Computer-mediated communication\">computer-mediated</a>. Depending on the mode of communication, the same message can be interpreted in a different way.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, different types of relationships can be maintained through different types of communication.\n</p><p>Face-to-face communication affords the greatest opportunity for precise communication because immediate feedback from the receiver can tell whether the message has been understood accurately. Technology today provides limited face-to-face communication to everyone, even those separated by long distance. Businesses have used videoconferencing for many years but programs like <a href=\"/wiki/Skype\" title=\"Skype\">Skype</a> now allow a personal face-to-face conversation with anyone in the world. With the technological advancements that have taken place over the past decade, communication has also evolved from handwritten letters to emails and text messaging and significantly shortened response times.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Romantic and close personal relationships use more openness and assurance maintenance behaviors and these are easier to communicate in person. But even these close connections are relying on more computer mediated communication today. Texting can have many uses, from coordinating task sharing to simply letting someone know you are thinking about them. People may use <a href=\"/wiki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> to plan activities with others, announce new relationships, and provide support and encouragement to those in need. Even the <a href=\"/wiki/Birthday_card\" title=\"Birthday card\">birthday card</a> has migrated online. Although technology cannot replace face-to-face communication in these cases, it can supplement and reinforce the importance of the relationship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Casual connections do not need the same amount of attention as close friendships and romantic relationships. Although there may be some face-to-face communication or telephone calls, social media such as Facebook is enough to maintain an acquaintanceship. Here they can post photos and comments to maintain contact and keep up on each other's lives. If someone is having a bad day, they can provide the necessary support and positivity needed to maintain the relationship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some relationships start and stay online. Individuals may meet through a message board or on Facebook while living hundreds of miles away. These virtual relationships require the least amount of maintenance. People in a virtual-only relationship may be highly committed to each other and display just as much maintenance behavior as those in close proximity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-rabby_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-rabby-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A drawback to using only computer mediated communication is idealization which occurs when a person in a relationship describes the relationship and partner in an unrealistically positive manner. Idealization often will reflect unreal expectations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Mediated communication allows people to control every aspect of the message and they can present an image of themselves that is not real. Facebook relationship maintenance follows implicit rules for interaction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-marmo_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-marmo-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> People expect others to present themselves on Facebook in a positive manner and even to limit a post of anything that could hurt their own image or that of a friend. Even if those in a virtual or long-distance relationship do arrange to meet in person, it is usually set up well in advance and allows time to prepare for control of the encounter to reinforce the online image rather than the reality of their life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Despite its drawbacks, <a href=\"/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication\" title=\"Computer-mediated communication\">computer-mediated communication</a> has changed the way people maintain relationships. Through the technological advancements that have taken place over the past twenty years, communication has evolved from handwritten letters to emails to text messaging to Facebook to Skype, significantly shortening response times with every step. The increased use and familiarity with technology, even as it evolves, will result in user's adaptation to computer mediated communication and reduce some of the advantages of face-to-face communication. However, the amount of time spent together improves the satisfaction in any relationship and face-to-face communication is still recommended whenever possible.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Strategic_.26_routine_maintenance_behaviors\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategic_&amp;_routine_maintenance_behaviors\">Strategic &amp; routine maintenance behaviors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_maintenance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Strategic &amp; routine maintenance behaviors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Behavior patterns in a relationship can be classified as being <i>strategic</i> or <i>routine</i>.

When you phone somebody to congratulate them on a birthday or anniversary, it is a deliberate action that clearly shows you taking the time to show your affection for someone you have a relationship with. These are clear strategic behaviors designed to give <a href=\"/wiki/Positive_reinforcement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Positive reinforcement\">positive reinforcement</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A <i>routine</i> maintenance behavior is less strategic and has more to do with the everyday tasks in life. For example, if a wife is cleaning up from dinner, and her husband decides to take out the trash. This would be considered a Routine Maintenance Behavior. They are used without the express purposes of maintaining a relationship, yet they still help people preserve their bonds with one another.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guerrero_3-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guerrero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Statistically, couples have shown that routine maintenance means more to their relationship than strategic maintenance does. Part of this has to do with the difference in routine maintenance and an exchange relationship. The key difference being that benefits are given without one expected in return, as in an exchange relationship. From this perspective the maintenance and enhancement of close relationships depends on the extent that both people are concerned for each other's needs, and are willing and able to meet those needs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-harvey_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-harvey-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Romantic_relationships\">Romantic relationships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_maintenance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Romantic relationships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stages_of_romantic_relationships\">Stages of romantic relationships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_maintenance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Stages of romantic relationships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Romance_(love)\" title=\"Romance (love)\">Romantic relationships</a> have an extra element that is not found in friendship relationships.

Commonly asking questions such as \"What do you do for fun\" or \"What do you study in school\" are used to establish common grounds. This stage is usually a determining stage in deciding to move forward with the relationship or not.</li>\n<li>Intensifying \u2013 Intensifying involves increased physical touch, especially in public. Much more time in private life is spent with significant other. Individuals begin to look for more commitment. Feelings are beginning to be disclosed as intimate relationship forms.</li>\n<li>Integrating \u2013 At this stage, the bond becomes closer into possible labels of boyfriend and girlfriend. People begin to see you as one with your significant other and as a single unit. Relationship becomes very close and intimate. Words like \"I\" or \"me\" become \"ours.\"</li>\n<li>Bonding \u2013 Last is the bonding stage, which involves the declaration of your status in a formal manner. You legally become bonded as one. Commitments are made and you are there for each other through difficult times.

Much work needs to be done to recover to a healthy point if the relationship is to continue.</li>\n<li>Avoiding \u2013 You begin to avoid each other completely instead of bearing through the routines. Partners restrict themselves from contact not just in person, but also via electronic communication.</li>\n<li>Termination \u2013 This is the final point in de-escalation known as terminating. Partners end their relationship formally and an agreement is reached, usually divorce for marriage situations. Conversations following the terminating stage are of practical matters such as how to divide property or legal matters. The terminating stage can be positive or negative. New beginnings can result after this stage.</li></ol>\n<p>After the termination stages runs its course, relationships often return to the friendship status or in the unfortunate scenario, complete avoidance. If relationships started in the friendship stage and comes to an end in a positive note, friendship status is more likely to be achieved.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_maintenance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Interpersonal_communication_relationship_dissolution\" title=\"Interpersonal communication relationship dissolution\">Interpersonal communication relationship dissolution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Relationship_forming\" title=\"Relationship forming\">Relationship forming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Socionics\" title=\"Socionics\">Socionics</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_maintenance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-canary-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-canary_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-canary_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-canary_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dindia, K., &amp; Canary, D.J.
