Bias-free communication is speech or writing that attempts to include people of all ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious affiliations, abilities, and ages by communicating in a way that makes no assumptions about the receiver of such communication.    An important part of communicating in a bias-free manner is by making sure you are engaging in meaningful conversations, using bias-free language. Your use of words is vital in terms of effectively communicating in ways that you do not offend the person you are talking to. According to Locker, "Bias-free language is language that is sensitive to people's sex, race, age, physical condition and many other categories. Bias-free language does not discriminate and therefore includes all readers in a fair and friendly manner."
