Project Lingua, or just Lingua is an online translation community formed in the end of 2006  with the goal of translating articles from the global citizen media project Global Voices Online from English into other languages, opening lines of distributed  communication between bloggers across the world. The project currently translates into tens  of different languages, and incorporates an active team of hundreds of volunteer translators and translation editors. Along with the Cucumis project and the Wikipedia's own translation projects in every language, such as the Wikipedia:ECHO, Lingua is considered one of the largest volunteer-based online translation communities in the world.     Lingua began as a community-based initiative by Taiwanese blogger Portnoy Zheng,  who started translating Global Voices articles into Chinese as early as September, 2005.  This initial idea became a project of its own at the Global Voices Summit in December 2006, where it was given the name "Lingua". The first official Lingua sites, launched by June 2007, were Chinese (both Simplified and Traditional), Bangla, Farsi, Spanish, Portuguese and French. The project has since grown rapidly in size and scope. Global Voices is translated in all the top languages used on the internet but also include under-represent and indigenous languages, such as Aymara .Translators apply via the Translation Application Form.  Lingua has content-sharing/partnerships (formal and informal) with news sites and other online organizations, such as: Lingua has also partnered with like minded organisations to provide translations. In August 2012, Lingua launched a collaborative effort to translate the Declaration of Internet Freedom  providing the text in 31 languages.
