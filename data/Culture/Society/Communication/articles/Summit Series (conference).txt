Summit Series was founded in April 2008 by Elliott Bisnow, Brett Leve, Jeff Rosenthal, Jeremy Schwartz, and Ryan Begelman. Summit was launched with an invitation-only event organized for young entrepreneurs to meet and gain advice from one another that was hosted at a ski resort in Park City, Utah and attended by 19 people.   Later in 2008, the group held a similar gathering in Mexico.  Initially the organization did not have an official headquarters and the team moved between rented apartments in various countries worldwide.   In 2009, Summit was invited by the Obama administration to curate a meeting at the White House between senior officials and 35 young entrepreneurs.   In May 2010, Summit held DC10, a three-day conference in Washington, D.C. for 750 people with participants including former President Bill Clinton, Ted Turner, and John Legend.

In April 2013, Summit purchased Powder Mountain,  the largest ski resort in America, for a reported $40 million.   Summit relocated its headquarters to Powder Mountain later that year.  The organization hosted its first event at the resort, Summit Outside, in July 2013.  Summit is developing a sustainable residential community named Summit Powder Mountain on the mountain. Plans for Summit Powder Mountain include 500 homes and a village of comparable density, a recording studio, conference lodge, startup incubator and an innovation laboratory.
