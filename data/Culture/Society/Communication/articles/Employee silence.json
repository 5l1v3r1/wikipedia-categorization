One way this can happen is if employees do not speak up to a supervisor or manager.\n</p><p>Van Dyne et al. (2003) define silence as an employee\u2019s motivation to withhold or express ideas, information and opinions about work\u2010related improvements. This silence can be intentional or unintentional; information can be consciously held back by employees. Or it can be an unintentional failure to communicate or a merely a matter of having nothing to say (Tangirala and Ramanujam, 2008). In an organization, this is interesting because it appears that silence is a communicative choice that employees may decide to adopt.\n</p><p>Indeed, when there is a problem in the workplace, employees have two options: remain silent or speak up. Unfortunately, many employees choose to remain silent because they do not want to share information that could be interpreted as negative or threatening.  Employees typically remain silent about conflicts with co-workers, disagreements about organizational decisions, potential weaknesses in work processes, illegal or dangerous behaviors, and individual/personal grievances. Their silence keeps management from receiving critical information that would allow their organizations to improve or address problems before they have adverse effects.\n</p><p>The question of why employees choose to communicate or not in an organizational setting is an interesting one.  As Milliken et al. (2003) state, \u201cthere is evidence from a variety of sources that employees often do not feel comfortable speaking to their bosses about organizational problems or issues that concern them.\u201d  Employees might be afraid of the outcome of speaking up, they might feel like nothing will change, they might simply feel intimidated with the subject matter that they wish to express, or they might feel intimidated by whom they would have to talk to.  Also, if their co-workers aren\u2019t speaking up, they might be inclined to close their mouths as well, termed \"collective silence\".  They might not want to break away from the crowd and present an opinion that differs from the majority. Or, employees might not feel like they possess enough power to speak up and voice their opinions; this notion is of particular significance when the organization is structured and set up as a hierarchy or bureaucracy.\n</p><p>Employee silence can occur in any organization, most often in organizations where <a href=\"/wiki/Communication\" title=\"Communication\">communication</a> is suffering. Employee silence causes the most damage when employees and supervisors do not meet on a regular basis. In a virtual workplace this is also true. In a virtual workplace the only in-person communication is in small discussion groups. This kind of organization is very susceptible to employee silence because there is almost no person-to-person communication, and it is very easy to ignore or misinterpret things like email. Employee silence is a problem for more than just virtual organizations. Within the past few years employee silence has been happening more often in non-virtual organizations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  Organizations where considerable risk is involved such as airports and \u201chospitals; should be especially mindful of\u201d employee silence.  This is because mistakes caused by employee silence in these organizations can lead to the loss of life or serious damage costs to the organization.<sup id=\"cite_ref-podcast_interview_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-podcast_interview-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Causes\">Causes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Employee_silence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Causes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are many different reasons for the start of employee silence in an organization. According to the Handbook of Organizational Justice, \"a culture of injustice in organizations, be it distributive, procedural, or interactional (what we would call interpersonal), can lead to employee silence.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_of_org_justice_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook_of_org_justice-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In other words, \"if the organizational norm is an unjust environment such as one that is characterized by intense supervisory control, suppression of conflict, ambiguous reporting structures, and poorly conducted performance reviews, employees will choose not to exercise voice and will therefore not receive the benefits available to those that do express opinions and ideas.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_of_org_justice_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook_of_org_justice-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One obvious cause of employee silence is constant negative feedback from supervisors. When an employee gives a supervisor a suggestion and is shot down, employee silence is developed in an organization. Over time employees start to feel that every time they make a suggestion it will not be taken into consideration or will be rejected. A result of this is called a dissenting voice, which contributes to employee silence. The dissenting voice is that of the supervisor shooting someone down.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Supervisors, leaders, and managers alike can avoid the occurrence of a dissenting voice among employees by monitoring their management style. Cooperative styles such as \"integrating, obliging, and compromising\" are more effective than \"avoiding and dominating\" styles, which could cause silence among employees (Colquitt and Greenberg 312).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_of_org_justice_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook_of_org_justice-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another reason employee silence occurs is because people fear that if they speak up they may lose their jobs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In some cases subordinates don\u2019t want to appear as though they are going against their supervisors, as they may view the employees' input as criticism of their practices, and be fired.<sup id=\"cite_ref-podcast_interview_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-podcast_interview-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This is especially true of organizations which have just experienced layoffs. In these cases, employees fear that their jobs could be taken away and are even less likely to voice their opinions than they did in the first place.<sup id=\"cite_ref-podcast_Brockner_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-podcast_Brockner-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another cause of employee silence is when supervisors and employees fail to address problems. Avoiding problems or looking for \"quick fixes\" only makes things worse and causes employees to feel that there is no hope for resolution. If employees lose hope that the real problems will actually be addressed and resolved, it can lead to a host of problems for the organization and for the employee, one of which is continued employee silence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  Employees then start to feel it is better to remain silent about issues because nothing will change anyway. If companies want to be successful they need to confront the actual problem and fix it. Both employee and supervisor need to deal with the situation because employee silence usually stems from higher management down to lower level employees, which is the cause of the indifferent employee.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceB_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceB-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Discursive_formations\">Discursive formations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Employee_silence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Discursive formations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A discursive formation is defined as the regularities that produce such discourse. Discourse (acts of speaking and writing) is the medium by which an individual\u2019s behavior is framed for him/her and others.  We are who we are, based on our communicative practices with others.  Foucault uses this concept in his analysis of the political economy and natural history, but it\u2019s very useful when studying organizational communication.\nDiscursive formations perhaps can intensify the conditioning of the silent employee based on the power aspect of the discourse itself. When one speaks or writes, a message can be delivered in a certain context, and that can have an effect on the employee on whether or not to remain silent.  Discourse is the product of the dominant power interests in organizations and these interests can perpetuate themselves based on the ideology that is represented through them. Employees can feel less powerful as a result of hearing dominant opinions and perceptions; these practices can encourage silence naturally.\n</p><p>Many factors contribute to the notion of employee silence, especially when it comes to how one is placed or ranked in an organizational structure.  There are distinct organizational groupings or divisions, such as masculine or feminine, subordinate or dominant, manager or employee, that can influence silence.  The way superiors communicate with subordinates determines the climate and the culture of the organization.  Employees begin to identify themselves throughout the culture they work in, by the ways in which they participate in work rituals, through the relationships they form with co-workers and managers, and through the language/discourse they use. Communication is thus at the forefront of how employees perceive themselves in relation to the organization and in regards to their relationships with other people.\n</p><p>Research by Milliken et al. (2003) suggests that employee silence is related to social capital (valuable resources such as trust and goodwill that are embedded within a social structure).  Employees work hard to build and maintain social capital and typically do not engage in behaviors that may weaken or sever these vital social ties.  They do not want to risk looking bad; this will reflect on their identity, their role, and their overall connection to the organization. This is pertinent as it relates to employee identity and power.  Since employees perceive themselves in relations to others, they do not want to ruin their public image because that image alone protects their social capital.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Additional_causes\">Additional causes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Employee_silence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Additional causes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In organizations, there is evidence that employees are especially uncomfortable conveying information about potential problems or issues to those above them (Milliken et al. 2003).  This knowledge brings up the notion of hierarchy and subordinate/supervisor relationships.  Someone in a lower position will be uncomfortable expressing issues to someone in a higher position.  If, however, subordinates have close, positive, interpersonal relationships with their supervisors, chances are higher that they will choose to communicate honestly.  It comes down to the basic principle of trust and mutual appreciation, which is difficult to obtain in a bureaucratic structure.  Willman, P. et al. (2006) present evidence that any hierarchical organization tends to support what its leaders already think is true more than it challenges them to think differently.  The levels below the leaders are more interested in keeping their jobs than in telling the truth.\n</p><p>But once a relationship is established, and the lines of communication are open, it is undeniably easier to have others on your side and others who are willing to help you out, both professionally and personally.  Pfeffer (2010) acknowledges the dynamic relationship among trust, relationships, and power when he says, \u201cSometimes building a relationship so that others will help you requires nothing more than being polite and listening... Being nice to people is effective because people find it difficult to fight with those who are being polite and courteous.\u201d When that key component of mutual understanding is absent in an organizational setting, however, silence comes into play, and a myriad of power schemes and competing agendas can influence the decision of whether or not to communicate concerns.\n</p><p>Donaghey, J. et al. (2011) suggest ways in which management, through agenda-setting and institutional structures, can perpetuate silence over a range of issues, thereby arranging employees out of the voice process.  When a dominant group voices certain opinions, these perceptions become the dominant ideologies that float across the organization.  The subordinate viewpoints are therefore never brought to the forefront because they are inevitably silenced.\n</p><p>Tangirala and Ramanujam (2008) conducted research on nurses in Midwestern hospitals to study employee silence in health care.  With lives at stake every day, the notion of employee silence in such an industry is a particularly devastating one due to its potential implications.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2012)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>  Their research showed that the more power a supervisor is perceived to have, the less likely it was that nurses would share critical information.  They did not want to cause unnecessary tension and sever professional bonds with their bosses.  They didn\u2019t want to cause a stir; in their minds, it was better to remain silent than address conflicts and clear up confusion.\n</p><p>The research also found that nurses were less silent when they identified with their workgroup, felt proud of and attached to their jobs, and perceived a high level of fairness in the workplace.  These startling<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\" title=\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\"><span title=\"The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (April 2012)\">according to whom?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> revelations relate to Pfeffer\u2019s key point of acting like one has it (confidence and power); perception is everything and perception is reality.  He states, \u201cWe choose how we will act and talk, and those decisions are consequential for acquiring and holding on to power\u201d (2010).\nIt is clear when employees feel they don\u2019t have a stake, a personal investment, in an organization, they will choose to remain silent.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2012)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>\n</p><p>So how can organizations reduce employee silence and increase employee commitment?  According to Ewing (1977), managers need to create a safe place for employees to voice their concerns. They should<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\" title=\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\"><span title=\"The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (April 2012)\">clarification needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> create a comfortable, open space or environment where employees do not feel intimidated or threatened by either internal or external circumstances.\n</p><p>Tangirala and Ramanujam (2008) suggest that organizational pride should be enhanced in the minds and souls of workers.  Employees need to feel a high amount of satisfaction in order to positively identify with their organization.  Managers can also increase employee pride in their professions by giving constructive feedback after projects are completed and by engaging in constant training to continually enhance performance. Employees need to feel like their contributions matter, and that their work is significant and meaningful. When this occurs, employees will feel like they truly do matter in an organization; they will become active players and voice their concerns freely and without fear. They will more positively identify with their organizations, thus bringing the whole idea of employee identity, communication and job satisfaction full circle.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects\">Effects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Employee_silence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Effects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Organizational_effects\">Organizational effects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Employee_silence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Organizational effects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Employee silence is extremely detrimental to organizations, often causing an \u201cescalating level of dissatisfaction\u201d among employees, \u201cwhich manifests itself in absenteeism and turnover and perhaps other undesired behaviors\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_of_org_justice_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook_of_org_justice-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Communication is the key to an organization\u2019s success.

Over time silence within organizations causes some employees to be extremely indifferent.

Unfortunately when major monetary losses are detected in organizations, managers tend to react by trying to recover the loss, overlooking the fact that employees have become indifferent as a result of unaddressed employee silence. More often than not employees who are not doing their share of the work are also not speaking up about the problems they see, leading to a perpetual cycle of employee silence (Joinson 1048).<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceB_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceB-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_on_employees\">Effects on employees</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Employee_silence&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Effects on employees\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Indifferent employees, often products of ignored employee silence, tend to feel like cogs at machinery factories, developing the attitude \u201cto get along, go along\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceB_9-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceB-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> They sometimes develop depression and other health problems.

One way to do this would be to try to establish procedural climates.  Another way to prevent employee silence is to create an employee who is committed the organization. This is done by showing that the organization is fair and committed to its employees.

It would be interesting to discover if job titles play a part in employee silence or it's just a matter of analyzing each individual situation or event.\n</p><p>Another area of potential future research should delve into the notion of silence as the absence of speech (a non-behavior, essentially).  The absence of such a behavior is difficult to study than more overt and obvious behavior (Johannesen, 1974).  This act has many implications for employee and organizational performance.\n</p><p>Non-verbal behavior should be addressed as well in future studies of employee silence. It might be beneficial to research the effect of body language and the importance of gestures to interpret employees' motives.
