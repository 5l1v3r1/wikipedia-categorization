The Mars Laser Communication Demonstration  was a project to demonstrate optical communications on the 2009 Mars Telecommunications Orbiter. "Lasercom sends information using beams of light and optical elements, such as telescopes and optical amplifiers, rather than RF signals, amplifiers, and antennas"   The program for the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter was scrapped in 2005 and hence also the project
