This is a list of awards issued by organisations and governmental bodies honoring the contributions of volunteers (unpaid staff). Whereas many organisations honor volunteers who serve within those individual organisations, these awards listed here recognize volunteers contributing to a variety of nonprofit organisations, non-governmental organisations, charities, civil society organizations and communities. City University London hosts an annual volunteer awards ceremony. In 2015 there were 7 award categories which included Volunteer of the Year which was awarded to Siobhan Tatum, Team Player awarded to Valentina Aronica and Leadership in Volunteering was secured by Ken Hy. www.islingtontribune.com/news/2015/apr/volunteering-awards-salute-‘inspiring’-city-university-students
