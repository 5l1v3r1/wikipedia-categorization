The phrase primitive culture is the title of an 1871 book by Edward Burnett Tylor. A defining characteristic of primitive cultures according to Tylor is a greater amount of leisure time than in more complex societies.  Cultural primitivism has also been applied to interpretations of unfamiliar cuisines. The eating practices of Native American cultures have been likened to the ways of the noble savage, whose eating practices are characterized as equitable and inclusive. These qualifications are made from an etic perspective. Barbecue in particular has been studied by the scholar Andrew Warnes.
