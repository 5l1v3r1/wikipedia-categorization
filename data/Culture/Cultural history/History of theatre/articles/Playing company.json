The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the following discussion applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.\n</p><p>In the later <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_Ages\" title=\"Middle Ages\">Medieval</a> and early <a href=\"/wiki/Renaissance\" title=\"Renaissance\">Renaissance</a> periods, wealthy and powerful English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe of half a dozen \"players\", just as noblemen kept <a href=\"/wiki/Jester\" title=\"Jester\">jesters</a> or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Tudor_dynasty\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tudor dynasty\">Tudors</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England\" title=\"Henry VII of England\">Henry VII</a> kept a company of players called the \"Lusores Regis\", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In the early period the difference between players, <a href=\"/wiki/Acrobatics\" title=\"Acrobatics\">acrobats</a> and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could defray expenses by touring to various cities and performing for profit&#160;&#8211;&#32; a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of <a href=\"/wiki/English_Renaissance_theatre\" title=\"English Renaissance theatre\">English Renaissance theatre</a> in the early and middle 16th century derives.\n</p><p>One curious development of this era was the development of companies of pre-pubescent boy actors. The use of the <a href=\"/wiki/Boy_player\" title=\"Boy player\">boy player</a> in companies of adult actors to play female parts can be traced far back in the history of <a href=\"/wiki/Medieval_theatre\" title=\"Medieval theatre\">medieval theatre</a>, in the famous <a href=\"/wiki/Mystery_play\" title=\"Mystery play\">mystery plays</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Morality_play\" title=\"Morality play\">moralities</a>; the employment of casts of boys for entire dramatic productions began in the early 16th century, which utilized the boys' choirs connected with cathedrals, churches, and schools. In time the practice took on a professional aspect and companies of child actors would play an important role in the development of drama through the <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabethan_era\" title=\"Elizabethan era\">Elizabethan era</a> and into the <a href=\"/wiki/Jacobean_era\" title=\"Jacobean era\">Jacobean</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Caroline_era\" title=\"Caroline era\">Caroline</a> periods that followed.

A variety of strolling players, and even early London-based troupes existed before 1572. The situations were often fluid, and much of this history is obscure; this timeline necessarily implies more precision than exists in some cases.

Companies had hundreds of pounds of value invested in their costumes, in \"glaring satin suits\" and \"sumptuous dresses\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>&#160;&#8211;&#32; \"cloaks in scarlet with gold laces and buttons, and in purple satin adorned with silver;\" doublets of \"carnation velvet, flame, ginger, red and green; and women's gowns in white satin and cloth of gold.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In 1605, Edward Alleyn estimated that his share in the \"apparell\" of the <a href=\"/wiki/Admiral%27s_Men\" title=\"Admiral&#39;s Men\">Admiral's Men</a> was worth \u00a3100&#160;&#8211;&#32; and Alleyn was one of nine sharers in the company at the time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> When a company got itself into financial difficulties, the members sometimes had to pawn their costumes, as <a href=\"/wiki/Pembroke%27s_Men\" title=\"Pembroke&#39;s Men\">Pembroke's Men</a> did in the plague year of 1593.\n</p><p>In 1605 the actor <a href=\"/wiki/Augustine_Phillips\" title=\"Augustine Phillips\">Augustine Phillips</a> left specific pieces of his wardrobe to an apprentice in his last will and testament&#160;&#8211;&#32; including his \"mouse-colored\" velvet hose, purple cloak, white taffeta doublet, and black taffeta suit. To a modern sensibility, this may sound quaint and odd; but when \"a doublet and hose of seawater green satin cost \u00a33\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> the monetary value of Phillips' items was not negligible. Actors could face serious penalties for appropriating the costumes of their companies. [See <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Dawes\" title=\"Robert Dawes\">Robert Dawes</a> for an example.] (The players could defray some of their costs in the used clothing market. As an example, the King's Men bought discarded items of Gondomar's wardrobe for the actor playing the Black Knight in <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Game_at_Chess\" title=\"A Game at Chess\">A Game at Chess</a></i>. <sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Often, \"eminent lords and knights at their decease\" would leave articles of their finery to their servants&#160;&#8211;&#32; much of it \"unseemly\" for servingmen and women to wear. Such garments would end up the property of the actors.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A second major cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid as little as \u00a36 to \u00a37 per play (or about the price of two suits).<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Yet since the companies acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_Henslowe\" title=\"Philip Henslowe\">Philip Henslowe</a>'s Diary records dozens of titles for the 1597&#8211;1603 period; when <a href=\"/wiki/Worcester%27s_Men\" title=\"Worcester&#39;s Men\">Worcester's Men</a> were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.\n</p><p>The sharers in the company also paid wages to their hired men and boys. Wages differed somewhat over time and from company to company and case to case; but the general average minimum was 1 <a href=\"/wiki/Shilling\" title=\"Shilling\">shilling</a> per man per day, the same wage as that of an artisan worker. Boys cost perhaps half as much, though they were often maintained under some version of an apprenticeship arrangement, which could vary widely in details.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scheduling\">Scheduling</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Playing_company&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Scheduling\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Performances at the public theatres were generally allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays like <a href=\"/wiki/Good_Friday\" title=\"Good Friday\">Good Friday</a>. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they could. They were supposed to cease playing entirely during <a href=\"/wiki/Lent\" title=\"Lent\">Lent</a>&#160;&#8211;&#32; but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Strange%27s_Men\" title=\"Lord Strange&#39;s Men\">Lord Strange's Men</a> played daily at the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rose_(theatre)\" title=\"The Rose (theatre)\">Rose Theatre</a> right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Herbert_(Master_of_the_Revels)\" title=\"Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)\">Henry Herbert</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_the_Revels\" title=\"Master of the Revels\">Master of the Revels</a>.\n</p><p>One restriction that the players observed, one that was too serious to violate, was the prohibition enforced whenever <a href=\"/wiki/Bubonic_plague\" title=\"Bubonic plague\">bubonic plague</a> rose from endemic to epidemic levels. Through much of the English Renaissance period, the theatres were shut down when the death figures in the plague bill (the weekly mortality report for London and some suburban parishes) rose above a certain level. In 1604 that cut-off number was set at 30 per week; in 1607 it was raised to 40. A serious epidemic closed the theatres almost entirely from June 1592 through April 1594; 11,000 Londoners died of plague in 1593. (The plague tended to abate in the colder weather of winter; the theatres opened for short seasons during the winter months of those years.) 1603 was another bad plague year, with 30,000 deaths in London; the theatres were closed from March 1603 to perhaps April 1604.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Other serious epidemics caused theatre closures in 1625 (for eight months, to October) and from May 1636 to October 1637. These periods of closure were always traumatically difficult for the acting troupes; some survived by touring cities and towns outside London...and some didn't survive at all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Elizabethan_Age\">The Elizabethan Age</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Playing_company&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Elizabethan Age\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The explosion of popular drama that began when <a href=\"/wiki/James_Burbage\" title=\"James Burbage\">James Burbage</a> built the first fixed and permanent venue for drama, <a href=\"/wiki/The_Theatre\" title=\"The Theatre\">The Theatre</a>, in <a href=\"/wiki/1576_in_literature\" title=\"1576 in literature\">1576</a> was the one great step away from the medieval organizational model and toward the commercial theatre; but that evolution was, at best, a \"work in progress\" throughout the English Renaissance. Throughout this period, troupes of actors needed to maintain the patronage of a noble household. The prevailing legal system in England<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> defined \"masterless men\" who traveled about the country as vagabonds, and subjected them to treatments of varying harshness. Local authorities tended to be more hostile than welcoming toward players; the Corporation of London, from the <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lord Mayor of the City of London\">Lord Mayor</a> and aldermen down, was famously hostile to acting troupes, as were the <a href=\"/wiki/Puritan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puritan\">Puritans</a>. Noble patronage was, at the very least, the legal fig leaf that allowed professional players to function in society.\n</p><p>In some cases, more so toward the end of the period, noble patronage was nothing more than that legal fig leaf; a company of actors was an independent entity, financially and otherwise. Conversely, some noblemen were beneficent patrons of their players. The Lords Hunsdon&#160;&#8211;&#32; <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Carey,_1st_Baron_Hunsdon\" title=\"Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon\">Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon</a> (c. 1524&#8211;96), and his son <a href=\"/wiki/George_Carey,_2nd_Baron_Hunsdon\" title=\"George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon\">George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon</a> (1547&#8211;1603)&#160;&#8211;&#32; were valuable protectors of their own company, and, when they served in the office of <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain\" title=\"Lord Chamberlain\">Lord Chamberlain</a> (1585&#8211;96 and 1597&#8211;1603 respectively), of English drama as a whole.\n</p><p>That company of Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was organized somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept of which was just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in <a href=\"/wiki/1594_in_literature\" title=\"1594 in literature\">1594</a>, after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_Henslowe\" title=\"Philip Henslowe\">Philip Henslowe</a> functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (The silver lining in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. (<a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Langley\" title=\"Francis Langley\">Francis Langley</a>, builder of the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Swan_(theatre)\" title=\"The Swan (theatre)\">Swan Theatre</a>, operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.)     \n</p><p>Drama in the age of <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England\" title=\"Elizabeth I of England\">Elizabeth</a> was at best an organized disorder; suppression of individual companies, and even the profession as a whole, for political reasons was not unknown. [See: <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dogs_(play)\" title=\"The Isle of Dogs (play)\">The Isle of Dogs</a></i>.] Local residents sometimes opposed theatres in their neighborhoods. Individual companies of actors struggled and failed and recombined; tracking the changes has been the obsession of scholars and the bane of students. \n</p><p>Yet the drama was also enormously popular, from the Queen and Court down to the commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, and the middle class generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a surprising and intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control&#160;&#8211;&#32; in <a href=\"/wiki/Shoreditch\" title=\"Shoreditch\">Shoreditch</a> to the north, or the <a href=\"/wiki/Bankside\" title=\"Bankside\">Bankside</a> and Paris Garden in <a href=\"/wiki/Southwark\" title=\"Southwark\">Southwark</a>, on the southern bank of the <a href=\"/wiki/River_Thames\" title=\"River Thames\">River Thames</a>: the <a href=\"/wiki/Curtain_Theatre\" title=\"Curtain Theatre\">Curtain</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rose_(theatre)\" title=\"The Rose (theatre)\">Rose</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Swan_(theatre)\" title=\"The Swan (theatre)\">Swan</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Fortune_Playhouse\" title=\"Fortune Playhouse\">Fortune</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Globe_Theatre\" title=\"Globe Theatre\">Globe</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Blackfriars_Theatre\" title=\"Blackfriars Theatre\">Blackfrairs</a>&#160;&#8211;&#32; a famous roster.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Jacobean_and_Caroline_Eras\">The Jacobean and Caroline Eras</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Playing_company&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The Jacobean and Caroline Eras\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>King <a href=\"/wiki/James_I_of_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"James I of England\">James</a>, \"VI and I\", was passionately fond of drama; and theatrical activity at Court accelerated from the start of his reign.

In 1608 a company was organized under the title of the King's second son, the eight-year-old Charles; this company, the Duke of York's Men, was called <a href=\"/wiki/Prince_Charles%27s_Men\" title=\"Prince Charles&#39;s Men\">Prince Charles's Men</a> after Prince Henry unexpectedly died in 1612.\n</p><p>Companies continued to form, evolve, and dissolve in the early Jacobean era&#160;&#8211;&#32; the <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Revels_Children\" title=\"King&#39;s Revels Children\">King's Revels Children</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Lady_Elizabeth%27s_Men\" title=\"Lady Elizabeth&#39;s Men\">Lady Elizabeth's Men</a>; but by the midpoint of James' reign, around the time of Shakespeare's death in <a href=\"/wiki/1616_in_literature\" title=\"1616 in literature\">1616</a>, the dramatic scene had generally stabilized into four important companies. These were: the King's Men, at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres; <a href=\"/wiki/Admiral%27s_Men\" title=\"Admiral&#39;s Men\">Palsgrave's Men</a> (formerly the Admiral's and Prince Henry's Men), at the Fortune; <a href=\"/wiki/Prince_Charles%27s_Men\" title=\"Prince Charles&#39;s Men\">Prince Charles's Men</a>, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Hope_Theatre\" title=\"Hope Theatre\">Hope</a>; and <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Men\" title=\"Queen Anne&#39;s Men\">Queen Anne's Men</a>, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Bull_Theatre\" title=\"Red Bull Theatre\">Red Bull Theatre</a>.\n</p><p>Theatrical evolution continued, sometimes tied to the lives and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded with the death of <a href=\"/wiki/Anne_of_Denmark\" title=\"Anne of Denmark\">Anne of Denmark</a> in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Henrietta%27s_Men\" title=\"Queen Henrietta&#39;s Men\">Queen Henrietta's Men</a>. Occasionally there were other new companies like <a href=\"/wiki/Beeston%27s_Boys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beeston&#39;s Boys\">Beeston's Boys</a>, and new theatres like the <a href=\"/wiki/Salisbury_Court_Theatre\" title=\"Salisbury Court Theatre\">Salisbury Court</a>. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 1636&#8211;37, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in a dizzying confusion.
