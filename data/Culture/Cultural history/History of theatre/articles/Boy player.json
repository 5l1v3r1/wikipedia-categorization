The playwright <a href=\"/wiki/John_Lyly\" title=\"John Lyly\">John Lyly</a> earned fame when his \"Euphuistic\" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1580s.\n</p><p>The practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). In <a href=\"/wiki/1590_in_literature\" title=\"1590 in literature\">1590</a> theatrical performances by the Children of Paul's were suppressed, largely due to Lyly's involvement in the <a href=\"/wiki/Marprelate_controversy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marprelate controversy\">Marprelate controversy</a>. Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/1600_in_literature\" title=\"1600 in literature\">1600</a>, however, the practice saw a resurgence: the <a href=\"/wiki/Children_of_the_Chapel\" title=\"Children of the Chapel\">Children of the Chapel</a> performed at the private <a href=\"/wiki/Blackfriars_Theatre\" title=\"Blackfriars Theatre\">Blackfriars Theatre</a> for much of the first decade of the 17th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Their performances of the plays of <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Jonson\" title=\"Ben Jonson\">Ben Jonson</a> were especially popular, inspiring Shakespeare's lines about how the boys \"carry it away...Hercules and his load too\" in <i>Hamlet,</i> II, ii,360-2. (The <a href=\"/wiki/Globe_Theatre\" title=\"Globe Theatre\">Globe Theatre</a> was decorated with a statue of <a href=\"/wiki/Hercules\" title=\"Hercules\">Hercules</a>, the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.\n</p><p>The children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the <i>Poetomachia</i> or <a href=\"/wiki/War_of_the_Theatres\" title=\"War of the Theatres\">War of the Theatres</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/1599_in_literature\" title=\"1599 in literature\">1599</a>&#8211;<a href=\"/wiki/1601_in_literature\" title=\"1601 in literature\">1601</a>). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted <a href=\"/wiki/John_Marston_(poet)\" title=\"John Marston (poet)\">John Marston</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Drum%27s_Entertainment\" title=\"Jack Drum&#39;s Entertainment\">Jack Drum's Entertainment</a></i> (1600) and <i><a href=\"/wiki/What_You_Will\" title=\"What You Will\">What You Will</a></i> (1601) and <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Dekker_(poet)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thomas Dekker (poet)\">Thomas Dekker</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Satiromastix\" title=\"Satiromastix\">Satiromastix</a></i> (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Cynthia%27s_Revels\" title=\"Cynthia&#39;s Revels\">Cynthia's Revels</a></i> (1600) and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Poetaster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Poetaster\">The Poetaster</a></i> (1601).\n</p><p>The boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Middleton\" title=\"Thomas Middleton\">Thomas Middleton</a>, which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman \"wits,\" in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Heywood\" title=\"Thomas Heywood\">Thomas Heywood</a> that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of <a href=\"/wiki/George_Chapman\" title=\"George Chapman\">George Chapman</a> &#8212; <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bussy_D%27Ambois\" title=\"Bussy D&#39;Ambois\">Bussy D'Ambois</a>,</i> <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Revenge_of_Bussy_D%27Ambois\" title=\"The Revenge of Bussy D&#39;Ambois\">The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</a></i>, and the double play <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Conspiracy_and_Tragedy_of_Charles,_Duke_of_Byron\" title=\"The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron\">The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron</a></i>. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.   \n</p><p>The brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play <i><a href=\"/wiki/Eastward_Ho\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastward Ho\">Eastward Ho</a></i>, which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By <a href=\"/wiki/1606_in_literature\" title=\"1606 in literature\">1606</a> the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The <a href=\"/wiki/Lady_Elizabeth%27s_Men\" title=\"Lady Elizabeth&#39;s Men\">Lady Elizabeth's Men</a> was a new company granted a patent on April 27, <a href=\"/wiki/1611_in_literature\" title=\"1611 in literature\">1615</a>, under the patronage of King James' daughter <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Bohemia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elizabeth of Bohemia\">Princess Elizabeth</a>; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Gunnell\" title=\"Richard Gunnell\">Richard Gunnell</a> attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the <a href=\"/wiki/Salisbury_Court_Theatre\" title=\"Salisbury Court Theatre\">Salisbury Court Theatre</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/1629_in_literature\" title=\"1629 in literature\">1629</a>. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Hammerton\" title=\"Stephen Hammerton\">Stephen Hammerton</a>, who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early <a href=\"/wiki/Matinee_idol\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Matinee idol\">matinee idol</a> among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>A limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in <a href=\"/wiki/1637_in_literature\" title=\"1637 in literature\">1637</a>, when <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Beeston\" title=\"Christopher Beeston\">Christopher Beeston</a> established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called <a href=\"/wiki/Beeston%27s_Boys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beeston&#39;s Boys\">Beeston's Boys</a>. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors &#8212; much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in 1638, his son <a href=\"/wiki/William_Beeston\" title=\"William Beeston\">William Beeston</a> continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in 1642; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the <a href=\"/wiki/Restoration_comedy\" title=\"Restoration comedy\">Restoration</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Boys_in_adult_companies\">Boys in adult companies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Boy_player&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Boys in adult companies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Playing_company\" title=\"Playing company\">playing companies</a> of adult actors, boys were initially given the female parts, but women were permitted to act on the stage from December <a href=\"/wiki/1661_in_literature\" title=\"1661 in literature\">1661</a>.

Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by <a href=\"/wiki/William_Shakespeare\" title=\"William Shakespeare\">Shakespeare</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Webster\" title=\"John Webster\">Webster</a> could have been played by \"children.\" The available evidence is incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; however, the overall implication is that even the largest roles were played by boys or young men, not mature adults. In a recent detailed survey of the evidence for the ages of boy actors and their roles, scholar David Kathman concludes that \"No significant evidence supports the idea that such roles were played by adult sharers but a wealth of specific evidence demonstrates that they were played by adolescent boys no older than about twenty-one\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> There are only two possible examples of adult actors playing female roles. The first appears in the cast list for <a href=\"/wiki/John_Fletcher_(playwright)\" title=\"John Fletcher (playwright)\">John Fletcher</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Wild_Goose_Chase\" title=\"The Wild Goose Chase\">The Wild Goose Chase</a></i>, in which the veteran comedian <a href=\"/wiki/John_Shank\" title=\"John Shank\">John Shank</a> is listed; the entry reads \"Petella, their waiting-woman. Their Servant Mr. <i>Shanck</i>.\"  However, Kathman argues that this refers to two roles, not one: Shank did not play Petella, but a comic servant who appears later in the play.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The second example is the cast list for <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Heywood\" title=\"Thomas Heywood\">Thomas Heywood</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Fair_Maid_of_the_West\" title=\"The Fair Maid of the West\">The Fair Maid of the West</a></i>, in which <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Turner_(actor)\" title=\"Anthony Turner (actor)\">Anthony Turner</a> apparently played the tiny role of a kitchen maid. Kathman suspects this is merely a misprint, but concludes that even if Turner did play this role, there remains no evidence for adults playing leading roles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Many boy actors filled female roles for a few years, then switched to male roles. An example: <a href=\"/wiki/John_Honyman\" title=\"John Honyman\">John Honyman</a> started playing female roles for the <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Men_(playing_company)\" title=\"King&#39;s Men (playing company)\">King's Men</a> at the age of 13, in <a href=\"/wiki/1626_in_literature\" title=\"1626 in literature\">1626</a>, in <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_Massinger\" title=\"Philip Massinger\">Philip Massinger</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Roman_Actor\" title=\"The Roman Actor\">The Roman Actor</a></i>. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of <a href=\"/wiki/Lodowick_Carlell\" title=\"Lodowick Carlell\">Lodowick Carlell</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Deserving_Favourite\" title=\"The Deserving Favourite\">The Deserving Favourite</a></i> and Massinger's <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Picture_(Massinger_play)\" title=\"The Picture (Massinger play)\">The Picture</a></i> (both in <a href=\"/wiki/1629_in_literature\" title=\"1629 in literature\">1629</a>). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Thompson_(actor)\" title=\"John Thompson (actor)\">John Thompson</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Sharpe_(actor)\" title=\"Richard Sharpe (actor)\">Richard Sharpe</a>, appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" <a href=\"/wiki/Theophilus_Bird\" title=\"Theophilus Bird\">Theophilus Bird</a> played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.\n</p><p>Audience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform <i><a href=\"/wiki/Othello\" title=\"Othello\">Othello</a></i> at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, \"She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as \"she,\" when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Responses\">Responses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Boy_player&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Responses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many <a href=\"/wiki/Puritan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puritan\">Puritan</a> preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed encouraged homosexual lust.
