In free climbing, a first ascent (FA), or first free ascent (FFA) is the first successful, documented climb of a route or boulder performed without using equipment such as anchors, quickdraws or ropes for aiding progression or resting. In this article, notable first free ascents of hard routes and boulders are listed. Ratings on the hardest climbs tend to be speculative, until other climbers have had a chance to complete the routes and a consensus can be reached on the precise grade. This becomes increasingly difficult as the grade increases, because fewer climbers are capable of repeating the route and passing judgment on its grade. As of November 2017: 9c (5.15d) (unconfirmed): 9b+ (5.15c): 9b (5.15b): 9a+ (5.15a): 9a (5.14d): 8c+ (5.14c): 8c (5.14b): 8b+ (5.14a): 8b (5.13d): 9b (5.15b): 9a+ (5.15a): 9a (5.14d): 9a (5.14d): 8c+ (5.14c): 8c (5.14b): There are few climbers who have free-soled in the 5.14 grade range. This list does not include "highball" boulder ascents because the climbers here did not use any padding or spotters. There is some debate on the blurred line between "highball" bouldering and short free solo climbs.  8c (5.14b): 8b+ (5.14a): Chris Sharma is currently working on an extremely ambitious project that in his opinion may turn out to be harder than 9b+ (5.15c): 9b (5.15b) (unconfirmed): 9a+ (5.15a): 9a (5.14d): 8b (5.13d): 7c+ (5.13a): 9A (V17) (unconfirmed): 8C+ (V16): 8C (V15): 8B+ (V14): 7B+ (V8):
