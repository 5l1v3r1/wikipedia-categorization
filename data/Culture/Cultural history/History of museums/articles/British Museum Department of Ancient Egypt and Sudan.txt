The Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan is a department forming an historic part of the British Museum, housing the world's largest[h] and most comprehensive collection of Egyptian antiquities (with over 100,000  pieces) outside the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.  Egyptian antiquities have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects  from Sir Hans Sloane. After the defeat of the French forces under Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the British army and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed Rosetta Stone, were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed Henry Salt as consul in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the Musée du Louvre. By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund under the efforts of E.A. Wallis Budge. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from Amarna, Bubastis and Deir el-Bahari. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including Flinders Petrie's Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the Oxford University Expedition to Kawa and Faras in Sudan. Active support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including Asyut (1907), Mostagedda and Matmar (1920s), Ashmunein (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as Soba, Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.  In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of Egyptian and Sudanese Prehistory.  These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of Southern Methodist University in Texas, and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the Sahara Desert between 1963 and 1997. Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm (University of Munich) and William Adams (University of Kentucky). The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 mummies and coffins, the largest outside Cairo. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought after exhibits by visitors to the museum. Key highlights of the collections include: Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC – c. 2690 BC) Old Kingdom (2690–2181 BC) Middle Kingdom (2134–1690 BC) New Kingdom (1549–1069 BC) Third Intermediate Period (1069–664 BC) Late Period (664–332 BC) Ptolemaic dynasty (305–30 BC) Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD) Room 64 - Egyptian grave containing a Gebelein predynastic mummy, late predynastic, 3400 BC Room 64 - Fragmentary ceremonial palette known as the Hunters Palette, from the late predynastic period, Naqada III, c. 3250-3100 BC Room 4 – Three black granite statues of the pharaoh Senusret III, c. 1850 BC Room 68 - Part of the el-Amarna hoard, Egypt, c. 1850-1800 BC (18th dynasty) Room 63 - Wooden coffin of pharaoh Nubkheperre Intef of Egypt's 17th dynasty, 1600 BC Room 4 – Three black granite statues of the goddess Sakhmet, c. 1400 BC Room 4 – Colossal statue of Amenhotep III, c. 1370 BC Great Court – Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III, c. 1350 BC Room 61 – The famous false fresco 'Pond in a Garden' from the Tomb of Nebamun, c. 1350 BC Room 4 - Limestone statue of a husband and wife, 1300-1250 BC Room 63 - Gilded outer coffins from the tomb of Henutmehyt, Thebes, Egypt, 19th Dynasty, 1250 BC Book of the Dead of Hunefer, sheet 5, 19th Dynasty, 1250 BC Room 4 - Ancient Egyptian bronze statue of a cat from the Late Period, about 664–332 BC Room 4 - Green siltstone head of a Pharaoh, 26th-30th Dynasty, 600-340 BC Room 4 - Sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibre, 26th dynasty, about 530 BC Great Court - Black siltstone obelisk of King Nectanebo II of Egypt, Thirtieth dynasty, about 350 BC Room 4 – The Rosetta Stone, key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 196 BC Room 62 - Detail from the mummy case of Artemidorus the Younger, a Greek who had settled in Thebes, Egypt, during Roman times, 100-200 AD Coordinates: 51°31′9.62″N 0°7′39.87″W﻿ / ﻿51.5193389°N 0.1277417°W﻿ / 51.5193389; -0.1277417
