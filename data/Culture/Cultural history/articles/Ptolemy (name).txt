The name Ptolemy or Ptolemaeus may refer to: Ptolemy, or Ptolemaeus, or Tolomeo (Italian spelling) may also refer to: According to Georg Autenrieth, the English name Ptolemy    comes from the Ancient Greek name Πτολεμαῖος (Ptolemaios),   "warlike" or "son of war". Autienrieth renders the meaning of the name to be an adjective from πτόλεμος (ptólemos), explained as a Homeric Greek form of πόλεμος (pólemos), "war".   A nephew of Antigonus I Monophthalmus was called Polemaeus,  the normal form of the adjective. Ptolemaios is first attested in Homer's Iliad and is the name of an Achaean warrior, son of Piraeus, father of Eurymedon.  The name Ptolemaios varied over the years from its roots in ancient Greece, appearing in different languages in various forms and spellings. The original form, and some of the variants, are listed here in the languages relevant to the history of the name. The name Ptolemy spread from its Greek origins to enter other languages in Western Asia during the Hellenisation that followed the conquest of the known world by Alexander the Great. The Aramaic name Bar Talmai (Greek Bartolomaios and English Bartholomew) may be related.  Ptolemais is formed from this name by the Greek feminine adjectival ending -i(d)s. The Ptolemaic dynasty, of Macedonian origin, ruled Hellenistic Egypt for nearly 300 years, from 305 BC to 30 BC. The kings of this dynasty were all named Ptolemy.  See Ptolemaic dynasty for details of their reigns and other ruling members of the dynasty. See also: Legacy of Ptolemy I Soter. There were several members of the Ptolemaic dynasty that did not become senior rulers of Egypt. Some of them became rulers of other kingdoms. Many of the dates and other details about these Ptolemies are uncertain. (and, in approx. chronological order)
