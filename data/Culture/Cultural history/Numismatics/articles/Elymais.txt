Elymais or Elamais (Ἐλυμαΐς, Hellenic form of the more ancient name, Elam) was a semi-independent state of the 2nd century BC to the early 3rd century AD, frequently a vassal under Parthian control, and located at the head of the Persian Gulf in the present-day region of Khuzestan, Iran (Susiana).  It is reported that these people were great archers and natives of Susa, which lay to the east of Elymais territory. Most of the Elymais were probably descendants of the ancient Elamites,  who once had control of that area in the past. The provinces of Elymais were Massabatice (later Masabadhan), Corbiane and Gabiane. Nothing is known of their language, even though Elamite was still used by the Achaemenid Empire 250 years before the Elymais came into existence.  A number of Aramaic inscriptions are found in Elymais.  The kingdom of Elymais survived until its extinction by a Sassanid invasion in the early 3rd century AD. It is reported in 2 Maccabees that the priests of the temple of Nanea, which is located in Susa, tricked Antiochus IV Epiphanes and murdered him by throwing rocks on him and dismembering him (2Macc 1:10–17). The coins of Elymais depicted a king; it is not known whether this was a Parthian king or a local ruler, as such information has not come to light. These coins were based on Greek standards of debased Drachms and Tetradrachms. The royal picture is generally based on Parthian coinage, usually with an anchor with a star in crescent figure. The reverse has a figure or bust of Artemis with text around it, an eagle, or often only elongated dots (this has led numismatists to believe that the engravers didn't know Greek or copied from coins whose writing was already unintelligible).
