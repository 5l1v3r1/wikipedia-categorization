The Chase Manhattan Bank Money Museum was a money museum at the Rockefeller Center, New York City from 1928 to 1977. The Museum was located at the Rockefeller Center on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The collection was acquired from Farran Zerbe in 1928, and contained legal tender in a variety of forms, including wampum, ancient and modern coins, and paper money. The museum closed in 1977 and most of the collection (approx. 26,000 objects) was donated to the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution on 16 January 1978. Some of the collection went to the American Numismatic Society, including an 1804 U.S. dollar.  An 1862 $1 Legal Tender note with Serial Number 1 (the first dollar bill issued by the United States) is now in the Chase Bank.   Gene Hessler was the last curator of the museum from 1967 to 1975.
