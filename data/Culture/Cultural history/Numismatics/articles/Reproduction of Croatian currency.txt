The reproduction of Croatian currency is regulated by the Croatian National Bank. The Bank issued an act regarding this matter on February 28, 2002. The decisions most relevant to reproductions of Croatian banknotes are listed in Article 10, titled Reproduction, which states the following: The title of the document is: "Decision regarding handling of banknotes and coins of kuna and lipa unsuitable for usage", but Article 10 seems to refer to all banknotes that the Croatian National Bank has published, not only kuna and lipa. There is no other document regarding reproduction of Croatian currency and there is no specific mention of "unsuitability for usage" in this article. There is no separate document resolving the status of coins so it is to be assumed that the word "banknote" (in original: novƒçanice) includes coins too.
