A Trial plate was a piece of metal used as a standard in the assaying of coins to determine a coin's accuracy and fineness.  Plates made from various metals including copper, silver and gold were used in events such as the Trial of the Pyx as benchmarks of quality.  A contender for the earliest known trial plate dates from 1279 and is held by the Royal Mint Museum in the United Kingdom.
