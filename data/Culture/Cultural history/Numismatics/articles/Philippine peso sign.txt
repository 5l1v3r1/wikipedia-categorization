The symbol resembles a Latin letter P with a double stroke. This insignia of the Philippine peso is native to the Philippines, while the other countries having peso as the main currency use the dollar sign as their symbol. The peso is usually denoted by the symbol "₱". This symbol was added to the Unicode standard in version 3.2 and is assigned U+20B1 (₱). The symbol can be accessed through some word processors by typing in "20b1" and then pressing the Alt and X buttons simultaneously, or by pressing and holding "alt", then pressing "8369" on the keypad.   Other ways of writing the Philippine Peso sign are "PHP", "PhP", "P", or "P" (strike-through or double-strike-through uppercase P), which is still the most common method, although font support for the Unicode Peso sign has been around for some time.
