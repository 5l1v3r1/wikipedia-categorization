The 1946-S copper cent die clash is a rare collectible coin of the United States. This coin exhibits a die clash error in which the obverse image (the portrait of Lincoln) is partially transferred to the reverse die, and thus partially visible on the struck coins. This type of error was quite rare for the 1946-S copper cent: only six specimens are known to exist, so an uncirculated specimen could be valued at several thousand dollars. Two uncirculated coins are listed in private collectors' catalogs, while four circulated specimens are known to exist.
