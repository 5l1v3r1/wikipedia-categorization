He was primarily a <a href=\"/wiki/Mineralogist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mineralogist\">mineralogist</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Metallurgist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Metallurgist\">metallurgist</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Chemist\" title=\"Chemist\">chemist</a>, but also worked as a <a href=\"/wiki/Physician\" title=\"Physician\">physician</a> and was a member of a number of learned societies.  He wrote four books on mineralogy and chemicals.\n</p><p>In 1837, to alleviate the need for small change during the Hard Times, Feuchtwanger created tokens made of argentan (commonly known as <a href=\"/wiki/Nickel_Silver\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nickel Silver\">German Silver</a>), an alloy made of copper, nickel, zinc, tin and trace metals. It was considerably cheaper to produce than the extraction of copper for the government minted half-cents and cents.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Panic_of_1837\" title=\"Panic of 1837\">Hard Times</a>, an especially rough period of economic <a href=\"/wiki/Recession\" title=\"Recession\">recession</a> following the dissolution of the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States\" title=\"Second Bank of the United States\">Second Bank of the United States</a>, was known for massive hoarding of small change. Much of the small change circulating at this time (roughly 1837-1844) was composed of clunky copper half-cents and cents privately produced or various cut and whole silver coins of foreign origin. In fact, it would not be until 1857, that <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Congress\" title=\"United States Congress\">Congress</a> would enact into law that legal currency be coin of <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Mint\" title=\"United States Mint\">United States Mint</a> origin.\n</p><p>In 1837, Feuchtwanger presented his one cent coins to Congress for approval as legal coinage and a cheaper substitute for copper. This was probably the first attempt to circulate \"nickel\" coinage in the United States. Congress denied his request, but Feuchtwanger persisted in his production and circulation. Laws banning private coinage were not passed until 1864.  Between 1837 and 1844 thousands of Feuchtwanger cents came out of his New York City <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmacy\" title=\"Pharmacy\">pharmacy</a>. To the discerning collector over a dozen different die casts have been identified, affecting the relative rarity of each specimen found.\n</p><p>Aside from one cent tokens, in 1864 Feuchtwanger also produced three cent tokens which are considered extremely rare, as few specimens have survived. Feuchtwanger was also noted for producing stamp-like casts featuring his common theme of a pouncing eagle attacking a snake.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feuchtwanger_Cent&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Hard_times_token\" title=\"Hard times token\">Hard times token</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Civil_War_token\" title=\"Civil War token\">Civil War token</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_and_references\">Notes and references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feuchtwanger_Cent&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Notes and references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://coinbooks.org/esylum_v04n15a13.html\">- Article on Lewis Feuchtwanger</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pcgscoinfacts.com/Coin/Detail/20001\">- PCGS Coinfacts Page for Feuchtwanger 1C, followed by pages for other of his strikes.</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.groveminting.com/products.html\">- 2011 Silver Commemorative Feuchtwanger Cent</a> as issued by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.groveminting.com\">Grove Minting Company</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2183\nCached time: 20180919095937\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.016 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 29/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:7070904-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919095937 and revision id 828366456\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Historical_currencies_of_the_United_States"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Exonumia"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Numismatics"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Token_coins"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bavaria"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chemist"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Civil War token"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"F\u00fcrth"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hard times token"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jena"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lewis Feuchtwanger"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Metallurgist"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mineralogist"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New York City"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nickel Silver"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Panic of 1837"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Pharmacy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Physician"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Recession"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Second Bank of the United States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Token coin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Congress"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States Mint"}],"templates":[],"images":["Feuchtwanger_cent.jpg","Feucht_reverse.jpg"],"externallinks":["http://coinbooks.org/esylum_v04n15a13.html","http://www.pcgscoinfacts.com/Coin/Detail/20001","http://www.groveminting.com/products.html","http://www.groveminting.com"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Feuchtwanger_Cent","byteoffset":612,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Feuchtwanger_Cent","byteoffset":2787,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Notes and references","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Feuchtwanger_Cent","byteoffset":2846,"anchor":"Notes_and_references"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Feuchtwanger Cent","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5446013"}]}}
