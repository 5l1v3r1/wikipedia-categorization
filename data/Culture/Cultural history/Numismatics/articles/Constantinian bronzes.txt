The Constantinian bronzes were a series of bronze coins introduced in the Roman Empire in the middle of the 4th century. The specific denominations are unclear and debated by historians and numismatists. They are referred to as AE1, AE2, AE3, and AE4, with the former being the largest (near 27 mm) and the latter the smallest (averaging 15 mm) in diameter: In November 2013, the largest hoard of Constantinian bronze coins was discovered in Devon, England. The Seaton Down Hoard consists of 22,000 coins, mostly Constantinian bronzes.
