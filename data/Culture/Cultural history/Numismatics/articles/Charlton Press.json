September 20, 2013)  It was Jim Charlton's experience as an avid <a href=\"/wiki/Numismatics\" title=\"Numismatics\">numismatist</a> that inspired him to create a catalogue for coin collectors. In 1926, when Jim Charlton was 15, his older brother Harry Charlton gifted him a United States 1863 <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Head_cent\" title=\"Indian Head cent\">Indian Head cent</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-test_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-test-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It was from this initial exposure to coins that Jim Charlton developed an interest in numismatics, frequently visiting coin dealers, and purchasing coins from second-hand stores in <a href=\"/wiki/Toronto\" title=\"Toronto\">Toronto</a>, Ontario, Canada.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>   Charlton continued to cultivate his interest in coins while moving to Northern Ontario for work as an engineer from 1933 to 1948. But, it was his return to Toronto in April 1948 after accepting a position as a Steam Engineer for <i>the Star</i> (now <i><a href=\"/wiki/Toronto_Star\" title=\"Toronto Star\">Toronto Star</a></i>) that allowed him to expand his collection.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  By actively acquiring withdrawn circulation coinage from bank acquisitions, coin auctions, and inventories from coin shops, Charlton's collection grew exponentially.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While continuing his work as chief Steam Engineer at <i>The Star</i>, Charlton ran Canada Coin Exchange, a coin business from his home on a part-time basis during evenings and Saturdays with his wife Mary (nee Tyndall) from 1948 until 1956.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Canada_Coin_Exchange:_The_Early_Years_.281952-1959.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada_Coin_Exchange:_The_Early_Years_(1952-1959)\">Canada Coin Exchange: The Early Years (1952-1959)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charlton_Press&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Canada Coin Exchange: The Early Years (1952-1959)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Charlton had been actively buying and selling coins since 1948 and conducting a number of mail auction sales beginning in 1950. It was during this time that he realized the need for a Canadian catalogue which would provide accurate values of coins. Based on his experience as an auctioneer, he realized that the only catalogue on Canadian coins, one published by <a href=\"/wiki/Wayte_Raymond\" title=\"Wayte Raymond\">Wayte Raymond</a> (<i>Coins and Tokens of Canada, 1947</i>), was outdated. While Raymond's publication listed coinage by dates, mint marks, mintages and values, and was an improvement from its earlier 1937 publication, listed coin values did not correspond to the values received at bid during auction. It was the selling prices of those sales in which Charlton auctioneered that helped to establish the baseline values for the first catalogue.\n</p><p>In 1952, Jim Charlton with the assistance of Fred Bowman and other numismatic students, released the company's first title, the <i>Catalogue of Canadian Coins, Tokens &amp; Fractional Currency, 1st edition</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Allen,_Don_H_2001._P._93_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Allen,_Don_H_2001._P._93-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  A publication at 34 pages, the catalogue filled a void for Canadian coin collectors and featured then current values and listings of Canadian coins. The original catalogue and all catalogues until 1959, were saddle-stitched with various coloured paper covers. Folded sheets were correlated and then stapled through the folded cover crease from the outside. With the exception of 1954, the catalogue was updated yearly until 1959 when the catalogue underwent a major revision.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The growing popularity of numismatics in Canada in the 1950s necessitated Jim Charlton's expansion of his home-based business into a separate retail location. He opened Canada Coin Exchange at 53 Front Street, Toronto, Ontario on August 2, 1956. A few months after opening Front Street, Charlton, his wife, and two employees suffered a botched armed robbery at gunpoint by two Toronto men.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  Due to safety concerns, Charlton then relocated Canada Coin Exchange and consolidated the store, office, and warehouse into one location. His new shop at 80 Richmond Street, Toronto, Ontario was opened on October 31, 1958, and his operations remained there until August 1965.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Whitman_Years_.281960-1969.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Whitman_Years_(1960-1969)\">The Whitman Years (1960-1969)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charlton_Press&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The Whitman Years (1960-1969)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1959, the coin catalogue (8th edition) underwent a major revision not only in terms of its content, but also with regards to the logistics of publication and distribution.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yeoman_and_Bressett\">Yeoman and Bressett</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charlton_Press&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Yeoman and Bressett\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Before the printing of the catalogue's 8th edition, Charlton had been contacted by <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_S._Yeoman\" title=\"Richard S. Yeoman\">Richard S. Yeoman</a> (of Yeoman and <a href=\"/wiki/Kenneth_Bressett\" title=\"Kenneth Bressett\">Bressett</a>) with a proposal for a new expanded edition to the <i>Catalogue of Canadian Coins, Tokens &amp; Fractional Currency</i>. Having the facilities, experience and market potential that Jim Charlton lacked, Yeoman and Bressett became responsible for the printing, sales, and distribution of the catalogues through Whitman's Coin Products Division for the next ten years (1960 \u2013 1969) until the 19th edition. During the \"Whitman Years\", the catalogue was modified to a blue hardcover case bound publication, where individual segments were sewn together, before the spine was flattened, and the hard cover attached.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cross,_William_K_2014_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cross,_William_K_2014-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  The blue cloth-bound soil-resistant hard cover was continued until 1969.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Having Richard Yeoman handle the Charlton catalogue was a fortuitous pairing for the Canadian coin catalogue. Yeoman was an integral part of <a href=\"/wiki/Whitman_Publishing\" title=\"Whitman Publishing\">Whitman Publishing</a>. He had helped to cultivate an extensive sales network for coin related material.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  His experience in compiling definitive coin price guides (the <i>Handbook of United States Coins</i> aka the Blue Book, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Guide_Book_of_United_States_Coins\" title=\"A Guide Book of United States Coins\">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a></i> aka the Red Book) was invaluable in increasing sales and interest in Canadian numismatics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Allen,_Don_H_2001._P._73_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Allen,_Don_H_2001._P._73-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In addition to pairing with Whitman, modifications were also made to the content of the 1960 catalogue. The catalogue itself underwent a formatting modification, with the incorporation of more individual and larger illustrations of coins and <a href=\"/wiki/Token_coin\" title=\"Token coin\">tokens</a>, additional information on coins and bills themselves, reassembling of data, mint statistics and prices on one page, the inclusion of grading standards, the inclusion of die varieties never previously catalogued, and an increase in pages to 128 from its previously 34.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>   The length of the catalogue was limited to no more than 128 pages given the limitations of printing technology.

This resulted in renaming the catalogue from the <i>Catalogue of Canadian Coins, Tokens &amp; Fractional Currency to the Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins, Token &amp; Paper Money</i>.\n</p><p>But the inclusion of paper money in the catalogue was not without its difficulties. Jim Charlton had long desired for his catalogue to reflect the growing interest in paper bills. When he explored the possibility in 1954, he encountered obstacles given that he had not received permission to publish such a catalogue with illustrations of paper money from the <a href=\"/wiki/Bank_of_Canada\" title=\"Bank of Canada\">Bank of Canada</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Department_of_Finance_Canada\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department of Finance Canada\">Department of Finance</a>. Doing so would contravene the <a href=\"/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada)\" title=\"Criminal Code (Canada)\">Criminal Code</a> (section 471(b)551).\n</p><p>At the same time that Charlton was exploring the possibility of incorporating bank note illustrations, James Elliott Jr. was independently working on a paper money catalogue. But, unlike Elliott who published his catalogue without illustrations, Charlton took a risk and published a modest catalogue on Canadian and Newfoundland government paper money with a 1955 issue date using reduced size note face illustrations. Charlton was hopeful that no action would be taken against him by the <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_Canada\" title=\"Government of Canada\">Government of Canada</a>. Years prior in 1947, the Department of Finance had not instigated legal proceedings against W.H. Kernohan of Forest, Ontario who had released educational material in the form of a chart featuring banknote illustrations. As Jim Charlton stated about Kernohan, \"So, I figured to myself, 'if he can do that, I think I've got a good case if they decide to come after me.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Nonetheless, fearing seizure of the printed matter, Charlton kept the majority of the publications in the basement of his brother's residence in Mississauga, Ontario.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>  Luckily, no such seizure occurred and in fact, the Central Bank ordered a copy of the catalogue. It was soon thereafter that Elliott released a second catalogue with full illustrations of paper bills, using fronts and backs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The new format and content was well received in a book review printed in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Numismatist\" title=\"The Numismatist\">The Numismatist</a>'</i>s December 1959 issue. Hailed as a \"milestone in Canadian numismatics,\" Charlton's catalogue was recommended for \"the shelf of any collector interested in Canadian numismatics, or wishing to appreciate the place of these important series in the world picture.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coin_Guide\">Coin Guide</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charlton_Press&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Coin Guide\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1961, Canada Coin Exchange published <i>The Charlton Coin Guide</i>, the definitive guidebook on determining the worth and value of a coin.  For those interested in coin accumulation evaluation, the <i>Coin Guide</i> contained not only buying prices for coins of Canada and Newfoundland, but also for Canadian Paper Money from 1935 Bank of Canada issues up to present times, Canadian colonial tokens, war medals and decorations, United States coinage and common gold coins of the world.

Between 1965 and 1967, the coin business hit a <a href=\"/wiki/Recession\" title=\"Recession\">recession</a> in Canada. Proof like sets had peaked and new issues were flooding the market, saturating it. As a consequence, there was a significant price decrease in the market for coins and more dealers were turning to precious metals. Jim Charlton felt that reflecting this downturn in his catalogue was not warranted, whereas Whitman was adamant that values listed in the Canadian catalogue should account for the market's price decrease.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cross,_William_K_2014_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cross,_William_K_2014-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>   Unable to reach a compromise, Jim Charlton once again resumed full publishing of <i>Canadian Coins, Tokens and Paper Money</i>.\n</p><p>With the demands of the coin business taking his free time from his wife Mary and son Jimmy, Jim Charlton left <i>The Star</i> after 13 years of employment in 1961.

Thus, with input from dealers who precipitated the change, the coin catalogue was not only modified to incorporate the value association with a coin's condition, but also incorporated more Canadian and Newfoundland bank paper issues. The total page number of the catalogue was increased to 200.\n</p><p>When Jim Charlton was editor of the catalogue, it was his common practise to walk around Toronto, asking dealers about the prices they were paying for coins.

After pitching to companies on the marvels of elastomer, Cross would often visit coin shops in the area during his spare time before heading home, particularly in Ottawa. While employed full time at DuPont, Cross bought and sold coins on the side as a part time dealer.\n</p><p>It was his mother who first initiated his interest in coins, having always set aside coins from a young age.

Due to the downdraft and decreasing value and interest in coins that occurred with the coin recession in the mid-1960s, the Red Cent Coin Company shifted its focus to bullion products, buying gold and silver, and bullion gold numismatics wholesale from 1966 to 1972.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>  While the Red Cent Coin Company no longer had a brick and mortar store, they did have offices located on Adelaide Street in 1966, which they shared with Cale Jarvis, the publisher of Canadian Coin News.

We used to buy sovereigns for example, out of London, England which didn't require export permits, and bring them back to Toronto with the intention of selling them to the United States.

In fact, Cross had always wanted to own the book end of Charlton, admiring what was considered to be the bible for Canadian numismatics. His passion for the hobby eventually led to Cross founding and becoming acting President of the Canadian Association of Numismatic Dealers (1976-1980), and purchasing Torex (Canada's most popular coin and paper money show) from 1976 to 1984. In November 1986, Bill Cross, along with Brian Cornwell, and Ingrid K. Smith founded the <a href=\"/wiki/International_Coin_Certification_Service\" title=\"International Coin Certification Service\">International Coin Certification Service</a> (I.C.C.S), a third party coin grading service that evaluates coins, their authenticity, their grade, and ultimately their worth. Cross sold his share in I.C.C.S in 2009. Cross was also honorary chair of the  <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Numismatic_Association\" title=\"Royal Canadian Numismatic Association\">Royal Canadian Numismatic Association</a> (RCNA) at the World's Fair of Money in 2014, and recipient of the J.

(the largest coin company in Canada in the 1970s), but also Charlton International Publishing Inc., as well as an auction room, all under one roof.\n</p><p>At the same time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Cross continued operating the Red Cent Coin Company, with eventual plans to gradually phase out that aspect of the business.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Red Cent Coin Company was eventually consolidated with Charlton International Publishing in 1979 to become Charlton International, which handled both the publishing and supply end of Cross' business. At the time, Charlton Numismatics was one of the leading coin companies in Canada, as well as buying and selling jewellery and other collectables. As Cross explains, Charlton Numismatics was the first to offer jewellery gold chains by weight. Cross would import the chains from Italy and sell to the public by the gram. So popular was his service that during the Christmas season, Charlton Numismatics would often sell a profitable sum in gold chain alone.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cross,_William_K_2014_9-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cross,_William_K_2014-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With Cross at the helm, and Charlton assuming an editorial position with the catalogues, the catalogue increased in size from 200 pages to 341 pages between the years of 1971 and 1978.

While Merchant Scrip had been covered in the coin catalogue in a 47 page section, the values found therein were out of date.

Beginning in 1868, D.T. Batty began cataloguing English and Colonial copper coinage, authoring four volumes spanning over 1300 pages. Over 27 years starting from 1868, Batty sold by subscription parts of his publication, all except the final volume listing Colonial Copper Coinage, due to his death.

As he explains, a man had walked into Charlton Numismatics with a list of a couple hundred Royal Doulton figurines, which Cross purchased. As part of the purchase agreement, a helper from Charlton Numismatics picked up the figurines from the man's home, while also agreeing to drop off a trunk that was to be shipped to Vancouver. The transaction went smoothly, with the Royal Doulton figurines picked up, inventoried and itemized, while the trunk was dropped off at Toronto's Union station. After the trunk arrived in Vancouver, it was not claimed and when curious employees opened the trunk days later, they found the man's dead wife inside. The police came to Charlton Numismatics and seized all of the Royal Doulton figurines as they were needed as evidence in the court case.
