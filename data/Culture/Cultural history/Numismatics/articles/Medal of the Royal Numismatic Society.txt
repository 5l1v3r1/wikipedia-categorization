The Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society was first awarded in 1883. It is awarded by the Royal Numismatic Society and is one of the highest markers of recognition given to numismatists. The President and Council award the Medal annually to an "individual highly distinguished for services to Numismatic Science".  In recent years the Medallist has been invited to receive the medal in person and to give a lecture, usually at the Society's December Meeting. Sir John Evans gave the dies for the original silver medal to the Society in 1883. The current medal was commissioned from Ian Rank-Broadley in 1993 and is a cast silver medal with the classical theme of Heracles and the Nemean lion.  Recipients of the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society and their lecture titles (where available) are given below.  Further details about the individual medallists and their contributions to the field of numismatics can be found in the Numismatic Chronicle.
