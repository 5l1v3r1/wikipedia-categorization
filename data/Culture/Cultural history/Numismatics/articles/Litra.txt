A litra (plural: litrae; Ancient Greek: λίτρα) is a small silver coin (or unit of measurement for other precious metals) used in the colonies of Ancient Greece in general and in ancient Sicily in particular. As a coin, the litra was similar in value to the obol  and weighed one-third of a Roman libra, i.e. 109.15 g (3.850 oz).  In silver, the coin weighed 0.87 g (0.031 oz) and was equal to one-fifth of a drachma.  In the 3rd-century apocryphal New Testament text known as the Acts of Thomas, Jesus sells Thomas to an Indian merchant "for three litrae of silver unstamped".  In the Talmud, the litra is a unit of measurement, the equivalent of 60 shekels, weighing 354 g (12.5 oz).   Media related to Litra at Wikimedia Commons
