The South-West African mark was a temporary currency issued between 1916 after the withdrawal of the German South-West African mark, and prior to the introduction of the South African pound in 1918. A number of notes were denominated in South West African marks and pfennig, especially by the Swakopmund Bookshop that issued 10, 25, 50 Pfennig, and 1, 2, and 3 mark notes.
