The Currency Act 1982 (c 3) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Following Decimal Day in 1971, when the British monetary system changed from pound/shilling/penny to the metric Â£1 = 100p system, the new currency was known as the "new pound" and therefore the "new pence". By 1982, the use of "new pence" was out of use, and replaced with "penny". The Act sanctions the use of "penny" rather than "new penny" in common usage, such as on coins produced by the Royal Mint . The Act covers England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is still in force unamended.
