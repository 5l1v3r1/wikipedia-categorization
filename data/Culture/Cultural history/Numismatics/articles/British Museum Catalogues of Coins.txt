The British Museum Catalogues of Coins was a series envisioned and initiated by Reginald Stuart Poole, Keeper of the Department of Coins and Medals, at the British Museum, between 1870 and 1893. The aim was to produce a scholarly series of catalogues of the collection, based on the British Museum's collection and other collections. The series continued after his retirement, and continues to this day, with the collection increasingly being made available online.  The series editor was Reginald Stuart Poole, and the authors/editors were Percy Gardner, Barclay Vincent Head, and Warwick Wroth. This series was prepared by Harold Mattingley, R.A.G. Carson, and P.V. Hill. These catalogues were prepared by Stanley Lane Poole, and edited by Reginald Stuart Poole. These catalogues were compiled by Stanley Lane Poole, Percy Gardner, E. J. Rapson and John Allan, and the series was edited by Reginald Stuart Poole. This is a joint publication series with the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, authored/edited by Andrew Burnett, Michel Amandry, Pere Pau Ripolles, Ian Carradice and M. Spoerri Butcher.
