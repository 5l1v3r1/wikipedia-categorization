The Sylloge of the Coins of the British Isles (SCBI) is an ongoing project to publish all major museum collections and certain important private collections of British coins.  Catalogues in the series contain full details and illustrations of each and every specimen.  Every Anglo-Saxon and Norman coin included in the project can be viewed on the SCBI Database, based at the Department of Coins and Medals, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. The project was first suggested in the early 1950s by Christopher Blunt and other members of the British and Royal Numismatic Societies.  In 1956, its unofficial committee secured recognition as a committee of the British Academy through the good offices of its first chairman, Sir Frank Stenton.  The first volume, on Anglo-Saxon Coins in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (prepared by Philip Grierson), was published two years later in 1958. Since that date over sixty additional volumes have been published, covering both museum and some significant private collections in Britain,  the United States, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Latvia and more.  Further volumes are in preparation or projected for the future.  The key gaps in the series remain the British Museum and the Royal Coin Collection in Stockholm.  Both of which present massive undertakings and have only recently begun to be tackled comprehensively.  Some of the early volumes, such as that covering the Cambridge collection, are also now in need of substantial updating.  Nonetheless, British numismatics has been extremely well served by the project, and it continues to publish volumes almost every year. Since its inception, the policy of the Sylloge Project has been to keep an eminent Anglo-Saxon historian as its chairman.  This reflects the emphasis on Anglo-Saxon material in the published volumes, and the need to keep an educated outside perspective on the project.  Chairmen have included: General Editors of the project have included: Other current members of the Sylloge Committee are: Current volumes of the Sylloge are: Ancient British and Anglo-Saxon Coins.
