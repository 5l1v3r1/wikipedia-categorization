A coin capsule is a type of plastic capsule designed to prevent coins from becoming damage by protecting it from outside contaminants while allowing the coin to be viewed through transparent plastic. Coin capsules are commonly used by coin collectors, numismatists or coin grading services to store and keep coins safe.  The varied nature of coin sizes has led to a wide range of differently sized capsules becoming available each offer different levels or protection or security.  Some types of capsules are designed with the ability to be reopened while others, once closed cannot be reopened without damaging the capsule.
