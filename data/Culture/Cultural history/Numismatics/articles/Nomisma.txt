Nomisma (Greek: νόμισμα) was the ancient Greek word for "money" and is derived from nomos (νόμος) "anything assigned, a usage, custom, law, ordinance".  In modern Greek, the word nomisma means "currency".  It is also a term used by numismatists when  referring to the pieces of money or coin in the plural nomismata an example of which is the Aes rude of Numa Pompilius (the 2nd King of Rome).   The term nomos may also refer to an approximately 8 gram Achaean coin denomination.
