More generally, it is any crime situation where\u2014again, to all appearances\u2014someone <i>must</i> have entered or left the scene of the crime, yet it was <i>not</i> possible for anyone to have done so.  (For example, one such Agatha Christie mystery (<i><a href=\"/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None\" title=\"And Then There Were None\">And Then There Were None</a></i>) takes place on a small island during a storm; another on a train stalled in the mountains and surrounded by new-fallen, unmarked snow.) One of the most famous locked room mysteries was <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hollow_Man_(1935_novel)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Hollow Man (1935 novel)\">The Hollow Man</a></i>. The resolution of such a story might involve showing how the room was <i>not</i> really \"locked\"; or that it was not necessary for anyone else to have come or gone; that the murderer is still hiding in the room; or that the person to \"discover\" the murder when the room was unlocked in fact committed it just then.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sherlock_Holmes_and_Dr._Watson_mysteries\">Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson mysteries</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_crime_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson mysteries\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1887, Scotsman Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle\" title=\"Arthur Conan Doyle\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> (1859\u20131930) gave fresh impetus to the emerging form of the detective story by creating <a href=\"/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes\" title=\"Sherlock Holmes\">Sherlock Holmes</a>, resident at 221B Baker Street, <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>\u2014probably the most famous of fictional detectives and the first one to have clients, to be hired to solve a case.

Conan Doyle also introduced <a href=\"/wiki/Dr._Watson\" title=\"Dr. Watson\">Dr. John H. Watson</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Physician\" title=\"Physician\">physician</a> who acts as Holmes's assistant and who also shares Holmes's flat in Baker Street with him.

[...] From the writer's point of view, Conan Doyle knew the importance of having someone to whom the detective can make enigmatic remarks, a consciousness that's privy to facts in the case without being in on the conclusions drawn from them until the proper time. Any character who performs these functions in a mystery story has come to be known as a \"Watson\".\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many of the great fictional detectives have their Watson: <a href=\"/wiki/Agatha_Christie\" title=\"Agatha Christie\">Agatha Christie</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Hercule_Poirot\" title=\"Hercule Poirot\">Hercule Poirot</a>, for example, is often accompanied by Captain Arthur Hastings.

Generally, it does include a murder mystery. However, the atmosphere created by hard-boiled writers and the settings they chose for their novels are different from English country-house murders or mysteries surrounding rich old ladies elegantly bumped off on a cruise ship, with a detective happening to be on board. Ian Ousby writes,\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Hard-boiled fiction would have happened anyway, even if Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers [...] had not written the way they did or Knox had not formulated his rules. The impetus came from the conditions of American life and the opportunities available to the American writer in the 1920s. The economic boom following the First World War combined with the introduction of <a href=\"/wiki/Prohibition\" title=\"Prohibition\">Prohibition</a> in 1920 to encourage the rise of the gangster. The familiar issues of law and lawlessness in a society determined to judge itself by the most ideal standards took on a new urgency. At the same time, the <a href=\"/wiki/Pulp_magazine\" title=\"Pulp magazine\">pulp magazines</a> were already exploiting a ready market for adventure stories&#8212;what Ronald Knox would have called \"shockers\"&#8212;which made heroes of cowboys, soldiers, explorers and masked avengers. It took no great leap of imagination for them to tackle modern crime and detection, fresh from the newspaper headlines of the day, and create heroes with the same vigour [...].\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another author who enjoyed writing about the sleazy side of life in the U.S.A. is <a href=\"/wiki/Jonathan_Latimer\" title=\"Jonathan Latimer\">Jonathan Latimer</a>. In his novel <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Solomon%27s_Vineyard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Solomon&#39;s Vineyard (page does not exist)\">Solomon's Vineyard</a></i> (1941), private eye Karl Craven aims to rescue a young heiress from the clutches of a weird cult. Apart from being an action-packed thriller, the novel contains open references to the detective's sex drive and allusions to, and a brief description of, kinky sexual practices. The novel was considered \"too hot\" for Latimer's American publishers and was not published until 1950 in a heavily <a href=\"/wiki/Bowdlerize\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bowdlerize\">Bowdlerized</a> version. The unexpurgated novel came out in Britain during the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second World War\">Second World War</a>.\n</p><p>The hardboiled phenomenon appeared slightly earlier than the <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction\" title=\"Golden Age of Science Fiction\">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a>. \"Apparently something just before the War [World War II] acted to create pulp writers who were willing to break out of the post-World War I shell of neverland cliches which persisted in the pulps until the middle of the 1930s\", <a href=\"/wiki/Algis_Budrys\" title=\"Algis Budrys\">Algis Budrys</a> said in 1965.

Starting with writers like <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Iles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Francis Iles\">Francis Iles</a>, who has been described as \"the father of the <a href=\"/wiki/Psychological_suspense_novel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Psychological suspense novel\">psychological suspense novel</a> as we know it today,\" more and more authors laid the emphasis on character rather than plot. Up to the present, lots of authors have tried their hand at writing novels where the identity of the criminal is known to the reader right from the start. The suspense is created by the author having the reader share the perpetrator's thoughts\u2014up to a point, that is\u2014and having them guess what is going to happen next (for example, another murder, or a potential victim making a fatal mistake), and if the criminal will be brought to justice in the end. For example, <a href=\"/wiki/Simon_Brett\" title=\"Simon Brett\">Simon Brett</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Shock_to_the_System_(1990_film)\" title=\"A Shock to the System (1990 film)\">A Shock to the System</a></i> (1984) and <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Dobyns\" title=\"Stephen Dobyns\">Stephen Dobyns</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/Boy_in_the_Water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Boy in the Water\">Boy in the Water</a></i> (1999) both reveal the murderer's identity quite early in the narrative. <i>A Shock to the System</i> is about a hitherto law-abiding business manager's revenge which is triggered by his being passed over for promotion, and the intricate plan he thinks up to get back at his rivals. <i>Boy in the Water</i> is the psychological study of a man who, severely abused as a child, is trying to get back at the world at large now that he has the physical and mental abilities to do so. As a consequence of his childhood <a href=\"/wiki/Psychological_trauma\" title=\"Psychological trauma\">trauma</a>, the killer randomly picks out his victims, first terrifying them and eventually murdering them. But <i>Boy in the Water</i> also traces the mental states of a group of people who happen to get in touch with the lunatic, and their reactions to him.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crime_fiction_in_specific_themes\">Crime fiction in specific themes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_crime_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Crime fiction in specific themes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Apart from the emergence of the psychological thriller and the continuation of older traditions such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Whodunnit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Whodunnit\">whodunnit</a> and the private eye novel, several new trends can be recognised. One of the first masters of the <a href=\"/wiki/Spy_novel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spy novel\">spy novel</a> was <a href=\"/wiki/Eric_Ambler\" title=\"Eric Ambler\">Eric Ambler</a>, whose unsuspecting and innocent protagonists are often caught in a network of <a href=\"/wiki/Espionage\" title=\"Espionage\">espionage</a>, betrayal and violence and whose only wish is to get home safely as soon as possible. Spy thrillers continue to fascinate readers even if the <a href=\"/wiki/Cold_War\" title=\"Cold War\">Cold War</a> period is over now. Another development is the courtroom novel which, as opposed to courtroom drama, also includes many scenes which are not set in the courtroom itself but which basically revolves around the <a href=\"/wiki/Trial_(law)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trial (law)\">trial</a> of the protagonist, who claims to be innocent but cannot (yet) prove it. Quite a number of U.S. lawyers have given up their jobs and started writing novels full-time, among them <a href=\"/wiki/Scott_Turow\" title=\"Scott Turow\">Scott Turow</a>, who began his career with the publication of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Presumed_Innocent_(novel)\" title=\"Presumed Innocent (novel)\">Presumed Innocent</a></i> (1987) (the phrase in the title having been taken from the age-old legal principle that any defendant must be considered as not guilty until s/he is finally convicted). But there are also authors who specialise in historical mysteries\u2014novels which are set in the days of the Roman Empire, in medieval England, the United States of the 1930s and 40s, or whenever (see <a href=\"/wiki/Historical_whodunnit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Historical whodunnit\">historical whodunnit</a>) -- and even in mysteries set in the future. Remarkable examples can be found in any number of <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_K._Dick\" title=\"Philip K. Dick\">Philip K. Dick</a>'s stories or novels.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"LGBT_crime_fiction\">LGBT crime fiction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_crime_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: LGBT crime fiction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/LGBT\" title=\"LGBT\">LGBT</a> has also left its mark on the genre of crime fiction. Numerous private eyes\u2014professionals as well as amateurs\u2014are now women, some of them <a href=\"/wiki/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">lesbians</a>. Tally McGinnis, for example, is the young gay heroine of a series of novels by U.S. author <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nancy_Sanra&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Nancy Sanra (page does not exist)\">Nancy Sanra</a> (born 1944). Sanra's Tally McGinnis mysteries, such as <i>No Escape</i> (1998), which is set in <a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco\" title=\"San Francisco\">San Francisco</a>, are quite traditional in other respects. In Britain, Scottish-born <a href=\"/wiki/Val_McDermid\" title=\"Val McDermid\">Val McDermid</a> created lesbian journalist-cum-sleuth Lindsay Gordon, and <a href=\"/wiki/Joan_Smith_(novelist_and_journalist)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joan Smith (novelist and journalist)\">Joan Smith</a> (born 1953) has gained popularity as the author of a series of Loretta Lawson novels. Lawson is a university teacher and an amateur sleuth.  In <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Full_Stop_(novel)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Full Stop (novel) (page does not exist)\">Full Stop</a></i> (1995), she stops over at <a href=\"/wiki/New_York,_New_York\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New York, New York\">New York</a> and is quickly devoured by the city.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Police_investigation_themes\">Police investigation themes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_crime_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Police investigation themes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By far the richest field of activity though has been the police novel. U.S. (male) writer <a href=\"/wiki/Hillary_Waugh\" title=\"Hillary Waugh\">Hillary Waugh</a>'s (1920\u20132008) <a href=\"/wiki/Police_procedural\" title=\"Police procedural\">police procedural</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Last_Seen_Wearing_..._(Hillary_Waugh_novel)\" title=\"Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)\">Last Seen Wearing ...</a></i> (1952) is an early example of this type of crime fiction. As opposed to hard-boiled crime writing, which is set in the mean streets of a big city, <i>Last Seen Wearing ...</i> carefully and minutely chronicles the work of the police, including all the boring but necessary legwork, in a small American college town where, in the dead of winter, an attractive student disappears. In contrast to armchair detectives such as Dr. Gideon Fell or Hercule Poirot, Chief of Police Frank W. Ford and his men never hold back information from the reader. By way of elimination, they exclude all the suspects who could not possibly have committed the crime and eventually arrive at the correct conclusion, a solution which comes as a surprise to most of them but which, due to their painstaking research, is infallible. The novel certainly is a whodunnit, but all the conventions of the cosy British variety are abandoned. A lot of reasoning has to be done by the police though, including the careful examination and re-examination of all the evidence available. Waugh's police novel lacks \"action\" in the form of dangerous situations from which the characters can only make a narrow escape, but the book is nonetheless a page-turner of a novel, with all the suspense for the readers created through their being able to witness each and every step the police take in order to solve the crime.\n</p><p>Another example is American writer <a href=\"/wiki/Faye_Kellerman\" title=\"Faye Kellerman\">Faye Kellerman</a> (born 1952), who wrote a series of novels featuring Peter Decker and his daughter by his first marriage, Cindy, who both work for the <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Los Angeles, California\">Los Angeles</a> Police Department. Local colour is provided by the author, especially through Peter Decker's <a href=\"/wiki/Jew\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jew\">Jewish</a> background. In <i><a href=\"/wiki/Stalker_(novel)\" title=\"Stalker (novel)\">Stalker</a></i> (2000), 25-year-old Cindy herself becomes the victim of a <a href=\"/wiki/Stalking\" title=\"Stalking\">stalker</a>, who repeatedly frightens her and also tries to do her <a href=\"/wiki/Bodily_harm\" title=\"Bodily harm\">bodily harm</a>. Apart from her personal predicament, Cindy is assigned to clear up a series of murders that have been committed in the Los Angeles area. Again, the work of the police is chronicled in detail, but it would not be fiction if outrageous things did not intervene.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_crime_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFPinault1992\" class=\"citation\">Pinault, David (1992), <i>Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights</i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Brill_Publishers\" title=\"Brill Publishers\">Brill Publishers</a>, pp.&#160;86\u201391, <a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/90-04-09530-6\" title=\"Special:BookSources/90-04-09530-6\">90-04-09530-6</a></cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=Story-Telling+Techniques+in+the+Arabian+Nights&amp;rft.pages=86-91&amp;rft.pub=Brill+Publishers&amp;rft.date=1992&amp;rft.isbn=90-04-09530-6&amp;rft.aulast=Pinault&amp;rft.aufirst=David&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AHistory+of+crime+fiction\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Sova, Dawn B. <i>Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z</i>.
