Marchande de modes was a French Guild organisation for women fashion merchants or milliners, normally meaning ornaments for headdresses, hats and dresses, within the city of Paris, active from August 1776 until 1791. It played a dominating role within the commercial life and fashion industry of France during the last decades prior to the French Revolution. One of the most famous members was Rose Bertin.
