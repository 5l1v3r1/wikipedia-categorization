The Association for Women with Large Feet was a British organisation founded by Airton resident Mrs Phyllis Crone in 1949. It lobbied for clothing manufacturers to better provide for tall women.  Members had to be at least 5 feet 8 inches tall.  The group was originally formed to convince footwear manufacturers to provide more attractive options for women with larger shoe sizes, however it expanded to lobby clothing manufacturers more generally to provide for tall women, with some success.  The Association made direct approaches to manufacturers, and if they agreed to provide for tall women, their details were circulated to all members.  The group changed its name to The Association of Tall Women in October 1951  with the aim of increasing its appeal and membership. There were reportedly 10 branches across the UK by this point, with members joining at a rate of around 50 per week. Membership fees were 3 shillings and 6 pence (3s 6d) per year.  By 1952 the group was reported as having 2000 members in London alone.  As part of their campaign, in 1952 a London department store held a public display of clothing for taller women.  Successes included convincing stocking manufacturers to produce nylons with longer foot and leg measurements "ending a nightmare for taller women"   and the establishment of a London shop called "Tall Girls".
