Mad Carpentier was created in January 1940 by Mad Maltezos and Suzie Carpentier right after Madeleine Vionnet, their former employer, closed in 1939. They stayed open during World War II and were very popular in the 1940s.  In fashion history and for lots of clients, Mad Carpentier represented a continuation of Vionnet's bias cut and elegance. In the late 1940s, Mad Carpentier was celebrated for the evening dresses and its remarkable and popular coats in 1940s and 1950s  breaking with the Vionnet tradition.
