Capri pants (also known as three quarter pants, capris, crop pants, clam-diggers,  flood pants, jams, highwaters, or toreador pants ) are pants that are longer than shorts but are not as long as trousers. They typically come down to between knee and calf or ankle length. Capris are popular with people in many countries; especially in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Asia.  Capri pants were introduced by fashion designer Sonja de Lennart in 1948, and were also popularised by English couturier Bunny Roger . The name of the pants is derived from the Italian isle of Capri, where they rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early '60s.  The American actress Audrey Hepburn was among the first movie stars who wore capris, most notably in the film Roman Holiday, and the pants quickly became synonymous with her classic style. Capris' acceptance in the United States was influenced by the 1960s television series The Dick Van Dyke Show. The character Laura Petrie, the young housewife played by Mary Tyler Moore, caused a fashion sensation – and some mild controversy – by wearing snug-fitting capri pants during the show's run.  By the mid 1960s, capri-style tight-fitting cargo pants became popular among teenage boys; a good example was the superstar teen actor of that era, Luke Halpin, who wore them in some episodes of the popular Flipper.  After a drop in popularity during the 1970s through the 1990s, capris returned to favor in the mid 2000s.  Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal wore capri pants in the majority of his matches before 2009.  Notes
