The Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling is the Academy Award given to the best achievement in makeup and hairstyling for film. Usually, only three films are nominated each year rather than five as in most categories. The exception is in the early 1980s as well as 2002, when there were only two nominees; and in 1999, when there were four nominees. The competitive category was created in 1981 as the Academy Award for Best Makeup, after the Academy received complaints that the make-up work in The Elephant Man (1980) was not going to be honored. Although no award was given to The Elephant Man, an entire category dedicated to honoring make-up effects in film was created for subsequent ceremonies. Previously, make-up artists were only eligible for special achievement awards for their work. This is one of the categories with different stages of nominating. A shortlist of titles is chosen by the makeup branch's executive committee and clips are screened by the members of the branch at an annual "bake-off" where nominees are determined. After only two films were shortlisted in 2002, rules were installed requiring that seven finalists be chosen each year. In 2012, the category was given its current name for use in the 85th Academy Awards and onward.   Makeup artist Rick Baker holds the record for both most wins and most nominations for this award. Before 1981, Special Achievement Oscars were twice awarded to makeup artists for their work on a specific film: Starting in 1993, the award is to be shared with hairstylists if hair effects "contribute greatly to the appearance and effect of the characters".  In the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Films in dark blue background have received a Special/Honorary Award; those in yellow background have won a regular Academy Award of Merit.
