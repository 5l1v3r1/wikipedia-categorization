Mucuchí (Mokochi) is a suspected Timotean language of Venezuela. Mirripú (Maripú) was a dialect. Most classifications place them as dialects of Timote, with Cuica being a separate language, but the data in Loukotka indicates that Timote and Cuica were one language, and Mucuchí–Marripú another; this is reflected in Campbell & Grondona (2012).
