The Paleo-Corsican language is an ancient extinct language spoken in Corsica and presumably in the northeastern part of Sardinia (Gallura) by the local Corsican populations during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The scanty evidence of this ancient language, which comes mainly from toponymy, would indicate a type of Pre-Indo-European language, or according to other Indo-European, with Ligurian and Iberian affinity.  Antoine Peretti ranks as Ligurian the suffixes -asco, -elo / ello, -ate / ati, -inco, present in different Corsican names.
