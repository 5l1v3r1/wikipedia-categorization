Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating <a href=\"/wiki/Stereophonic_sound\" title=\"Stereophonic sound\">stereophonic sound</a> (using <a href=\"/wiki/Telephone\" title=\"Telephone\">telephone</a> technology) was demonstrated by <a href=\"/wiki/Cl%C3%A9ment_Ader\" title=\"Cl\u00e9ment Ader\">Cl\u00e9ment Ader</a> in Paris in 1881. The <a href=\"/wiki/Pallophotophone\" title=\"Pallophotophone\">pallophotophone</a>, invented by <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_A._Hoxie\" title=\"Charles A. Hoxie\">Charles A. Hoxie</a> and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35&#160;mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later <a href=\"/wiki/Audio_mixing\" title=\"Audio mixing\">mixdown</a> or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British <a href=\"/wiki/EMI\" title=\"EMI\">EMI</a> engineer <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Blumlein\" title=\"Alan Blumlein\">Alan Blumlein</a> patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and <a href=\"/wiki/Surround_sound\" title=\"Surround sound\">surround sound</a> on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of <a href=\"/wiki/Stereo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stereo\">stereo</a> tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.\n</p><p>The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the <a href=\"/wiki/Ampex\" title=\"Ampex\">Ampex</a> corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, utilizing its \"Sel-Sync\" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician <a href=\"/wiki/Les_Paul\" title=\"Les Paul\">Les Paul</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-snyder_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-snyder-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the <a href=\"/wiki/Average_Indexed_Monthly_Earnings#Indexing_yearly_income\" title=\"Average Indexed Monthly Earnings\">US average yearly income</a> in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM <a href=\"/wiki/Portastudio\" title=\"Portastudio\">Portastudio</a>, which used the inexpensive <a href=\"/wiki/Compact_audio_cassette\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Compact audio cassette\">compact audio cassette</a> as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as <a href=\"/wiki/Pro_Tools\" title=\"Pro Tools\">Pro Tools</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cubase\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cubase\">Cubase</a> were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like <a href=\"/wiki/GarageBand\" title=\"GarageBand\">GarageBand</a> were being included as a standard feature on home computers.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_(RCA_Studio_B).jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_%28RCA_Studio_B%29.jpg/220px-Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_%28RCA_Studio_B%29.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_%28RCA_Studio_B%29.jpg/330px-Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_%28RCA_Studio_B%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_%28RCA_Studio_B%29.jpg/440px-Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_%28RCA_Studio_B%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1280\" data-file-height=\"853\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ampex_440_%26_MM1000_(RCA_Studio_B).jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>AMPEX 440 (two track, four track) and 16-track MM1000</div></div></div>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Overview\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Overview</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Ampex&#39;s_original_8-track_recorder\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Ampex's original 8-track recorder</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Multi-channel_recorders\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Multi-channel recorders</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Other_early_multi-track_recorders\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other early multi-track recorders</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Impact_on_popular_music\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Impact on popular music</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Large_format_analog_recorders\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Large format analog recorders</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Home_systems\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Home systems</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Digital_multitracking\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Digital multitracking</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Computer-based_recording\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Computer-based recording</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_multitrack_recording&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Overview\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the <a href=\"/wiki/AEG\" title=\"AEG\">AEG</a> corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer <a href=\"/wiki/John_T._Mullin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John T. Mullin\">John T. Mullin</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Ampex\" title=\"Ampex\">Ampex</a> corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity (\"HiFi\") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz  recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.\n</p><p>Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician <a href=\"/wiki/Les_Paul\" title=\"Les Paul\">Les Paul</a>, who lent his name to Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Ford\" title=\"Mary Ford\">Mary Ford</a>. But it was <a href=\"/wiki/Patti_Page\" title=\"Patti Page\">Patti Page</a> who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called <a href=\"/wiki/Confess_(song)\" title=\"Confess (song)\">'Confess'</a>, in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before <a href=\"/wiki/Les_Paul\" title=\"Les Paul\">Les Paul</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Ford\" title=\"Mary Ford\">Mary Ford</a> had their first multi-voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously \u2014 that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded <a href=\"/wiki/Conversations_with_Myself_(album)\" title=\"Conversations with Myself (album)\">Conversations with Myself</a>, an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations.\n</p><p>Despite <a href=\"/wiki/Ampex\" title=\"Ampex\">Ampex</a> having created the first 8-track tape machines for <a href=\"/wiki/Les_Paul\" title=\"Les Paul\">Les Paul</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Atlantic_Records\" title=\"Atlantic Records\">Atlantic Records</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings \u2014 including many of <a href=\"/wiki/Phil_Spector\" title=\"Phil Spector\">Phil Spector</a>'s so-called \"Wall of Sound\" productions and early <a href=\"/wiki/Motown\" title=\"Motown\">Motown</a> hits \u2014 were taped on 3-track recorders.\n</p><p>The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"The Beatles\">The Beatles</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones\" title=\"The Rolling Stones\">The Rolling Stones</a> were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's <a href=\"/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios\" title=\"Abbey Road Studios\">Abbey Road Studios</a> became particularly adept at the technique called \"reduction mixes\" in the UK and \"bouncing down\" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.\n</p><p>By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders - which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios - enabled <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Wilson\" title=\"Brian Wilson\">Brian Wilson</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\" title=\"The Beach Boys\">The Beach Boys</a> to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities - singer-guitarist <a href=\"/wiki/Carl_Wilson\" title=\"Carl Wilson\">Carl Wilson</a> was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions - so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Wrecking_Crew_(music)\" title=\"The Wrecking Crew (music)\">The Wrecking Crew</a>\". For the group's landmark <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pet_Sounds\" title=\"Pet Sounds\">Pet Sounds</a></i> album in 1965, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member <a href=\"/wiki/Bruce_Johnston\" title=\"Bruce Johnston\">Bruce Johnston</a>), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Pet_Sounds_Sessions\" title=\"The Pet Sounds Sessions\">The Pet Sounds Sessions</a></i> (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Smile_Sessions\" title=\"The Smile Sessions\">The Smile Sessions</a></i> (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 <i>magnum opus</i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Smile_(The_Beach_Boys_album)\" title=\"Smile (The Beach Boys album)\">Smile</a></i>.\n</p><p>All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums <i><a href=\"/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)\" title=\"Revolver (Beatles album)\">Revolver</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sgt_Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sgt Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band\">Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></i>, were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.\n</p><p>4-track tape also led to a related development, <a href=\"/wiki/Quadraphonic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quadraphonic\">quadraphonic</a> sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon\" title=\"The Dark Side of the Moon\">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></i> and Mike Oldfield's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tubular_Bells\" title=\"Tubular Bells\">Tubular Bells</a></i> were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the <a href=\"/wiki/Surround_sound\" title=\"Surround sound\">surround sound</a> technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.\n</p><p>In a <a href=\"/wiki/Professional_audio\" title=\"Professional audio\">professional audio</a> setting today, such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Recording_studio\" title=\"Recording studio\">recording studio</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Audio_engineer\" title=\"Audio engineer\">audio engineers</a> may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.\n</p><p>The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetic_tape\" title=\"Magnetic tape\">magnetic tape</a> as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33\u2153 rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetic_tape\" title=\"Magnetic tape\">magnetic tape</a>, then transferred to disc, with <a href=\"/wiki/Bing_Crosby\" title=\"Bing Crosby\">Bing Crosby</a> leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ampex.27s_original_8-track_recorder\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ampex's_original_8-track_recorder\">Ampex's original 8-track recorder</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_multitrack_recording&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Ampex&#039;s original 8-track recorder\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with <a href=\"/wiki/8-track_tape\" title=\"8-track tape\">8-track tape</a> endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project.

The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.\n</p><p>The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pet_Sounds\" title=\"Pet Sounds\">Pet Sounds</a></i> relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Wilson\" title=\"Brian Wilson\">Brian Wilson</a> pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then '<a href=\"/wiki/Overdubbing\" title=\"Overdubbing\">dubbed down</a>' to one track of an eight-track tape.

During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08&#160;cm - 7.62&#160;cm) wide.  The so-called \"golden age\" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using <a href=\"/wiki/Hard_disk_drive\" title=\"Hard disk drive\">hard disk drives</a> instead of tape.  Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.\n</p><p>Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available.

A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format.

A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one.

The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, <a href=\"/wiki/Enrico_Caruso\" title=\"Enrico Caruso\">Enrico Caruso</a>. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in \"real time\" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.\n</p><p>By the late 1970s, <a href=\"/wiki/3M\" title=\"3M\">3M</a> introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing &amp; mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital \"word\". The only converters of the day were 12 bit &amp; 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit \"word\" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50&#160;kHz).

Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and <a href=\"/wiki/Mitsubishi_Corporation\" title=\"Mitsubishi Corporation\">Mitsubishi Corporation</a> created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the \"DASH\" format meaning, \" Digital Audio Stationary Head\". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the <a href=\"/wiki/Dynamic_range\" title=\"Dynamic range\">dynamic range</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Signal_to_noise_ratio\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Signal to noise ratio\">signal to noise ratios</a>.\n</p><p>Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital <a href=\"/wiki/Drum_machine\" title=\"Drum machine\">drum machines</a> and inexpensive analog <a href=\"/wiki/Audio_mixer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Audio mixer\">audio mixers</a> introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function <a href=\"/wiki/Remote_control\" title=\"Remote control\">remote control</a> was also available.\n</p><p>The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8&#160;mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a \"read before write\" function for <a href=\"/wiki/Overdubbing\" title=\"Overdubbing\">overdubbing</a> purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 &amp; 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording.

In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available  However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications.  This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.
