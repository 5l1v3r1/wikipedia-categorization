Th manuscript includes three other works that are not listed in the index, two of which are also duplicated. On the other hand, the works listed as numbers 36 and 37, Salte y baile and Mi voluntad no me dexa are in fact parts of a single work titled Por dinero baila el perro. Therefore, the cancionero contains 46 individual works. One of them is for 4 voices, 35 are for 3 voices and the ten remaining are for 2 voices. The musical forms employed are the villancico, the canción and the romance. All the pieces are anonymous, but one of them, Sobre moradas violetas, is also found in the Cancionero de la Sablonara, attributed to the Sevillian guitarist and composer Juan de Palomares, on a text by Catalina Zamudio. Several texts were extracted from the romancero or were written by known authors, such as Lope de Vega, Catalina Zamudio, etc. Concordance with other manuscripts:
