The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings is a non-fiction book that is an encyclopedic referencing of all known blues music albums released on CD. The book's first edition was released on 31 October 2006 and was written by Tony Russell and Chris Smith with contributions by Neil Slaven, Ricky Russell and Joe Faulkner. Russell in particular is known as a musical historian, working closely with programs presented on BBC Radio, as well as documentaries on the blues. In the book, artists are set up alphabetically and include short (usually one paragraph) biographies before showing a complete listing of their discography. Each album includes title, a rating out of four stars, label, musicians on the album, release month and year, and finally a review of varying length.
