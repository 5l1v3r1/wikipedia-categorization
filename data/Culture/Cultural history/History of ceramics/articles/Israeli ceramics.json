beginning of the 20th century the <a href=\"/wiki/Palestinian_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Palestinian people\">Palestinian</a> tradition of designing pottery from local materials dominated in Israel.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The pottery was primary functional, intended primarily for the use of the local population in the Land of Israel. Other vessels were imported from neighboring areas.\n</p><p>Pots were thrown on potter's wheels mostly in urban areas or in pottery villages. It was a craft traditionally worked by men.  In the census carried out on the streets of the land of Israel in 1928 during the <a href=\"/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine\" title=\"Mandatory Palestine\">British Mandate</a>, 77 pottery villages (of individuals or groups) were listed, while in the 1931 census, 211 different pottery villages were listed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Many of the pottery villages were centralized, based on geographical proximity of the potters' families. Examples of this can be found in the pottery workshops held in the pottery villages in Rashia al Fakhar (<a href=\"/wiki/Tel_Faher\" title=\"Tel Faher\">Tel Faher</a>) at the foot of <a href=\"/wiki/Mount_Hermon\" title=\"Mount Hermon\">Mount Hermon</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Or in <a href=\"/wiki/Hebron\" title=\"Hebron\">Hebron</a>, at the various workshops of the Alfahori family. These pots were fired at a low temperature in traditional kilns that burned wood, charcoal, or animal droppings. Different workshops were held in <a href=\"/wiki/Gaza_Strip\" title=\"Gaza Strip\">Gaza</a> as well, where they produced unique black pottery (\u0641\u062e\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u0648\u062f), produced by adding organic materials, such as barley husks, to the kiln or by reduction firing. The smoke from the process of the burning of these materials within the kiln lent the pottery its characteristic black color.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In addition, a tradition existed of producing pots made of clay mixed with straw or gravel for cooking and other utilitarian uses by the local population.  This work was carried out by hand by women, and the pots were fired in improvised kilns, in kitchen ovens, or sometimes not fired at all.  Pottery of this type, which was produced in the Samaria area and in <a href=\"/wiki/Ramallah\" title=\"Ramallah\">Ramallah</a>, for example, was typically decorated with color made from rusted iron that originated in the <a href=\"/wiki/Jordan_Valley_(Middle_East)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jordan Valley (Middle East)\">Jordan Valley</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As the century progressed, this tradition began dying out as a result of industrialization, and in addition, from the 1980s competing pottery from other countries began to be imported.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Until 1989, for example, 11 different workshops were active in Hebron.

This experiment indicated the British interest in traditional art of the Arts and Crafts movement. Armenian ceramic art can be traced back to the 15th century, to the Turkish cities of <a href=\"/wiki/%C4%B0znik\" title=\"\u0130znik\">\u0130znik</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/K%C3%BCtahya\" title=\"K\u00fctahya\">K\u00fctahya</a>, but the combination of the ancient art of the Land of Israel and Christian motifs created a unique artistic synthesis.\n</p><p>The outstanding artist of the early years was <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=David_Ohannessian&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"David Ohannessian (page does not exist)\">David Ohannessian</a>, who specialized in the design of ceramic decorative art in buildings and monuments, many of which were commissioned by the British Mandate government. The workshop that he founded \u2013 \"The Dome of the Rock Tiles\" \u2013 produced not only monumental works, but also utilitarian and decorative pottery. Among the most important works Ohannessian produced in Jerusalem were tiles for the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Colony_Hotel\" title=\"American Colony Hotel\">American Colony Hotel</a> (1923), the fountain house in St. John's Hospital, the tiled dome in the <a href=\"/wiki/Rockefeller_Museum\" title=\"Rockefeller Museum\">Rockefeller Museum</a> garden, etc. Among the motifs that appear in his decorations are the <a href=\"/wiki/Cypress\" title=\"Cypress\">Cypresses</a> trees, <a href=\"/wiki/Tulip\" title=\"Tulip\">tulips</a>, and grapevines typical of traditional Seljuk and <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\" title=\"Ottoman Empire\">Ottoman</a> decorative art.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Ohannessian introduced some unique Jerusalem iconography to his works, figures derived from Armenian medieval illuminations, historic designs and forms from European renaissance majolica, and bird motifs drawn from an Armenian Jerusalem 5th-6th century mosaic floor, discovered during an archeological dig in the Holy City during the 1890s, to name a few.\n</p><p>The workshop that Ohannessian founded in Jerusalem followed the tradition of ceramic making as he had practiced and overseen it in his atelier in Kutahya, in Ottoman Anatolia, which had flourished prior to World War I and his deportation to the Syrian desert. According to traditional methods, the processes of clay and glaze mixing, wheel throwing, design, painting, and firing were performed by a variety of artisans, all supervised by Ohannessian, some of whom specialized in design and others who were experts at the potter's wheel. Ohannessian was skilled himself in all facets of the art and trained a variety of apprentices, as he had done in Anatolia. He maintained particular expertise in painting ceramics and design. Upon the founding of his workshop on the Via Dolorosa, he cooperated with <a href=\"/wiki/Near_East_Relief\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Near East Relief\">Near East Relief</a>, to train a number of Armenian orphans of the genocide, giving them the skills to engage in the art on a professional basis. Some of his workshop's output, especially the monumental architectural tile works, were signed by the chief artist. Numerous other vases and plates identified their respective makers through small glazed initials on the bottom, usually painted in ochre. Ohannessian's workshop used a stone wood-burning kiln, built to his specifications in 1919.  The model implemented in this workshop was used for other Armenian workshops founded subsequently in Jerusalem.\n</p><p>The artists <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Megardish_Karakashian&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Megardish Karakashian (page does not exist)\">Megardish Karakashian</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nishan_Balian&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Nishan Balian (page does not exist)\">Nishan Balian</a>, who left Ohannessian's workshop in 1922, founded a workshop together called \"Palestine Pottery,\" where they developed a line of design with figurative images that were alien to traditional Turkish ceramic art.  For example, the two of them combined designs from ancient mosaics discovered in the Land of Israel, such as the \"Birds Mosaic\" (Jerusalem) or the mosaic from <a href=\"/wiki/Hisham%27s_Palace\" title=\"Hisham&#39;s Palace\">Hisham's Palace</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Jericho\" title=\"Jericho\">Jericho</a>.

Of the objects produced in this department, the best known are the wall tiles and decorations from the 1920s and 1930s.

This can be seen both in the design of the models and in the work techniques, which tended to be mechanized. In addition, while local pottery depended on family-led workshops and on cooperative activity by the artists, the Jewish potter saw himself both as an artist and as an expression of the language of art.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Chava_(Eva)_Samuel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Chava (Eva) Samuel (page does not exist)\">Chava Samuel</a>, who Immigrated to the Palestine in 1932, founded \"Hayozer\" [The Creator], the first ceramics workshop in the Jewish community in Jerusalem. \"Kad VeSefel\" [Jug and Cup], the ceramics workshop founded in 1934 in <a href=\"/wiki/Rishon_LeZion\" title=\"Rishon LeZion\">Rishon LeZion</a> with <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paula_Ahronson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Paula Ahronson (page does not exist)\">Paula Ahronson</a>, produced a variety of utilitarian pots and decorative pottery, using a combination of potter's wheel and ceramic casting.

As opposed to the figures from the Jewish world created by the artists of the \"Bezalel\" school, Samuel's imaged lacked the religious dimension. The images that remained, for the most part looked like images from folklore.

Grossman made <a href=\"/wiki/Aliyah\" title=\"Aliyah\">Aliyah</a> to the Land of Israel in 1933 after studying pottery in Germany. During her first years in Palestine, Grossman already began to carry out soil surveys to determine how local materials were used in pottery production. In addition, Grossman researched how pottery was made in the Land of Israel in ancient times and what where the work methods of Arab and Armenian potters throughout the Land. In her work Grossman emphasized the use of materials from the Land of Israel. Some of her work was even influenced by local archaeological findings. Her techniques for working the material included basic geometric decoration, using local non-glaze slips (<a href=\"/wiki/Slipware\" title=\"Slipware\">engobes</a>) in assorted colors.\n</p><p>An echo of Grossman's views can be seen in the 1940s, when <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Lev&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jacob Lev (page does not exist)\">Jacob Lev</a>, who served from 1939 as the head of the Sculpture Department in the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Bezalel\" title=\"Bezalel\">New Bezalel</a>,\" began to offer classes in pottery in the department.

In spite of her consistent use of local materials, Zunz's works differ from the archaeological direction of Hedwig Grossman's works or the oriental decoration of Eva Samuel's.  The shape of her pottery was influenced by European Modernism in its lack of decoration and in its organic tendency toward the use of the glossy surface slips of <a href=\"/wiki/Terra_sigillata\" title=\"Terra sigillata\">Terra sigillata</a> or ceramic glazes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> In addition to her independent works, Harag Zunz also produced technical academic research and participated in various industrial projects.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"From_landscape_to_clay.2C_1950.E2.80.931980\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"From_landscape_to_clay,_1950\u20131980\">From landscape to clay, 1950\u20131980</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Israeli_ceramics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: From landscape to clay, 1950\u20131980\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the 1950s and 1960s there was an upswing in ceramic activity in Israel, and steps were taken toward institutionalizing ceramics as a branch of art.

In addition, decorative arts \u2013including ceramic art \u2013 were no longer perceived as a foreign element in the young Israeli culture.  To a large extent these forms of media were encouraged by various government agencies.  Finally, an examination of the creations of the artists demonstrates the inculcation of a local artistic \"tradition\" that chose to cut itself off from the Arab ceramic tradition, the Armenian tradition, and even that of Bezalel, in favor of \"modernism\" and \"localness,\" which determined the central direction of Israeli ceramics until the 1980s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Along with <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hedwig_Grossman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Hedwig Grossman (page does not exist)\">Hedwig Grossman</a>, who taught most young ceramicists in her Jerusalem studio and in <a href=\"/wiki/Ein_Hod\" title=\"Ein Hod\">Ein Hod</a>, and from 1964 in <a href=\"/wiki/Givatayim\" title=\"Givatayim\">Givatayim</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hanna_Harag_Zunz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Hanna Harag Zunz (page does not exist)\">Hanna Harag Zunz</a> also taught them in the Oranim Seminar (today <a href=\"/wiki/Oranim_Academic_College\" title=\"Oranim Academic College\">Oranim Academic College</a>), <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paula_Ahronson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Paula Ahronson (page does not exist)\">Paula Ahronson</a> at Wizo in Tel Aviv, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gedula_Ogen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Gedula Ogen (page does not exist)\">Gedula Ogen</a> at Havat HaNoar HaTzioni (Israel Goldstein Youth Village).

Among the most significant followers of Grossman are Amnon Israeli and Gedula Ogen. From the 1960s both of them took the inspiration for their work from archaeology and the Land of Israel landscape, expressed in works that were unglazed and coated in slip<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> or exposed to an open fire during their firing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Other prominent ceramic artists were <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yehudit_Meir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Yehudit Meir (page does not exist)\">Yehudit Meir</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yocheved_Marx&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Yocheved Marx (page does not exist)\">Yocheved Marx</a>, who worked together in Beersheba from 1958, using local materials from the earth of the Negev and fired their works at very high temperatures (1250-1300 degrees C), which was atypical for Israeli ceramicists of that period.   The works they created spanned the field from decorative to practical.\n</p><p>The opportunities for exhibiting and selling ceramics during that period were limited and led to the production, for the most part, of practical ceramic ware.

In 1966 in Tel Aviv the \"Clay Museum\" opened as part of the Eretz Israel Museum, exhibiting ancient ceramics next to exhibitions of Israeli artists who exhibited in the open courtyard of the pavilion.

The presentation of ceramics and the rest of the arts as equal to other artistic media, bears witness to the importance of art during those years and its promotion by exhibitions and competitions organized by institutions such as the Israel Packaging Institute and the Israel Export Institution, etc.  On 24 September 1970, an exhibition opened in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art that surveyed the field of ceramics in Israel and was the ultimate expression of this trend.

In particular the influence of Israeli sculptors could be seen. Along with the continuing use of \"architectural\" images and the trend toward \"localness,\" it could be seen in the use of images of the land and desert landscapes, a divergence from the boundaries of traditional ceramics.  The aspiration toward copying nature into works of art forced the artists into seeking new artistic expressions.\n</p><p>The status of Land of Israel architecture as the expression of Zionist nationalism attracted not only the broad public, but also many ceramicists, to it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> Many of them utilized the skills they had acquired in the restoration of pottery, which was found in great numbers in the archeological digs of the 1950s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>  It was natural, therefore, that architectural images appeared in the works of Israeli artists.  A whole group of artists such as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=David_Ben_Shaul&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"David Ben Shaul (page does not exist)\">David Ben Shaul</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agi_Yoeli&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Agi Yoeli (page does not exist)\">Agi Yoeli</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=David_Calderon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"David Calderon (page does not exist)\">David Calderon</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Moshe_Shek&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Moshe Shek (page does not exist)\">Moshe Shek</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shelly_Harari&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Shelly Harari (page does not exist)\">Shelly Harari</a>, in addition to their ceramic works, produced during this period human sculptures or animal images inspired by figurines and statuettes from antiquity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup> Their works included a pioneering Zionist element that expressed an attempt to connect the young Israeli state with its historical and biblical past.<sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-49\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> At the same time, Israeli ceramicists showed a tendency toward modernism, which emphasized the geometric character of the shape and the work and showed the influence of European modernism.\n</p><p>Most of the characteristics of sculpture can be found in works that originated on potter's wheels during those years.  A central element in the widespread distribution of works of this genre was the teaching of Gedula Ogen at Bezalel.  Ogen developed a style using the potter's wheel to achieve the volume needed for large scale relief sculpture and figurative sculpture.  In her works she continued Grossman's style of design in her emphasis on the naturally colorful quality of the material.  Most of her work dealt with images from nature and with the relationship between it and culture and art.\n</p><p>The main reason for the shift in style during the 1960s that deviated from the previous tradition by opening the field of Israeli ceramics to varied new points of view, was the arrival and influence of ceramics producers and professional ceramic artists, the practical implementation of which could be seen in the works of David Morris, Magdalena Hefetz, Sonia Natra and others who studied and became specialists in the United States and Europe.<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An article from 1972 describes the creation of one of these sculptures by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rina_Peleg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Rina Peleg (page does not exist)\">Rina Peleg</a>, a graduate of Bezalel, who \"leaning heavily on the potter's wheel and round motions, creates the body of her sculpture.

Artists such as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neta_Avraham&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Neta Avraham (page does not exist)\">Neta Avraham</a>, Shelly Harari, <a href=\"/wiki/Nora_and_Naomi\" title=\"Nora and Naomi\">Nora and Naomi</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jean_Meir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jean Meir (page does not exist)\">Jean Meir</a>, Maud Friedland, and others, deviated from the tradition of \"sculpting with the potter's wheel\" in order to try out different techniques, particularly freestanding sculpture.  A central motif was the imitation of formations found in local landscapes and their conversion into objects of sculpture.\n</p><p>The Israeli landscape, especially the desert landscape, was perceived as isolated from modern westernized society, and served as an inspiration to artists in creating the form, texture, and color of artistic objects.  In this way these artists joined the general trend among many other Israeli artists who created in their works images of an archaic utopia, many of them even under the late influence of \"Canaanite\" art.  The objects they created tended towards abstract plant structures or towards the building of objects that suggested archaic cultural structures.\n</p><p>As ceramics drew closer to the field of art, however, foreign influences also creeped into the Israeli tradition.  <a href=\"/wiki/Siona_Shimshi\" title=\"Siona Shimshi\">Siona Shimshi</a>, for example, during these years returned from studies in the United States, where she had been exposed to postmodern art, such as Pop Art.  Her ceramic works combined these influences with biographical works and psychological images.  For example, in her works such as \"Puppet Theater\"\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> or \"Class Photo 1939\" (1965), the artist aimed to express psychological and social themes, something that was unusual in Israeli ceramics of the time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Starting in the 1960s, large scale sculptures began to appear in Israeli art, such as the bronze sculpture \"Sheep of the Negev\" by <a href=\"/wiki/Itzhak_Danziger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Itzhak Danziger\">Itzhak Danziger</a>, Assemblage art works, such as those of <a href=\"/wiki/Igael_Tumarkin\" title=\"Igael Tumarkin\">Igael Tumarkin</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yehiel_Shemi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Yehiel Shemi (page does not exist)\">Yehiel Shemi</a>, or works making use of various techniques such as installations or the use of non-artistic materials, such as those created by the artists of the group \"Ten Plus,\" while at the same time ceramic works continued to be limited by the size of the kilns in which they were fired.  However, apparently it was the influence of conceptual art, which arrived in Israel in the 1970s, that cut off ceramic activity from Israeli art.  This is particularly noticeable against the background of \"earth\" and \"place\" imagery among the Israeli artistic vanguard of this period.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"From_deconstruction_to_reconstruction.2C_1980.E2.80.932010\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"From_deconstruction_to_reconstruction,_1980\u20132010\">From deconstruction to reconstruction, 1980\u20132010</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Israeli_ceramics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: From deconstruction to reconstruction, 1980\u20132010\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the 1980s a fundamental change occurred in the way Israeli ceramic art was perceived.  The primary cause of the change was the disruption of the local tradition in Israeli ceramics.  Some of the reasons can be discerned in the perception of a break which Israeli society felt in a delayed reaction to the <a href=\"/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War\" title=\"Yom Kippur War\">Yom Kippur War</a>, and in reaction to the First Intifada.<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-54\">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> In addition the influence of postmodern culture began to trickle into the local culture.\n</p><p>Even though postmodernism had once been described as the expression of \"the personal, [with a tendency towards the] hand-made, metaphorical, figurative, [and] decorative\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-55\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-55\">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> traits that came naturally to Israeli ceramic artists and their art, paradoxically the distance between them and mainstream Israeli art widened.  At the same time, in painting, sculpture, and photography objections began to be heard against the status of the object as a work of art, whereas until the 1990s the field of Israeli ceramics had primarily adopted the attitude of \"identity politics,\" as the central tenet of postmodernism.  In place of historical and archeological relationships, a series of personal relationships began to appear, most of them expressivist, which deviated from the traditional Israeli ceramic tradition that had existed up to this time.\n</p><p>This sidelining of ceramics, and especially of pottery, from the main museums,<sup id=\"cite_ref-56\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-56\">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-57\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-57\">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> led to the establishment of a number of independent cooperative galleries in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,<sup id=\"cite_ref-58\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-58\">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> for the display and merchandising of ceramics, such as \"Ruach Cadim\" (1987), the  \"Altogether 8\" group (1990), and \"Shlush Shloshim (1992).

In 1985 Ofrat curated the exhibition \"Toward a Myth Without God\" in the <a href=\"/wiki/Jerusalem_Artists_House\" title=\"Jerusalem Artists House\">Jerusalem Artists House</a>.  In the exhibition catalog, Ofrat described ceramics as an expression of metaphysics, and pottery and pots as a means of direct connection to nature.  A connection that Ofrat described as a dialectic of \"proceeding toward a double eternity \u2013 an eternity of absorbing living and an eternity of absorbing dying\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-59\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-59\">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> connected to the practicality and the symbolism of the pottery.  In this Ofrat reflected the phenomology of Martin Heidegger and Derrida, who emphasized earth and object (and the pitcher as a characteristic expression of this) as an intersection between life and death.<sup id=\"cite_ref-60\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-60\">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Many of the artists sought to probe the personal and the biographical through archetypal images, and thus express the symbolic dimension of art.  From the point of view of form, it was manifested by developing means of sculptural expression in a more figurative direction and with a tendency toward ignoring the individual object in favor of the sculptural array.<sup id=\"cite_ref-61\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-61\">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>  <a href=\"/wiki/Siona_Shimshi\" title=\"Siona Shimshi\">Siona Shimshi</a>, for example, developed her ceramic sculpture as a series of  archetypal human forms made of bare material.<sup id=\"cite_ref-62\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-62\">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Nora_and_Naomi\" title=\"Nora and Naomi\">Nora and Naomi</a> began to communicate with the sculptural field when they started to make use of motifs of journeys or nature images.  The works of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Moshe_Shek&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Moshe Shek (page does not exist)\">Moshe Shek</a> are somewhere on the spectrum between ceramics and sculpture, expressed in a sort of postmodern incarnation of the Israeli ceramic tradition.  The enormous pieces he created, which he called \"containers\" (1986), were decorated with simple designs that emphasized the natural colors of the material,<sup id=\"cite_ref-63\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-63\">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> and these sculptures displayed stylized imaginary animals made of clay cylinders that emanated echoes of  \"Canaanite\" sculpture.

In contrast, Meira Una, in the mid-1980s created a series of Chanukah lamps that combined images from Orthodox Judaism with architectural images.  Her work is typified by the use of untreated material (without clay slips or glazes), with scribbles or engraved writing, and with no polishing or finishing of the form.  All of these works emphasized the status of the personal and the preoccupation with ars poetica in ceramics and art.\n</p><p>At the same time, the most prominent ceramic artist who made use of Jewish motifs came from the field of art and painting.

A large number of ceramic artists began to adopt ideas from painting and sculpture in their art.  These ideas, in the eyes of these artists, conferred a new legitimacy on pottery and on the objects they created, both as an expression of their personal feelings and as an expression of ars poetica.\n</p><p>An example of the renewed relationship between sculpture and pottery can be seen in the works of artists on the border between traditional pottery and contemporary art.  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rayah_Redlich&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Rayah Redlich (page does not exist)\">Rayah Redlich</a>, for example, created large scale pots, which she presented as a renewed esthetic and cultural examination, and on which she used techniques of printing and painting \"on the shards.\"  Many of these works were displayed on pedestals that were part of the exhibit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-69\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-69\">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> And <a href=\"/wiki/Daniel_Davis\" title=\"Daniel Davis\">Daniel Davis</a> used his potter's wheel to create large scale pots whose \"shards\" were then joined together in bundles by steel strips.  A group of about 70 of them appeared as part of \"A Woman of the Pots,\" a performance and film created by his wife, <a href=\"/wiki/Adina_Bar-On\" title=\"Adina Bar-On\">Adina Bar-On</a>, in 1990.<sup id=\"cite_ref-70\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-70\">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> Besides being used for musical percussion instruments, the pots pointed to themes like death and Judaism.  Another group that dealt with the imagery of the material and of pottery by means of a representative medium was the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Zik_Group&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Zik Group (page does not exist)\">Zik Group</a>, whose works include a pot as a central image.  In the installation \"Anarzik\" (1997), for example, the group created, on the structure of a potter's wheel, a complex pot that underwent a transformation of its technology and its form before the eyes of the public.<sup id=\"cite_ref-71\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-71\">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another prominent artist was <a href=\"/wiki/Lidia_Zavadsky\" title=\"Lidia Zavadsky\">Lidia Zavadsky</a>, who even served as the head of the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem.  Like other artists, Zavadsky inserted sculpture into her work as an integral part of her postmodern approach.  Between the years 1992-1994 Zavadsky produced a series of pot-sculptures that turned out to be the highlight of her artistic output.  The pots were monumental in size, glazed in intense colors, and a combination of work on the potter's wheel and sculpture.  In spite of her themes of corporeality and death, the form and the internal relationships were the central artistic concern of Zavadsky's work.  Through them the artist grappled with European and Asian pottery traditions. These works received more artistic recognition than any ceramic works up to that time and were displayed as well in the Israel Museum.\n</p><p>Only at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st did ceramic artists begin to make more consistent use of installation art within ceramic art.<sup id=\"cite_ref-72\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-72\">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> Artists such as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Talia_Tokatly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Talia Tokatly (page does not exist)\">Talia Tokatly</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hadass_Rosenberg_Nir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Hadass Rosenberg Nir (page does not exist)\">Hadass Rosenberg Nir</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Shlomit_Bauman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Shlomit Bauman (page does not exist)\">Shlomit Bauman</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yael_Atzmony&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Yael Atzmony (page does not exist)\">Yael Atzmony</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Maya_Muchawsky_Parnas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Maya Muchawsky Parnas (page does not exist)\">Maya Muchawsky Parnas</a>, and others created installations that combined different media, such as sculpture, ceramics, video, etc.  In their works we see a combining of elements of their personal identity through the disassembly and assembly of objects saturated with political or personal history.\n</p><p>An opposing philosophy to this sculptural trend was the return to the pottery tradition of which one expression was the increasing adoption of porcelain as the material used on potter's wheels and in casting beginning in the 1990s. This happened both because this material began to arrive in Israel on a regular basis, and because artists began to be trained in the use of this material within the academic framework<sup id=\"cite_ref-73\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-73\">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> as well as privately.<sup id=\"cite_ref-74\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-74\">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> Among the artists who began to use porcelain on potter's wheels was <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Irit_Abba&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Irit Abba (page does not exist)\">Irit Abba</a>. The use of this material sharpened her concentration on the form of the pot and allowed her to develop a deconstructionist concept of the pot, of her perception of pottery, and of her view of European culture.
