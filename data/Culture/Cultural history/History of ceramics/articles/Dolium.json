These sources, along with a variety of other less significant sources where dolia are only briefly mentioned, characterize the dolia as the largest type of earthenware vessel made by the Romans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Brenni,_G._M._R_1985_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Brenni,_G._M._R_1985-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_and_purpose\">Use and purpose</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dolium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Use and purpose\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There is evidence to support the claim of many classical archaeologists that dolia were used exclusively on land for the processing and storage of foodstuffs. For instance, dolia were manufactured for the most part by travelling specialist <a href=\"/wiki/Pottery\" title=\"Pottery\">potters</a> or by workshops that were involved principally in production of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_ceramics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Architectural ceramics (page does not exist)\">architectural ceramics</a>. Dolia were used in food production areas, such as farmhouses, and selling points like taverns and town warehouses. Dolia were also used in theatres for their <a href=\"/wiki/Acoustics\" title=\"Acoustics\">acoustic</a> qualities (presumably for special <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_effect\" title=\"Sound effect\">sound effects</a>).\n</p><p>The two methods of storing dolia were to either bury them half way in the ground or standing under a roof. They were used to hold goods such as <a href=\"/wiki/Wine\" title=\"Wine\">wine</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grape_husks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Grape husks (page does not exist)\">grape husks</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Olive_oil\" title=\"Olive oil\">olive oil</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Amurca\" title=\"Amurca\">amurca</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Wheat\" title=\"Wheat\">wheat</a>, and other common grains. Many dolia hold record amounts of 40-50 quadrantals (quadrantals being the general amount held in one amphora). Unlike the amphora, the dolium was not regarded as an accessory and sold along with the wine that it contained. Rather, dolia were fixed facilities not employed for the distribution of wine. Its major purpose was for the permanent storage capacity of goods.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, dolia were also commonly used in conjunction with transport facilities such as <a href=\"/wiki/Cargo_ship\" title=\"Cargo ship\">merchant ships</a> and temporary storage places like harbor warehouses. Surprisingly given their construction, dolia were often used in overseas transport. Recent archaeological discoveries indicate two or three rows of dolia were sometimes positioned along the keel of a merchant ship, apparently cemented in place to prevent shifting with the ship's movement at sea. This technique allowed dolia to serve as fixed receptacles for the transport of wine. The high prices of dolia is evidence to indicate that their incorporation into maritime transportation represented a substantial investment of funds. Also, given their great weight and bulk, replacement must have represented both an inconvenience and an expense. Thus, extraordinary caution must have been placed when handling the dolia to preserve and maintain their useful life. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Ethnography\" title=\"Ethnography\">Ethnographic research</a> indicates that in many cases dolia remained in use for several decades, and therefore, it seems plausible to suggest that dolia regularly remained in prime use for up to 20\u201330 years and perhaps longer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Brenni,_G._M._R_1985_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Brenni,_G._M._R_1985-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dolia_in_maritime_commerce\">Dolia in maritime commerce</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dolium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Dolia in maritime commerce\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Positions_of_dolia_in_ships\">Positions of dolia in ships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dolium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Positions of dolia in ships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While the mystery of the dolia in relation to maritime commerce is still being researched, archaeologists have substantial evidence from shipwrecks to support its significant, yet short role. One of the most striking evidences of the use of dolia in the commerce of food supplies is their presence on board Roman merchant ships. There have been at least seven <a href=\"/wiki/Shipwreck\" title=\"Shipwreck\">shipwrecks</a> discovered carrying dolia, dating between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD. Three of the most interesting and identifiable shipwrecks that lend themselves to study of dolia are the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Diano_Marina\" title=\"Diano Marina\">Diano Marina</a></i>, the <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Petit_Congloue&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Petit Congloue (page does not exist)\">Petit Congloue</a></i>, and the <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=La_Giraglia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"La Giraglia (page does not exist)\">La Giraglia</a></i> shipwrecks. \n</p><p>The <i>Diano Marina</i> shipwreck (IM, <a href=\"/wiki/Liguria\" title=\"Liguria\">Liguria</a>, Italy) was discovered with fifteen dolia still intact. Its relatively deep underwater location provided sufficient protection from both natural and human disturbances to allow for a more detailed study on the position of dolia on board this Roman merchant ship. The dolia from this shipwreck were found to be two different shapes, corresponding to two different positions on board the ship. Four long, cylindrical dolia were located in a line along the keel of the ship, while ten shorter, more rounded dolia were divided into two lines and laid alongside the central dolia. This type of disposition seems to be related to the structure of the ship and most likely implies that the lips of all the dolia were lying at an even level. The preservation of the Diano Marina's entire cargo provides a rare chance to estimate the capacity of Roman ships. Based on the calculations of the capacity of the central cylindrical dolia and the surrounding rounded dolia on board, the total capacity of the dolia on board the \u201cDiano Marina\u201d would have been approximately 9,500 gallons. \n</p><p>The \u201cPetit Congloue\u201d shipwreck (<a href=\"/wiki/Marseille\" title=\"Marseille\">Marseille</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Bouches-du-Rh%C3%B4ne\" title=\"Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne\">Bouches-du-Rhone</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Provence\" title=\"Provence\">Provence</a>, France) was discovered in a similar environment as the \u201cDiano Marina\u201d shipwreck. Its relatively deep underwater location sufficiently protected the site from disturbances as well, which also allowed for a more detailed study on the position of dolia on board this Roman merchant ship. However, in the \u201cPetit Congloue\u201d shipwreck, the dolia are all unfortunately silted up to their shoulders, making it impossible to distinguish their different shapes. But their disposition clearly shows the same pattern of three lines parallel to the keel as in the \u201cDiano Marina\u201d shipwreck, which allows us to further specify that the vases in each line were actually sized compared to the ones in the neighboring line. It is important to note here that even though this shipwreck does not allow us to study the shapes of these particular dolia, the sporadic recovery of single dolia from the sea without its known origins basically shows two different and distinct shapes: cylindrical or rounded.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Construction_of_Dolia_Ships\">Construction of Dolia Ships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dolium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Construction of Dolia Ships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The \u201cLa Giraglia\u201d shipwreck, discovered off the coast of <a href=\"/wiki/Corsica\" title=\"Corsica\">Corsica, France</a>, is particularly interesting because it is officially recognized as a <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cistern_boat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Cistern boat (page does not exist)\">cistern boat</a>. This type of vessel was intended to transport dolia in bulk as the dolia appear to have been placed in the hold as the ship was being built. The \u201cLa Giraglia\u201d was carrying at least eight dolia and its excavation gives insight into the ship\u2019s design and how such vessels contributed to patterns of trade in the western Mediterranean. The cistern boat was an innovation in <a href=\"/wiki/Shipbuilding\" title=\"Shipbuilding\">ship construction</a>, intended to respond to changes in the production and transportation of wine brought about by Roman expansion. The cistern boat began being built during the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Augustan_Period&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Augustan Period (page does not exist)\">Augustan Period</a>, and continued until the 2nd century. The relatively short period of production for this ship-type suggests that there were problems with its design which caused the design to be superseded. Because each discovery illuminates the ways in which maritime commerce adapted to the demands of production and transportation, the \u201cLa Giraglia\u201d shipwreck is essential in the understanding of mutual exchange within the Mediterranean. \n</p><p>As this dolia ship came to a very traumatic ending, there is little left to be excavated and studied of the hull. The hull planking is also poorly preserved, but there were, however, thirteen <a href=\"/wiki/Strake\" title=\"Strake\">strakes</a> that may serve for extrapolation to the design of the entire ship. The strakes were fastened together by pegged <a href=\"/wiki/Mortise_and_tenon\" title=\"Mortise and tenon\">mortise and tenon</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Woodworking_joints\" title=\"Woodworking joints\">joinery</a> and assembled in the classic shell-first construction. The spacing between mortises and the width of the mortises is very tight and they also appear to be slightly wider than the tenons. It is believed that the space left within the mortises was intended to compensate for possible misalignment of opposite mortises. It appears that they were arranged in a straight line, rather than alternating from the inboard to the outboard edge and the back inboard in order to prevent the wood from splitting. Twenty-six frames were also identified and recorded from the \u201cLa Giraglia\u201d dolia shipwreck. The large quantity of nails indicates their significance as a strengthening element in the assemblage of the frames with the planking. \n</p><p>The \u201cLa Giraglia\u201d was a medium-sized ship, but possessed a few rather unusual characteristics because the discovery and study of the twenty-six frames reveal that 58.8% of the preserved hull was composed of <a href=\"/wiki/Oak\" title=\"Oak\">oak</a>. The use of oak solely for the hull planking has never before been seen in the Mediterranean. However, given the fragmented nature of the remaining wreck, this preponderance of oak in the surviving portions may not reflect the composition of the rest of the original ship. It could have perhaps only been used for the bottom of the hull, which would certainly be an interesting characteristic for such cistern boats. The ship builder might have thought it necessary to use this hardwood because the weight of the cargo was concentrated in the center section of the ship. Overall, there were six species of wood  used in the construction of the \u201cLa Giraglia\u201d: oak was used for the <a href=\"/wiki/Frame_(nautical)\" title=\"Frame (nautical)\">frames</a> and tenons, <a href=\"/wiki/Beech\" title=\"Beech\">beech</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Elm\" title=\"Elm\">elm</a> also for the frames, <a href=\"/wiki/Wood_ash\" title=\"Wood ash\">ash</a> made up the small pegs used in the hull planking, and <a href=\"/wiki/Fir\" title=\"Fir\">fir</a> and two other types of oak. The shipwright obviously knew how to use the available species appropriately for the construction of the different structures and elements of the ship. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatever the answers to the numerous questions raised about the dolia vessels or cistern boats, these ships must be considered not only as a technical innovation of their time, but also as a daring enterprise. The presence of huge containers in the hold presented an obvious and real danger. The rupture of a full dolium would have caused almost two tons of wine to pour rapidly into the hold, which could have resulted in a sudden destabilization and <a href=\"/wiki/Capsizing\" title=\"Capsizing\">capsizing</a> of the vessel. In spite of the advantages of dolia over <a href=\"/wiki/Amphoras\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Amphoras\">amphoras</a>, the obvious risks may explain why cistern boats disappeared\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_discovery\">Recent discovery</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dolium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Recent discovery\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A new dolia shipwreck has recently been discovered on the seabed just off the coast of the Tuscan island of <a href=\"/wiki/Elba\" title=\"Elba\">Elba</a>.

The central row was composed of the highest cylindrical dolia, while the two other lines, laid on both sides of the central one, were composed of shorter and more rounded vases. The very tight disposition of the dolia has led to the deduction that these containers were never removed from their places on board ship and that when they carried wine, it had to be poured in and out at the ports-of-call. This conclusion is supported by the fact that all the dolia found on Roman port buildings were imbedded in the ground, and therefore were also irremovable.\u201d \n</p><p>In terms of maritime commerce, two assumptions about dolia presented: one, dolia were intended to carry wine and two, they were irremovable within the ships that carried them. This is supported by an ambiguous passage of Latin text from Pliny\u2019s Digest that talks about wine being poured for ships specialized for wine. This would draw the conclusion that ships carrying dolia were specifically transporting only wine. \n</p><p>\u201cPerhaps one of the most interesting results of the search for information on dolia is the fact that they have been found in considerable quantities in every step of a system of food supply which was related to the overseas trade. In fact, the archaeological evidence confirms the existence of a commercial organization, which would buy a certain food commodity, most likely wine, stored in dolia\u2026 In a second step the same commodity may be been further transported to other dolia in other warehouses located closer to possible buyers\u2026 All the archaeological and literary evidence support this vision\u201d of the role of dolia in maritime commerce.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Brenni,_G._M._R_1985_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Brenni,_G._M._R_1985-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dolium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Bibliography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>\u201cLa Nave \u2018A Dolia\u2019 di <a href=\"/wiki/Diano_Marina\" title=\"Diano Marina\">Diano Marina</a>,\u201d <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sullacrestadellonda.it/archeo/dianoindex.htm\">http://www.sullacrestadellonda.it/archeo/dianoindex.htm</a> (28 April 2009).</li>\n<li>\u201cMystery of seabed resolved with 2,000 year old ship\u2019s discovery.\u201d The Roman Hideout. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.romanhideout.com/news/2002/irna20020824.asp\">http://www.romanhideout.com/news/2002/irna20020824.asp</a> (Dated 15 August 2002; Access date: 26 April 2009).</li>\n<li>Brenni, G.
