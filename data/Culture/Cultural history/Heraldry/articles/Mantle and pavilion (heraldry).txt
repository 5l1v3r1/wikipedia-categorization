In heraldry, the mantle is a symbol of sovereign power and is generally reserved for royalty. In some cases its use has also been granted to other nobles, in recognition of particular merits. In ordinary rendering the mantle is usually crimson and lined with ermine. Certain arms may also display a pavilion surmounting the mantle. The pavilion is said to be the invention of the Frenchman Philip Moreau.  While common in continental European heraldry, the mantle and pavilion is absent in British heraldry.
