Gasparcolor was a color motion picture film system, developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. Bela Gaspar (1898-1973). It used a subtractive 3-color process on a single film strip, one of the earliest to do so. During the 1930s and 1940s, it was used primarily in animation, notably by Oskar Fischinger (Muratti Gets in the Act, 1934; Composition in Blue, 1935), Len Lye (Birth of a Robot, Rainbow Dance, both 1936), and George Pal.  William Moritz, in his article for the Fischinger Archive (see External Links), gives more detail about this history of this color process. Dr. Gaspar eventually moved to Hollywood and sold his patents to Technicolor and 3M.
