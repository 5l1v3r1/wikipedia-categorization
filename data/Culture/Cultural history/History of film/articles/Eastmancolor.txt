Eastmancolor is a trade name used by Eastman Kodak for a number of related film and processing technologies associated with color motion picture production. Eastmancolor, introduced in 1950, was one of the first widely successful "single-strip colour" processes, and eventually displaced the more cumbersome Technicolor. Eastmancolor was known by a variety of names such as Deluxe color (20th Century Fox), Warnercolor, Metrocolor, Pathecolor and Columbiacolor, and others.
