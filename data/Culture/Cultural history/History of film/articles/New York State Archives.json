The State Archives preserves records from the <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_State_Legislature\" title=\"New York State Legislature\">legislative</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Judiciary_of_New_York\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Judiciary of New York\">judicial</a>, and executive branches of state government.

Legislation in 1988 created the Documentary Heritage Program that provided for technical advisory services and competitive grants to historical societies, museums, libraries, and other nonprofit organizations holding historical records.  A local government records law in 1987 required the appointment of records management officers in 4300 local governments, including every county, city, town, village, and school and special district.  A Local Government Records Management Improvement Fund was established in 1989 to support technical advisory services and competitive grants to local governments to help them develop and maintain records management programs.  Through this program the State Archives provides archives and records management advice and technical support to every area of the State. Over $250 million in grant funds have been distributed since the program's inception.\n</p><p>The New York State Archives serves students and teachers, scholars and community researchers, government officials, the legal and business community, and the general public.  It encourages students through awards, grants, and internships; helps teachers use historical documents as primary source material in the classroom; and offers stipends for research using State Archives\u2019 records. The annual Student Research Award provides a cash award to New York State students in grades 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12 for projects that use historical records.  The Hackman Research Residency program provides travel grants to scholars to come to Albany to use the resources of the State Archives to conduct research and develop new knowledge using primary source materials.   The nonprofit New York State Archives Partnership Trust, established in 1992, provides support for preservation of and access to the treasures of the State Archives, educational projects that make historical records available to teachers and students and programs that promote New York State\u2019s archives and history and publishes a quarterly magazine <i>New York Archives</i> with articles and photographic essays on New York state history.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span
