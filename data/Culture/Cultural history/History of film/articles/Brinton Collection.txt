The Brinton Collection is a collection of early cinematography which was used by William Franklin Brinton (July 12, 1857-Dec. 16, 1919) for his traveling show in the Midwestern United States.   It was preserved by history teacher, Michael Zahs, in a barn in Ainsworth, Iowa.  The collection includes works by Georges Méliès which were thought to have been lost: The Wonderful Rose-Tree and The Triple-headed Lady.  The collection's history was recounted in a film documentary, Saving Brinton in 2017.
