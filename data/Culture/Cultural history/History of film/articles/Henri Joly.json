He developed early versions of motion picture film, cameras, and projectors.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Biography\">Biography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Henri_Joly&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Biography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Joly was born in Viomenil, Vosges in 1866. By 1889 he was a gymnastics instructor at the school of Joinville, and was introduced to the nascent moving-picture technology when pioneers <a href=\"/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey\" title=\"\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey\">\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Georges_Demen%C3%BF\" title=\"Georges Demen\u00ff\">Georges Demen\u00ff</a> (who was also a gymnast) came there to make motion-picture studies. Joly became acquainted with the Edison <a href=\"/wiki/Kinetoscope\" title=\"Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a> when it was publicly introduced in Paris in 1894. In 1895 Joly met <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Path%C3%A9\" title=\"Charles Path\u00e9\">Charles Path\u00e9</a>, a Vincennes merchant who sold <a href=\"/wiki/Phonograph\" title=\"Phonograph\">phonographs</a>, who began importing pirated Kinetoscopes (made by <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_W._Paul\" title=\"Robert W. Paul\">Robert W. Paul</a> in England) in May 1895.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Film-related_career\">Film-related career</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Henri_Joly&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Film-related career\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The short \"movies\" presented on the early Kinetoscopes had little variety, and they rapidly wore out. As Joly became aware of these shortcomings, he offered to make a camera for Path\u00e9 that could be used to reproduce the Kinetoscope films. Path\u00e9 agreed to fund the development, and on 26 August 1895, Joly filed a patent application for a camera that could provide films both for a projector and for the Kinetoscope. The camera used a mechanical movement similar to that in the Demen\u00ff system, and utilized perforated film which could be advanced on mechanical sprockets. He made his first moving picture, titled <i>Le Bain d'une Mondaine</i> in September\u2013October of that year.\nOn 8 October 1895 Joly filed a patent for another machine, the \"Photozootrope\", which was essentially a large Kinetoscope with four eyepieces. He sold a few units, but did not achieve major success with this development.\n</p><p>Path\u00e9 realized the commercial possibility of Joly's camera, and in 1896 he dissolved his agreement with Joly. He managed to secure the rights to the camera and the film process, going on to great success in the motion picture world.\nDuring 1896 Joly filed three other patent applications: the first for another camera; the second for a method of eliminating \"flicker\" from the projected image; and the third for a method of adding the perception of depth to the filmed image.\nDuring the final years of the decade Joly teamed with a French businessman and engineer, Ernest Normandin, to make and exhibit motion pictures. The process, officially called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Joly-Normandin\" title=\"Joly-Normandin\">Joly-Normandin</a></i> but also billed first as <i>Cinematographe Joly</i>, and then as <i>Royal Biograph</i>, was being exhibited at the Bazar de la Charit\u00e9 in 1897 when a disastrous fire (caused by a Molteni ether lamp) occurred. It was later exhibited in England (at the Empire in Leicester Square), and in Ireland (billed as \"Professor Jolly's Cinematograph\").\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg/220px-Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"152\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg/330px-Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg/440px-Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3831\" data-file-height=\"2644\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Phonographes_%26_Cin%C3%A9matographes_Lux_1906.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Share of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Phonographes et Cin\u00e9matographes Lux, issued 5. November 1906</div></div></div>\n<p>In 1900 Joly entered a three-way partnership with Normandin and his brother Edgar, called \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Biophonographe\", to exploit a system of synchronizing a motion picture projection with sound from a phonograph. The company filmed and marketed several films, but declared insolvency in 1902. Joly sold the rights to his patents to Georges Mendel, who continued developing them into a commercially viable talking film. Joly created another company in 1906, the <i>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Phonographes et Cin\u00e9matographes Lux</i>, which produced several short films. He left the company in 1908 after disagreements with other principals, continuing his research alone.\n</p><p>One line of research into recording sound for films involved a beam light reflected from a mirror which vibrated in response to sound waves. He had formulated the concept in 1905, but was never able to develop the machines necessary for its utilization. Unable to achieve commercial success, he supported himself by working in various manufacturing plants. By the time of his death in 1945 in Paris, he was a night watchman, and died unnoticed and destitute.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Henri_Joly&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.victorian-cinema.net/joly.htm\">Who's Who of Victorian Cinema entry</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1269\nCached time: 20180910163343\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.035 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 92/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 314/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 74/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 414/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   21.924      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   21.924      1 -total\n 20.62%    4.520      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:31853356-0!canonical and timestamp 20180910163343 and revision id 825631680\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"fr","url":"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Joly_(cin%C3%A9ma)","langname":"French","autonym":"fran\u00e7ais","*":"Henri Joly (cin\u00e9ma)"},{"lang":"mg","url":"https://mg.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Joly","langname":"Malagasy","autonym":"Malagasy","*":"Henri Joly"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"French_inventors"},{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"Pioneers_of_photography"},{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"Cinema_pioneers"},{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"History_of_film"},{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"French_cinema_pioneers"},{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"1866_births"},{"sortkey":"Joly, Henri","*":"1945_deaths"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Charles Path\u00e9"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Georges Demen\u00ff"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Joly-Normandin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kinetoscope"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Phonograph"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Robert W.
