Hoxie\">Charles A. Hoxie</a> working at <a href=\"/wiki/General_Electric\" title=\"General Electric\">General Electric</a> (GE) developed a photographic film recorder, initially to record transoceanic wireless telegraphy signals. However, this recorder was later adapted for recording speech and was used in 1921 to record speeches by President Coolidge and others which were broadcast over Station WGY (Schenectady). This recorder was called the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pallophotophone\" title=\"Pallophotophone\">Pallophotophone</a></i>.\n</p><p>In 1925 GE started a program to develop commercial sound-on-film equipment based on Hoxie's work. Unlike the <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Stereo\" title=\"Dolby Stereo\">Dolby Stereo</a>, Powers <a href=\"/wiki/Cinephone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cinephone\">Cinephone</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Phonofilm\" title=\"Phonofilm\">Phonofilm</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Movietone_sound_system\" title=\"Movietone sound system\">Movietone</a> systems in which the audio modulated the intensity of a recording lamp which exposed the soundtrack, thus creating a variable-density (or in <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Stereo\" title=\"Dolby Stereo\">Dolby Stereo</a>'s case variable-area just like the <a href=\"/wiki/General_Electric\" title=\"General Electric\">GE</a> system) track, the GE system employed a fast-acting mirror <a href=\"/wiki/Galvanometer\" title=\"Galvanometer\">galvanometer</a> to create a variable-area soundtrack. A number of demonstrations of this system, now known as Photophone, were given in 1926 and 1927. The first public screenings with this system were of a sound version (music plus sound effects only) of the silent film <a href=\"/wiki/Wings_(1927_film)\" title=\"Wings (1927 film)\">Wings</a> which was exhibited as a road-show in around a dozen specially equipped theatres during 1927.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1928 RCA Photophone Inc was created as a subsidiary of RCA (itself then a GE subsidiary) to commercially exploit the Photophone system. The RCA system continued to use the <i>galvanometer</i> until the 1970s, when it became technically obsolete. The Western Electric system continued to use the slower-acting <i>light valve</i>, and, under successor ownership, is still used to this day.\n</p><p>For nearly half a century, motion picture sound systems were licensed, with two major licensors in North America, RCA and Western Electric (Northern Electric, in Canada), which licensed their principal sound element (original track negative) recording systems on a non-exclusive basis. In general, motion picture producers elected to license one or the other. In a few cases, where mergers had occurred, a producer might be licensed for both. For many years, it was customary to \"brand\" a film with its sound system, variously as \"RCA Sound Recording\", \"Western Electric Recording\", or similar brands, often including the corporate logo of the licensor (<i>Meatball</i> for RCA; <i>The Voice of Action</i> for Western Electric; <i>Li Westrex</i> for the post-1956 divestiture of Western Electric under Litton Industries' ownership). Such branding ceased in about 1976, particularly after nearly all optical sound recording (for release prints) had been converted to Westrex's/Dolby's <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Stereo\" title=\"Dolby Stereo\">stereo variable-area</a> system from RCA's and Westrex's mono systems, although there were a few examples of such branding thereafter (mainly Westrex.)\n</p><p>Many years later, the Photophone trademark would be reused by the Western Electric/Westrex (Dolby) <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Stereo\" title=\"Dolby Stereo\">stereo variable-area</a> system, after both the Western Electric and Westrex trademarks became unavailable due to corporate asset sales by the disintegrating Bell System, but the Western Electric/Westrex (Dolby) <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Stereo\" title=\"Dolby Stereo\">stereo variable-area</a> system continued to be marketed by a successor, and it is still serviced and supported to this day, although it is no longer branded as Photophone (but nowadays instead branded as Dolby).\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Comparison_of_.28mono.29_variable-area_and_variable-density\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comparison_of_(mono)_variable-area_and_variable-density\">Comparison of (mono) variable-area and variable-density</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=RCA_Photophone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Comparison of (mono) variable-area and variable-density\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although variable-density sound system recording is usually associated with Western Electric (and Powers <a href=\"/wiki/Cinephone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cinephone\">Cinephone</a>) and variable-area sound system recording is usually associated with RCA (and <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Stereo\" title=\"Dolby Stereo\">Dolby Stereo</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Perspecta\" title=\"Perspecta\">Perspecta</a> sound), these relationships are not cast into stone.\n</p><p>Both variable-area systems and variable-density systems were marketed by both RCA and Western Electric, the Western Electric <i>light valve</i> being capable of producing either variable-density or variable-area depending on which ribbon axis was parallel to the film motion, and the RCA <i>galvanometer</i> was capable of producing either variable-area or variable-density depending upon the particulars of the optical system.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Roughly equal measured and perceived quality was available from both systems and from both manufacturers. Neither recording system nor manufacturer was clearly superior to the other, except where specific customer end-to-end processes made one system/manufacturer more consistently superior to the other system/manufacturer.\n</p><p>Variable-density was preferred for Technicolor sound prints as this process utilized a silver gray-scale \"key\" record, thereby creating a <a href=\"/wiki/CMYK\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CMYK\">CMYK</a> color image, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_track\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sound track\">sound track</a> was also a silver gray-scale record, which greatly facilitated variable-density (and made variable-area rather difficult). The \"key\" record was deleted from most <a href=\"/wiki/Technicolor#Three-strip_Technicolor\" title=\"Technicolor\">Technicolor</a> prints after 1944, thereby creating a CMY color image, but Technicolor's strong preference for variable-density continued long thereafter.\n</p><p>Variable-density was finally abandoned as customer preferences for \"dual-bilateral\" variable-area sound tracks emerged in the late 1950s. This required changes to some laboratory processing and quality controls, but the real reason for variable-density's demise was yet to come.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stereo_variable-area\">Stereo variable-area</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=RCA_Photophone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Stereo variable-area\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the early-1970s there was renewed interest in improving the quality of optical film soundtracks. \n</p><p>As a consequence by the early 1970s several individuals and organizations were considering improvements to the dated technical standards used for optical sound on 35mm film. In particular both Dolby Labs<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and Kodak<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> were investigating the use of Dolby noise reduction on optical soundtracks. \n</p><p>In the mid-1970s Westrex Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href=\"/wiki/Litton_Industries\" title=\"Litton Industries\">Litton Industries</a> since 1956, and the successor to Western Electric's cinema sound business unit) re-introduced the ca. 1938 \"four ribbon\" light valve, and the ca. 1947 RA-1231 sound recorder.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When originally introduced in 1947 the RA-1231 could be configured as a mono 35mm variable-density or variable-area recorder, or a mono 16mm variable-density or variable-area recorder, at the customer's option. However its basic electro-optical arrangement could also be used to create a time-aligned, two-channel variable-area version,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and this then became the industry standard device for recording stereo variable-area optical soundtracks.\n</p><p>Variable-density's fate was then sealed as these stereo optical sound prints (as contrasted with stereo magnetic sound prints or mono optical sound prints) became a marketing imperative.\n</p><p>When encoded utilizing <a href=\"/wiki/Dolby_Laboratories\" title=\"Dolby Laboratories\">Dolby Laboratories</a>'s technology (itself originally being in part licensed from <a href=\"/wiki/Sansui_Electric\" title=\"Sansui Electric\">Sansui</a>), the discrete L and R channels of Westrex's stereo variable-area system were renamed \"Left Total\" and \"Right Total\", and when decoded utilizing Dolby's Cinema Processor these produced the L, C, R and S sound image first popularized by Fox's <a href=\"/wiki/Cinemascope\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cinemascope\">CinemaScope</a> magnetic stereo system in 1953.\n</p><p>Stereo optical sound prints are compatible with films with any aspect ratio and with normal print film stocks with <a href=\"/wiki/Film_perforations#KS\" title=\"Film perforations\">KS-type</a> film perforations, whereas stereo magnetic sound prints require film stocks with the narrower <a href=\"/wiki/Film_perforations#CS\" title=\"Film perforations\">CS-type</a> film perforations.
