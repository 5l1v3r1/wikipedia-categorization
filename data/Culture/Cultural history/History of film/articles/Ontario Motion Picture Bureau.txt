The Ontario Motion Picture Bureau was established by the Government of Ontario in 1917 and was the first state-founded film organization in the world, preceding the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau by a year. Its mandate was to carry out “educational work for farmers, school children, factory workers and other classes,” to promote the province and its resources and “to encourage the building of highways and other public works.” Initially, the Bureau hired private film companies in Toronto to produce films under its editorial control. By 1923, the OMPB acquired its own studio, in Trenton, Ontario, previously owned by Adanac Films, and began producing its own educational films distributing 1,500 reels monthly by 1925. These films were mostly screened in churches, schools and community institutions. By the late 1920s, its films were increasingly viewed as outdated, while the Bureau itself was being criticised as having a large and unwieldy bureaucracy. It was dissolved on October 26, 1934 by the new Liberal government of Mitchell Hepburn, who had pledged during the 1934 provincial election to cut the size of government. The Bureau's property in Trenton was donated as a community hall.
