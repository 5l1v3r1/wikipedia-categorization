Pre-Code Hollywood is the era in the American film industry between the introduction of sound in the late 1920s  and the enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code) censorship guidelines. Although the Code was adopted in 1930, oversight was poor and it did not become effectively enforced until July 1, 1934. Before that date, movie content was restricted more by local laws, negotiations between the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) and the major studios, and popular opinion than strict adherence to the Hays Code, which was often ignored by Hollywood filmmakers. The criterion for inclusion on this list is the direct mention or discussion of the film as pre-Code in a mainstream source.
