The electrotachyscope is an 1887 invention of Ottomar Ansch√ºtz of Germany which presents the illusion of motion with transparent serial photographs, chronophotographs, arranged on a spinning wheel of fortune or mandala-like glass disc, significant as a technological development in the history of cinema. A Geissler tube was used to flash light through the transparencies to provide a weak projection to a single person or small audience through a small window. It was first publicly demonstrated at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. An earlier, related device is described in the January 24, 1878 issue of the journal Nature.
