He developed the <i>Thalofide cell</i>, a sensitive photocell, which was used as part of an infra-red communication system by the U.S. Navy during, and for some years after WW1.\n</p><p>In 1922 Case and his assistant Earl I. Sponable turned their attention to \"talking pictures\". In that same year Case was approached by <a href=\"/wiki/Lee_de_Forest\" title=\"Lee de Forest\">Lee de Forest</a> who had been attempting since 1919 to create an optical soundtrack for motion picture film in a system he called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Phonofilm\" title=\"Phonofilm\">Phonofilm</a></i>. De Forest was having little success and turned to Case for help, so from 1922 until 1925 Case and de Forest collaborated in the development of the Phonofilm system. Amongst other Case inventions Case contributed the Thalofide photocell and also the <i>Aeo-light</i>, a light source that could be readily modulated by audio signals and was used to expose the soundtrack in sound cameras.\n</p><p>In 1925, however, Case ended his relationship with de Forest due in the main to de Forest's tendency to claim the entire credit for the Phonofilm system for himself despite the fact that most of the critical inventions had come from Case. Documents supporting this, including a signed letter by De Forest that states that Phonofilms are only possible because of the inventions of Case Research Lab, are located at the Case Research Lab Museum in <a href=\"/wiki/Auburn,_New_York\" title=\"Auburn, New York\">Auburn, New York</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In 1925, therefore, Case and Sponable continued the development of their own system, now called \"Movietone\".\n</p><p>From 1924 onwards Sponable had turned his attention to the design of single-system cameras, in which the sound and picture are recorded on the same negative. He asked <a href=\"/wiki/Bell_%26_Howell\" title=\"Bell &amp; Howell\">Bell &amp; Howell</a> to modify one of their cameras to his design, but the results were unsatisfactory. Consequently, the Wall machine shop in <a href=\"/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York\" title=\"Syracuse, New York\">Syracuse, New York</a> was asked to rebuild this camera and the results were much improved.\n</p><p>Subsequently, many single-system 35mm cameras were produced by Wall Camera Corporation, which much later produced the three-film <a href=\"/wiki/Cinerama\" title=\"Cinerama\">Cinerama</a> cameras. Wall initially converted some Bell &amp; Howell <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Design_2709&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Design 2709 (page does not exist)\">Design 2709</a> cameras to single-system, but most were Wall designed and produced. Single-system cameras were also produced by <a href=\"/wiki/Mitchell_Camera\" title=\"Mitchell Camera\">Mitchell Camera</a> Corporation during World War II for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, although these cameras were quite rare.\n</p><p>Partly as a result of the single system experiments, the <a href=\"/wiki/Aspect_ratio\" title=\"Aspect ratio\">aspect ratio</a> of approximately 1.19:1 that is created by printing an optical soundtrack on top of the 35mm full aperture became known colloquially as the \"Movietone ratio\".  It was used extensively by Hollywood and European studios (apart from those that adopted sound-on-disc) between the late 1920s and May 1932, when the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Academy_Ratio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Academy Ratio (page does not exist)\">Academy Ratio</a> of 1.37:1 was introduced to restore the effective shape of the silent frame.\n</p><p>The 1950s brought the first 35mm kinescope camera with sound-on-film rather than separate, from Photo-Sonics, with a Davis Loop Drive mechanism built within the camera box. This camera was essential for TV network time-shifting in the years before Videotape. The sound galvanometer was made by RCA and was designed for good to excellent results when the kinescope negative was projected, thereby avoiding making a print before the delayed replay. The Davis mechanism was a Western Electric development.\n</p><p>After the split with de Forest, Case adopted a revised position for the projector soundhead, which was now placed below the picture head, with a sound-picture offset of 14 \u00bd inches (368&#160;mm) (which is close to the present day standard), rather than being placed above the picture head as had been the phonofilm practice. Case also adopted the 24 frames/sec speed for Movietone, bringing it in line with the speed already chosen for the Western Electric <a href=\"/wiki/Vitaphone\" title=\"Vitaphone\">Vitaphone</a> sound-on-disc system, and thus establishing 24 frames/sec as the standard speed for all sound films, whether sound-on-disc or sound-on-film. With a few exceptions, this has remained the standard speed for professional sound films ever since.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-HistoryofSoundFilms_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HistoryofSoundFilms-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At this point, the Movietone system was adopted by the <a href=\"/wiki/AMPAS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AMPAS\">AMPAS</a> as the Academy's standard. It and the later RCA Photophone system were interchangeable in most respects. See <a href=\"/wiki/RCA_Photophone\" title=\"RCA Photophone\">RCA Photophone</a> for technical details and lists of the industry adopters.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commercial_use_by_William_Fox\">Commercial use by William Fox</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Movietone_sound_system&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Commercial use by William Fox\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Movietone entered commercial use when <a href=\"/wiki/William_Fox_(producer)\" title=\"William Fox (producer)\">William Fox</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fox_Film_Corporation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fox Film Corporation\">Fox Film Corporation</a> bought the entire system including the patents in July 1926.

Sponable (page does not exist)\">Earl I. Sponable</a> (1895\u20131977) from Case Research Lab in 1926, when he purchased the sound-on-film patents from Case. The first feature film released using the Fox Movietone system was <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sunrise_(film)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sunrise (film)\">Sunrise</a></i> (1927) directed by <a href=\"/wiki/F._W._Murnau\" title=\"F. W. Murnau\">F. W. Murnau</a>. It was the first professionally produced feature film with an optical sound track. The sound in the film included only music, sound effects, and very few unsynchronized words. The system was used for sound acting sequences in <a href=\"/wiki/Mother_Knows_Best_(1928_film)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mother Knows Best (1928 film)\">Mother Knows Best</a> (1928).\n</p><p>Less than two years after purchasing the system from Case, Fox bought out all of Case's interests in the Fox-Case company. All of Fox's sound feature films were made using the Movietone system until 1931 when it was superseded by a <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Electric\" title=\"Western Electric\">Western Electric</a> recording system using the light-valve invented by Edward C. Wente in 1923. However, Fox <a href=\"/wiki/Movietone_News\" title=\"Movietone News\">Movietone News</a> used the system until 1939, because of the ease of transporting the single-system's sound film equipment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_development\">Later development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Movietone_sound_system&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Later development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:177px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Fox_movietone_2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Fox_movietone_2.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"231\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"175\" data-file-height=\"231\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Fox_movietone_2.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A vintage Fox movietone motion picture camera</div></div></div>\n<p>The Case Research Lab sound system influenced many industry standards, such as location of the <a href=\"/wiki/Optical_sound\" title=\"Optical sound\">optical sound</a> 20 frames in advance of the image it accompanies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-HistoryofSoundFilms_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HistoryofSoundFilms-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  The current <i><a href=\"/wiki/SMPTE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SMPTE\">SMPTE</a></i> standard for <a href=\"/wiki/35mm_film\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"35mm film\">35 mm sound film</a> is +21 frames for optical, but a 46-foot theatre reduces this to +20 frames;<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> this was originally done partly to ensure the film runs smoothly past the sound head, but also to ensure that no Phonofilm could again be played in theaters&#160;\u2014 the Phonofilm system being incompatible with Case Research Lab specifications&#160;\u2014 and also to ease the modification of projectors already widely in use.\n</p><p>Sponable worked at the <a href=\"/wiki/Fox_Film_Corporation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fox Film Corporation\">Fox Film Corporation</a> (later <a href=\"/wiki/20th_Century_Fox\" title=\"20th Century Fox\">20th Century Fox</a>) Movietone studios on <a href=\"/wiki/54th_Street_(Manhattan)\" title=\"54th Street (Manhattan)\">54th Street</a> and 10th Avenue in New York City until he retired in the 1960s, eventually winning an <a href=\"/wiki/Academy_Award\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Academy Award\">Academy Award</a> for his technical work on the development of <a href=\"/wiki/CinemaScope\" title=\"CinemaScope\">CinemaScope</a>. Sponable had many contributions to film technology during his career, including the invention of the perforated motion-picture screen that allowed placing the speakers behind it to enhance the illusion of the sound emanating directly from the film action. During his years at Fox, Sponable also served for a time as an officer of the <a href=\"/wiki/Society_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Engineers\" title=\"Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers\">Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers</a>. He published a concise history of sound film in the April 1947 issue of <i>The SMPE Journal</i> (<i>The SMPTE Journal</i> after 1950).<sup id=\"cite_ref-HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The history of Case Research Lab has long been unheralded for numerous reasons. Theodore Case died in 1944, after donating his home and laboratory to be preserved as a museum to the inventions of Case Research Lab. The museum's first director, who oversaw the museum for 50 years, put the laboratory's contents into storage and converted the building into an art studio. The Case Research Lab sound studio was located on the second floor of the estate's carriage house and that was rented to the local model train club until the early 1990s.\n</p><p>Fox was seriously injured in a July 1929 car accident, lost his company in 1930 when his loans were called in and lost the 1936 lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court against the film industry for violating the Tri-Ergon patents he owned. Sponable did little to establish the record of Case Research Lab inventions, other than his April 1947 article in <i>The Journal of the SMPE</i>.\n</p><p>Incredibly, it was also in 1947 that the Davis Loop Drive was first introduced to Western Electric licensees, including Twentieth Century-Fox (WECo RA-1231; and still made to this day by a successor company).<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In the collections are also letters from <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Edison\" title=\"Thomas Edison\">Thomas Edison</a>, an original copy of the Tri-Ergon patents, and an internal document from Fox Films written in the 1930s. This latter document says that once it became public knowledge that Sponable perfected the variable-area system of sound-on-film at the Fox Studios, the system that became the standard and replaced the inventions of Case Research Lab.\n</p><p>A number of films owned by Case Research Lab and Museum and restored by <a href=\"/wiki/George_Eastman_House\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George Eastman House\">George Eastman House</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Rochester,_New_York\" title=\"Rochester, New York\">Rochester, New York</a>, are in the collections of both of those institutions. The Case Research Lab and Museum has additional sound-film footage of Theodore Case, and recently discovered copies of the same films at the Eastman House, are in a much higher state of preservation. Movietone News films are in the collections of 20th-Century Fox and the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina\" title=\"University of South Carolina\">University of South Carolina</a> at Columbia, including the only known footage of Earl I.

Sponable can also be seen in footage of the premiere of the film <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Robe_(film)\" title=\"The Robe (film)\">The Robe</a></i>.\n</p><p>Phonofilms that were produced using Case Research Lab inventions are in the collections of the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_of_Congress\" title=\"Library of Congress\">Library of Congress</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Film_Institute\" title=\"British Film Institute\">British Film Institute</a>.\n</p><p>Variable density (VD) recording systems developed from Movietone gradually lost market share to variable area (VA) ones developed from Photophone from the 1940s onwards, a process that gathered pace as VA-related <a href=\"/wiki/Patent\" title=\"Patent\">patents</a> expired.  Though both methods are theoretically capable of achieving similar standards of recording, duplication and reproduction, quality control in the <a href=\"/wiki/Film_laboratory\" title=\"Film laboratory\">lab</a> proved to be far more critical in the duplication of VD tracks than VA ones: slight errors in printer light settings and sensitometry and densitometry control will affect the <a href=\"/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio\" title=\"Signal-to-noise ratio\">signal-to-noise ratio</a> far more on a VD track than on a VA one.
