Gevacolor is a color motion picture process. It was established in 1948, originally based in Belgium and an affiliate of Agfacolor. The process and company flourished in the 1950s as it was suitable for on location shooting. Both the companies merged in 1964 to form Agfa-Gevaert, and continued producing film stock till the 1980s.  The first Gevacolor featured film was a Malaysian film named Buloh Perindu (year 1953). This was the first colour film in Southeast Asia. Nine notable films to use this coloring system were in India - the Tamil films Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum, Nadodi Mannan (1958, half color), Veerapandiya Kattabomman (some parts in geva color), Sri Valli, Maaya Mohini, and the Telugu film Lava Kusha.  Two Hindi films, Hatim Tai (1956 film) and Jimbo, were shot in Gevacolor.
