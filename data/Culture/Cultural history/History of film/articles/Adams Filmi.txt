 Adams Filmi Oy (previously Adamsin Filmitoimisto) was a Finnish film production company. Founded in 1912 by Abel Adams (1879â€“1938), the company was later merged with Fenno-Filmi which eventually became Fennada-Filmi. The Finnish Broadcasting Company bought Fennada-Filmi in 1982. When Adams Filmi Oy, O.Y. Kinosto and Ky Kino Savoy merged in 1986, a new film company Finnkino was born. After Abel Adams suddenly died in 1938, his wife became the head of the company. Their daughter Felicia Adams took over the charge in 1958. Valuable film material was lost in a fire in 1959, including three early films by Teuvo Tulio.
