Initial funding was provided by Northern Arts (what was then the <a href=\"/wiki/UK_Government\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UK Government\">UK Government</a>'s regional agency for distributing public arts funding in the north-east of England), and the organisation began life with a full-time <a href=\"/wiki/Curator\" title=\"Curator\">curator</a> and a part-time <a href=\"/wiki/Archivist\" title=\"Archivist\">archivist</a>.  In 2001, responsibility for distributing core funding to the English regional <a href=\"/wiki/Film_archive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Film archive\">film archives</a> passed from Northern Arts to the newly formed <a href=\"/wiki/UK_Film_Council\" title=\"UK Film Council\">UK Film Council</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Regional_screen_agencies\" title=\"Regional screen agencies\">regional agency</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.northernmedia.org/\">Northern Film and Media</a>.  A temperature and humidity controlled vault facility was built for the NEFA on the Teesside campus during 2003, and was formally opened the following year.  In December 2003, NRFTA Ltd. was formed as a <a href=\"/wiki/Company_limited_by_guarantee\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Company limited by guarantee\">company limited by guarantee</a> (no. 04994213), thus making the archive an independent legal entity.  In February 2006, responsibility for providing a moving image archive service to <a href=\"/wiki/Cumbria\" title=\"Cumbria\">Cumbria</a> passed from the NRFTA to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nwfa.mmu.ac.uk/\">North West Film Archive</a>.  As of February 2010 the NEFA has a staff of two (one full-time and one part-time), both of whom are based at <a href=\"/wiki/Teesside_University\" title=\"Teesside University\">Teesside University</a>.  The NEFA is one of a network of eight regional film archives in <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">England</a>.  It is an 'emerging archive' member institution of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bufvc.ac.uk.faf/\">UK Film Archive Forum</a>.In July 2012, NEFA merged with the Yorkshire Film Archive (YFA), a registered charity (no. 1093468), and now comes under the YFA banner and charity. Together,they have a growing collection currently containing over 50,000 titles - 17,000 held by YFA, and 33,000 held by NEFA - ranging from films made by the early film pioneers of the late 1890s, to recent footage of changing landscapes and life across both regions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_operations\">Current operations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Northern_Region_Film_and_Television_Archive&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Current operations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The NEFA is based at <a href=\"/wiki/Teesside_University\" title=\"Teesside University\">Teesside University</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Middlesbrough\" title=\"Middlesbrough\">Middlesbrough</a>, where most of the collection is stored.  Limited storage facilities are also operated at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/\">Tyne and Wear Archives Service</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne\" title=\"Newcastle upon Tyne\">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> as well, but all work on the collection now takes place at Teesside.  Viewing facilities for members of the public are available at <a href=\"/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne\" title=\"Newcastle upon Tyne\">Newcastle</a>, but <a href=\"/wiki/Film_preservation\" title=\"Film preservation\">preservation</a> and cataloguing work no longer takes place there.  As with any archive, the NEFA undertakes three core activities.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Acquisition</b>.  There is no system of <a href=\"/wiki/Legal_deposit\" title=\"Legal deposit\">legal deposit</a> for audiovisual media in the UK, and so moving image archives have to identify appropriate materials for preservation and persuade their owners to deposit them.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Film_preservation\" title=\"Film preservation\">Preservation</a></b>.  <a href=\"/wiki/Film\" title=\"Film\">Film</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetic_tape\" title=\"Magnetic tape\">magnetic tape</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Optical_disc\" title=\"Optical disc\">digital optical media</a> are among the most technically complex of any archival medium to preserve for the long-term.  NEFA staff carry out this task through a combination of preserving original media and copying where this is necessary to prevent the loss of content.</li>\n<li><b>Access</b>.  This includes dealing with viewing requests from individual researchers, organising public screenings and licensing material to <a href=\"/wiki/Film\" title=\"Film\">film</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">TV</a> programme makers, and for online use.  Access work can also involve negotiating <a href=\"/wiki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyright</a> clearance and overcoming technical issues needed to provide high-quality access copies.</li></ul>\n<p>The NEFA is funded from a combination of sources, including public money, revenue from commercial footage licensing to broadcasters (all other paid-for services are charged on a cost-covering basis) and 'in kind' contributions from its constituent organisations, principally <a href=\"/wiki/Teesside_University\" title=\"Teesside University\">Teesside University</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tyneandweararchives.org.uk/\">Tyne and Wear Archives Service</a>.  The NEFA's work is overseen by a <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_directors\" title=\"Board of directors\">board of directors</a>, and its permanent staff are all employees of <a href=\"/wiki/Teesside_University\" title=\"Teesside University\">Teesside University</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_collection\">The collection</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Northern_Region_Film_and_Television_Archive&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The collection\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The collection policies of the English regional film archives are all broadly similar.  They do not collect fictional feature films or TV programmes produced outside their regions and/or intended for network broadcast: this is the responsibility of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Film_and_Television_Archive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Film and Television Archive\">National Film and Television Archive</a>.  The NEFA's collection consists mainly of regional TV news and regionally produced network output, industrial, promotional, educational and advertising films, and amateur film and video.  Among its major collections are:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/BBC\" title=\"BBC\">BBC</a> regional news filmed location reports for the north-east and <a href=\"/wiki/Cumbria\"
