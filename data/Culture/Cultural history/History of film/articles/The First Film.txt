The First Film is a 2015 British documentary film about cinema pioneer Louis Le Prince, made by David Nicholas Wilkinson.   It asserts that Le Prince, rather than the Lumiere brothers, was the true inventor of moving pictures, making his first film in Leeds in 1888 before his mysterious disappearance in 1890.   Mark Kermode, film critic of The Guardian, described the film as "a flickering story that blends intrigue, industrial espionage, and possibly even murder".  The film's world premiere was at the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival.  It went on general release in the United States in September 2016.
