   40,000 Years of Dreaming (White Fellas Dreaming: A Century of Australian Cinema) is an hour-long documentary film presented by George Miller and produced by the British Film Institute, as part of their Century of Cinema series. The film acts mainly as a collage of various pieces of Australian film, past and present, including Miller's own Mad Max series.  In the film, Miller focuses primarily on Australian cinema as a vessel of public dreaming, creating a link between contemporary Australian cinema and the "dreamtime" stories of Aborigine folklore. Miller also places Australian cinema in the context of Joseph Campbell's monomyth concept. Since its release in 1997, it—along with several of the other films in the Century of Cinema series, outside of Martin Scorsese's feature—has long been out of print, minus the occasional television showing.
