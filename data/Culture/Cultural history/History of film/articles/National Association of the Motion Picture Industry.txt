The National Association of the Motion Picture Industry (NAMPI) was a regulatory body created by the Hollywood studios in 1916 to answer demands of censorship.    The system consisted of a series of "Thirteen Points", a list of subjects and storylines they promised to avoid.  The organization tried to prevent New York from becoming the first state with its own censorship board in 1921, but failed.  NAMPI was ineffective and was replaced when the studio hired Will H. Hays to oversee censorship in 1922.
