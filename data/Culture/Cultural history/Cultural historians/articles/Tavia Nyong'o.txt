In his essay, Nyong'o explores the meaning of the word "diaspora". He is especially interested in the translocal community-building potential, of music, but worries that the very mobilizing and empowering aspects of diasporic music--a channel of community belonging--also divides and destroys communities.  He writes, “The close affiliation of popular music with seduction, romance and sex speaks to the anxiety with which queerness is policed within it”.
