Dominique Moulon (born 1962) is a historian of art and technology, specializing in French digital art. He is the author of the book Art contemporain nouveaux médias.   Dominique Moulon began his activities as an art historian of new media art and computer art by obtaining a Diplôme National Supérieur d’Expression Plastique in 1987 from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Art in Bourges France. In 1993 he obtained a Diplôme d’Etudes Approfondies en esthétique, sciences et technologies des arts from the University of Paris VIII. In 2002 he completed an extensive research project called Outils et Création Numérique, which in detail conveyed the techniques computer artists were using in France. He paid close attention to interactivity and developed a philosophical investigation of the real and the virtual, and its multisensory nature by stressing an aesthetics of technology. This work was conducted for the Recherche et Innovation de la Délégation aux Arts Plastiques du ministère de la Culture et de la Communication. Here Moulon began his work documenting the historical record of the relationship between technology and digital forms of art, extending the historic work of Frank Popper, Jack Burnham and Gene Youngblood. Key to his initial thinking and activities as an aesthetician, cultural theorist, curator, teacher, and art critic was his encounter with the work of Pierre Restany, Jean-Louis Boissier, Roy Ascott, Edmond Couchot, Christine Buci-Glucksmann and Fred Forest. Working with the Délégation au Développement et aux Affaires Internationales, in 2004 he created a website to share his research at nouveauxmedias.net. He also is responsible for the digital art section of the French paper magazine "Images Magazine" and was a visiting instructor in 2007 at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
