Tricia Collins is an American art critic, art gallerist and curator of contemporary art. She was half of the curatorial team Collins & Milazzo,  who co-published and co-edited Effects : Magazine for New Art Theory from 1982 to 1984.  She later ran the art galleries Grand Salon, Tricia Collins Grand Salon, and Tricia Collins Contemporary Art in New York City until the year 2000.  Born in Miami, Collins grew up in Tallahassee, Florida and moved to New York City in 1979. In 1980 she moved to the East Village, where she established her reputation.  In 1984, Tricia Collins and Richard Milazzo  began working together as curators to transform the group show into a critical statement.  Her exhibitions and critical writings with Collins & Milazzo brought to prominence a new generation of artists in the 1980s.  It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of Post-conceptual art that argued simultaneously against Neo-Expressionism and Picture-Theory Art.  It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what the critics reductively called Simulationism and Neo Geo) was first brought together.
