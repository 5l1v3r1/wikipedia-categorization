Susan Hogan (born 1961) is a British cultural historian. Hogan is Professor in Cultural Studies & Art Therapy at the University of Derby, where she facilitates the closed-group component of the art therapy training, and co-ordinates the final thesis or research project component of a number of programmes. Hogan married Philip Douglas in 1988, and then divorced in 1998. Hogan's mother-in-law was noted anthropologist Dame Mary Douglas.  She has two children: Emile and Eilish. Hogan attended a school based on the doctrine of A.S. Neillâ€™s Summerhill School. This experience, coupled with the anthropological work of her mother-in-law, influenced her work. She started her Ph.D. at the University of Sydney in art history and finished it in cultural history at the Thomas Reid Institute of the University of Aberdeen, where G.S. Rousseau served as her primary supervisor. She has taught in a number of universities including the University of New South Wales and University of Derby. Hogan's work has focused on therapy with: women of ageing and women who have recently given birth, offering art therapy groups to give support to woman and an opportunity for them to explore their changed sense of self-identity and sexuality as a result of pregnancy and motherhood. Her published work is significant in its sustained challenge to the use of reductive psychology and for bringing anthropological and sociological ideas to bear on the subject of art therapy.
