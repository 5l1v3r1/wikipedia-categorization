She is "interested in what it means to have an intellect, instincts, and a spirit, and how these oppositions inherent in us come into balance." Mikasen is inspired by philosophy, psychology, myth, literature and scientific theory.   Mikasen is the coauthor with chemist Mark Griep of the nonfiction book Re'Action!' Chemistry in the Movies,  which explores the political, social, and psychological aspects of chemistry of over 140 films and gives the perspectives of a scientist and artist on the "dark and bright sides" of the portrayal of chemistry in motion pictures.   She and Griep were awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant in the area of Public Understanding of Science to research and write the book.   Mikasen created a work entitled Jekyll & Hyde for the book.  Its stereo pair format (see stereopsis) has two focal points, which mirrors the split Jekyll & Hyde character whose oppositional personalities.
