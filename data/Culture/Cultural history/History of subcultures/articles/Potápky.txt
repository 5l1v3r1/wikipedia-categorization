Potápky ("The Grebes") or bedly ("The Parasol Mushrooms") were a Czech urban youth subculture primarily defined by the interest in American culture, primarily in swing music It corresponsed to the subcultures of Swingjugend (literally "Swing Youth", commonly translated as "Swing Kids") in Nazi Germany and zazou in France at the same time period.   Potápky were distinguished by their eccentric fashion ("zoot suit", deformed hat, colored socks), long hair, body postures, and slang.  As many youth subcultures it was characterized by the rebellion against the older generation, and since Nazi occupation (Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, since 1940), it was rebellion against the Nazis.
