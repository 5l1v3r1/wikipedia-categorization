Centro Iberico was a squatted school in Notting Hill, England, that became a Social centre, a live venue and a studio in the 1980s. Centro Iberico, also known as the Anarchy or Alternative ‘A’ Centre,  at 421 Harrow Road alongside the canal, was a former school squatted by Spanish anarchists. It provided anarcho-punk conditions for gigs by the Mob, Conflict, Poison Girls and the Subhumans.  Throbbing Gristle played and recorded at the centre, and future Madonna producer William Orbit began his recording career and Guerilla Records whilst living there.
