Recombinant culture is when cultural productions such as television shows are rehashed in a series of sequels.  The term was introduced by Todd Gitlin in 1983 to describe how in American television networks would create and promote sequels and spin-off over original shows, with "hits" being very rare and "a blatant imitation stands a good chance of getting bigger numbers than a show that stands on its own".  The phenomenon has been attributed to advertising-supported media.  Examples include the Superman series.  Positive examples of recombinant culture have included sampling in music.
