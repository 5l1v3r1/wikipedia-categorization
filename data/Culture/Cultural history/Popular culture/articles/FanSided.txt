On September 29, 2016, Burt Gertson, who was listed as one of FanSided’s writers, got into a Twitter argument with former adult film actress Mia Khalifa, who at the time was a regular sports columnist at FanSided. It soon turned out that Gertson was not a real person despite initial claims by FanSided former Editor-in-Chief Jim Cavan. Shortly after, FanSided admitted in a series of tweets that Gertson was not real and his column was meant to be fictional satire.  FanSided issued a statement on October 1, 2016 announcing that it had fired Cavan.
