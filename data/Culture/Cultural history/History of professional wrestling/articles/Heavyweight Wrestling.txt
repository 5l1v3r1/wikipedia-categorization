Heavyweight Wrestling from Washington  is the first weekly televised wrestling program that was produced by the WWE, which at the time was a regional professional wrestling promotion called Capitol Wrestling Corporation, a member of the National Wrestling Alliance. The show was hosted by Bill Malone (1956), Morris Siegel (1956–1959) and Ray Morgan (1959–1970) and was taped at the Capitol Arena in Washington, D.C..  The show debuted on January 5, 1956 and aired until the summer of 1970 when Vincent James McMahon moved the television tapings to eastern Pennsylvania and replaced Heavyweight Wrestling with WWWF Championship Wrestling. Morgan stayed with Championship Wrestling until he was replaced by McMahon's son Vincent K. McMahon.
