She married Freidrich August Cleve from Magdeburg in Germany, who was active as a printer and in 1787 opened what is sometime referred to as the first <a href=\"/wiki/Lending_library\" title=\"Lending library\">lending library</a> in Stockholm. When she became a widow in 1796, Cecilia Cleve renounced the guild printer privilege she was entitled to after her late spouse, but kept his right to keep a public lending library, and managed it until her death. She did this despite having a widow pension which were sufficient to support herself, and her foster children. She introduced the innovation to catalog the books in alphabetic order, which was at the time an innovation, quarterly subscriptions and advertises in the country papers. She managed the library with success and it reportedly contained 8.000 volumes. By 1800, five other lending libraries had bee founded in Stockholm, but she remained the only female librarian until <a href=\"/wiki/Eva_Unander\" title=\"Eva Unander\">Eva Unander</a> opened hers at S\u00f6dermalmstorg in 1816. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cecilia_Cleve&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entrepren\u00f6rskap: under 400 \u00e5r, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1274\nCached time: 20180906163256\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:53331688-0!canonical and timestamp 20180906163256 and revision id 785251871\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"sv","url":"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Cleve","langname":"Swedish","autonym":"svenska","*":"Cecilia Cleve"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Cleve, Cecilia","*":"1819_deaths"},{"sortkey":"Cleve, Cecilia","*":"Swedish_librarians"},{"sortkey":"Cleve, Cecilia","*":"Library_history"},{"sortkey":"Cleve, Cecilia","*":"Gustavian_era_people"},{"sortkey":"Cleve, Cecilia","*":"19th-century_Swedish_businesspeople"},{"sortkey":"Cleve, Cecilia","*":"18th-century_Swedish_businesspeople"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Eva Unander"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lending library"},{"ns":0,"*":"Nils Dahlin"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Cecilia_Cleve","byteoffset":1188,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Cecilia Cleve","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Cleve, Cecilia"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q24878923"}]}}
