Typically, a \"slide library\" contains slides depicting <a href=\"/wiki/Visual_arts\" title=\"Visual arts\">artwork</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Architecture\" title=\"Architecture\">architecture</a>, or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of <a href=\"/wiki/Art_history\" title=\"Art history\">art history</a>, architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Biology\" title=\"Biology\">biology</a> and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as \"Visual Resources Collections,\" as they may be responsible for all \"visual\" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:\n</p>\n<ul><li>35mm slides</li>\n<li>lantern slides</li>\n<li>mounted study photographs</li>\n<li>born digital images</li>\n<li>35mm, 8mm film</li></ul>\n<p>Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously <a href=\"/wiki/Library_catalog\" title=\"Library catalog\">cataloged</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Archive\" title=\"Archive\">inventoried</a> slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, <a href=\"/wiki/Digitizing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Digitizing\">digitized</a> slides and placed them online via <a href=\"/wiki/Content_management_systems\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Content management systems\">content management systems</a>. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_visual_resources_collections\">History of visual resources collections</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Slide_library&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History of visual resources collections\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first American <a href=\"/wiki/Lantern_slide\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lantern slide\">lantern slide</a> collections, developed by <a href=\"/wiki/Museum\" title=\"Museum\">museums</a> to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: <a href=\"/wiki/DePauw_University\" title=\"DePauw University\">DePauw University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_University\" title=\"Columbia University\">Columbia University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Oberlin_College\" title=\"Oberlin College\">Oberlin College</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Princeton_University\" title=\"Princeton University\">Princeton University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Rochester\" title=\"University of Rochester\">University of Rochester</a>. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.\n</p><p>The first illustrated architectural history course west of the <a href=\"/wiki/Mississippi\" title=\"Mississippi\">Mississippi</a> was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley\" title=\"University of California, Berkeley\">University of California, Berkeley</a> in 1905.  The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at <a href=\"/wiki/MIT\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MIT\">MIT</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cornell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cornell\">Cornell</a> at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides.  In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3\"x 4.25\".\n</p><p>The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film.  Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2\"x2\" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.\n</p><p>The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960.  The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955\u20132005.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Timeline:_Development_of_visual_resources_.28collections_and_profession.29_in_the_U.S.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Timeline:_Development_of_visual_resources_(collections_and_profession)_in_the_U.S.\">Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Slide_library&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25\" x 4.0\" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required <a href=\"/wiki/Lime_light\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lime light\">lime light</a> which was dirty and dangerous\n</p><p>1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed\n</p><p>1888. First perforated film stock developed\n</p><p>1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock\n</p><p>1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film\n</p><p>1905. UC Berkeley\u2019s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher\u2019s book, <i>A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method</i>\n</p><p>1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust\n</p><p>1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography\n</p><p>1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film\n</p><p>1930.  Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)\n</p><p>1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle\n</p><p>1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base\n</p><p>1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets\n</p><p>1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides\n</p><p>1968. Visual resources curators begin meeting during annual College Art Association (CAA) conferences\n</p><p>1969. Art Libraries Society, established in the United Kingdom and Ireland, founded\n</p><p>1969.
