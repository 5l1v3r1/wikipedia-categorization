Edmond Roudnitska (1905–1996) was a French master perfumer and author. He is known for creating perfumes such as Dior's Eau Sauvage and Diorissimo, and Rochas's Femme. Many of his creations are still in production today. He was the father of perfumer Michel Roudnitska. In 1926, he started his training in perfumery in Grasse. In 1942, he met Thérèse Delveaux, who became his wife.  In 1946, he founded Art et Parfum, a private lab for creating perfumes.  Diorissimo, based on  lily of the valley, was a notable achievement in the field of perfumery. Unlike rose or jasmine, the smell of lily of the valley cannot be extracted from essential oil of the flower. Roudnitska circumvented the problem by using aroma chemicals like hydroxycitronellal. :142
