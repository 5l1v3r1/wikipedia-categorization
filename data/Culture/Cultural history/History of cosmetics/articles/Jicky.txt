Jicky is a perfume by the House of Guerlain, created by Aimé Guerlain. Introduced in 1889, it is the oldest continuously-produced perfume in the world.   Jicky was one of the first perfumes created with the addition of synthetic materials,  and was the first abstract perfume in history, meaning it is not based on a single note.  Its perfume notes include: spice, lemon,  lavender, wood and vanilla.  Its stopper is shaped like a champagne cork.  Jicky was the nickname of Aimé Guerlain's nephew, Jacques Guerlain, and according to legend, was also the pet name of Aimé's girlfriend from his time studying in England.
