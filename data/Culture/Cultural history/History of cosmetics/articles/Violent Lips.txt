Violent Lips is a cosmetics company founded by sisters Isabella and Sophia Haddad in 2011.   Their product line consists of temporary tattoo decals for the lips,  which create designs not possible with traditional lipstick - such as rainbows, animal prints, and polka dots.  At just 13 and 9 years old, the Haddad sisters were playing around with temporary tattoos. As a joke, they affixed them onto their lips and just like that the idea for temporary lip art was born.  The products have been featured by Seventeen,  Cosmopolitan,   Teen Vogue,  Vogue Italia,  MTV Style,  Elle Girl,  and Essence.  They have been worn by Khlo√© Kardashian, and her sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner.
