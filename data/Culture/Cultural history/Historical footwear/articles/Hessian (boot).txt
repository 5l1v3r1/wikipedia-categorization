Hessian (/ˈhɛsiən/; from Hesse in Germany) refers to a style of light boot that became popular from the beginning of the 19th century.   First worn by German soldiers in the 18th century, these military riding boots became popular in England, particularly during the Regency period (1811-1820), with their polished leather and ornamental tassels. Initially used as standard issue footwear for light cavalry regiments, especially hussars, they would become widely worn by civilians as well.  The boots had a low heel, and a semi-pointed toe that made them practical for mounted troops, as they allowed easy use of stirrups.  They reached to the knee and had a decorative tassel at the top of each shaft, with a "v" notch in front.  The Hessian boot would evolve into the rubber work boots known as "wellies" and the cowboy boot.
