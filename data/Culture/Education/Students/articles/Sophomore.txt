In the United States, a sophomore (/ˈsɑːfmɔːr/ or /ˈsɒfəmɔːr/)   is a student in the second year of study at high school or college. The 10th grade is the second year of a student's high school period (usually aged 15-16) and is referred to as sophomore year.   In How to Read a Book, the Aristotelean philosopher and founder of the "Great Books of the Western World" program Mortimer Adler says, "There have always been literate ignoramuses, who have read too widely, and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a mixture of learning and folly which might be applied to the bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all 'sophomores.'"  High school sophomores are expected to begin preparing for the college application process, including increasing and focusing their extracurricular activities. Students at this level are also considered to be developing greater ability for abstract thinking.  In the United States, college sophomores are advised to begin thinking of career options and to get involved in volunteering or social organisations on or near campus.
