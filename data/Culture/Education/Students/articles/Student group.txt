A student group is an organization of students, typically at a high school, college or university, who share a common background or interest.  Student groups may be supervised by a member of faculty, but are typically organized and attended independently.  Student groups may elect people to positions of responsibility in the group, such as president, vice-president, treasurer, and business manager. Students may form groups for people of a common ethnicity or religion.  Others form around common interests such as science, art, music, and sports.  Some student groups focus on a particular aspect of the school, such as community service, student government, or environmental activism.  One specific type is for LGBT students; in high school these are often called gay-straight alliances.
