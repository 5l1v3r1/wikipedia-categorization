In United States education, a senior is a student in the fourth year of study (generally high school or college/university study).   In the United States, the twelfth grade is usually the fourth and final year of a student's high school period and is referred to as his/her senior year. In England and Wales, students in their tenth year and above in Secondary School are seniors ; in Scotland, students in their fifth year and above are seniors. In the  province of Ontario, high school students in their third year and above are considered to be seniors, while in the province of Alberta, only grade twelves are counted as seniors  even though both provinces are Canadian (due to the fact that high school is only grades ten-twelve in Alberta). In the United States, the fourth year that a student has been at a higher institution, is known as the senior year. In college athletics, a student in their final year of eligibility is known as a senior.  The term super senior is used in the United States to refer to a fifth-year student who has not completed the graduation requirements by the end of the fourth year, and thus is required to stay an additional year to complete said requirements.
