Arts integration differs from traditional education by its inclusion of both the arts discipline and a traditional subject as part of learning (e.g. using improvisational drama skills to learn about conflict in writing.) The goal of arts integration is to increase knowledge of a general subject area while concurrently fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of the fine and performing arts.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts defines arts integration as \"an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject and meets evolving objectives.\"\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History_of_arts_education_and_arts_integration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History of arts education and arts integration</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Arts_integration_research_and_advocacy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arts integration research and advocacy</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Key_players\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Key players</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Art_education_obstacles\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Art education obstacles</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#No_Child_Left_Behind\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">No Child Left Behind</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#School_budgets\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">School budgets</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Practical_uses\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Practical uses</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Arts_integrated_teachers\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arts integrated teachers</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#The_contribution_of_arts_education_to_children\u2019s_development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The contribution of arts education to children\u2019s development</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Academic_effects\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Academic effects</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Socio-emotional_development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Socio-emotional development</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Socio-cultural_development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Socio-cultural development</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Cognitive_development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Cognitive development</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Integration_of_arts_in_classroom_curriculum\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Integration of arts in classroom curriculum</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Arts_Technology_Integration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arts Technology Integration</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#UNESCO_Arts_Integration_Program\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">UNESCO Arts Integration Program</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Conclusion</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-20\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_arts_education_and_arts_integration\">History of arts education and arts integration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History of arts education and arts integration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Arts integration is related to <a href=\"/wiki/Arts_in_education\" title=\"Arts in education\">arts education</a> in schools. Arts education, while existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Dewey\" title=\"John Dewey\">John Dewey</a>'s Progressive Education Theory. The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in American schools was Leon Winslow's <i>The Integrated School Art Program (1939).</i> For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being.\n</p><p>According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner. Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work,<i> Enlightened Cherishing</i>. Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of <a href=\"/wiki/Cognition\" title=\"Cognition\">cognition</a>. He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their interactivity\u2014the arts move learning beyond what is written or read.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Cassandra_B._Whyte\" title=\"Cassandra B. Whyte\">Cassandra B. Whyte</a> emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime. The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Whyte advocated including aspects of art education with <a href=\"/wiki/Locus_of_control\" title=\"Locus of control\">locus of control</a> identification counseling experiences to help higher education students develop confidence in their unique problem solving abilities in the classroom and in life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Formerly, <a href=\"/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"No Child Left Behind\">No Child Left Behind</a> legislation describes arts education as \"essential to every child's education,\" and include it as one of the Core Subjects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Currently, <a href=\"/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative\" title=\"Common Core State Standards Initiative\">Common Core</a> and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning. Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever. The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arts_integration_research_and_advocacy\">Arts integration research and advocacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Arts integration research and advocacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Arts advocacy discourse currently presents two main opposing views in support of arts in education. The first points to economic grounds that art teaches \"21st-century skills\" like collaboration and innovation, which are necessary only as a means to breed productivity for the growth of the market. The second, alternative approach focuses instead on the philosophical value of creative inquiry that art instills in students, arguing lifelong development with no end in mind as a necessary habit borne out of an arts education.

These important areas are considered by many the tools for success for student achievement. A consequence of predominately emphasizing these three areas of academic study is a lack of attention to other major areas of academics, mainly the arts. Viewing the arts as insignificant has had a major impact on teaching creativity to students.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"No_Child_Left_Behind\">No Child Left Behind</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: No Child Left Behind\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The importance of teaching the arts to students has recently been viewed as less essential than teaching other core studies, particularly by school administrators. Educational institutions are attempting to maintain federal standards to receive government funding. These standards focus predominantly on subjects such as English and math and are also highly emphasized during standardized testing. If schools can improve student achievement within these areas, they do not become vulnerable to a loss or reduction in federal funding. Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, \u201cIn a time when President Bush\u2019s \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study. This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes as well as a large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"School_budgets\">School budgets</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: School budgets\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While a sizable amount of the educational budget is spent on these important areas of academic study, schools are finding that there is less money for what some would consider as non-essential courses, such as higher level music and art. According to the academic journal The Electronic Musician, \u201cOn March 2, 2011, both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate a number of small education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, including the complete defunding of the Arts in Education program, a $40 million fund that supports competitive grants and national initiatives\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> While small reductions to budgets are common during a recession, some states have reduced their arts budgets drastically. According to the Teaching Artists Journal, \u201cIn 2004, total state funding for the arts will drop to $272 million, a 23% decrease in just the last year. And nearly two-thirds of that total decrease comes from cutbacks in just three of the hardest hit states: California, Michigan and Florida\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> While the reduction of funding for the arts has been reduced nearly a quarter in different areas, educators often struggle to maintain their arts program as a vital skill to teach to students. The funds that have been reduced now disallow the arts to provide furnishings and supplies as well as instructor salaries that are essential to these programs. As a result, art courses are not regarded with the same amount of respect and students are denied a creative outlet within their education.\n</p><p>Budget issues and the reduction of spending for the arts has caused numerous schools to attempt to find additional sources to help support their arts program. School administrators frequently look towards state funding to assist in financing the arts. Grants and other means to finance the arts are increasingly becoming more frequent, but they are temporary solutions to fund these programs. Schools often work with local and state governments to receive income; however numerous state governments are experiencing other budget deficit issues and can rarely afford to finance such a program in the amount that is needed. So to help support the arts, often there is need for assistance from private contributors. Still, as with grants, private contributors cannot donate enough funds to adequately support the arts in education and cannot contribute as consistently as the government could. Funding the arts in education still remains a large and unresolved issue for many school districts nationwide.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Practical_uses\">Practical uses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Practical uses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Advocacy for the arts raises an issue of how essential teaching the arts to students actually is. Due to statistical analysis of a perceived lapse in mathematical and reading skills of our youth, many parents feel that importance of the arts is less crucial than other fundamental areas of academic study. This is namely due, in part, by the fact that art is viewed as less needed in the workforce. However many advocates argue that students in the arts excel in interpreting and analyzing visual and spatial information. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, \"Educators have acknowledged that the arts are basic to the acquisition of a well-rounded education. The arts provide meaning to learning. They serve as a vehicle for acquiring the skills to which educational reformers have said students should aspire: problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> These skills that are acquired by the arts are actually needed characteristics in the modern workforce. The stress of the importance for the arts then becomes one that benefits the students for their future careers. While many view the arts as inapplicable in today\u2019s modern workforce, many would argue that the arts provide positive results for students competing in today\u2019s competitive job market.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arts_integrated_teachers\">Arts integrated teachers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Arts integrated teachers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>An issue commonly brought is that \u201cnot all teachers are artists,\u201d meaning that there aren\u2019t enough teachers capable of doing art to teach in every classroom. However, this is not the case, as any teacher can become an arts teacher. While art is, to its core, incredibly subjective, there is a basis for every practice. In the fine arts there are the elements and principles of design, the color wheel, etc. In music there is basic music theory. In drama, there is basic play structure, acting theory, etc. Whether or not a teacher can do these things is irrelevant; if they can be taught, that information can be passed on from the teacher to the student. The goal is not to create master artists, but rather teach basic arts skills, processes, and aesthetic quality, and encourage creative teaching techniques.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> This basic understanding can then be passed on to the students, who then learn by doing. These skills are simple and easy to learn and teach, and will be infinitely useful in creating lesson plans and in practice. Once an arts-integrated environment is established, techniques, examples, and information can be shared amongst colleagues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>  They can discuss findings and share what works and does not work within the classroom.\n</p><p>Funding and advocacy for the arts still remains the largest issue that is currently facing teaching this important area to students. Many districts and supporters speak out for more funding to ensure advancement in the arts, however there is little money to be shared across the many programs in education. Many fear that certain arts programs may be removed from some schools due to these concerns. While art education is considered one of the core subjects in the No Child Left Behind Act, there are many who fear for its future.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_contribution_of_arts_education_to_children.E2.80.99s_development\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_contribution_of_arts_education_to_children\u2019s_development\">The contribution of arts education to children\u2019s development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arts_integration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: The contribution of arts education to children\u2019s development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The arts are often perceived as a hobby, an interest or purely as a recreational occupation.

In a time of economic instability resources are strictly distributed and the arts are ever so often first to get cut. Yet, research on the effects of arts education on children\u2019s learning and development show significant positive outcomes on children exposed to arts programs with teacher supervision compared to children not exposed to arts education.

Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance.
