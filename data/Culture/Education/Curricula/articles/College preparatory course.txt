A College preparatory course is a means by which college bound high school students may better meet the more stringent scholastic requirements for entry into colleges and universities.   Students taking college-preparatory courses may have an increased quantity of classwork, and expectations to achieve are at a higher level.   The GPA (grade point average) weight for college-preparatory courses may have more value for college entry programs than regular courses.   College prep courses are particularly appropriate for providing the academic background needed to succeed in a degree program at a college or university.   Above college-preparatory in difficulty is honors, where the advanced structure while similar in many ways to college prep, requires even more effort from the student.   In many schools, a student can move from college-preparatory courses to Advanced Placement AP  courses, if they attain a certain average.
