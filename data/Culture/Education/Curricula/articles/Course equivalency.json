{"parse":{"title":"Course equivalency","pageid":12498132,"revid":836514159,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Course equivalency</b> is the term used in <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">higher education</a> describing how a <a href=\"/wiki/Course_(education)\" title=\"Course (education)\">course</a> offered by one <a href=\"/wiki/College\" title=\"College\">college</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/University\" title=\"University\">university</a> relates to a course offered by another. If a course is viewed as equal or more challenging in subject and course material than the course offered by the receiving college or university, the course can be noted as an equivalent course. A course equivalency can be unilateral, meaning it is deemed equivalent by the receiver.  Or, it could be bilateral, meaning both sender and receiver acknowledge their acceptance of each other's course as equivalent.  The methods and measures used to determine course equivalency vary by institution, state, region and country.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Course_equivalency&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/College_transfer\" title=\"College transfer\">College transfer</a> often requires the determination and evaluation of prior course learning.  Receiving institutions usually maintain course equivalency tables listing how courses equate by sender institution.  Unless the receiving institution maintains an online public reference to the course equivalency tables, students have difficulty ascertaining transferbility of their credit experiences. As a result, student transitions from sender to receiver can be very problematic. This has led a number of states to initiate legislate reforms, regulations and mandates to augment the tracking of course equivalencies. A variety of statistics, studies, and initiatives have been documented (see References).\n</p><p>The most common course attributes evaluated to determine course equivalency are description, academic <a href=\"/wiki/Credit_(education)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Credit (education)\">credits</a>, accreditation, type of instructor, method of <a href=\"/wiki/Education\" title=\"Education\">instruction</a>, level of instruction, <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_outcomes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Learning outcomes\">learning outcomes</a>, grade scale and grade earned, pre-requisites, co-requisites and <a href=\"/wiki/Textbook\" title=\"Textbook\">textbook</a>.  This is not an exclusive list of course attributes. Generally, <a href=\"/wiki/Teacher\" title=\"Teacher\">faculty</a> perform the determination of course equivalencies.  Course equivalency decisions can often be appealed by presenting evidence to an academic department.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Course_equivalency&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/College_transfer\" title=\"College transfer\">College transfer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Articulation_(education)\" title=\"Articulation (education)\">Articulation (education)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Career_college\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Career college\">Career college</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Community_college\" title=\"Community college\">Community college</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Junior_college\" title=\"Junior college\">Junior college</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/University\" title=\"University\">University</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of colleges and universities\">List of colleges and universities</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Course_equivalency&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n<p>Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).
