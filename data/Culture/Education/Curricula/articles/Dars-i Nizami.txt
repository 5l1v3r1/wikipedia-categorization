Dars-i Nizami is a study curriculum or system used in traditional Islamic institutions (madrassas) and Dar Ul Ulooms, which originated in the Indian subcontinent in the 18th century and can now also be found in parts of South Africa, Canada, the United States, the Caribbean and the UK.  The founder or designer of the Dars-i Nizami system was Mulla Nizam Uddin As Sihaalwi (1161 hijri/1748 c.e.) from the Farangi Mahal ulema (Islamic scholars) group, after whom the Dars-i Nizami were named (Robinson, 2001: p72).
