Connections Academy provides online school products and services to virtual schools for grades K-12, including full-time online schools bearing the "Connections Academy" name across the country. It is based in Columbia, Maryland  and is part of Pearson's Online & Blended Learning K-12 group. It supports public online schools for grades K-12 across the United States. A private online school, International Connections Academy,  is also available to students who live abroad. Online schools are an alternative to traditional public schools.  Similar to charter schools, they are subsidized by the state.  Although they contract with many non-profit schools, they are not a non-profit organization.  In the spring of 2001, Sylvan Ventures started a separate business unit to create a virtual school program with its first virtual schools beginning in Wisconsin and Colorado.  The company first began providing online school services to two schools in the fall of 2002. In September 2004, Connections Academy was sold to an investor group led by Apollo Management, L.P. The company now operates public schools under management contracts from charter schools or school districts. A new corporate entity called Connections Education was established in early 2011.  In this same year, on September 15, 2011, Pearson, an international learning company, acquired Connections Education for in excess of $400 million.  Connections Education consists of two education-focused divisions including Connections Academy and Pearson Online & Blended Learning that serves educational institutions and other organizations with online learning solutions. In October 2017, Alabama became the 34th state to partner with Connection Academy.  In December 2017, it was announced that one Connections Academy school's contract would not be renewed and the decision is under appeal.    2016 & 2015 awards include:
