In traditional curriculum planning, a list of content that will be taught is created and/or selected.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In backward design, the educator starts with goals, creates or plans out <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_assessment\" title=\"Educational assessment\">assessments</a> and finally makes <a href=\"/wiki/Lesson_plan\" title=\"Lesson plan\">lesson plans</a>. Supporters of backward design liken the process to using a \"road map\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In this case, the destination is chosen first and then the road map is used to plan the trip to the desired destination. In contrast, in traditional curriculum planning there is no formal destination identified before the journey begins.\n</p><p>The idea in backward design is to teach toward the \"end point\" or learning goals, which typically ensures that content taught remains focused and organized.  This, in turn, aims at promoting better understanding of the content or processes to be learned for students.  The educator is able to focus on addressing what the students need to learn, what data can be collected to show that the students have learned the desired outcomes (or <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_standards\" title=\"Learning standards\">learning standards</a>) and how to ensure the students will learn. Although backward design is based on the same components of the <a href=\"/wiki/ADDIE_model\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ADDIE model\">ADDIE model</a>, backward design is a condensed version of these components with far less flexibility.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Curriculum_design,_and_instructional_design\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Curriculum design, and instructional design</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Advantages\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Advantages</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#The_importance_of_assessment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The importance of assessment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Other_models_of_instructional_design\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other models of instructional design</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#ADDIE_model_of_design\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">ADDIE model of design</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Dick_and_Carey_model_(also_known_as_the_Systems_Approach_Model)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Dick and Carey model (also known as the <i>Systems Approach Model</i>)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Kemp_instructional_design_model_(also_known_as_the_Morrison,_Ross_and_Kemp_Model)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Kemp instructional design model (also known as the <i>Morrison, Ross and Kemp Model</i>)</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Supporting_research_using_backward_design\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Supporting research using backward design</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Application\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Application</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Criticisms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Criticisms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Curriculum_design.2C_and_instructional_design\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Curriculum_design,_and_instructional_design\">Curriculum design, and instructional design</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Curriculum design, and instructional design\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Backward design is often used in conjunction with two other terms: curriculum design and <a href=\"/wiki/Instructional_design\" title=\"Instructional design\">instructional design</a>.\n</p><p>Curriculum design is the act of designing or developing curricula for students.  Curricula may differ from country to country and further still between provinces or states within a country.  Curriculum is based on benchmark standards deemed important by the government.

Based around those components, the instructor then has the opportunity to choose the design model and stages that work best for them in their specific situation.  This way they can achieve the appropriate learning outcomes or create a plan or strategy for improvement.

A statement of objectives is used to indicate the kinds of changes in the student to be brought about so that instructional activities can be planned and developed in a way likely to attain these objectives.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The term \"backward design\" was introduced to curriculum design in 1998/9 by Jay McTighe and Grant Wiggins (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Understanding_by_Design\" title=\"Understanding by Design\">Understanding by Design</a></i>). The  somewhat idiosyncratic term is ultimately due to James S. Coleman, who in his <i>Foundations of Social Theory</i> (1990) used it to parallel the term \"backward policing\" which he coined for a policy which he found in the production process in <a href=\"/wiki/Honda\" title=\"Honda\">Honda</a> factories.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advantages\">Advantages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Advantages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to Doug Buehl (2000),<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> advantages of backward design include: \n</p>\n<ul><li>Students are not as likely to become so lost in the factual detail of a unit that they miss the point of studying the original topic.</li>\n<li>Instruction looks toward global understandings and not just daily activities; daily lessons are constructed with a focus on what the overall \"gain\" from the unit is to be.</li>\n<li>Assessment is designed before lesson planning, so that instruction drives students toward exactly what they need to know.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_importance_of_assessment\">The importance of assessment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The importance of assessment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The primary starting point for backward design is to become familiar with the standards/outcomes for the grade level and curriculum being taught.  The second part of curriculum planning with backward design is finding appropriate assessments. It can be difficult for \"traditional\" <a href=\"/wiki/Educator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Educator\">educators</a> to switch to this model because it is hard to conceptualize an assessment before deciding on lessons and instruction. The idea is that the assessments (<a href=\"/wiki/Formative_assessment\" title=\"Formative assessment\">formative</a> and/or <a href=\"/wiki/Summative_assessment\" title=\"Summative assessment\">summative</a>) should meet the initial goals identified.\n</p><p>Wiggins and McTighe (2008) also utilize the \"WHERE\" approach during the assessment stage of the process.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>W</b> stands for students knowing <i>where they are heading</i>, <i>why they are heading there</i>, <i>what they know</i>, <i>where they might go wrong in the process</i>, and <i>what is required of them</i>.</li>\n<li><b>H</b> stands for <i>hooking</i> the students on the topic of study.</li>\n<li><b>E</b> stands for students <i>exploring</i> and <i>experiencing ideas</i> and being <i>equipped with the necessary understanding</i> to master the standard/outcome being taught.</li>\n<li><b>R</b> stands for providing opportunities for students to <i>rehearse, revise</i>, and <i>refine</i> their work.</li>\n<li><b>E</b> stands for student <i>evaluation</i>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_models_of_instructional_design\">Other models of instructional design</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Other models of instructional design\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Instructional_design\" title=\"Instructional design\">Instructional design</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"text\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg/200px-ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"107\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg/300px-ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg/400px-ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"768\" data-file-height=\"410\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:ADDIE_Model_of_Design.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>ADDIE Model of Design</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ADDIE_model_of_design\">ADDIE model of design</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: ADDIE model of design\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most models of instructional design follow the core elements found in the <a href=\"/wiki/ADDIE_model\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ADDIE model\">ADDIE model</a> of design: <i>analyze</i> (designer develops an understanding of the desired outcomes and the learner's knowledge and skills); <i>design</i> (documents learning outcomes, assessment tools, exercise and content); <i>develop</i> (creating the learning materials); <i>implement</i> (the created learning materials are distributed to the learners); and <i>evaluate</i> (the effectiveness of the learning materials is assessed and documented).<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>  Many instructional designers and training developers use the ADDIE model as a generic process for creating other models.

The model includes the following components: (1) identify instructional goals; (2) conduct instructional analysis; (3) identify entry behaviors and learner characteristics; (4) write performance objectives; (5) develop assessment instruments; (6) develop instructional strategy; (7) develop and select instructional materials; (8) design and conduct formative evaluation of instruction; and (9) design and conduct summative evaluation.  Both the Dick and Carey model and the backward design model are goal and objective oriented; assessment is created based on learning objectives and goals, and instruction is created based on evaluation and assessment. The Dick and Carey model, however, is a more systemic model in that making changes to components affects other components and, therefore, the changes occur in parallel.  In the more linear backward design model, the steps are non-flexible which means that skipping or changing steps is not an option.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Kemp_instructional_design_model_.28also_known_as_the_Morrison.2C_Ross_and_Kemp_Model.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kemp_instructional_design_model_(also_known_as_the_Morrison,_Ross_and_Kemp_Model)\">Kemp instructional design model (also known as the <i>Morrison, Ross and Kemp Model</i>)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Kemp instructional design model (also known as the Morrison, Ross and Kemp Model)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Kemp instructional design model is a holistic form of instructional design, taking into account all factors of the learning environment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  It is very systemic and also follows the same basic design pattern of the <a href=\"/wiki/ADDIE_model\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ADDIE model\">ADDIE model</a>.

The largest difference between backward design and the Kemp model is that the Kemp model is meant to be used on a smaller scale.

Similarly, it leaves little room for improvisation.</li>\n<li>Teachers who know their curriculum and lesson trajectory that was led by Backwards Design may find that over adherence depletes their agility to focus on the learning experience and, with students or colleagues, induce new routes towards learning goals. A focus on principles of creative development such as contextual probing, improvisation, and juxtaposition may lead students to discover and know that which was unanticipated by the teacher or curriculum developers. In this, BD is incomplete or a potential recipe for student boredom.</li>\n<li>Desired results may fall short of student potential. This model assumes the relative level of students, yet students may have the capacity to go beyond desired results. In assuming an end goal, students are not empowered to reach for their own goals or to follow a process that may lead to results that surprise both the student and the teacher. For the master teacher, it would be worthwhile to move past fixed goals  and establish processes and student choices that lead them to relevant yet indeterminate locations.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Backward_design&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Assessment_for_learning\" title=\"Assessment for learning\">Assessment for learning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Cognitivism_(psychology)\" title=\"Cognitivism (psychology)\">Cognitivism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Teacher\" title=\"Teacher\">Educators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Lesson_plan\" title=\"Lesson plan\">Lesson plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Ralph_W._Tyler\" title=\"Ralph W.
