Section 23 (1)(b) had its origins in a unanimous agreement between the provincial leaders and Trudeau reached in 1978 in <a href=\"/wiki/St._Andrews,_New_Brunswick\" title=\"St. Andrews, New Brunswick\">St. Andrews, New Brunswick</a>, in which children of citizens could receive schooling in their language.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  When this idea was brought to the Charter in the 1980s, Trudeau also successfully secured agreement from provincial leaders that section 23 could not be nullified by the <a href=\"/wiki/Section_Thirty-three_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\">section 33</a> notwithstanding clause.\n</p><p>When the government of Quebec had passed the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Charter_of_the_French_Language\" title=\"Charter of the French Language\">Charter of the French Language</a></i> in 1977, only parents who had gone to English schools in Quebec could have their children educated in English.  Concerns for the erosion of the educational rights of <a href=\"/wiki/English-speaking_Quebecer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English-speaking Quebecer\">English-speaking Quebeckers</a> thus led to section 23(1)(b) being written so that that part of the Quebec law would become unconstitutional.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dyck_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dyck-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  This portion of the Charter of the French Language was indeed struck down by the courts in <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Attorney_General_of_Quebec_v._Quebec_Protestant_School_Boards&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Attorney General of Quebec v. Quebec Protestant School Boards (page does not exist)\">Attorney General of Quebec v. Quebec Protestant School Boards</a></i> (1984).  The verdict prompted the passing of Bill 86 in 1993 which amended the Charter of the French Language, stating that any child of a Canadian citizen whose parent or sibling had received English-medium education in <i>Canada</i> (rather than Quebec specifically) could attend English-medium schools<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p><p>While there was decreased minority language education in Quebec at the time when the <i>Charter</i> was adopted, several other provinces (where <a href=\"/wiki/English_Canadian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English Canadian\">English Canadians</a> were the majority) had no French language schools at all.  In contrast, in 2005 all provinces had minority language education schools.  In 1986, 152,225 <a href=\"/wiki/French_Canadian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"French Canadian\">French Canadian</a> students outside of Quebec were going to French-language schools in accordance with section 23, and in 2001 the number was 149,042.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> There have been some roadblocks to minority-language education since the Charter came into effect, such as a need for more French-speaking teachers and decreased enrollment in English-language education in rural Quebec, as well as challenges from both francophone and anglophone minority parents that education of equal quality is not being provided by their provincial government. The relative lack of French-language post secondary education opportunities (colleges and universities) outside of Quebec influences the choice of some French Canadian students to switch English language instruction, especially as they advance towards the end of their compulsory education.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The rights of official language minority students remains a topic contested in provincial and federal courts, with funding for legal costs for court actions being provided by federal governments Court Challenges Program.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Application\">Application</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Section_23_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Application\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg/300px-Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg/450px-Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg/600px-Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2560\" data-file-height=\"1920\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ecole_de_l_anse_au_sable.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/L%27Anse-au-sable\" title=\"L&#39;Anse-au-sable\">L'Anse-au-sable</a>, a French language school in <a href=\"/wiki/Kelowna,_British_Columbia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kelowna, British Columbia\">Kelowna, British Columbia</a>.

This was a conciliatory gesture made by the authors of the <i>Charter</i> which failed to obtain Quebec's agreement to the constitutional changes in 1982. This provision will not be valid in Quebec until the provincial government chooses to ratify it. \n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sufficient_numbers\">Sufficient numbers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Section_23_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Sufficient numbers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While section 23 guarantees its rights to Canadian citizens who are also <a href=\"/wiki/Parent\" title=\"Parent\">parents</a>, as long as they speak English or French as a minority, the ability to exercise this right to send one's child to minority language education is limited by the possibility that the minority language community in which one lives may be too small.  Sections 23(3)(a) and (b) state the \"number of children\" must be \"sufficient to warrant\" government spending for either schooling or the building of <a href=\"/wiki/School\" title=\"School\">school</a> facilities.\n</p><p>These limits were defined by the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada\" title=\"Supreme Court of Canada\">Supreme Court of Canada</a> in the 1990 case <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mahe_v._Alberta\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mahe v. Alberta\">Mahe v. Alberta</a></i>.  The Court declared that section 23 guaranteed a \"sliding scale.\"  In certain circumstances, the children whose parents could exercise the right might be so few that literally no minority language education may be provided by the government.  With a greater number of children, some schools might be required to provide <a href=\"/wiki/Classroom\" title=\"Classroom\">classrooms</a> in which the children could receive minority language education.  An even greater number would require the <a href=\"/wiki/Construction\" title=\"Construction\">construction</a> of new schools dedicated solely to minority language education. \n</p><p>The Court also ruled that the right to \"facilities\" in section 23(3)(b) could include more than classrooms and schools.  Namely, a large number of children could mandate that minority language schools have their own <a href=\"/wiki/School_board\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School board\">school boards</a>.  Somewhere between the right to a school and a right to a school board was a right for the minority language community to have some members on a larger school board.\n</p><p>In the case <i><a href=\"/wiki/Arsenault-Cameron_v._Prince_Edward_Island\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island\">Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island</a></i> (2000), the Court further defined sufficient numbers.  As 49 French Canadian children were ready for minority language instruction in <a href=\"/wiki/Summerside,_Prince_Edward_Island\" title=\"Summerside, Prince Edward Island\">Summerside, Prince Edward Island</a>, it was argued by the province that a number this low would only require <a href=\"/wiki/School_bus\" title=\"School bus\">school buses</a> to transport them to a nearby French language school, rather than the construction of a separate school.  The Court, however, ruled that if a new school were actually built, it could draw in more people than those whose families had previously expressed interest, and thus the number could be somewhat fewer than 100.  While even a school this small might struggle with providing certain educational services, protecting the culture of the minority language community was considered too important and the number of students was ruled sufficient for the building of a new school.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manitoba\">Manitoba</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Section_23_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Manitoba\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The decision to allow for Minority education rights (according to legal decisions based on Article 23) along a sliding scale had already been nascent in Manitoba and was foreshadowed by the Laurier-Greenway compromise of 1896.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2010)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> This compromise came in response to what was argued to be unconstitutional provincial school legislation (Schools Act 1890) in relation to the constitutionally entrenched Manitoba Act of 1870. In Manitoba where the Public Schools Act had been reformed along the lines of minority vs majority language rights and a changing population proportion of English to French (where English speakers out-numbered French by the 1890s), the Laurier-Greenway compromise allowed for a school district in a community by community basis to offer French language instruction if the French population was large enough and requested such instruction.\n</p><p>In 1916 under Premier T.C. Norris the prior compromise was rescinded and the Franco-Manitoban minority lost their right to receive instruction in French in Manitoba's public schools. Section 93 of the BNA act(1867) in the Province's opinion had been contravened with the Laurier-Greenway Compromise and no longer had legal standing. Moreover, in section 93 of the BNA the province had ultimate authority to decide on minority language instruction. The latter remained status-quo until two changes were made to Manitoba's Public School Act (PSA) in 1966 and 1970 when French language instruction was once again recognized as an official language of instruction.\n</p><p>Manitoba's minority French language instruction rights have developed since the introduction of the Charter and Section 23 to a point where they have allowed for the inclusion of a separate school board (<a href=\"/wiki/Division_Scolaire_Franco-Manitobaine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine\">La Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine</a> DSFM) which is fully funded by the provincial treasury and operates throughout the Province. Significant with regards to the Province's (Manitoba) interpretation of section 23 is how the \"number of Students\" and not \"mother tongue\" is the basis upon which French language (minority) instruction rights are respected. Minority language instruction in Manitoba is in transition and still presents various legal issues and related constitutionally charged questions (see <a href=\"/wiki/Manitoba_Act_1870\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Manitoba Act 1870\">Manitoba Act 1870</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_Riel\" title=\"Louis Riel\">Louis Riel</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Manitoba_Schools_Question\" title=\"Manitoba Schools Question\">Manitoba Schools Question</a>, Laurier-Greenway Compromise).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Section_23_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Dyck-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dyck_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dyck_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dyck_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dyck, Rand.
