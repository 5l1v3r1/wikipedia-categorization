The Three Minute Thesis competition or 3MT, is an annual competition held in over 200 universities worldwide. It is open to PhD students, and challenges participants to present their research in just 180 seconds, in an engaging form that can be understood by an intelligent audience with no background in the research area. This exercise develops presentation, research and academic communication skills and supports the development of research students' capacity to explain their work effectively. The competition originated at the University of Queensland (UQ) in 2008. There are currently three categories, UQ, Trans-Tasman and International. This category features students from the University of Queensland.  2015  2014  2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2015 Finals held at The University of Queensland; 2014 Finals held at The University of Western Australia; 2013 Finals held at The University of Western Sydney; 2012 Finals held at The University of Queensland;  2011 Finals held at the University of Western Australia. 2010 Finals held at University of Queensland;
