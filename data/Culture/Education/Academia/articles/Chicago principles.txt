The Chicago principles (″Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression″)  (or the Chicago Statement) are a set of guiding principles expressing a commitment to freedom of speech and freedom of expression on college campuses in the United States. Initially adopted by the University of Chicago following a report issued by a designated Committee on Freedom of Expression in 2014, they came to be known as the “Chicago principles” after other universities across the country committed to the principles or modelled their own based on similar goals.   Since 2014, several other universities have committed to the principles, including Princeton and Purdue.    As of September 2018, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education reported that 45 American colleges and universities had "adopted or endorsed the Chicago Statement or a substantially similar statement."  In July 2014, the University of Chicago formed the ‘University of Chicago's Committee on Freedom of Expression’ after a series of incidents where students at various schools sought to prevent controversial commencement speakers that year.  The committee returned a report which re-emphasized the school’s commitment to principles of free expression as “an essential element of the University’s culture.” The University's commitment to free speech gained national media attention in August 2016, when Dean of Students John Ellison sent a letter to the incoming freshman class of 2020 affirming the free speech principles and stating that the University did not support the use of trigger warnings or safe spaces.  In adopting the principles, Purdue president, Mitch Daniels later said “we didn’t see how we could improve on the language.”
