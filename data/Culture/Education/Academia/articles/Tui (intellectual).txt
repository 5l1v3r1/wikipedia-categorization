A Tui is an intellectual who sells his or her abilities and opinions as a commodity in the marketplace[clarification needed] or who uses them[clarification needed][vague] to support the dominant ideology of an oppressive society.  The German modernist theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht invented the term and used it in a range of critical and creative projects, including the material that he developed in the mid-1930s for his so-called Tui-Novel—an unfinished satire on intellectuals in the German Empire and Weimar Republic—and his epic comedy from the early 1950s, Turandot or the Whitewashers' Congress. The word is a neologism that results from the acronym of a word play on "intellectual" ("Tellekt-Ual-In").  According to Mark Clark:  Brecht routinely referred to the members of the Frankfurt School, particularly Theodor Adorno, as "Tuis".  The corresponding term "Tuism" describes the theory and practice of the Tui-intellectual.
