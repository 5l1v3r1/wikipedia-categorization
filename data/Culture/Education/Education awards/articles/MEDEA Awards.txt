The MEDEA Awards is a free competition launched in November 2007 and supported by the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission through the MEDEA2020 project.  It aims to encourage innovation in the use of moving images and sound in education,  across Europe and beyond.  The MEDEA Awards are integrated in the Media & Learning Conference,  a yearly conference about the use of media in education which takes place in Brussels, Belgium.
