The proposal was that public elementary schools should be closed one day a week, in addition to Sunday, so that parents could have their children receive religious instruction outside the school premises. This idea was later implemented by Dr. <a href=\"/wiki/William_Albert_Wirt_(educationalist)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"William Albert Wirt (educationalist)\">William Albert Wirt</a>, an educator and superintendent of the school district of <a href=\"/wiki/Gary,_Indiana\" title=\"Gary, Indiana\">Gary, Indiana</a>, in 1914. In the first years of Wirt's implementation, over 600 students participated in off-campus religious education.\n</p><p>Most released time programs were held outside school property, and the public school system had no involvement in the religious programs taught there.\n</p><p>Released time began to grow rapidly. In 1922, programs were active in 23 states. Approximately 40,000 students, from 200 school districts, were enrolled in such programs. In 1932, 30 states had active programs in 400 communities with enrollment of 250,000 students. In 1942, participation reached 1.5 million students in 46 states. Released time reached its peak enrollment totals in 1947, when 2 million students were enrolled in some 2,200 communities. Legislation paving the way for released time programs had been adopted by 12 states. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.releasedtime.org/besthtml/best_history.htm\">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legal_challenge\">Legal challenge</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Released_time&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Legal challenge\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1945, <a href=\"/wiki/Vashti_McCollum\" title=\"Vashti McCollum\">Vashti McCollum</a> brought legal action against the <a href=\"/wiki/Champaign,_Illinois\" title=\"Champaign, Illinois\">Champaign, Illinois</a> public school district. McCollum was the mother of a student in the district. McCollum's suit stated that her eight-year-old son had been coerced and ostracized by school officials because her family had chosen to not participate in the district's in-school religious instruction program. The Champaign district's religious instruction was held during regular school hours in the classrooms in Champaign's public schools and was taught by members of a local religious association, with the approval of school officials.\n</p><p>McCollum's suit argued that religious instruction held during regular school hours on public school property constituted an <a href=\"/wiki/Establishment_Clause\" title=\"Establishment Clause\">establishment of religion</a>, in violation of the <a href=\"/wiki/US_Constitution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US Constitution\">US Constitution</a>, and violated also the <a href=\"/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause\" title=\"Equal Protection Clause\">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.\n</p><p>The state district court ruled against McCollum, as did the <a href=\"/wiki/Illinois_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Illinois Supreme Court\">Illinois Supreme Court</a> upon appeal. However, in 1948, the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Supreme Court\">United States Supreme Court</a> ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, reversing the lower courts' decision. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=333&amp;invol=203\">[2]</a>. It ruled that the Champaign program was unconstitutional since it used the state's compulsory education system to aid in the teaching of religious doctrine and tax-supported school buildings were being used.\n</p><p>In the aftermath of that decision, <i><a href=\"/wiki/McCollum_v._Board_of_Education\" title=\"McCollum v. Board of Education\">McCollum v. Board of Education</a></i>, the number of released time classes dropped by 12 percent across the nation. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.bestnetwork.org/history.htm\">[3]</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zorach_v._Clauson\">Zorach v.

Clauson\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1952, the case of <a href=\"/wiki/Zorach_v._Clauson\" title=\"Zorach v. Clauson\">Zorach v. Clauson</a> came before the Supreme Court. The case involved the education law of <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_State\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New York State\">New York State</a>, particularly a regulation by which a public school was permitted to release students during school hours for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In a 6 to 3 ruling, the high court upheld the New York law.\n</p><p>In the majority opinion, Justice <a href=\"/wiki/William_O._Douglas\" title=\"William O. Douglas\">William O. Douglas</a> wrote that New York's program \"involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds\", unlike the earlier McCollum case that the Zorach plaintiffs had cited as precedent.\n</p><p>Douglas wrote that a public school \"may not coerce anyone to attend church, to observe a religious holiday, or to take religious instruction. But it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. No more than that is undertaken here.\"\n</p><p>The Court's opinion stated that\n</p>\n<dl><dd>In the McCollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction. Here, as we have said, the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction. We follow the McCollum case. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time program unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=343&amp;invol=306\">[4]</a></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Today\">Today</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Released_time&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Today\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are approximately 1,000 released time programs in operation today, ranging from kindergarten to high school, with 250,000 students enrolled. In some areas, including most public school districts in the state of <a href=\"/wiki/Utah\" title=\"Utah\">Utah</a>, released time programs allow students a daily class period, which may be used for extracurricular religious studies.\n</p><p>A multi-denominational Christian organization that supports Released Time Bible Education across the country is School Ministries, Inc. (SMI). It was created in 1990 to act as an association that assists local communities in the creation of Released Time Bible Education and to provide support for existing programs.  Although initially envisioned to have a South Carolina focus, SMI soon was undertaking a national role in responding to RTBE interests, addressing legal challenges, raising national visibility and addressing research needs.  Since 2003, SMI has experienced an annual growth rate of 10% in students served. (See School Ministries, Inc. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.schoolministries.org\">[5]</a>)\n</p><p>One notable large group taking released time for religious instruction are <a href=\"/wiki/Latter-Day_Saint\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Latter-Day Saint\">Latter-Day Saint</a> students. Most LDS students in ninth through twelfth grade attend weekday religious classes called <a href=\"/wiki/Church_Educational_System#Seminaries\" title=\"Church Educational System\">Seminary</a>. In the Western United States, such as in Idaho and Utah, it is common to find an LDS seminary building within close walking distance of public high schools, sometimes directly adjacent. In such situations, the LDS students will take one class period off from the public school as released time. The large numbers taking released time means the seminary has up to six or seven periods corresponding to the public school class periods.\n</p><p>Through the ministry Always Loved Ministry, many students who attend public schools in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are able to receive Christian Release Time Education. Pennsylvania School Code 1546 requires Pennsylvania public schools to accommodate a parent's request for Release Time Education by excusing their child from school to receive religious instruction outside of the school building.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT#SOAPBOX\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikipedia:NOT\"><span title=\"This text contains promotional language.
