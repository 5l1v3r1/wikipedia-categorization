But in its most developed form, children\u2019s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children\u2019s rights education, children\u2019s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.<sup id=\"cite_ref-implement_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-implement-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Fully developed children\u2019s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child.

Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention\u2019s provisions on education along three tracks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-verhellen2_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-verhellen2-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> First is the child\u2019s right to education on the basis equal opportunity (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28\">article 28</a>). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child\u2019s rights in education (articles <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2\">2</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12\">12</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13\">13</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14\">14</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15\">15</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19\">19</a>). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child\u2019s rights through education (article <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29\">29</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42\">42</a>). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.\n</p><p>This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children\u2019s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'\n</p><p>Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children\u2019s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-empower_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-empower-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-un_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-un-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-hodgkin_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hodgkin-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Value_of_children.E2.80.99s_human_rights_education\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Value_of_children\u2019s_human_rights_education\">Value of children\u2019s human rights education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Value of children\u2019s human rights education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Children\u2019s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children\u2019s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.<sup id=\"cite_ref-tibbitts_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tibbitts-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of <a href=\"/wiki/Bullying\" title=\"Bullying\">bullying</a> and stand up against a bully in the school playground.\n</p><p>Research by Katherine Covell and R.

Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-newman_movement_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-newman_movement-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities.

It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic <a href=\"/wiki/Pedagogy\" title=\"Pedagogy\">pedagogy</a> and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to <a href=\"/wiki/Adoption\" title=\"Adoption\">adoption</a>, education, and family.\n</p><p>Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Breton_Island\" title=\"Cape Breton Island\">Cape Breton</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>, in the late 1990s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-impact_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-impact-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-moral_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-moral-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum\" title=\"Curriculum\">Curriculum</a> materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from <a href=\"/wiki/Narcotics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Narcotics\">narcotics</a>, students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on <a href=\"/wiki/Human_sexuality\" title=\"Human sexuality\">sexuality</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_justice_in_Canada&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Youth justice in Canada (page does not exist)\">youth justice</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Child_abuse\" title=\"Child abuse\">child abuse</a>, and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against <a href=\"/wiki/Discrimination\" title=\"Discrimination\">discrimination</a>.  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children\u2019s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and <a href=\"/wiki/Child_labor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Child labor\">child labor</a>. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a <a href=\"/wiki/Sweatshop\" title=\"Sweatshop\">sweatshop</a> talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hampshire.2C_England\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hampshire,_England\">Hampshire, England</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Hampshire, England\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in <a href=\"/wiki/Hampshire\" title=\"Hampshire\">Hampshire County</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/England\" title=\"England\">England</a>, called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative.

They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.\n</p><p>After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hants_27-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hants-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities\u2014with funding from the <a href=\"/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)\">Ministry of Education</a>\u2014devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.\n</p><p>The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school \u2013 across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children\u2019s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Zealand\">New Zealand</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: New Zealand\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries.

The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand\u2019s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children\u2019s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hrie_28-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hrie-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.\n</p><p>To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children\u2019s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community \u2013 school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents \u2013 learn about children\u2019s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Initiatives_with_preschool\">Initiatives with preschool</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Initiatives with preschool\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in <a href=\"/wiki/British_Columbia\" title=\"British Columbia\">British Columbia</a> over a three-month period.<sup id=\"cite_ref-wallberg_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wallberg-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The introduction of \"The Rights Project\" was motivated in large part by observations of the children\u2019s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children\u2019s focus from individual wants to community needs \u2013 to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Evaluations_of_children.E2.80.99s_human_rights_education\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Evaluations_of_children\u2019s_human_rights_education\">Evaluations of children\u2019s human rights education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Evaluations of children\u2019s human rights education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.<sup id=\"cite_ref-belgium_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-belgium-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students\u2019 social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children \u2013 those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.\n</p><p>Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children\u2019s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved <a href=\"/wiki/Classroom_climate\" title=\"Classroom climate\">classroom climate</a>, engagement, and behavior.<sup id=\"cite_ref-impact_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-impact-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-moral_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-moral-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> At the grade 6 level differences were found in children\u2019s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local <a href=\"/wiki/Food_bank\" title=\"Food bank\">food bank</a> to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.\n</p><p>Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students\u2019 appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.\n</p><p>The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.<sup id=\"cite_ref-dead_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-dead-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-comp6_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-comp6-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-implement_11-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-implement-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-comp1_29-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-comp1-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-comp2_30-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-comp2-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-comp3_31-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-comp3-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-comp5_32-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-comp5-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 \u2013 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.\n</p><p>Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.\n</p><p>Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-comp2_30-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-comp2-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-educate_25-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-educate-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_evaluations\">Other evaluations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Other evaluations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hrie_28-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hrie-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  \"Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom\", a teacher reported, \"especially some of the aspects of my behavior management.\" Another stressed that she has \"had fabulous response from the children.\"\n</p><p>Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.<sup id=\"cite_ref-wallberg_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wallberg-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children\u2019s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, \"you are hurting my right to play\" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children\u2019s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus \"from 'me' to 'we'.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Children%E2%80%99s_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Children\u2019s rights\">Children\u2019s rights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Children%27s_rights_movement\" title=\"Children&#39;s rights movement\">Children\u2019s rights movement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child\" title=\"Convention on the Rights of the Child\">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Human_rights_education\" title=\"Human rights education\">Human rights education</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Right_to_education\" title=\"Right to education\">Right to education</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_rights_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 25em; -webkit-column-width: 25em; column-width: 25em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-impact-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-impact_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-impact_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-impact_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-impact_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Covell, K., and Howe, R.B.
