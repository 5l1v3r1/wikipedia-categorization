A Master of Jurisprudence is highly beneficial for those that need an in-depth understanding of the law within current executive level positions.  M.J. students are required to develop a comprehensive understanding of the operation of law as it applies to a specified area of law. Master of Jurisprudence program offerings may focus on Business and Corporate Governance Law , Immigration Law, Health Law, Administrative Law, Real Estate Law, and Risk Management . Some M.J. programs combine a combination of graduate level legal courses with MBA-style courses in concentrated areas of study. The M.J. program typically ranges between 30 and 45 credit hours. Some students may be able to complete the program in as little as one year, depending on their academic status. Master of Jurisprudence degrees are designed to provide a deeper understanding of the U.S. legal system to business professionals. While some classes may be shared with J.D. candidates, the MJur does not prepare recipients to sit for the bar exam to practice law, but rather provides a better understanding of legal issues related to the recipient's chosen field.
