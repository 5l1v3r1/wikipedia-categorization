Maturationism is an early childhood educational philosophy that sees the child as a growing organism and believes that the role of education is to passively support this growth rather than actively fill the child with information. The idea is that genetic factors play a larger role in development than environmental ones, particularly in regard to language acquisition. Maturationism is associated with the concept of developmental stages.
