The Korean Language Proficiency Test, (Hangul: 세계한국말인증시험) or KLPT, tests people who are not native speakers of Korean on their grasp of the language. The goal is to determine whether the test-taker is proficient enough to live in Korea, work as an employee at a Korean company, etc. The Basic-KLPT, or B-KLPT, is also offered; this version of the test simply "assesses whether or not examinees have basic communication ability."  http://www.kets.or.kr
