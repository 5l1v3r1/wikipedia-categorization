The Bachelor of Economics (BEc or BEcon) is a four-year academic degree in the social sciences encompassing both qualitative and quantitative courses. Typical mandatory courses for the degree include microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, economic statistics, history of economic thought and political economy. Some universities offer undergraduate degree students the opportunity to specialise in a particular area of economics, such as: agricultural economics,  econometrics,  environmental and resource economics,  financial economics,  and political economy.  A Bachelor of Economics with Honours degree is a four-year degree and is taken subsequently as an extension to the three-year Bachelor of Economics. The degree consists of a single-year full-time program. The degree requires more academic courses with a researched thesis component.
