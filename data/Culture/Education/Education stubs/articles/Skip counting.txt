Skip counting is a mathematics technique taught as a kind of multiplication in reform mathematics textbooks such as TERC.  In older textbooks, this technique is called counting by twos (threes, fours, etc.). In skip counting by twos, a person can count to 10 by only naming every other number:  2, 4, 6, 8, 10.   Combining the base (two, in this example) with the number of groups (five, in this example) produces the standard multiplication equation:  two multiplied by five equals ten. Another similar method is coloring in squares in a 100s chart to show multiplication patterns. Critics such as Mathematically Correct however believe that it is an inadequate method to teach multiplication and ineffective for computation compared to traditional mathematics methods of multiplication.
