The National Numeracy Strategy arose out of the National Numeracy Project in 1996, led by a Numeracy Task Force in England. The strategy included an outline of expected teaching in mathematics for all pupils from Reception to Year 6. In 2003, the strategy, including the framework for teaching, was absorbed into the broader Primary National Strategy. The framework for teaching was updated in 2006.
