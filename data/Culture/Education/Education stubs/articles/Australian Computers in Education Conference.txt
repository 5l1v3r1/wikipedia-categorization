This National Conference is the biennial conference of the Australian Council for Computers in Education (ACCE). The conference brings together educators from across Australia and around the world who are interested in the use of information and communication technologies to support and enhance teaching and learning in school classrooms,  as opposed to a focus on its use in higher education, or school administration. Affiliate member organisations of ACCE take turns to host the national conference, in place of their own state conference.

Since that time it has continued to provide teachers around the country a forum to exchange information on classroom activity, make connections with each other, and learn from experts in the field.  The conference proceedings provide an insight into the nature of educational computing practice since the early 1980s and the papers are widely cited in the research field literature.   In 2008 the conference was held in Canberra and the then Education Minister Julia Gillard delivered the opening Keynote Address, highlighting the importance of digital technologies in her education reform agenda.
