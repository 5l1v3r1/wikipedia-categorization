The Master of Religious Education is a terminal academic degree in preparation for professional teaching ministry,  usually offered by Christian institutions. The curriculum includes two years of theological study and sometimes a thesis.  Although related to many Master of Arts in Religious Education or Master of Theology degrees, the primary focus of the M.R.E. is to prepare individuals for teaching, as such often requiring previous experience or training in education in order to enroll.  Often, the difference in title is based on the history, philosophy or policies of the institution offering the degree.   In North America, institutions that offer accredited M.R.E. programs are usually approved by the Association of Theological Schools. This is a partial list of institutions of note who award a Master of Religious Education (M.R.E.) degree.
