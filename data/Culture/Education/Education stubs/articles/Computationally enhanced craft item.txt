A Computationally enhanced craft item (CETI) is a simple mechanical device that is fitted with a small computer or computer interface and a servo system. A larger computer programs or directly controls the CETI according to the wishes of the user-programmer. CETIs are educational devices, but they can possibly provide guidance towards a future of user-programmable robots and ubiquitous computing. Tom Wrensch was one of the earliest proponents of CETI.
