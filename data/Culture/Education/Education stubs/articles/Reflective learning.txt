Reflective learning is a form of education in which the student reflects upon their learning experiences.  This is a development of the concept of experiental learning as propounded by John Dewey, who wrote Experience and Education in 1938.  Later theorists include David Kolb, David Boud and Donald Sch√∂n.   In a professional context, this is known as reflective practice.
