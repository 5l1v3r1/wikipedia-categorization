A perfect attendance award is traditionally given in U.S. schools as a way to honor students who have neither missed any days of nor been late to class. Supporters believe that the award promotes education by encouraging students to attend class whenever it is in session. However, some believe that offering a perfect attendance award promotes presenteeism and hurts public health by causing students to attend class when sick with a potentially contagious illness,  while punishing those who make the decision to stay home to recover.
