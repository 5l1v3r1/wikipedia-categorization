Allowed to keep terms (ATKT)  is a process in the Indian education system to allow students of pre-graduation and graduation to study in the next grade if they have failed in 1 to 4 subjects. The students must pass the papers they failed before entering into the next grade. For example, if a first-year bachelor's degree student fails to get passing marks in his four subjects, the student must pass those subjects before entering the third year, while the student can study in second year.   It has backronyms like Tried and Keep trying.  The ATKT system has been criticized, mainly by teachers:   The most notable/notorious form of ATKT or failure in examinations is in the Engineering Colleges in India.Some students have a backlog of more 10 ATKTs in a academic year.to protest this large volume of ATKTs,they assemble in the Mumbai University campus and demand for the ATKT rule to be increased so that they may be promoted to the next academic year in spite of having many ATKTs.
