Education in Grenada is free and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.  In 1998, the gross primary enrollment rate was 125.5 percent, while the net primary enrollment rate was 97.5 percent.   Despite the high enrollment rate, poverty, poor school facilities, and the periodic need to help with family farm harvests have resulted in approximately a 7 percent absenteeism rate among primary school children.
