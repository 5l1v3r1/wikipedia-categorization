CollegeTimes is a life hacking blog focused on "real world education" that features an online database of more than 15,000 colleges and universities and their accompanying "uncensored" student reviews, which claims to be the largest higher education directory on the Internet.  The website has created controversy among multiple for-profit college institutions in the United States and Canada because of negative student reviews (user-generated) that appear on certain school profiles, which has led to ongoing legal threats and outcries being aimed at CollegeTimes and their various business partners.  The website's managed WordPress hosting provider LittleBizzy was sued in the United States in 2012 by Neumont University, a for-profit technical institute based in Utah, after being accused of "business disparagement" that allegedly cost the college more than $1 million in lost revenue due to negative student reviews appearing on CollegeTimes.  However, the case was eventually thrown out due to improper service of process.  The case garnered attention across the Ninth Circuit Court after the magistrate judge initially assigned to the case refused to admit Section 230 arguments - which protect web hosting companies in regard to free speech issues - into the case; the judge went so far as to completely strike LittleBizzy's mention of Section 230 protections from the public record for unexplained reasons,  leading CollegeTimes to accuse the two judges involved in the case of favoring Neumont due to an alleged common affiliation with Mormonism.
