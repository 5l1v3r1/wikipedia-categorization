Certified software manager (CSM) is a professional designation for IT asset management.  The course was developed by the Software Publishers Association (now SIIA) in 1994 as a component of one of the first global anti-piracy efforts, led by Ken Wasch.  In 2004, administration of the CSM, and its successor class the Advanced Software Manager, moved to Washington, DC-based LicenseLogic. The course syllabus walks the attendee through from the beginnings of "What is Software Asset Management (SAM)?" through to developing a basic asset management program for their organization.  The CSM is the basis for various other ITAM courses.
