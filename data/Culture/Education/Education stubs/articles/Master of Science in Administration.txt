A Master of Science degree in administration (abbreviated M.Sc.A.,  "MSA", or MScA) is a type of Master of Science degree awarded by universities in many countries. It is a relatively new field of study that came into existence in the mid-to-late 1970s. The MSA provides preparation for a variety of administrative positions in large, mid-sized and small organizations. The focus of the MSA program highlights the importance of management skills and is designed to develop and train management who may serve in the private or public sector.   The MSA program is an amalgam of the master of public administration (MPA) and master of business administration (MBA). The MSA combines courses from several disciplines, including psychology, economics, political science, statistics, leadership, computer science, and business administration to include technology and resource management.  The MSA has similarities to the MPA, as it focuses on organizational behavior, microeconomics, public finance, research methods/statistics, policy process and policy analysis, ethics, public management, leadership, planning and GIS, and program evaluation/performance measurement.  The similarities with the MBA include the focus on economics, organizational behavior, marketing, accounting, finance, strategy, operations management, international business, information technology management, supply chain management, project management, government policy, and ethics.
