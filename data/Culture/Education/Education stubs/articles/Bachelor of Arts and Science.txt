Bachelor of Arts and Science (B.A.S. or B.A.&Sc. or B.A.Sc.) is an undergraduate bachelor's degree conferred by a small number of American universities and a fair number of universities in other English-speaking countries (including Canada and Australia). Generally, to receive a B.A.S. degree, a student would need to complete the general requirements for a bachelor's degree and also the requirements for two different academic majors (or academic minors) â€” one that usually leads to a B.A. degree and one that usually leads to a B.S. degree. In the United States, the degree is meant to be a four-year degree, but many students will take five years to complete the program.  Technically speaking, it is not an example of a double degree, as universities only confer a single degree.
