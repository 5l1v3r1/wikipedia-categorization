An online lecture is an educational lecture designed to be posted online. Lectures are recorded to video, audio or both, then uploaded and made viewable on a designated site. Students may go to a certain designated site to view the lecture online at a time which is convenient for them. Traditionally, vocal education is possible only when the teacher and the pupil are together in the same room, where the teacher passes on the information in the same vicinity of the student. Online lectures are now possible with the advent of video communications. The development of the online lecture makes it possible so that the teacher and student no longer have to be in the same vicinity to teach and learn, respectively. There are certain advantages to online lecturing. Students may access online lectures posted on their designated websites anywhere in the world, at any time they wish, as long as they have an internet connection. They can also be repeated for the sake of note taking. Studies have shown that students improve significantly in courses with online archived lectures.  Studies have also noted that the overall experience of a course has improved with the addition of online lectures.  There are disadvantages to online lecturing, namely the lack of face-to-face interaction, and the fact that students cannot easily contact their instructors unless a communications link is created. Additionally, attendance for in-class lectures may drop due to archived lectures. This can be avoided with in class quizzes or by postponing posting lectures until after the in-class session.
