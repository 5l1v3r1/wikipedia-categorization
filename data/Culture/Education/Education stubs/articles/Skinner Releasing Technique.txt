Skinner Releasing Technique is a movement training method in which certified teachers employ imagery, voice and music as stimuli for unstructured, improvised movements in their students.  The trademark for this method is held by Skinner Releasing Institute.  Although Skinner Releasing Technique is sometimes compared to dance techniques, it differs significantly from conventional dance techniques such as turnout and spotting, in which body form and movement are rigorously specified. Instead this method is somatic in nature, emphasizing the internal sensory experience of the practitioner.  Skinner Releasing Technique was invented by Joan Skinner, a Professor Emeritus at University of Washington.
