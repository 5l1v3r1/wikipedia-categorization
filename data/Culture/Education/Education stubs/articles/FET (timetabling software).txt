FET is a free and open-source time tabling app for automatically scheduling the timetable of a school, high-school or university. FET is written in C++ using the Qt cross-platform application framework. Initially, FET stood for "Free Evolutionary Timetabling"; as it is no longer evolutionary, the E in the middle can stand for anything the user prefers.  Custom made versions of FET are available for Moroccan, Algerian and US high-schools.
