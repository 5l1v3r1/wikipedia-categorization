Intellectual property education is the teaching of explanations of and arguments concerning intellectual property laws, especially copyright and related violations. Proponents[who?] argue that such education should be implemented because of increasing copyright infringement by students (and the general population). Detractors[who?] argue that such education is tantamount to forced indoctrination of propaganda.
