AP Russian Language and Culture is a proposed Advanced Placement course and examination, in development since 2005.  It is being developed through the American Council of Teachers of Russian, in collaboration with the College Board and with funding from the U.S. Department of Education and the National Security Education Program.  AP Russian Language is equivalent to a second-year college-level Russian language course. Students enrolling in AP Russian Language and Culture are typically in their fourth or fifth year of language study, or have had equivalent experience with the language.  The exam is reported with a score of 1 to 5. A prototype exam was administered to students in 2010.
