Education in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is neither compulsory nor free, although children are usually in school until the age of 15.  In 1998, the gross primary enrollment rate was 90.5 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 83.5 percent.   Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for St. Vincent and the Grenadines as of 2001.   While enrollment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect childrenâ€™s participation in school.   According to the government, cases in which children leave school before the age of 16 are investigated.
