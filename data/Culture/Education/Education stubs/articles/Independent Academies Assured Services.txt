The Independent Academies Assured Services (IAAS) is an initiative of the Independent Academies Association (IAA) that provides a free register of educational product and service suppliers for educational establishments. All suppliers on the register are required to pass the Quality Mark accreditation process laid out by IAAS. The Quality Mark register lists suppliers of products and services including academy transition, environmental sustainability, health and safety, consumables procurement, ICT and technology. The majority of suppliers are recommended to IAAS by educational establishments. The IAA Quality Mark is supported by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the Independent Academies Association (IAA). In order to acquire and maintain the Quality Mark from IAAS, suppliers are annually assessed according to criteria that consider price, ethics, track record and the safeguarding of children. IAAS also aim to mediate between educational establishments and suppliers if disputes arise.
