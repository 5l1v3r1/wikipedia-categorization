Most universities in the world are organised into teaching and research divisions. Professors and lecturers will normally be contracted to do both and, in theory at least, course syllabi are structured around the teacher's research interests. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to further integrate the two activities. This has led to a new interest in undergraduate research, where students enrolled on bachelor's degrees are given the opportunity to participate in research projects or undertake their own research.\n</p><p>This concept is also coined as <b>Teaching-as-Research</b> or <b>Research-based Practices in Teaching</b> in higher education. There are growing number of activities supported and sponsored by inter-university organizations such as the National Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network.<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.cirtl.net/\">[1]</a> \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Worldwide\">Worldwide</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Research-informed_teaching&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Worldwide\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This practice was pioneered in America, where there is now a nationwide Council for Undergraduate Research, and in Australia. Recently, the UK Government funded several 'centres of excellence' which focus in different ways on undergraduate research. One of the most important is the  Reinvention Centre for Undergraduate Research, which was set up in the Sociology department at <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Warwick\" title=\"University of Warwick\">Warwick University</a> in  partnership with the School of the <a href=\"/wiki/Built_environment\" title=\"Built environment\">Built Environment</a> at  <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_Brookes_University\" title=\"Oxford Brookes University\">Oxford Brookes University</a> under the directorship of Mike Neary. The Centre's journal, Reinvention, launched in September 2007. In 2006, the UK Government also invested c.\u00a325m into universities across the country to strengthen research-informed teaching. Key publications by Alan Jenkins, Roger Zetter, Mick Healey and Angela Brew have further developed the research base for research-informed teaching. In April 2007 the University of <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Lancashire\" title=\"Central Lancashire\">Central Lancashire</a> appointed the first ever Chair in Research-informed Teaching, Stuart Hampton-Reeves, and in September 2007 launched a Centre for Research-informed Teaching.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Efficacy\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Research-informed_teaching&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Efficacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While university instruction is optimal when grounded in empirical findings, some concerns have arisen regarding the efficacy of university instruction at research focused institutions. A growing number of these higher education research institutions focus on the researching prowess of the potential professor (and, in many cases, the grant-writing ability of prospective employee) while often paying substantially less attention to one's ability to disseminate the information.  Of course, those talented instructors who are both strong in research and instruction have the potential to really impact their students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Research-informed_teaching&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/York/documents/ourwork/teachingandresearch/LinkingTeachingAndResearch_April07.pdf\">Linking Teaching and Research</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cur.org/\">Council for Undergraduate Research</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/research/cetl/\">Warwick Reinvention Centre</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.uclan.ac.uk/nexus\">UCLAN Centre for Research-informed Teaching</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2203\nCached time: 20180921221510\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.072 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 80/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4063/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 9/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.021/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   55.116      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   55.116      1 -total\n 71.98%   39.675      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:14011647-0!canonical and timestamp 20180921221510 and revision id 840458131\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_June_2013"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Teaching"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from June 2013"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Built environment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Central Lancashire"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Higher education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"University of Warwick"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":["https://www.cirtl.net/","http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/York/documents/ourwork/teachingandresearch/LinkingTeachingAndResearch_April07.pdf","http://www.cur.org/","http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/research/cetl/","http://www.uclan.ac.uk/nexus"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Worldwide","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Research-informed_teaching","byteoffset":1048,"anchor":"Worldwide"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Efficacy","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Research-informed_teaching","byteoffset":2189,"anchor":"Efficacy"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Research-informed_teaching","byteoffset":2822,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Research-informed teaching","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7315050"}]}}
