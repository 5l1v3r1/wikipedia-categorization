An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\"\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#&quot;Teaching_about_Writing,_Righting_Misconceptions&quot;\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#&quot;Continuing_the_Dialogue&quot;\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Continuing the Dialogue\"</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Benefits\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Benefits</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Criticism_and_responses\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Criticism and responses</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Writing_about_Writing:_A_College_Reader\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\"><i>Writing about Writing: A College Reader</i></span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Selected_readings\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Selected readings</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Reception\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reception</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_about_Writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Composition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Carter_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Carter-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\".22Teaching_about_Writing.2C_Righting_Misconceptions.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;Teaching_about_Writing,_Righting_Misconceptions&quot;\">\"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_about_Writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed.  This course sought \"to improve students' understanding of writing, <a href=\"/wiki/Rhetoric\" title=\"Rhetoric\">rhetoric</a>, language, and literacy\" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging \"more realistic conceptions of writing.\"  <sup id=\"cite_ref-DownsWardle_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DownsWardle-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.\n</p><p>In the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that \"writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-DownsWardle_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DownsWardle-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about \"writing studies\", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.\n</p><p>The authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write \"rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-DownsWardle_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DownsWardle-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\".22Continuing_the_Dialogue.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;Continuing_the_Dialogue&quot;\">\"Continuing the Dialogue\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_about_Writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;Continuing the Dialogue&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled \"Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting\nMisconceptions.'\" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being \"that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-follow_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-follow-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> She goes on to write, \"Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-follow_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-follow-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing <i>major</i> and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, <i>Writing about Writing: A College Reader</i>, which was published in 2011.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Benefits\">Benefits</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_about_Writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Benefits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In \"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\" Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:<sup id=\"cite_ref-DownsWardle_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DownsWardle-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>an increased self-awareness about writing</li>\n<li>improved reading abilities</li>\n<li>improved confidence as a student</li>\n<li>raised awareness of research writing as conversation</li></ul>\n<p>WAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article \"Writing about Writing in <a href=\"/wiki/Basic_writing\" title=\"Basic writing\">Basic Writing</a>,\" Shannon Carter explains \"a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-Carter_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Carter-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.\n</p><p>Many instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled \"Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students,\" Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis\u2014two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, \"Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jonikka_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jonikka-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism_and_responses\">Criticism and responses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_about_Writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism and responses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and \"often in fundamental ways.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-Carter_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Carter-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In his response to Downs and Wardle's \"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\" Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.\n</p><p>Kutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend \"the nuances of the composing process.\" He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, \"While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-Kutney_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Kutney-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's \"dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-Miles_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Miles-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their \"research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Miles_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Miles-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\nDowns published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out:</p><blockquote><p> My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to \"FYC as Intro to Writing Studies\" is about as magnanimous as their response itself \u2013 that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories \u2013 for me, Schwegler and Shamoon \u2013 planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Downs_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Downs-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>He writes Miles et al. \"seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner.\" His main contentions are:<sup id=\"cite_ref-Downs_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Downs-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><ul><li>Miles et al. seem only to respond to arguments Downs and Wardle didn't make rather than focusing on the ones they did.</li>\n<li>There is a major difference between the type of course he and Wardle advocate from first-year writing and a course that serves as in introduction to a writing major.</li>\n<li>Miles et al. grossly misinterpreted the types of readings that are purposed to be involved in WAW, as they are not all of an academic nature and nowhere in Downs' and Wardle's article do they say that it is.</li>\n<li>In regards to the criticism that first-year writing students will have a difficult time comprehending readings that are also taught to graduate students, Downs states that it's an \"admirable goal\" of writing programs to support this kind of learning, and cutting first-year students off from this type of learning is \"unnecessarily limiting.\"</li></ul>\n<p>He concludes by writing \"I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Downs_7-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Downs-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be \"lone pioneers\" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Elbow\" title=\"Peter Elbow\">Peter Elbow</a> as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Shannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be \"off-putting\" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Carter_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Carter-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in \"recruiting\" more students to become majors in the field.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jonikka_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jonikka-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Writing_about_Writing:_A_College_Reader\"><i>Writing about Writing: A College Reader</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Writing_about_Writing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Writing about Writing: A College Reader\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Published in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as \"encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-Bedford_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bedford-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\nIn the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing.
