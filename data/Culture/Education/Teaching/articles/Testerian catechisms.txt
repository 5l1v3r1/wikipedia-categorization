The Testerian catechisms (Spanish: Catecismos testerianos) are religious documents used in the evangelization of the New Spain. They explain the Catholic doctrine through images based on indigenous conventions prior to the Conquest of Mexico and western Spanish writing and other languages.    These documents were an attempt to be educative materials for those religious that did not know the aboriginal languages then spoken in the territory that is now Mexico. They received their name for Jacobo of Testera, a Franciscan friar who elaborated catechisms of this type.  The missionariwes who participated in the evangelization of the new lands of the American continent looked for ways to transmit the new doctrine.  TMesoamerican images and documents were subject to destruction, as they were considered idolatric materials, but were tolerated  when used in a religious context. Theatrical representations, music, architecture, public sermons, among others, supported the new religious precepts.  The Testerian catechisms were used to transmit the  Ten Commandments and  prayers like the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary.
