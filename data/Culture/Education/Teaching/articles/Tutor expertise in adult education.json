Traditionally, medical education was delivered in large lecture format by content experts. In the 1960s, <a href=\"/wiki/Problem-based_learning\" title=\"Problem-based learning\">Problem-based learning</a> was first introduced at <a href=\"/wiki/McMaster_University\" title=\"McMaster University\">McMaster University</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario,_Canada\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ontario, Canada\">Ontario, Canada</a>. Problem-based learning involves small groups working within a tutorial system. Students are encouraged to brainstorm within the group and generate questions based on the scenario they are working on. Problem-based learning fosters <a href=\"/wiki/Self-directed_learning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Self-directed learning\">self-directed learning</a>, with the teacher taking on a new role as a facilitator, using their expertise only subtly and sparingly.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> This style of learning is built on <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Collaborative_learning_work&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Collaborative learning work (page does not exist)\">collaborative learning work</a> theory. Students with a common interest are encouraged to reflect, share their thoughts with their peers and develop analytical thinking and communication skills during the process.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The break from the true collaborative approach is in having an authority figure present.\n</p><p>Supporters of the truly collaborative approach feel that there is no need for that authority to be a content expert.  However, studies conducted at several medical schools across Canada, the USA and Europe dispute this idea. For example, in an analysis of student performance following small group experiences with experts and non expert tutors, students at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Medical_School\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Michigan Medical School\">University of Michigan Medical School</a> rated their experiences with content experts significantly higher than those led by non-experts. They felt that even though an expert tutor may ask the same questions as a non-expert tutor, that the expert was more inclined to ask the questions at the most opportune time and was better able to reframe the question in a way that was more valuable to the students. Ultimately, the students who were assigned to the groups led by content experts scored significantly higher on their final exam.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In another study, conducted at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, it was determined that expert tutors use their knowledge to ask more effective questions and are better equipped to keep the groups from floundering.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> This raises the question of whether a process expert can adequately assess student progress and determine when intervention is optimal and beneficial.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effectiveness\">Effectiveness</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tutor_expertise_in_adult_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Effectiveness\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While ongoing debate and research on this topic continues, several common threads have evolved and opinions on the effectiveness of this approach include: \n</p>\n<ul><li>Effective tutors for self-directed learning are those who only make appropriate interruptions.</li>\n<li>Effective tutors need content expertise coupled with facilitation training.</li>\n<li>The tutor's challenge is to avoid dispensing facts.</li>\n<li>The effective tutor needs to be empathetic to student needs and capable of motivation.</li></ul>\n<p>Given these determinants, one dares to ask if the issue is actually content expertise versus process expertise or rather what is the minimum requirement of each component which would produce the most effective tutor? <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tutor_expertise_in_adult_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Maudsley, G., BMJ 1999, 318:657-661</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Davis,W.K., Nairn,R., Paine, M.E., Anderson, R.M. and Oh, M.S., Academic Medicine 67(1992):470-474</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Maudsley, G.
