Think-pair-share is a collaborative teaching strategy first proposed by Frank Lyman of the University of Maryland in 1981. It can be used to help students form individual ideas, discuss and share with the others in-group. It can be used before reading or teaching a concept and works better with smaller groups.  In think-pair-share strategy the teacher acts as a facilitator, and poses a question or a problem to the students. The students are given sufficient time to think and gather their thoughts, after which the teacher asks them to pair themselves and share their thoughts with each other. As the students begin to share their thoughts and views, each learns to see the different perspective of thinking among their peers. By doing so the students learning is enhanced by the formation and articulation of an idea. This also enables the students to have clarity of thought and have the ability to communicate their thoughts and ideas to another student. If time permits the paired students can share their thought with other paired students, and teachers can ask one or two pairs to share their ideas with the entire class. Think-pair-share is designed to help the student to understand the concept of the given topic, develop ability to filter the information and formulate an idea or thought, and draw conclusions. The most important aspect of the think-pair-share is that students will develop the ability to consider and appreciate the different viewpoints of their peers.
