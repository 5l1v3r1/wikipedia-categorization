To do this, a teacher sets different expectations for task completion for students based upon their individual needs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Differentiated instruction, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Carol_Ann_Tomlinson\" title=\"Carol Ann Tomlinson\">Carol Ann Tomlinson</a> (as cited by Ellis, Gable, Greg, &amp; Rock, 2008, p.&#160;32), is the process of \"ensuring that what a student learns, how he or she learns it, and how the student demonstrates what he or she has learned is a match for that student's readiness level, interests, and preferred mode of learning.\" Teachers can differentiate in four ways: 1) through content, 2) process, 3) product, and 4) <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_environment\" title=\"Learning environment\">learning environment</a> based on the individual learner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ministry_of_Education_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ministry_of_Education-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Differentiation stems from beliefs about differences among learners, how they learn, learning preferences, and individual interests (Algozzine &amp; Anderson, 2007). Therefore, differentiation is an organized, yet flexible way of proactively adjusting teaching and learning methods to accommodate each child's learning needs and preferences to achieve maximum growth as a learner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tomlinson9_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tomlinson9-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  To understand how students learn and what they know, pre-assessment and ongoing assessment are essential.

Evidence suggests that, by instructing through multiple learning pathways, more \"<a href=\"/wiki/Dendrite\" title=\"Dendrite\">dendritic</a> pathways of access\" are created.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Willis_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Willis-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  This can be achieved by using several senses (i.e. sight, sound, smell) or by creating cross-curricular connections.  When more regions of the brain store data about a subject, there is more interconnection and <a href=\"/wiki/Cross-referencing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cross-referencing\">cross-referencing</a> of data from multiple storage areas in response to a single cue, meaning one has learned rather than memorized.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Willis_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Willis-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As Wolfe (2001) argues, information is acquired through the five senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and sound.  This information is stored temporarily, and the brain decides what to do with the acquired data.  The more of these stimuli that are activated, the more impact the data has on the brain.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This information is pertinent to differentiation, which can activate multiple senses and thus have a greater impact on the brain.  \n</p><p>Further, <a href=\"/wiki/Howard_Gardner\" title=\"Howard Gardner\">Howard Gardner</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences\" title=\"Theory of multiple intelligences\">theory of multiple intelligences</a> identified eight distinct intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gardner_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gardner-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  This is important when looking at how students possess different kinds of minds and therefore learn, remember, perform, and understand in different ways.  He argues that students would be better served if teachers could teach in a number of ways and learning could be assessed through a variety of means.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gardner_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gardner-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> This might reach more students and improve content retention.  Learning preferences extends these ideas by effectively instructing a larger number of students to encourage the development of the less preferred style.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pre-assessment\">Pre-assessment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Pre-assessment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>An important part of differentiated instruction and assessment is determining what students already know so as not to cover material students have mastered, or use methods that would be ineffective for students.  The goal of pre-assessment is to determine a student's knowledge, understanding and skill prior to the unit of study.  These are assessments for learning and include diagnostic or <a href=\"/wiki/Pre-assessment\" title=\"Pre-assessment\">pre-assessments</a> that the teacher uses to help guide instruction and benefit each learner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hume_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hume-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  They are informal and provide qualitative feedback to teachers and students to address strengths and needs during the unit.  Pre-assessments should be conducted several weeks before the unit of study and should not be graded.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strickland_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strickland-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>  Chapman and King (2005) note that when \"teachers strategically administer pre-assessments before planning their lessons, they can address the students' strengths and needs during instruction.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Pre-assessment can be conducted in two ways: 1) by identifying learning preferences and interests (i.e. Gardner's Multiple Intelligence test, or Visual, Auditory, or Kinesthetic learner),  and 2) by identifying knowledge of student understandings (i.e. checklists, quizzes, class discussion, portfolios, entry/exit cards, anticipation guides, <a href=\"/wiki/Diary\" title=\"Diary\">journals</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Self-reflection\" title=\"Self-reflection\">self-reflections</a>).  Both of these types of pre-assessment are used to design student tasks, particularly when a student might require support, enrichment, or have different learning styles, intelligence, or interests.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TVDSB_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TVDSB-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>  Teachers can also determine, locate, and compile appropriate resources and decide timelines/priorities for upcoming units.\n</p><p>The goals of differentiated instruction are to develop engaging tasks that challenge and enhance learning for each student. Instructional activities are flexible and based and evaluated on content, process, product, and learning environment. This instructional approach and choice of content are driven by the data from students' assessment results and from the outcomes of other screening tools.  Pre-assessments can gather information about each student's strengths, comforts, or areas of weakness.  This leads to appropriate differentiation that accommodates each student's learning needs and preferences.  Assessments should be used as a tool to create clear, and meaningful instruction that guides each student towards challenging but not frustrating activities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ongoing_assessment\">Ongoing assessment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Ongoing assessment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Assessment is the process of gathering information from a variety of sources such as assignments, teacher observations, class discussions, and tests and quizzes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TVDSB_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TVDSB-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Teachers must assess regularly to inform instructional strategies, learn about each student's readiness, interests, and learning preferences and to improve student learning.  This information can be gathered through diagnostic (pre-assessments), <a href=\"/wiki/Formative_assessment\" title=\"Formative assessment\">formative</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Summative_assessment\" title=\"Summative assessment\">summative assessments</a>, as well as Individual Education Plans, Ontario Student Records, student interest surveys, and multiple intelligence or learning style inventories.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hume_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hume-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Assessment for learning not only includes diagnostic or pre-assessment measures but also formative assessment.

This might include peer/ self-assessments, and peer/teacher conferences.  Assessment of learning is the culminating task or summative assessment, which takes place after the learning has occurred and students can show what concepts and/or skills they learned.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strickland_10-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strickland-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Differentiation can also be used here through a variety of strategies such as tests, projects, demonstrations, writing performances, and more.\n</p><p>All these ongoing assessments help the teacher know students and their needs so they can select effective teaching and learning strategies and interventions that maximize student achievement.  Consistent program review and diagnosis of whole-class and individual student responses not only provides ongoing feedback to enhance teaching and learning for teachers but students and parents as well.  Teachers use ongoing assessments to gather information about a student's knowledge and capabilities, to direct future planning, to monitor student progress, and to evaluate student achievement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TVDSB_12-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TVDSB-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Students and parents can also use these assessments to reflect and understand their own learning preferences and level of achievement.\n</p><p>Students must be assessed based on a standard rather than the level of assigned work.  A student who struggles in a particular subject may be given an assignment geared toward their abilities to help them learn.  They may do well at the adjusted work they are given.  That does not mean they should be given the same grade for their work, as the child who does not get an adjustment assignment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Content\">Content</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Content\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The content of lessons may be differentiated based on what students already know. The most basic content of a lesson should cover the standards of learning set by the district or state. Some students in a class may be completely unfamiliar with the concepts in a lesson, some students may have partial mastery of the content - or display mistaken ideas about the content, and some students may show mastery of the content before the lesson begins. The teacher may differentiate the content by designing activities for groups of students that cover different areas of <a href=\"/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy\" title=\"Bloom&#39;s taxonomy\">Bloom's taxonomy</a>. For example, students who are unfamiliar with the concepts may be required to complete tasks on the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: knowledge, comprehension, and application. Students with partial mastery may be asked to complete tasks in the application, analysis and evaluation areas, and students who have high levels of mastery may be asked to complete tasks in evaluation and synthesis.\n</p><p>When teachers differentiate content, they may adapt what they want students to learn or how students access the knowledge, understanding, and skills (Anderson, 2007). In these instances, educators are not varying student objectives or lowering performance standards for students. They use different texts, novels, or short stories at a reading level appropriate for each individual student. Teachers can use flexible groups and have students assigned to like groups listening to <a href=\"/wiki/Audiobook\" title=\"Audiobook\">audiobooks</a> or accessing specific internet sources. Students could have a choice to work in pairs, groups, or individually, but all students are working towards the same standards and objectives.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understanding_by_Design\">Understanding by Design</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Understanding by Design\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Understanding_by_Design\" title=\"Understanding by Design\">Understanding by Design</a> (UbD) is an educational strategy that may be used to inform content in a differentiated classroom. According to Carol Ann Tomlinson and Jay McTighe, UbD and differentiated instruction (DI) form an essential partnership. Combining these two educational theories may allow educators to simultaneously \"craft powerful curriculum in a standards-dominated era and ensure academic success for the full spectrum of learners.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Process\">Process</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Process\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The process of how the material in a lesson is learned may be differentiated for students based on their learning styles, taking into account what standards of performance are required for the <a href=\"/wiki/Child_development\" title=\"Child development\">age</a> level. This stage of differentiation allows students to learn based either on what method is easiest for them to gain knowledge, or what may challenge them most: some students may prefer to read about a topic (or may require practice in reading), and others may prefer to listen (or require practice in listening), or acquire knowledge by manipulating objects associated with the content. Information may be presented in multiple ways by the teacher, and may be based on any available methods or materials. Many teachers use areas of Multiple Intelligences to provide learning opportunities.\n</p><p>Commonalities in the assessment results lead to grouping practices that are designed to meet the students' needs. \"How\" a teacher plans to deliver the instruction is based on assessment results that show the needs, learning styles, interests, and levels of prior knowledge. The grouping practices must be flexible, as groups change with regard to the need that must be addressed. Regardless of whether the differentiation of instruction is based upon student readiness, interests, or needs, the dynamic flow of grouping and regrouping is one of the foundations of differentiated instruction. It is important for a differentiated classroom to allow some students to work alone, if this is their best modality for a particular task. (Nunley, 2004)\n</p><p>Differentiating by process refers to how a student comes to understand and assimilate facts, concepts and skills (Anderson, 2007). After teaching a lesson, a teacher might break students into small \"ability\" groups based on their readiness. The teacher would then give each group a series of questions, based on each group's appropriate level of readiness-skills, related to the objectives of the lesson. Another way to group the students could be based on the students' learning styles. The main idea behind this is that students are at different levels and learn in different ways, so a teacher can't teach them all the same way.\n</p><p>Another model of differentiation, layered curriculum, offers student a choice of assignments but requires that they demonstrate learning to pass the assignment. This eliminates the need for pre-assessment and is useful for teachers with large class loads, such as in high school (Nunley, 2004).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Product\">Product</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Product\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The product is essentially what the student produces at the end of the lesson to demonstrate the mastery of the content: tests, evaluations, projects, reports, or other activities. Based on students' skill levels and educational standards, teachers may assign students to complete activities that demonstrate mastery of an educational concept (writing a report), or in a method the student prefers (composing an original song about the content, or building a 3-dimensional object that explains mastery of concepts in the lesson or unit). The product is an integral component of the differentiated model, as preparation of the assessments determines both the \u2018what' and \u2018how' of instruction delivery.\n</p><p>When an educator differentiates by product or performance, they are affording students various ways of demonstrating what they have learned from the lesson or unit (Anderson, 2007; Nunley, 2006). It is done by using menu unit sheets, choice boards or open-ended lists of final product options. It is meant to allow students to show what they learned based on their learning preferences, interests and strengths.\n</p><p>Examples of differentiated structures include Layered <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum\" title=\"Curriculum\">Curriculum</a>, tiered <a href=\"/wiki/Education\" title=\"Education\">instruction</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tic-tac-toe\" title=\"Tic-tac-toe\">tic-tac-toe</a> extension menus, Curry/Samara models, RAFT <a href=\"/wiki/Writing\" title=\"Writing\">writing</a> activities, and similar designs. (see external links below)\n</p><p>In differentiated instruction, teachers respond to students' readiness, instructional needs, interests and learning preferences and provide opportunities for students to work in varied instructional formats. A classroom that utilizes differentiated instruction is a learner-responsive, teacher-facilitated classroom where all students have the opportunity to meet curriculum foundation objectives. Lessons may be on <a href=\"/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning\" title=\"Inquiry-based learning\">inquiry based</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Problem-based_learning\" title=\"Problem-based learning\">problem based</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Project-based_learning\" title=\"Project-based learning\">project based</a> instruction.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learning_environment\">Learning environment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Learning environment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Differentiating through the environment is important as it creates the conditions for optimal learning to take place.  According to Tomlinson (2003), \"Environment will support or deter the student's quest for affirmation, contribution, power, purpose, and challenge in the classroom,\" (p.&#160;37).<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  The learning environment includes the physical layout of the classroom, the way that the teacher uses the space, environmental elements and sensitivities including lighting, as well as the overall atmosphere of the classroom.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ministry_of_Education_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ministry_of_Education-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The teacher's goal is to create an environment that is positive, structured, and supportive for each student.  The physical environment should be a place that is flexible with varied types of furniture and arrangements, and areas for quiet individual work as well as areas for group work and collaboration.  This supports a variety of ways to engage in flexible and dynamic learning.  Teachers should be sensitive and alert to ways that the classroom environment supports students' ability to interact with others individually, in small groups, and as a whole class.  They should employ <a href=\"/wiki/Classroom_management\" title=\"Classroom management\">classroom management</a> techniques that support a safe and supportive learning environment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Helping_parents_learn_about_differentiated_instruction\">Helping parents learn about differentiated instruction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Helping parents learn about differentiated instruction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to Carol Ann Tomlinson,<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> most parents are eager for their students to learn, grow, succeed and feel accepted in school.
