The teaching philosophy of a candidate for an academic position is a written statement of the candidate's general personal views on teaching.  Colleges and universities that advertise a position whose duties require teaching often require the applicant to submit a teaching philosophy with the application.  The philosophy statement often attempts to express what methods of teaching the candidate practices.
