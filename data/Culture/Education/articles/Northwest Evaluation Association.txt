The Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), also known as MAP testing is an evaluation test to see where a student is academically. It advances in Language Arts, Reading, Math, and Science. This tool is used to represent academic growth and uses a "RIT Scale" to determine kindergarten thru 11th grade levels. NWEA also determines growth rate by beginning, middle, and end year terms meaning the test is taking three times each school year. This more accurately represents academic development. They also measure score using and comparing normative percentiles.
