The cognitive elite of a society, according to Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, are those having higher intelligence levels and thus better prospects for success in life. The development of a cognitive elite during the 20th century is presented in their 1994 book The Bell Curve. In this book, Herrnstein and Murray propose that the cognitive elite has been produced by a more technological society which offers enough high skill jobs for those with a higher intelligence to fill. They also propose that by removing race, gender or class as criteria the main criteria of success in academic and professional life is becoming primarily based on cognitive ability. Educational psychologist Linda Gottfredson wrote: The book has met with criticism, as has the cognitive elite concept.  It has been claimed that the case has been "wildly exaggerated",  and it is based on an intelligence measure that is also criticized.
