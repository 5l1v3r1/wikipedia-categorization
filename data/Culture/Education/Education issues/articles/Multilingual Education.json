Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Components_of_Multilingual_Education_(MLE)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Components of Multilingual Education (MLE)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Stages_of_an_MLE_Program\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stages of an MLE Program</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Components_of_Multilingual_Education_.28MLE.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Components_of_Multilingual_Education_(MLE)\">Components of Multilingual Education (MLE)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Multilingual_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Components of Multilingual Education (MLE)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><b>\"Strong Foundation\"</b> - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/\">Thomas and Collier, 1997</a>).

Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stages_of_an_MLE_Program\">Stages of an MLE Program</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Multilingual_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Stages of an MLE Program\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:\n</p>\n<ol><li><b>Stage I</b> - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language</li>\n<li><b>Stage II</b> - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.</li>\n<li><b>Stage III</b> - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.</li>\n<li><b>Stage IV</b> - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.</li></ol>\n<p>MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a \"two-way\" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.\n</p><p>Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to   rediscover their culture through their language.The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the    socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.\nIn addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.\n</p>\n<pre><b>MULTILINGUAL EDUCATION IN ODISHA,INDIA</b>\n Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes,along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra , the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang ,Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson,Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. \nDr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.\n</pre>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Multilingual_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Language_education\" title=\"Language education\">Language education</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Multilingualism\" title=\"Multilingualism\">Multilingualism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Bilingual_education\" title=\"Bilingual education\">Bilingual education</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.sil.org/literacy/multi.htm\">Multilingual Education Programs (SIL)</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=222\">Mother Tongue / Biliteracy Programs (UNESCO)</a></li></ul>\n<p>Multilingual Education in India, The CAse For English  Edited by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra and Prof Anand Mahanand publisihed by Viva Books,New Delhi  2016.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Multilingual_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>For further information, please refer to the MLE Manual of Susan Malone, and Denis Malone published by UNESCO, Bangkok</li></ul>\n<p>id21 insights.
