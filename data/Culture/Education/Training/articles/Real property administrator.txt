The real property administrator (RPA) designation is a professional designation for people who work in property management. The designation is administered by Building Owners and Managers Institute (BOMI) International, an independent nonprofit institute for property and facility management education.  The designation requires the completion of eight courses (available online, by textbook study or in a classroom format) as well as three years of qualifying, documented experience in property management at a property 50,000 square feet (4,600Â m2) or larger.  BOMI International courses are often conducted by BOMA (Building Owners and Managers Association) local organizations as an educational benefit for their members, and by corporations as part of their internal training for property management professionals.  Approximately 4,200 persons maintain the RPA designation, including about 3,500 in the United States and 700 in Canada. The program includes coursework on building systems design, operation, and maintenance; commercial real estate law; investment and finance; risk management and insurance; leasing and marketing; asset management; environmental health and safety; and business ethics.
