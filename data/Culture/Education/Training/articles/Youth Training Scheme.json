The scheme was first outlined in the 1980 <a href=\"/wiki/White_paper\" title=\"White paper\">white paper</a> <i>A New Training Initiative: A Programme for Action</i>, and it was brought into operation in 1983 to replace the <a href=\"/wiki/Youth_Opportunities_Programme\" title=\"Youth Opportunities Programme\">Youth Opportunities Programme</a> by the government of <a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher\" title=\"Margaret Thatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Initially lasting one year, the scheme was amended in 1986 to be so that it could be extended to years.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/1981_England_riots\" title=\"1981 England riots\">1981 England riots</a> encouraged that, by bringing into sharp focus the results of large numbers of unskilled unemployed finding their own solutions.\nThe scheme promised training to its applicants and made use of a variety of different training locales such as businesses, colleges of <a href=\"/wiki/Further_education\" title=\"Further education\">further education</a> or training workshops run by voluntary organisations. Since the training place was guaranteed by the government and trainees were to be paid if they were on the course, eligibility for <a href=\"/wiki/Social_security\" title=\"Social security\">social security</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Unemployment_benefit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unemployment benefit\">unemployment benefit</a> was withdrawn.\n</p><p>Accredited organisations were required to provide at least 13 weeks per year of training away from the job and include life skills and social skills. A standardised form of certification was issued at the end of the training period.\n</p><p>In 1989, it was renamed <b>Youth Training</b> and was placed under the management of local <a href=\"/wiki/Training_and_Enterprise_Council\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Training and Enterprise Council\">Training and Enterprise Councils</a>. The trainees on the schemes could be classified as either trainee status or employed status.\n</p><p>The difference was distinguished by whether the trainee was recruited by an employer and provided with training for the company needs or if the trainee was being trained by a training organisation using employers as training placements. Often, employed status trainees would have their training allowance improved by the employer.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism\">Criticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_Training_Scheme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The YTS attracted political and social criticism from an early point. Critics claimed that the scheme enabled employers to exploit school leavers for cheap labour, and it provided little substance in the way of genuine education. The broad left alliance of musicians, artists, comedians and writers, \n<a href=\"/wiki/Red_Wedge\" title=\"Red Wedge\">Red Wedge</a>, criticised YTS for its discriminatory nature toward black people and women.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The government's line was that the scheme was an effective counter to the drop in <a href=\"/wiki/Apprenticeship\" title=\"Apprenticeship\">apprenticeships</a> and marked rise in youth unemployment that was seen in the early 1980s.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_Training_Scheme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u201cA State of Independence\u201d, Fact Not Fiction Series, no.1.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081006195150/http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/so/youthchron/Education/8090educ.htm\">Youth Policies in the UK: A Chronological Map, Keele University</a></li></ul>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<table class=\"metadata plainlinks stub\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"background:transparent\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(HM_Government).svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stub icon\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/45px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png\" width=\"45\" height=\"37\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/68px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/90px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1530\" data-file-height=\"1256\" /></a></td><td><i>This article related to government in the United Kingdom or its constituent countries is a <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub\" title=\"Wikipedia:Stub\">stub</a>.
