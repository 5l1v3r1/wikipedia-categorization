Makers Academy is a 12-week computer programming bootcamp in London. It was founded by Rob Johnson and Evgeny Shadchnev in December 2012   and is designed to turn people with no knowledge of web development into job-ready junior developers in 12 weeks. Makers Academy claims to take students with little or no experience in computer programming  and teach them the fundamentals of web development. The stated aim is to help students develop the necessary skills to secure a role as a junior developer upon graduation. The course covers professional web development technologies such as Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SQL, Ajax and softer skills including Object-oriented design, Test Driven Development, Agile Methodology and version control with Git.  The main course is preceded by a 4-week, part-time, online 'pre-course' which students have to complete first. The program adopts a "learn by doing" approach, achieved largely through self-directed, project-based work. Students are encouraged to work in pairs on practical coding challenges, with weekly tests, culminating in a final project which is presented to hiring partners on "Graduation Day".   Makers Academy claims a 100% success rate in getting graduates into jobs as junior developers. The course is split into 16 weekly sections (12 weeks of intensive learning, preceded by a 4-week, part-time, 'pre-course'):  At the end of each week students are given a test to gauge their progress, with merit stickers given to those who pass the test.  Makers Academy claim to be attempting to tackle the issue of the lack of women in the IT Industry.   They offer a Â£500 scholarship to any woman attending their course,.
