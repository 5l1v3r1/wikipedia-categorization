The phrase common room is used especially in British and Canadian English to describe a type of shared lounge, most often found in  dormitories, at (for example) universities, colleges,  military bases, hospitals, rest homes, hostels, and even minimum-security prisons.  It is generally connected to several private rooms, and may incorporate a bathroom. However, they may also be found in day schools and sixth forms.  Regular features include couches, televisions, coffee tables, and other generic lounge furniture for socializing.  Depending on its location and purpose of use, a common room may be known by another name. For instance, in mental hospitals, where access is usually restricted to the daytime hours, this type of room is often called a "day room".  In Singapore, the term usually refers to a bedroom without attached bathroom in an HDB apartment unit.  Common rooms are mentioned in the Harry Potter series.
