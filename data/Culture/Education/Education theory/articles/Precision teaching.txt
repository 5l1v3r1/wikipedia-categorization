Precision teaching is a precise and systematic method of evaluating instructional tactics and curricula.  It is one of the few quantitative analyses of behavior forms of applied behavior analysis.  It comes from a very strong quantitative scientific basis and was pioneered by Ogden Lindsley in the 1960s based largely on Skinner's operant conditioning. Precision teaching is a type of programmed instruction that focuses heavily on frequency as its main datum.  By focusing on fluency, the teacher can then adjust the curricula for each learner to maximize the learning based on the learner's personal fluency measurements. The instruction can be by any method or approach. For example, the most effective applications of precision teaching have been when it is combined with direct instruction.  Children as young as five have charted their fluency measurements and utilized precision teaching to increase their learning.   According to Owen White,  Precision teaching "has been used successfully to teach the progress of learners ranging from the severely disabled to university graduate students, from the very young to the very old". "When I was a graduate student, I trained a rat whose behavior did not extinguish exactly as the charts in Skinner's book had shown. My rat at first had responded much more rapidly when his responding was no longer reinforced. The rapid responding went on for about 30 minutes, at which time the rat stopped abruptly. I took the cumulative record of the rat's unusual extinction to Dr. Skinner and asked him how this had happened. How could the rat do this when the book showed a very different gradual extinction curve? Skinner answered, "In this case, the book is wrong! The rat knows best! That's why we still have him in the experiment!"For a good introductory article on how to use precision teaching and celeration charts see
