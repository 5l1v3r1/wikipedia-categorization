The  International Centre for Sports Studies, known mostly by the initials CIES from the French Centre International d'Etude du Sport, is an independent, research and education organization, located in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, focusing on statistical studies of football-related issues.  CIES was created in 1995 by researchers Raffaele Poli and Loïc Ravenel as a joint venture between FIFA, the University of Neuchâtel, and the City and State of Neuchâtel.  CIES conducts research mostly on players' transfer values    and team profiles.   CIES organizes and offers a one-year postgraduate sports executive program, endorsed by FIFA,  which consists of three modules that are taught across three universities in Europe, and concludes with a final project. The successful conclusion of the program merits the award of FIFA Master International in Management, Law and Humanities of Sport.
