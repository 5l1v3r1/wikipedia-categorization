  The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) is a privately-held national level   board of school education in India that conducts the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and the Indian School Certificate examinations for Class X and Class XII respectively.  It was established in 1958.   Over 2,100 schools in India and abroad are affiliated to the CISCE.  The then Minister of Education- Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, presided over a conference in 1952 on pan-India level Certificate examinations. The aim was to consider the replacement of the overseas Cambridge School Certificate Examination by an All India Examination.   This Indian Council was set-up on the grounds that a board was required to administer the examinations being conducted in India by the University of Cambridge and to optimally tailor them according to the nation's need. The future education policies were prepared under the aegis of the Cambridge varsity.
