The Bracken School Readiness Assessment ("BSRA") is an individual concept knowledge test designed for children, pre-K through second grade. The BSRA was developed by Bruce A. Bracken and first published in 2002 by The Psychological Corporation. Raw scores can be converted to percentile rank scores and standard scores. The publisher has supporting guides for converting standard scores into criterion categories (e.g. "advanced" or "delayed"). Reliability measures were within expected ranges given the age of the students. Validity was assessed using other published assessments (e.g. WPPSI-R, DAS).
