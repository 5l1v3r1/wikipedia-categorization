The National Education Examinations Authority (NEEA) is an agency of the Chinese Ministry of Education, headquartered in the Li Ye building (立业大厦), Tsinghua Science Park, Haidian District, Beijing.  It administers public certificate tests and tests of foreign origin in Mainland China,  including those for adults and prospective university students.  The NEEA was established in 1987. In 1994 it merged with the Office of the Self-taught Higher Education Examinations (国家教委高等教育自学考试办公室).   The latter, originally established in 1983, became subordinate to the NEEA as the Office of the Self-Taught Education Examinations (全国高等教育自学考试委员会办公室).   In July 2006 the NEEA had its fourth reorganization.  As of 2010 the NEEA has 10 different English examinations available.
