Historically there are a number of different motives for the development of youth work in the UK.  First, early youth workers, often from the middle classes,  frequently saw working with deserving young people as an expression of their Christian faith.  Secondly there was a concern to instill a middle class set of values in working class youth.\n</p><p>This early approach to youth work has actually been around since the birth of the <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\" title=\"Industrial Revolution\">Industrial Revolution</a> in the 19th century, which was the first time that young men left their own homes and <a href=\"/wiki/Cottage_industry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cottage industry\">cottage industries</a> to migrate to the big towns.  The result of this migration was an emergent <a href=\"/wiki/Youth_culture\" title=\"Youth culture\">youth culture</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_area\" title=\"Urban area\">urban areas</a>, which locally was responded to by the efforts of local people.  Although with the formation of the <a href=\"/wiki/YMCA\" title=\"YMCA\">YMCA</a> (and later <a href=\"/wiki/Scouting\" title=\"Scouting\">Scouting</a>) organisations were founded whose sole aim was to address these issues, the emphasis was always on providing for young people.\n</p><p>A government review of the Youth Service, set up in November 1958 and chaired by Lady Albemarle, was published in 1960. It argued cogently for specific kinds of provision to be provided by local councils and ushered in a significant building boom of new premises for youth work. Often thought of as a golden age, the period following the Albemarle report was a time of thriving centre-based youth work.\n</p><p>Today (as outlined in the <i>Transforming Youth Work</i> document released in 1998 by the <a href=\"/wiki/DfES\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"DfES\">DfES</a>) it is the statutory duty of all local government organisations to provide a youth service in their region.  Also for the first time the youth service has national targets that have to be met with regard to the reach (initial contact) with young people, the number of relationships developed with young people and the number of accredited learning programmes achieved through the youth service.\n</p><p>In 1999 in the UK the main national professional organisations and trades union (CYWU) agreed to join other professional bodies representing informal education practitioners (community workers, community based adult educators, community educators), to create a UK wide National Training Organisation called PAULO (named in honour of the educator Paulo Freire. PAULO was formally approved by the Government to set the occupational training standards for all people working in this employment sector. In 2002 PAULO formed part of the Lifelong Learning UK Sector Skills Council.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approaches_to_youth_work\">Approaches to youth work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_work&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Approaches to youth work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Community_youth_work\">Community youth work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_work&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Community youth work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Community_youth_workers\" title=\"Community youth workers\">Community youth workers</a> provide community-based activities for young people in a variety of settings throughout local communities, including <a href=\"/wiki/Places_of_worship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Places of worship\">places of worship</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Nonprofit_organizations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nonprofit organizations\">nonprofit organizations</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Government_agencies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Government agencies\">government agencies</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Youth_empowerment\">Youth empowerment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_work&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Youth empowerment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Youth_empowerment\" title=\"Youth empowerment\">Youth empowerment</a></div>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/wiki/Youth_voice\" title=\"Youth voice\">Youth voice</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Youth_activism\" title=\"Youth activism\">Youth activism</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Community_education\" title=\"Community education\">Community education</a></div>\n<p>Youth empowerment is the deliberate granting of authority to young people by adults.

In Northern Ireland, 64% of youth work is faith-based.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Detached_youth_work\">Detached youth work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_work&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Detached youth work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In its purest form, detached youth work is a form of street-based youth work provision that operates without the use of a centre and takes place where young people \"are at\" both geographically and developmentally. It is often confused with outreach work because of the similar principles, i.e. making contact on the streets with those \"hard to reach\" or \"unattached\" young people. Detached work is seen as more than trying to encourage young people to utilise existing provision (which is the often used definition of Outreach work) and is used as a method of delivering informal and social education and is concerned with addressing whatever <a href=\"/wiki/Need\" title=\"Need\">needs</a> are presented to or perceived by the youth worker.\n</p><p>Also referred to as \"street work\" by some European, North and South American practitioners, modern detached work appears to have been influenced in <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Britain\" title=\"Great Britain\">Great Britain</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Ireland\" title=\"Ireland\">Ireland</a> by early contributions from the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, and in particular, accounts of the work carried out by the Welfare Council of New York  with street gangs in the 1950s became some of the earliest literature available on the subject of street-based work.  Street work has, however, always,  since its earliest incarnations, had a role to play in youth work.\n</p><p>\nHowever, it is important to note that contributors on the subject, such as those referenced above, e.g. (Kaufman, 2001) &amp; (Smith, 1996.) have discussed the ambiguity surrounding the titling of such forms of work and the regular confusion around which form of work is which and indeed as Smith himself states </p><blockquote>\n<p>\"There has been a good deal of dispute over how to label the work described here. The problem with notions such as 'detached' is that it could still be seen as making the youth centre or traditional youth organization the basic reference point. (These are what the workers are detached from). Furthermore, the titling adds to the stereotypical view of detached workers as 'mavericks' who float free of attachment. The reality of practice is that a central feature of the work is the process of becoming attached - to a neighbourhood, groups of young people, local community members and so on.  To this can be added the pretty pointless debate between 'detached' and 'outreach' work. The latter, it is sometimes said, is mainly concerned with bringing people into existing organizations and activities; the former is about 'working with people where they are at'. In reality most 'detached' workers have to use existing organizations, and have a range of activities that people can plug into. Some care is needed around this area...Most detached workers have some sort of office and base (with group rooms etc.) Furthermore their contact making may well be 'off the street' in schools, various commercial leisure environments, and in people's homes\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reproduced from the encyclopaedia of informal education <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.infed.org\">http://www.infed.org</a>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Adding to this debate is the fact that while there exists much support for street-based provision there is few definitions in existence to clearly distinguish the differences (if any) between 'Outreach' and 'Detached' work. That said, the <a href=\"/wiki/Scottish_Executive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scottish Executive\">Scottish Executive</a> in 1998 commissioned <a href=\"/wiki/The_Princes_Trust\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Princes Trust\">The Princes Trust</a> to carry out a National Development Project to develop <a href=\"/wiki/Best_Practice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Best Practice\">Best Practice</a> guidelines and methods to monitor, evaluate and create a National focus for Outreach and Detached Youth Work.  Through their research they offered this clear and simple definition for detached work, that is adequate for all those who are unfamiliar with this type of youth work provision,\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Detached youth work is a model of youth work practice, targeted at vulnerable young people, which takes place on young people\u2019s own territory such as streets, cafes, parks and pubs at times that are appropriate to them and on their terms.  It begins from where young people are in terms of their values, attitudes, issues and ambitions and is concerned with their personal and social development.

Furthermore, the research points out that \"There is even some evidence from fieldwork that there can be an occasional overlap in practice between the two modes of work.
