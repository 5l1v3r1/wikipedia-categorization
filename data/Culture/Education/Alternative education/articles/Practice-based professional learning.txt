Practice-based professional learning (pbpl) is understood in contrast to 'classroom-' or 'theory-based' learning. It is kindred to terms such as 'work-based learning', 'workplace' or 'work-centred' learning. Distinctive, though, are a concern for professional learning, and the preference for 'practice' rather than 'work'. While it does not disdain propositional knowledge and what is sometimes called 'theory', its prime interest is in the formation of self-renewing and effective professional practicesâ€”a distinct theoretical position in its own right. The range of concerns may be seen, for example, in the UK Open University's practice-based professional learning centre,  one of the Higher Education Funding Council for England's centres for excellence in teaching and learning.  Its interests cover the inter-relation of various forms of professional knowledge, ways of fostering them and their co-ordination, workplaces as sites of learning, the assessment of practice-based learning achievements, and the use of modern technologies to support distributed learning. Other centres for excellence occupy some or all of the territory, notably the Professional Development Unit at the University of Chester,  SCEPTrE in the University of Surrey,  CEPLW in the University of Westminster  and NCWBLP in Middlesex University.  Interest in this territory is not confined to the UK, with some of the most respected work associated with David Boud at the University of Technology, Sydney, NSW.
