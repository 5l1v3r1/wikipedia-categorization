The paper's editor accused PLANS of alarming parents with claims for which there was no evidence, including the suggestion that Waldorf methods were disguised witchcraft teachings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Public school officials in California's Marysville, Twin Ridges, Novato and Butte schools criticized PLANS as well; a principal in the Yuba County District, which was the target of PLANS' protests over their two Waldorf methods schools, expressed outrage over \"the lies, the distortion of facts\" when questioned by a reporter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> In reference to the PLANS lawsuit, the Nevada County superintendent of schools characterized it as \"despicable\" to have to redirect moneys from teachers and curriculum to pay legal costs, and insisted there was no merit to PLANS' accusations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> The accuracy and expertise of PLANS officials also came under attack during lawsuit witness hearings.  Six of the PLANS board directors and advisors sought to testify as expert witnesses in the case, but each was eliminated due to their lack of expertise on the subjects of anthroposophy and Waldorf education: three were eliminated by the court judge, and the other three subsequently withdrawn voluntarily by PLANS' attorney, Kendall.  After reviewing key sections of the deposition testimony taken of PLANS' most vocal spokesperson, Dugan, the judge expressed \"grave doubts about any reliance upon his opinions about anything that has to do with any intellectual endeavor, including anthroposophy\" before ruling that Dugan would not be allowed to give testimony in the trial.<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When PLANS succeeded in convincing board members in Ross Valley and Chico school districts to vote against proposed Waldorf methods charters there, both proposals were welcomed by other school districts nearby, allowing the new schools to go forward.,<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-49\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> Local news commentators in one of the targeted communities castigated their local school district for caving to PLANS' threat of a lawsuit, and showcased the episode as one of the most notably \"boneheaded or downright wrong things\" of the past year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Anthroposophical_Society\" title=\"Anthroposophical Society\">Anthroposophical Society in America (ASA)</a>, which is the legal representative of anthroposophy in the United States, has challenged PLANS over PLANS' characterizations of anthroposophy, as well as PLANS' suggestion that the anthroposophical movement has a direct interest or involvement in the growth of Waldorf teaching methods in the public schools.   These were two claims PLANS made in its May 28, 2004, \"Motion for Summary Judgement\".  Though not a direct party to the case, the ASA petitioned the court's permission to respond to this trial motion as a <i><a href=\"/wiki/Amicus_curiae\" title=\"Amicus curiae\">friend of the court</a></i>.  The court granted ASA's petition and, in July 2004, the organization submitted an 18-page legal brief to the court challenging PLANS' assertions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Argumentation_by_Waldorf_methods_charter_schools_and_PLANS\">Argumentation by Waldorf methods charter schools and PLANS</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PLANS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Argumentation by Waldorf methods charter schools and PLANS\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Advocates of public Waldorf education claim that Waldorf methods (charter) schools should be able to receive public funding. PLANS claims that although Waldorf representatives often state that a public \"Waldorf methods\" program has been structured so as not to violate the U.S. Constitution, these schools nevertheless have religious underpinnings. Private Waldorf schools celebrate religious festivals and observe religious holidays, for instance. PLANS asserts that in public Waldorf methods schools these activities are not always avoided and are sometimes simply renamed. PLANS alleges that morning verses recited in the public school in which children thank the sun for its warmth are actually prayers, and claim that the sun is a metaphor Steiner used to refer to Christ.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> In public Waldorf methods schools in the U.S., \"God\" has been removed from the verse and replaced with \"the Sun\" to avoid violation of the U.S. Constitution. PLANS claims this is a cosmetic and not a substantive change.\n</p><p>PLANS also claims that not only private, but also public, Waldorf methods schools are anthroposophical institutions. According to PLANS, public Waldorf teachers are required in most cases to take Waldorf teacher training in which they are asked to read works almost exclusively by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, the focus of which are Steiner's tenets of anthroposophy.\n</p><p>The two Waldorf methods public schools PLANS brought to court presented numerous witnesses and introduced documents which contradicted this claim.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> The judge ruled that PLANS could not introduce evidence taken in the context of the private and independent Waldorf schools to argue their case against the public Waldorf-methods schools.  The court ruled that private schools are separate entities, and insisted evidence be limited to policies and practices in effect within the litigated public school districts.  The two schools furnished statements and documents in this case showing that the teachers in their Waldorf methods schools were held to the same state mandated training and credential requirements as the teachers in other public schools in those districts.  In response to a demand to prepare a complete list of all Waldorf-related documents and reading materials related to training or instruction in Waldorf teaching methods, neither school district identified a single text written by Rudolf Steiner. Betty Staley, the Rudolf Steiner College staff member who developed the public teacher training program, testified the college's <i>1993-1994 Teacher Training Booklists</i> did not apply to the public teacher training program, and that only one of the texts from the lists, Steiner's <i>Philosophy of Freedom</i>, was used by the program.<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-54\">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In their trial case, PLANS did not repeat their claim that these or other texts by Steiner were required in the public Waldorf-methods teacher training.  However, they did claim that the schools \"provide[d] books for its teachers that are filled with Anthroposophical doctrine\", and that teachers were \"hire[d] because of their Anthroposophical training.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-55\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-55\">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> According to Staley's testimony, references to spirituality were eliminated from the public Waldorf teachers\u2019 training materials to meet state standards. One teacher who had participated in this program before adopting Waldorf methods in her teaching in the Oak Ridge, and later John Morse schools, reported that Steiner\u2019s philosophy was alluded to in her training and that teachers who wanted to learn more could pay for their own classes, but that most of her colleagues from Morse did not pursue any anthroposophical training in the course of becoming public Waldorf methods teachers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-56\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-56\">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>PLANS claims the basis of anthroposophy is esoteric Christianity.  In court documents, PLANS argued that Rudolf Steiner considered himself a Christian and that he considered anthroposophy to be a Christian form of theosophy and Rosicrucianism.  PLANS argued that Steiner himself described anthroposophy as a training to access skills of psychic awareness latent in each human being, and argued that the discipline \"spiritual science\" is not a true science nor philosophy, but a theology.  PLANS acknowledged that Steiner's supporters frequently concede the spiritual foundations of anthroposophy and Waldorf education, but claimed they make a false distinction between <i>spiritual</i> and <i>religious</i>.  PLANS considered anthroposophy to be part of a New Age religious movement, characterized by its seekers' rejection of orthodoxy and creedal forms of religious expression in favor of a more eclectic and individualized path of spiritual-psychological transformation, a process which PLANS claimed to be generally acknowledged as \"religious experience\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-57\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-57\">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>PLANS wanted the court to agree that Waldorf methods schools lead students through New Age rituals and interpret them as religious practices.  It also wanted the court to agree that in the schools, anthroposophy permeates every subject, and that the underlying theory of the education is based on theology, not philosophy.  In order to do this, PLANS first needed to convince the court that anthroposophy was a religion.  This attempt was unsuccessful, and PLANS seeks to reverse the decision in appeals court.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Waldorf_educators_and_public_Waldorf_methods_education\">Waldorf educators and public Waldorf methods education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PLANS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Waldorf educators and public Waldorf methods education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some supporters of Waldorf education have suggested that Waldorf education does not belong in government schools. Eugene Schwartz is a prominent teacher and author who has stated that he agreed with Dugan that Waldorf education could not properly be separated from anthroposophy. In Schwartz's view, although Waldorf education is not sectarian, the children are intended to have inwardly religious experiences. In his speech he exemplified this with the way the origin and history of the Jews is taught in grade three in independent Waldorf schools. Schwartz was fired from his position at a teaching college shortly after the speech, and in a later interview, claimed there were many other Waldorf teachers who agreed with him but were afraid to speak out. In Schwartz's opinion, Waldorf education has the goal of making \"everything sacramental\", and that \"willing, feeling, and thinking\" are \"soul forces\" which are intentionally brought to every aspect of the education. Schwartz objected to educators who would reject the movement's religious aspect to suit the requirements of public education. In the interview, Schwartz lamented the fact that, in his view, public Waldorf methods schools are watered-down imitations of authentic Waldorf education.<sup id=\"cite_ref-58\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-58\">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Schwartz has since become an active promoter of Waldorf education in charter and public schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-59\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-59\">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=PLANS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Deposition testimony by Debra Snell, PLANS vs SCUSD, TRESD 1999</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ.

Plaintiff's counsel first stated that he had \"no proffer\" based on the court's prior ruling...7. Plaintiff's counsel then stated that he had one item of evidence to support Plaintiff's case that anthroposophy is a religion, namely, Plaintiff's Exhibit 89...11. Plaintiff did not proffer any further exhibits or witnesses on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes. 12. Plaintiff rested its case on the threshold issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion...B. Conclusions of Law: 1. Plaintiff failed to carry its evidentiary burden of establishing that anthroposophy is a religion for purposes of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the [constitution].  2.  Plaintiff's only proffered evidence, Exhibit 89, is inadmissible for a variety of reasons.  Plaintiff did not offer any foundation to support admissibility of the Exhibit[], nor did Plaintiff authenticate the Exhibit[].  Moreover, the Exhibit is rank hearsay and is not an \"adoptive admission\" under the exception to the hearsay rule...IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Plaintiff take nothing, that the action be dismissed on the merits, and that Defendants recover their costs.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Civil Appeals Docketing Statement\", PLANS, Inc., Plaintiff-Appellant v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, USCA Docket # 05-17193</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"Appleant's Opening Brief\" &#32;&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Sic\" title=\"Sic\">sic</a></i>&#93;, filed 3/13/2006, United States Court of Appeals For the Ninth Circuit, PLANS, Inc. v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, # 05-17193, \"The case was bifurcated with the matter of whether or not Anthroposophy was a religion to be tried first.
