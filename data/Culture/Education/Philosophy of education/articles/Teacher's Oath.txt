The Teachers Oath is an oath taken in some countries by teachers. Since 1863, nearly two-thirds of the states have adopted loyalty oaths for teachers.  Most known of them was the Massachusetts Teachers' Oath which was a loyalty oath required to teach in Massachusetts from 1935 to 1967. In 1993 the german educator Hartmut von Hentig designed the Socratic Oath, which is supposed to be a set of professional guidelines for educators,  teachers and paedagogues.  Today there are many different versions of the Teachers` Oaths, depend on country, e.g. Comenius Oath in Finland,  Teachers` Oath Taking in Philippines,  Abdul Kalam Teachers Oath in India,  Teachers Pledge in Singapore  Betimi i MÃ«suesit in Kosovo,  etc. As teacher and educator I undertake, So that I undertake, ~ Hartmut von Hentig - 1993
