Global education is a set of ideas taught to enhance one's perception of the world. It is taught within the curriculum where teachers integrate multiple dimensions, perspectives, and citizenships into everyday lessons.  It began as an undertaking to restructure education and society in the 1960s and 1970s, through the initiatives of educationalists, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. This global approach seeks to break an educational program that is stuck in subject knowledge and national culture, and instead, seeks to discover alternative motivations for education and alternate futures.  Students learning to be global citizens through global education will learn more about international communities, social justice issues, and global events within a typical classroom setting.  Australia:  United Kingdom:  Network of Young Europeans:  Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation:  Throughout the colonial period, Dutch, French, and British universities established branch institutions or sponsored new schools in colonies. In Latin America and the Philippines, Roman Catholic universities established institutions and religious orders, like the Jesuits, attempted what may now be alluded to as multinational advanced education activities. History shows the fare of instructive foundations and the connecting of establishments from multiple nations for the most part spoke to a union of unequals. Outside institutions control local branches, or new institutions, which forces the outside institutions beliefs ideologies onto the new institution. New institutions are founded on foreign ideas and values. When initiatives or institutions are transported across borders, academic models, programs and curriculum from the older system are more accepted and generally last longer. The idea of transporting academic institutions abroad is still a growing wonder, although not new. Traditional colonialism and government-sponsored programs created during the Cold War transported institutional models, methods, and curriculum from the home country to creating nations. A few number of esteemed American institutions have established campuses worldwide, typically in popular fields, such as business. The University of Chicago’s Business school has a campus in Spain where students in Spain and other European countries use the standard curriculum used at Chicago. Faculty from the University of Chicago teach the courses with an international focus. The program also includes a study abroad trip to the home campus. A surprising model of multinationalization is being under-taken by Singapore, which is welcoming various esteemed outside colleges, for example, the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, to begin programs in Singapore. The foundations, which are deliberately chosen by the Singapore government, are offered motivating forces to come to Singapore. In a related pattern, various US-supported colleges have been built up in Kyrgyzstan, Qatar and Bulgaria, among different spots. These schools regularly begin through neighborhood activity, with solid connections to American colleges, and are for the most part managed by the US accomplices and, authorize in the US. Classes are taught in English and the curriculum is based off the United States. "Twinning" programs have also begun to grow in popularity worldwide. These programs connect an academic institution in one nation with an accomplice school in another nation. Normally, the connections are amongst North and South, with the college in the North giving the essential educational modules and introduction. In such courses of action, scholarly degrees are regularly mutually granted. Twinning has the benefit of supporting establishments in the South in growing new curricular offerings, with the blessing of an outside college.  There are numerous aspects to the new multinationalization of advanced education. In most cases, the focal objective for the majority of the partners, particularly those in the North, is to procure a benefit. Foundations in the South that are pulled in to multinational activities may likewise be occupied with profiting and they are likewise worried about taking care of developing demand for access to higher training and giving new degree programs that may not be profit capable in local schools. Similarly, as with different parts of globalization in higher training, multinational plans between establishments are set apart by imbalance.  Teachers work with students to teach them how to be Global Citizens. Global Citizens will bring international perspectives to their ideas creating a mindset that they are deeply connected to everyone in the world. Global citizens will embrace cultural and human diversity. Many schools are leaning towards adding global education to the curricula in order to build global citizens for a hope for a better society.  Global Education deals with Social Justice issues across the world. Social Justice is taught to advocate for a better society in which people have equal accessibility to resources and equal treatment regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, class, or able-bodiedness. By creating a comfortable community, teachers can spark conversations with students that explore social justice issues locally and around the world to help understand the complexities of societies. Many teachers of Global Education expect students to be active in their community and challenge social justice issues outside of school. This can be done through community service engagement.  Diversity is complex and can relate to many different topics. Teaching diversity though Global Education promotes a healthy and equal classroom that will reflect in the community. Understanding diversity allows students to have an open mind about others and life. They are able to address differences appropriately and have a deep understanding about themselves. This will allow for the world to become an inclusive place where issues among race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, class, or able-bodiedness are addressed correctly and with respect.  The National Education Association (NEA) recognizes Global Education to be a goal that educators strive to succeed in the classroom. The American association supports study abroad trips and teaching overseas for teachers to get a first hand experience of different cultures.  Universities in the United States are also expanding their study abroad programs to enhance greater interconnectedness and global economic interdependence. The Institute of International Education (IIE) is researching effective ways that higher education in the United States can grow and create quality study abroad programs within the curriculum.  Many K-12 schools within the United States have adapted a Global Education Framework that was created for state wide implementation. Within this framework consist of six essential steps for a successful global education curriculum within each school:  Universities in the United States have recently been expanding on the degree programs relating to global education. Many universities offer Bachelor Degree programs and certifications in Global Education, M.S. degrees in Global and International Education, M.A. degrees in International Education, and doctorate degrees in International Education.  People with a degree in International Education design, implement, manage, and evaluate multiple education programs within public and private primary and secondary schools, public and private higher education programs, national corporations, and cultural agencies. People in the job field can work at agencies across the world, within elite universities, and a variety of global education organizations.  In January 2016, the Institute of International Education (IIE) announced the winners at the annual IIE Andrew Heiskell Awards for Innovation on International Education. The Heiskell awards were created to promote and honor outstanding commitments conducted in international higher education. Categories of the awards include: Internationalizing the Campus, Study Abroad, International Partnerships, and Internationalizing the HBCU. These awards hope to bring public awareness to the benefits of international education.  The International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) awards professionals in the global education field for their outstanding contributions to international education in Australia by providing excellence and best practice. The International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) also supports the international education communities’ research, projects, journalism, publications, and more areas that contribute to the global perspectives in education.  Evidence based practices have shown that literature can help children learn about global issues. By exploring diversity in text, connecting the literature to service learning and activism, promote critical thinking about themselves in the global community, and develop their global awareness with literacy elements. Literature introduced in the classroom can teach multiple skills that prepare for further learning within the global community.  Technology is a key provider in learning about globalization and participating in the global community. Technology can be used in the classroom to communicate around the world, establish global relationships, learn more about global current events, and developing global research. The advancements of technology will have a positive impact of global education in primary schools and higher education schools.  Academic institutions have started using information technology (IT) to offer degree programs and other curriculum to students who are outside of the campus. Distance education is quickly growing both inside nations and universally. IT is starting to shape educating and learning and is affecting the administration of academic institutions. Distance education is not a new phenomenon, it has been around for years. The University of South Africa has been granting academic degrees to students through correspondence for decades. IT has greatly extended the range and methodological advancement of distance education, in the process adding to the development of separation training foundations.  A key role of global education is participating in service learning within the community or abroad. Service learning provides people with hands on learning with direct engagement and awareness with real word systematic issues. These issues can range between varieties of topics that can affect a community. Participating in service learning can strengthen the community as well as create deeper knowledge about how to create a better world. Service learning is considered a key factor in becoming a global citizen. Many schools around the world are starting to incorporate service-learning activities within the curriculum to promote the importance of community involvement.  Service learning or local volunteer service work are included in conceptualized global citizenship programs. This approach is criticized because global relations are dramatically split into rich and poor, or oppressor and oppressed, respectively. Experiences of oppression are more complex than experiences of oppressing. Global citizenship education includes connecting nearby and worldwide issues and points of view and may incorporate such themes as human rights, social equity, and citizenship instruction, economic improvement, and globalization. Service learning can carry the possibility to recreate social disparities and advance, instead of dissipate, stereotypes.  Service learning programs are different from other ways for experiential education by their intention to similarly benefit the provider and the recipient of the service and to keep equal focus on the service being given as well as the learning that is happening. Service learning programs are designed to mix service into courses. These programs are expected to provide services to others while also help the student to better understand their course, topics, or educational focus or major.  In South Carolina, Delaware, Kentucky, and Vermont, service learning is firmly advanced as a system for education reform. Service learning builds up students' feeling of civic and social duty and their citizenship abilities. Students who engage in service learning are more occupied with their service and more spurred to learn. Service learning can also result in students feeling as though they have learned more in their classes. At the point when service learning meets a genuine group need and incorporates significant arranging, administration, reflection, and celebration, it normally prevails with regards to connecting with understudies in the learning undertaking. Service learning has gained more popularity among educational institutions in recent years and has also spread across the country. The number of supporters of service learning continues to increase as well.  There are several elements that make service learning effective.
