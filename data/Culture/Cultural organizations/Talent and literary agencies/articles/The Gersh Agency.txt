 The Gersh Agency (also known as TGA, or simply Gersh) is a talent and literary agency established in 1949 by Phil Gersh,  based in Beverly Hills, California and New York City. The Gersh Agency is the sixth largest talent agency in the United States.  Gersh was founded in Beverly Hills in 1949 by Phil Gersh. He was considered one of the last links between Hollywood's Golden Age and today's corporate-owned movie business  and his clients included Humphrey Bogart, David Niven, William Holden, June Allyson, Richard Burton, Lee J. Cobb, Fredric March, Gloria Grahame, James Mason, Karl Malden, and Robert Wise.  In 1990, Richard Arlook joined the agency, which subsequently grew from a handful of agents to over twenty agents. Phil Gersh gradually handed over responsibility to his two sons but continued to play a role in the company's management until 10 weeks before his death in 2004.  The agency is currently run by Phil Gersh's sons, Bob (born 1951) and David (born 1948). They have since represented clients including Tom McCarthy, Jeffrey Tambor, Dave Diomedi,  Adam Driver,  Pamela Gray,  Sasha Lane,  Thomas Gibson,  Drew Lynch,  Terry Gilliam,  Wynona Ryder,  Pat Healy,  Cameron Scoggins,  Sasheer Zamata,  Joel David Moore,  Meghan Trainor,  Anna Ziegler,  Sasha Lane,  Kristen Stewart,  Anne Winters,  Ericson Core,  Megan Hilty, Kelli O'Hara, Laura Benanti,  and Andie MacDowell.  On 4 July 2018, TGA notified actor James Woods by email that they would no longer represent him. Woods accused the agency of liberal political bias due to his outspoken conservative views.    In 2010, TGA purchased literary agent Hohman, Maybank, Lieb, with a portfolio of writers including Robert Rodat, Katherine Fugate, Dave Reynolds, Ken Hixon, Sam Harper, Mitchell Kapner, Ben Ripley, David Scarpa, Geoff Rodkey, Marlene King, Alan McElroy, Chris Parker, Allison Burnett, Seth Bass, and Jonathan Tolins.
