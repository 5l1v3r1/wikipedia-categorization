Initially started by Nafis Ahmed  while he was a student in his sophomore year at IBA-DU, LiveSquare became known with a series of lounge concerts under the banner of The Wireless Sessions  featuring bands such as Arbovirus, Shunno, Artcell, Cryptic Fate and Nemesis, in a time when the lounge music scene in Dhaka was in its infancy.  LiveSquare also organized and executed several one-off concerts during this time, including a fundraising concert for the victims of the hurricane Cyclone Sidr.  LiveSquare went on a year-long hiatus in 2010 following Ahmed's graduation and subsequent employment at a reputed marketing agency. LiveSquare organized several new events in 2011, such as the tribute concert Titans: Iron Maiden  and The ABC Generation   series.

The Wireless Sessions were also brought back during this time.
