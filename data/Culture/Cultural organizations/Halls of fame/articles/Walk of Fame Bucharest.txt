Walk of Fame (Romanian: Aleea Celebrităților) is a project organized by Cocor and Metropolis Theater. The actors thus honored receive a star on the boulevard in Time Square (Romanian: Piața Timpului), in Bucharest, Romania. The criterion for choosing actors depends on the month in which they were born. The project is similar to that in Łódź, Poland, and is inspired by the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in Los Angeles, United States. The Walk of Fame was inaugurated on January 31, 2011.
