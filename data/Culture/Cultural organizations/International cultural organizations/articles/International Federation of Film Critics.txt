 The International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI, short for Fédération Internationale de la Presse Cinématographique) is an association of national organizations of professional film critics and film journalists from around the world for "the promotion and development of film culture and for the safeguarding of professional interests." It was founded in June 1930 in Brussels, Belgium.  At present it has members in more than 50 countries worldwide. The FIPRESCI often gives out awards during film festivals (such as the Vienna International Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival and the Warsaw International Film Festival) to reward what they see as enterprising film making. Winners of the award include: Robert Bresson refused this award at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. As of 2005, it also offers an online cinema journal, Undercurrents, edited by film critic Chris Fujiwara.
