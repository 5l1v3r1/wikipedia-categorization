The World Heritage Committee is a committee which selects the sites to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger, monitors the state of conservation of the World Heritage properties, defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties. It is composed of 21 states parties  that are elected by the General Assembly of States Parties for a four-year term.  According to the World Heritage Convention, a committee member's term of office is six years, however many State's Parties choose to voluntarily limit their term to four years, in order to give other States Parties an opportunity to serve.   All members elected at the 15th General Assembly (2005) voluntarily chose to reduce their term of office from six to four years.  The World Heritage Committee meets once a year to discuss the management of existing World Heritage Sites, and accept nominations by countries.
