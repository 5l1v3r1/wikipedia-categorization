The Global Cultural Districts Network (GCDN) is a federation of global centers of arts and culture that fosters cooperation and knowledge-sharing among those responsible for conceiving, funding, building, and operating cultural districts and/or clusters with a significant cultural element. The GCDN was founded in 2013 by Adrian Ellis and established by AEA Consulting, the New Cities Foundation, and the Dallas Arts District. Members represent cities, cultural districts, and cultural institutions from around the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, China, and Singapore.  The creation of the GCDN was sparked by a series of conversations with cultural leaders who were aware that whilst there existed forums in which people responsible for specific kinds of cultural institutions (museums or performing arts centers) could meet and discuss common issues, there was no such forum for those responsible for cultural districts, even though there is a great deal of new activity in this sector. (Some $US250 bn. is being invested in cultural infrastructure in districts over the next fifteen years.)  Income increase 80% 2016 Members of the Network meet twice a year to discuss a range of issues: governance; content and programming alliances; the animation of public spaces; the role of large scale cultural anchor institutions in districts; technology; development and training needs; effective methodologies for cultural planning; and more.
