The Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre is a cultural complex in Kuwait owned by the Diwan Amiri. It consists of museums, fine arts centre, theatre, and public spaces that include outdoor exhibits, as well as cafes and restaurants. The Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre is a 13-hectare site with a total exhibit area of 22,000 m2 making it the largest museum project in the world.   The Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre will create a new world class museum district within Kuwait. Together with the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre, the cultural centre is part of the new Kuwait National Cultural District (KNCD).    The cultural district is a celebration of the scientific and cultural achievements of mankind and the scale, shapes and shades of the buildings are designed to convey a sense of wonder and awe.   Each building contains an array of permanent and temporary world class exhibits and artworks.  Kuwaiti architecture is represented by the main ‘street’ which is not a straight line and echoes the traditional ‘Ferej’. This creates exciting spaces, corners and walkways, mirroring the experience of walking down a traditional, busy Kuwaiti street.   The museums present Kuwaiti, Islamic, and Arab culture and history. They also embrace and showcase the rich diversity of the world’s finest cultural achievements.  The museum district consists of six main buildings:   The fine arts centre includes artist studios and an artist-in-residence program.
