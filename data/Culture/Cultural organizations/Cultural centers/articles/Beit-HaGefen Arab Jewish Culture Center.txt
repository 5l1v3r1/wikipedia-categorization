The center is also engaged in the interfaith movement, providing a platform for regular meeting between representatives of three major monotheistic religions.  Every two years, Beit Ha'Gefen organizes an interfaith conference, with participation of Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Bahai and Druze clerics and religious authorities.     Beit Ha'Gefen has six departments: the Culture department, Contemporary Art Gallery, El Karama Theater, Visitor Center, Dialog and Program Center and The Clore Library and Cultural Center for children.  Beit Ha'Gefen also operates a contemporary Art Gallery that hosts multiple exhibitions per year that are related to tolerance and coexistence.
