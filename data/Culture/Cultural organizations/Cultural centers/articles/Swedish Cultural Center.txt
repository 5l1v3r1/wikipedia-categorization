The Swedish Cultural Center is a meeting spot for Scandinavians in Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 1892, initially as the "Swedish Club". The club is located at 1920 Dexter Avenue North in a building designed by architects Einar V. Anderson, Arden Croco Steinhart, and Robert Dennis Theriault Sr., and built 1959-1961.  Prior to that they were located in a 1902 building on Eight Avenue by contractors Otto Roseleaf, August S. Peterson, and Otto Rudolf Roseleaf.  The club hosts a number of events for members and non-members. Among their public events are a monthly pancake breakfast  and a Friday Kafé;  their Friday evening "happy hour" (which actually runs for 5-1/2 hours) is open to "prospective members".  They also offer Swedish lessons and show  Scandinavian films.  Coordinates: 47°38′11″N 122°20′32″W﻿ / ﻿47.63639°N 122.34222°W﻿ / 47.63639; -122.34222
