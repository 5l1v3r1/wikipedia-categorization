Nazrul Tirtha (Bengali: নজরুলতীর্থ; Nazrul Pilgrimage) is a cultural and educational center dedicated to the rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.  The center is situated at Action Area 1, New Town (few meters away from Rabindra Tirtha). West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurated the center on 24 May 2014 to mark the occasion of the 115th birth anniversary of the poet.    From August 2015, the center started screening films   and in November 2015 became a venue for the Kolkata International Film Festival.   Nazrul Tirtha also hosts art exhibitions.   The design and architecture of the center is said to be unique in Kolkata   and bears the signature material of controversial Swiss-born French architect Le Corbusier.  Nazrul Tirtha
