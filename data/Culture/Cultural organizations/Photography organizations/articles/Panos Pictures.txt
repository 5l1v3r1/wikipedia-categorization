 Panos Pictures is a photo agency based in London and founded in 1986. It specialises in stories about global social issues  for international media and NGOs   using photography and video. It also produces exhibitions and long-term documentary projects. As of September 2015, Adrian Evans is its director and has a controlling share in the company. Panos Pictures began in 1986 as a small independent for-profit photo agency specialising in environmental issues.  It was founded and partly owned by environmental charity Panos London (the Panos Institute's London office) out of its photo archive.  Adrian Evans joined as director in 1990 and spent five years overseeing its expansion.  Panos London closed in 2013. The Panos Institute, a sister organisation of Panos Pictures, has been renamed Panos Network, a network of five member institutes. Panos Pictures has at any time a group of twenty of its photographers, called Panos Profile, whom it represents more comprehensively than its wider group of photographers, which it calls Panos Network   (this Panos Network should not be confused with the sister organisation described above).
