Transphotographiques is a photography festival based in Lille, France.    It was created in 2001 by Olivier Spillebout, and organized since 2003 by the House of Photography (Maison de la photographie (Wikidata)).  Every year, or biannually, Transphotographiques runs exhibitions, workshops, conferences, and educational programs in the Lille area. For each festival, the work of a special guest (invité d'honneur) – or marraine (godmother)   or parrain (godfather)  – "defines that year's theme".  It is chaired by Bertrand de Talhouët, managed by Olivier Spillebout and organized in partnership with the magazine Photo, and runs from mid May to mid June. The festival is based in Lille, where these locations have been used: Tri Postal (Wikidata)    - Palais Rameau (Wikidata)   - Maisons Folies (Wikidata)  - Maison de la photographie (Wikidata)   - Vieille Bourse  - Palais Rihour (Wikidata)   - Hôtel de ville (Wikidata)  - Lille Cathedral  - Église Saint-Maurice de Lille  - Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse (Wikidata)   It has expanded outside Lille. The 2007 festival, for example, also had events in Roubaix, Lambersart, Valenciennes, and across the border in Kortrijk.  One part of the work of Transphotographiques is to promote the work of local photographers.  It is part of Photo Festival Union, a European network of photography festivals.  A month-long exhibition in Stary Browar, Poznań in 2008, Kolekcja Transphotographiques, was a retrospective of the first seven years of Transphotographiques.
