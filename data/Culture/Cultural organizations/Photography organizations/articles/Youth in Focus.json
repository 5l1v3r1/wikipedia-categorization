During his 30-year teaching career in <a href=\"/wiki/Compton,_California\" title=\"Compton, California\">Compton, California</a>, Walter would ask, \"What is the big difference that makes one young person become a successful orthopedic surgeon, and the one who sat next to him in class is dead or in jail before the age of 20?\" The answer always was found with an adult who took time to care and support.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The organization started summer photography program in a borrowed darkroom, and as a result, 14 youths completed the first 10-week session of Youth in Focus. The organization was incorporated as a non-profit in 1997. Today, this nationally-recognized program has afternoon and summer sessions and serves nearly 200 participants each year. The organization offers free classes year-round in a purpose-built photography space. Youth and Focus continues to expand its service through partnerships with other local youth service agencies and by providing advice and encouragement across the country to other groups who seek to emulate our model of youth empowerment through photography. When not traveling, Walter lives in Seattle's <a href=\"/wiki/Madrona,_Seattle\" title=\"Madrona, Seattle\">Madrona</a> neighborhood with his wife, Lynne Iglitzin, and dog, Candy.\n</p><p>Youth in Focus began working with the <a href=\"/wiki/Jeff_Raikes\" title=\"Jeff Raikes\">Raikes</a> Foundation in 2010 to participate in the Youth Program Quality Initiative. Youth Program Quality Assessment (YPQA) scores for Youth in Focus, in the Spring of 2011 and 2012, were consistently higher than comparison scores for 780 other National Youth programs. Our scores were higher in all main categories, and significantly higher in Supportive Environment and Youth Engagement.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_events\">Recent events</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_in_Focus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Recent events\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most recently, Youth and Focus was chosen by <a href=\"/wiki/KEXP-FM\" title=\"KEXP-FM\">KEXP-FM</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Starbucks\" title=\"Starbucks\">Starbucks</a> and Seattle Theater Group as at the beneficiary of The Little Big Show #5.

The organization's goal is to put cameras in the hands of low income, at-risk youth and place them in a challenging environment surrounded by high quality talented teachers, nurturing adult volunteer mentors, and create a strong community of support.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Through photography, the students are able to find their voice, identity, creativity, and gain new confidence in their worth and abilities.\n</p><p>After an interview process, accepted students are given a $1,000 scholarship, covering the total cost of instruction and equipment. Classes meet with their teaching artists and mentors twice a week for three hours over a nine-week quarter. Students submit, display and discuss their final work during our End of Quarter Show. Youth in Focus partners with other agencies to provide photography workshops in order to expand our reach and to enhance the partner's regular programming. The organization has worked with community centers, schools and other youth service agencies. They are currently partnering with Friends of the Children and Youth Care, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=South_Lake_High_School_(Washington)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"South Lake High School (Washington) (page does not exist)\">South Lake High School</a> and Big Picture High School, among others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Accomplishments\">Accomplishments</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Youth_in_Focus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Accomplishments\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/President%27s_Committee_on_the_Arts_and_Humanities\" title=\"President&#39;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities\">President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities</a> recognized Youth in Focus as a model program in the year 2000, providing \"life-changing activities\" to youth with limited opportunities.
