World Street Photography is an independent nonprofit organization and community created for street photographers by the non-profit Kujaja organisation. World Street Photography was founded in February 2014 by Gido Carper with the intention of giving street photographers a community and a public arena to show their street photography. Profit from its photobooks is given to charitable organizations. The World Street Photography Awards  are street photography competitions divided into 8 categories representing different types of street photography: Free style, Urban Geometry, Street Portraits, Decisive Moment, Shades and Lights, Reflections, Juxtaposition and Without Humans. Winners receive an award and are included in the annual World Street Photography Photobook and/or shown in the yearly exhibition. The judges are Alex Coghe,  Chris Suspect, Michael Ernest Sweet, Don Springer, Jonathan Highbee, Lara Kantardjian, Lauren Welles, Peter Kool, Tatsuo Suzuki, Setsiri Silapasuwanchai and Siegfried Hansen.  The profit of the two World Street Photography Photobooks were donated to Ashalayam.
