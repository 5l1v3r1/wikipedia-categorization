Contact Press Images is an international and independent photojournalism agency founded in 1976 in New York City by French-British journalist and editor Robert Pledge and American photojournalist David Burnett. Annie Leibovitz joined Contact Press in 1977. In 1990, the agency opened its European office in Paris under the supervision of Dominique Deschavanne, a French journalist and picture editor. In addition to producing monographs and exhibitions, some of Contact's photographers have been awarded prizes in photojournalism, including honors from the World Press Photo, National Press Photographers Association, and Overseas Press Club of America. The agency is focused on human rights issues such as wars and conflicts, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, religion and ethnicity, and environmental issues.
