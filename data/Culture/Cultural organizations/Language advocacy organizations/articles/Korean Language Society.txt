Korean Language Society is a society of hangul and Korean language research, founded in 1908 by Kim Jeongjin. Hangul Day was founded in 1926 during the Japanese occupation by members of the Korean Language Society, whose goal was to preserve the Korean language during a time of rapid forced Japanization.  It established a Korean orthography (한글 맞춤법 통일안) in 1933.
