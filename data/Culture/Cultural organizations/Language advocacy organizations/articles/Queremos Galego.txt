Queremos Galego or Plataforma Queremos Galego! (English: We want Galician!) is a citizen platform and social movement, consisting of 600 entities from different areas  and by people individually, that was born in 2009 to articulate a collective response in defense of the Galician language, its public use and the linguistic rights of the Galician-speaking population. The main actions of the platform are demonstrations and public acts. The current main goal of Queremos Galego is to fight against the linguistic policy of the People's Party of Galicia.  The platform called for two demonstrations in 2009. The first one on May 17 and the second on October 18,  with an assistance of 50,000 people.  On January 21, 2010 called a general strike in the Galician education system and for a demonstration in Santiago de Compostela,  which was seconded by most unions, opposition political parties, teachers, students, parents and various groups. The demonstration was attended by 50,000 people according to the police and by 100,000 according to Queremos Galego.   According to the Xunta de Galicia the 50% of teachers and students went on strike the same day, according to Quermos Galego it was the 90%.  The coverage of the strike by the Galician public TV station was widely criticized.    Queremos Galego called for demonstrations again in the Galician Literature Day of 2012 and 2013. Both demonstrations had an assistance o around 25,000 people. In the Galician Literature Day of 2014 Queremos Galego called for 8 demonstrations in the main cities of Galicia against the linguistic policy of the People's Party of Galicia.
