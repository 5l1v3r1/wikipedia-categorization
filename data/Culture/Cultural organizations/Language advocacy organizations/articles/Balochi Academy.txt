The Balochi Academy promotes the Balochi culture through the development and promotion of the language and literature; support for literary circles; conducting seminars and conferences; and inviting academics from other parts of Pakistan and abroad as guest speakers. It was officially established in 1961 and is located in Quetta, the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan. It publishes books in Balochi, Pashto, Urdu, English and Persian.  Before 1997 the Academy didnâ€™t have a building of its own. In 1997 Chief Minister of Balochistan Akhtar Mengal, who was interested in supporting the language, provided the Academy with land and a grant to construct its own building. In 1999 the complex was officially opened. It is a three-story building in central Quetta with a library and conference hall.
