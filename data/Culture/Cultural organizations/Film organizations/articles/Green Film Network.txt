The Green Film Network  is an international association of environmental film festivals and was founded to support the work of international documentary filmmakers and promote films that raise awareness of environmental topics. In February 2014, the network presented the inaugural Green Film Network Award  as a new transnational award for best environmental documentary of the year. Nominated by 11 of the network member film festivals  and selected by an international jury,  the annual award included a prize of 5,000 Euros and an award presentation and screening at a GFN festival. The first GFN Award was presented to filmmaker Reuben Aaronson for the documentary Amazon Gold during the opening ceremony of Fife ÃŽle-de-France (International Environmental Film Festival) in Paris on February 4.
