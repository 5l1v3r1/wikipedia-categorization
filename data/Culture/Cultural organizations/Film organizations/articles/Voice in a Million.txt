Voice in a Million is a project founded in 2009 to raise awareness for the plight of millions of children worldwide, that are orphaned, abandoned or separated from their birth parents; and in need of a loving family for life. The project achieves this by staging large arena concerts with one of the largest children's choirs in the world. The current Voice in a Million Choir began in July 2009 with 34 children.  Founded by Jo and Robert Garofalo,  events are run by Voice in a Million Limited.  Teachers can register their school to participate in arena events for £50 by using a online form and each child must purchase a T-Shirt for £12.50. The only entry requirement is that schools bring a minimum of 10 participants and "many schools that don’t have choirs also participate with their pupils for a fun and educational experience."   Parents are also encouraged to support their children by attending, with ticket prices ranging from £25 - £50 each for the 2017 Wembley Arena concert,  and can also pay to have messages in the programme,  buy a DVD of the event   as well as buy glowsticks and other merchandise for their children singing at the event.  Participants are encouraged to donate to Adoption UK via text or during the performance,  although Voice in a Million Limited itself does not make any donations from the event money raised.
