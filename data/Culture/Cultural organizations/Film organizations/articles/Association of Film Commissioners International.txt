Association of Film Commissioners International (AFCI) is worldwide network of more than 360 commissions from 40 countries on every continent except Antarctica. The AFCI represents trained, experienced and professional Film Commissioners and their offices and staff, sets standards and provides professional education, offers training and business services in the field of Film Commissioning, and provides regular marketing and network opportunities in Hollywood and around the world for Film Commissions. The AFCI was founded in 1975 to serve the growing needs of on-location film and television production. Originally, the AFCI was formed by a small group of film commissioners who wanted to share information and learn from one another’s experiences. The AFCI incorporated in Washington, D.C. in 1983. Since then, the AFCI has expanded into a worldwide network of more than 360 commissions from 40 countries on every continent except Antarctica. Members of the AFCI are Film Commissions from around the world. A film commission is a purpose-built organization or department set up by an interested city, county, state / province or federal government with the specific mandate of promoting and developing filming activity within the jurisdiction. The primary goal of any film commission is to attract film and video production to an area in order to accrue locally-realized benefits from hiring local crews and talent, renting local equipment, using hotel rooms, rental cars, catering services, or any number of goods and services supplied on location. In other words, Film Offices attract Film & TV productions to their locations, and then ensure that the location capitalizes on that production activity. Member Film Commissions have typically been established by cities, counties, states / provinces or federal governments, and are generally operated and funded by various agencies of government, such as the governor’s office, the mayor’s office, chambers of commerce, convention and visitors’ bureaus, tourism offices and business and economic development departments. 61.7%: US 14.1%: Europe 10.9%: Asia/Oceana 9.4%: Canada 3.9%: Africa/Latin America 25.8%: 1–5 years 20.3%: 6–10 years 14.8%: 11–15 years 16.4%: 16–20 years 7.0%: 21–25 years 15.6%: over 25 years 42.2%: County/Region 26.6%: State/Province 25.0%: City 6.3%: Country 57.8%: Government 42.2%: non-profit Corp. 45.8%: Economic Dev. 18.1%: Tourism 11.1%: Arts/Culture 8.3%:  Other 8.3%: Elected Official 5.6%: Stand Alone 2.8%: Community Dev. 38.6%: Gov.

In 1985, the AFCI partnered with the American Film Marketing Association to host Location Expo, the first on-location trade show for film and television production. Film Commissions from around the world gathered to promote their locations and services to American producers. The first Location Expo attracted 60 film commissioners and some 1,200 people from the film industry to a Los Angeles exhibition site. During the next four years, the Expo’s space demands increased so that by 1990 the show had to be held at a site different from the AFM conference. Attendance tripled. Then in 1991, Expo relocated with the AFM to Santa Monica. The annual trade show, now an AFCI-sponsored event and known as the AFCI Global Finance and Locations Show, soon became too large to be held in conjunction with AFM, moved its event to early spring, and welcomes over 200+ film commissions and commercial affiliates exhibiting their services to more than 3,000 delegates. The AFCI has been a sponsor of the Location Managers Guild Awards since their inaugural event in 2014, which is currently scheduled to coincide with the AFCI Location Show to take advantage of the number of film commissioners and international location professionals attending the show. A representative of the AFCI has typically been the presenter for the award for best film commission. Cineposium is an educational and networking event for film commissions first held in 1976. A program of educational seminars, it is designed to teach film commissioners about the management and processes of the film commission business. The event rotates among its active members, with recent locations including Jecheon (2013), New York (2014), Barcelona (2015), Atlanta (2016), and Los Angeles (2017). The AFCI also participates in a number of other film festivals and markets, sponsoring panels and events at the American Film Market, Berlinale, Busan Film Festival, Festival de Cannes, and Sundance Film Festival. AFCI offers multiple levels of training to members and non-members. From the entry level Film Commission Fundamentals online class to Master Classes and the Certified Film Commissioner program, AFCI members are the best trained in the world. AFCI also provides a variety of networking opportunities so members can market their local jurisdictions, educate themselves and their staff on cutting-edge production trends that impact filming on location.
