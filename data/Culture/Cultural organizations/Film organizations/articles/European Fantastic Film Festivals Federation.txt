European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (EFFFF), established in 1987, is a network of 22 genre film festivals from 16 countries  based Brussels, Belgium, and dedicated to promoting and supporting European cinema, particularly films in the fantasy, horror and science fiction genres.  Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton describe it as "the biggest fan-based cult-network on the continent", comparable in scope to World Science Fiction Convention, San Diego Comic-Con International, and Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors, though less commercial.  The EFFFF annually awards the Golden Méliès (Méliès d'or) for the best European fantastic feature film and short film, and the Federation Award for Best Asian Film. The EFFFF was founded in 1987 on the initiative of five film festivals: the Fantafestival in Rome, Fantasporto in Porto, the Paris International Fantastic Films Festival, the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival and the Sitges Film Festival. The EFFFF created its first awards in 1995, the Méliès d'argent (Silver Méliès) and the Méliès d'or (Golden Méliès), named in honour of Georges Méliès, the great French pioneer of fantastic cinema and special effects. The awards were intended to highlight the creativity and quality of European fantastic films, stimulate production and promote them worldwide. The first Méliès d'or ceremony was held by the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival in 1996 and the prize was given to Álex de la Iglesia for The Day of the Beast (Spanish: El día de la Bestia).  Since 1996, the EFFFF has awarded the annual Méliès d'Or and Méliès d'Argent (Golden or Silver Méliès) for the Best European Fantastic Feature Film.  Variety has called the Melies d'Or "Europe's top plaudit for horror pictures".   The following films have received the award:
