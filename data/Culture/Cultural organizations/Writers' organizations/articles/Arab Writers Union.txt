The Arab Writers Union (ar.: اتحاد الكتاب العرب) is an association of Arab writers, founded in 1969, in Damascus, at the initiative of a group of writers among whom the Syrian novelist Hanna Mina. The Union is currently based, from 2015, in Abu Dhabi, after it was moved from Damascus to Cairo in 2008.  On 27 January 1995, following Syrian pressure, it was announced in Damascus that the Arab Writers Union had expelled the Syrian poet Adunis.  Emirati poet and Chairman of the Emirates Writers Union Habib Al Sayegh has been unanimously elected as Secretary-General of the Arab Writers Union. Al Sayegh will serve as Secretary General of the Arab Writers Union for a three-year term and author Abdul Raheem Allam, Chairman of the Moroccan Writers' Union, will serve as first deputy to the Secretary-General. The announcement was made in a press conference held by the former Secretary-General of the Arab Writers Union on Friday evening, December 25, 2015 at Rotana Beach Hotel, Abu Dhabi.
