The International Women's Writing Guild (IWWG) was founded in 1976. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit writing organization. Its mission is to "empower women writers personally and professionally through writing." The IWWG has been an official Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with special consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 1998.    The IWWG collects an annual membership fee from registered members. It offers workshops in person and online through its Digital Village.  The IWWG sponsors an annual week-long writing conference for women writers every summer, as well as a variety of regional events throughout the year.  The summer conference centers around 30 different workshops, open readings for participants, and an art studio.  Regional volunteers time to organize round table discussions in their local areas and offer mentoring to other writers.  There are also day long retreats that take place around the country. No portfolio or experience is needed for these retreats.  While IWWG accepts members, writers do not need to be a member in order to attend these conferences and events.  The membership does give access to discounts to the events, as well as opportunities to network and sell published work.   2018 Board of Directors:
