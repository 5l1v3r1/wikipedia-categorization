The International Affiliation of Writers Guilds is an international trade union federation representing guilds of professional screenwriters and playwrights.  Some affiliates also belong to national trade union federations. The IAWG strives to ensure that fair royalties and residuals are collected by enforcement of copyrights.  If a member of one guild emigrates to another country or the movie or play is exported, member guilds automatically recognize their membership through reciprocal agreements. A core function is the registering of scripts to verify original authorship.  Most affiliates also have annual award ceremonies to celebrate accomplishments in the craft.
