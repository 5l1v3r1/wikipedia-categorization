The Bengali Movement Theatre is a unique and a collaborative complex style of the post modern performing and visual arts, which was created by Dr Mukid Choudhury in 1997. The Bengali Movement Theatre uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of dance, gesture, speech, song, music, drama, text, cinema and media from Bengali diverse sources into a complex performance.
