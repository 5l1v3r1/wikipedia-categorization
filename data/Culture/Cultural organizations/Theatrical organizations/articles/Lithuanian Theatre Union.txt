The association awards Lithuanian stage actors and plays with annual awards, from Best Actor and Best Young Actor categories to Best Productions. It declared independence from the new Union of Theatre Workers before the abortive coup of August 1991.  Many of the top theatre critics and people are a member of this union, which numbered 1000 members in 1987.  Coordinates: 54°40′56″N 25°16′26″E﻿ / ﻿54.68222°N 25.27389°E﻿ / 54.68222; 25.27389
