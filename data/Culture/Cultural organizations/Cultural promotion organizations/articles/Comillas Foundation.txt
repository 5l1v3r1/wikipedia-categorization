The Comillas Foundation (Fundación Comillas del Español y la Cultura Hispánica) is a private nonprofit organization based in the town of Comillas, Cantabria, Spain.  Comillas Foundation, established in 2005, is dedicated to promote Spanish language and Hispanic culture. The academic activities of Comillas Foundation (University Degree in Hispanic Studies and Master in Teaching Spanish as Foreign Language) are developed through the International Center for Higher Spanish Studies (CIESE-Comillas), associated to the University of Cantabria. Besides that, the foundation provides forums and seminars related with Spanish language and culture. Comillas Foundation headquarters is situated at the former Comillas Pontifical University building. Until now, the activities of the foundation were held at the Sobrellano Palace, a few hundred yards from the future location, until the restoration of the buildings are concluded.  From May 2010, Comillas’ Foundation activities take place in an historical building entirely renovated.  Courses have been designed to satisfy the specific needs of the target groups, i.e. professionals and executives, companies, institutions, teachers, as well as adults and students of Spanish.
