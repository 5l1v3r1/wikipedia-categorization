DutchCulture operates in the areas of culture, media and heritage. DutchCulture is the result of a merger of SICA, Trans Artists and MEDIA Desk Netherlands. The organisation will also take up the tasks that were assigned to the discontinued Netherlands Institute for Heritage. DutchCulture is  located at Herengracht 474 in Amsterdam since 1 June 2013.  DutchCulture is supported with a four-year grant from both the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The merging organisations SICA, Trans Artists and MEDIA Desk had been active in the field of international cultural cooperation for years. The merger into DutchCulture puts together the different expertise, networks and experience. DutchCultureâ€™s activities include: cultural programming of the bilateral Netherlands-Russia year 2013; informing and advising about European cultural funding programmes; expertise with Artist-in-Residence programmes globally; reinforcing Dutch cultural cooperation with China, Turkey and Brazil; organising working visits for Dutch embassy staff and international experts; creating and maintaining (online) databases focusing on export of Dutch culture and cultural mappings of several countries. DutchCulture offers services to ministries and local authorities, artists and cultural organisations, embassies, the creative industries sector, civil society and the business sector. The Cultural Heritage Desk of DutchCulture strengthens shared heritage collaboration between Dutch and foreign heritage organisations, Netherlands embassies and Dutch agencies. They also manage the foreign visitors programme and a matching fund for Dutch Mutual Cultural Heritage.  A programme council advises them on the applications of this fund. The programme council exists of four experts Martine Gosselink, Gert Oostindie, Diederik Six, Joost Schokkenbroek and a representative from DutchCulture. Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands take part in the council as observers.
