Korean Cultural Centers (Korean: 한국문화원, Hanja: 韓國文化院) are non-profit institutions aligned with the Government of South Korea that aim to promote Korean culture and facilitate cultural exchanges. Starting from 2009, the Korean Culture and Information Service began setting up Korean Cultural Centers around the world. The centers are run by the Korean Culture and Information Service, a subdivision of South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.  As part of efforts to introduce and spread interest in diverse aspects of Korean culture, the centers have organized many programs under the categories of arts, music, literature, film and cuisine.  As of January 24, 2018, there are 32 Korean Cultural Centers in 28 countries.  These projects have been announced or are currently under construction. As such, this information may change as the projects move forward.
