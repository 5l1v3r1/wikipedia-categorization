An Austrian Cultural Forum is an agency of the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs, whose task consists of the cultural and scientific dialogue with artists and scientists of each particular host country.  A Cultural forum focuses on the specific needs of local users and partners, and works independently on different contents. The international network currently consists of 30 cultural forums. (originally established as either a "cultural institute" or a "cultural department of an Austrian embassy",which, in March 2001, were both renamed as "cultural forum") The Austrian Cultural Forum New York Translation Prize is an annual literary prize that supports translations of contemporary Austrian fiction, poetry, and drama which have not previously appeared in English, with a grant of US$5,000. The first award was in 2009. In 2012 and 2013 the award was "suspended until further notice" due to budgetary constraints. It was revived in 2014 and is now awarded in a two-year cycle.
