The Adam Mickiewicz Institute (Polish: Instytut Adama Mickiewicza) is a government-sponsored organization funded by Poland's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, and headquartered at ulica Mokotowska 25 (the Sugar Palace) in Warsaw. Named after Polish national poet Adam Mickiewicz, its goal is to promote the Polish language and Polish culture abroad.   The Institute operates a bilingual Polish-English portal, "Culture.pl", founded in 2001. Besides a large number of associated poets, essayists, writers, translators, artists; literary, music, and film critics; and curators, the Institute includes Paweł Potoroczyn (director),  editor-in-chief Weronika Kostyrko, and editors Mikołaj Gliński (literature), Filip Lech (music), Anna Legierska (theatre), Bartosz Staszczyszyn (film), and Agnieszka Sural (visual arts).  In addition to the Ministry-of-Culture-sponsored Adam Mickiewicz Institute, there are Polish Cultural Institutes, sponsored by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  in over 22 major foreign cities, including Berlin, Bratislava, Budapest, Bucharest, Düsseldorf, Kiev, Leipzig, London, Minsk, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Prague, Rome, Saint Petersburg, Sofia, Stockholm, Tel Aviv, Vienna, and Vilnius. While the Adam Mickiewicz Institute frequently collaborates with the Polish Cultural Institutes, each institution is independent of the other and is sponsored by a different Polish government ministry.
