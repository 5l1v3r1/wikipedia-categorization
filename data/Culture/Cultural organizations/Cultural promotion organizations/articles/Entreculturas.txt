It focuses mainly on educating the poor in Latin America and Africa, while responding to humanitarian crises and also educating to global awareness in Spain.  In Latin America and Africa, Entreculturas supports initiatives that promote education of the disadvantaged, ranging from teacher training and building classrooms and vocational training centres, to supporting educational programs on radio, to nutritional programs.
