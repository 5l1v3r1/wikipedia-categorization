 The Michigan Digitization Project is a project in  partnership with Google Books to digitize the entire print collection of the University of Michigan Library. The digitized collection is available through the University of Michigan Library catalog, Mirlyn, the HathiTrust Digital Library, and Google Book Search. Full-text of works that are out of copyright or in the public domain are available.    According to the University of Michigan University Library, they embarked on this partnership for a number of reasons: The project has received academic       and media attention.     In February 2008, the University of Michigan announced that over 1Â million books from the University Library have been digitized.  In September 2008, the University of Michigan announced the establishment of HathiTrust, a multi-institutional digital repository.
