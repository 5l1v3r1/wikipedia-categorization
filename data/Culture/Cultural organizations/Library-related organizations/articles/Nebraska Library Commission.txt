The Nebraska Library Commission is a Nebraska state government agency. Located in Lincoln, the Library Commission provides reference, resources, training, and consulting for all types of library in the state. The various collections housed at the Library Commission are used to serve librarians, state employees, seekers of government information, and visually handicapped Nebraskans. The Library Commission is a clearinghouse for state government publications and makes many documents accessible online. Nebraska residents are provided access to current magazines, journals, newspapers, genealogical records, and business information through NebraskAccess. Nebraska Memories makes Nebraska-related historical and cultural heritage materials accessible worldwide. The Talking Book & Braille Service provides free books and magazines on cassette and in Braille to individuals with a visual or physical condition or a reading disability which limits use of regular print. (Their transition to digital books and digital players is currently in progress.) This service is part of a nationwide network of cooperating libraries headed by the National Library Service (NLS), a division of the Library of Congress.  The Library Commission also provides training, both live and online, to librarians throughout the state of Nebraska. The Nebraska Library Commission's statutory authority is set forth under Article 4, Chapter 51 of Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska. In addition to the powers granted in Chapter 51, state statutes provide that the Commission is the state agency designated to receive federal library program funds appropriated for the Library Services and Technology Act. The mission of the Nebraska Library Commission is statewide promotion, development, and coordination of library and information services. As the state library agency, the Commission is an advocate for the library and information service needs of all Nebraskans.
