DataCite is an international not-for-profit organization which aims to improve data citation in order to: In August 2009 a paper was published laying out an approach for a global registration agency for research data.  DataCite was subsequently founded in London on 1 December 2009  by organisations from 6 countries: the British Library; the Technical Information Center of Denmark (DTIC); the TU Delft Library from the Netherlands; the National Research Council’s Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (NRC-CISTI); the California Digital Library (University of California Curation Center);  Purdue University (USA);  and the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB).  After the founding of DataCite, leading research libraries and information centres converged for the first official members’ convention in Paris on 5 February 2010. The inclusion of five further members was approved in the office of the International Council for Science (ICSU): Australian National Data Service (ANDS);  Deutsche Zentralbibliothek für Medizin (ZB MED); GESIS - Leibniz-Institut für Sozialwissenschaften; French Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (INIST);  and Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich. The primary means of establishing easier access to research data is by DataCite members assigning persistent identifiers, such as digital object identifiers (DOIs), to data sets. Although currently leveraging the well-established DOI infrastructure, DataCite takes an open approach to identifiers, and considers other systems and services that help forward its objectives.   DataCite's recommended format for a data citation is:  OR DataCite recommends that DOI names are displayed as linkable, permanent URLs.  Third-party tools allow the migration of content to and from other services such as ODIN, for ORCID   In April 2017, DataCite was one of the founding partners in the Initiative for Open Citations.
