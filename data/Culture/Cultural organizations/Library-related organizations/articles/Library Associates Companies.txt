LAC Group's service lines of business include: Consulting & Project Management, Information & Asset Management, Library Staffing & Research Services, Legal Staffing, Managed Services, and Recruiting. LAC Group was founded in 1986 by Deb Schwarz as a staffing agency specializing in law libraries.   By 1989, it was offering technical services and serving other academic and other special  libraries.   In 1999, Library Associates caused a stir in library circles and gained national attention when they were selected by Pillsbury Madison & Sutro LLP to manage their library operations.    The company continued its expansion into different markets with its acquisition of Medical Library Consultants (MLC) from Betsey Beamish in 2001  and of Sanad Support Technologies from Jodi  and Fuad Suleiman in 2003.    With the acquisition of Sanad, Library Associates consisted of two divisions, Library Associates and Library Associates of Maryland. In 2007, the divisions were integrated and the company name was changed to Library Associates Companies.
