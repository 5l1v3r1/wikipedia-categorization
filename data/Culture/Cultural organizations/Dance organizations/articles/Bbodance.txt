  bbodance, formerly the British Ballet Organization (BBO), is a dance examination board based in London, England. Formerly known as the British Ballet Organization, bbodance  was founded in England in 1930 by Edouard Espinosa and Eve Louise Kelland, both noted dance teachers.  It was established as a dance teaching society and developed a syllabus of Classical Ballet training.  The BBO is now one of the leading dance examination boards in the United Kingdom and provides an examination syllabus in classical ballet, tap, jazz and modern dance, with a teacher training programme that qualifies people to work as dance teachers in the private and state sectors.  The BBO is a registered dance awarding body of the Council for Dance Education and Training  and its qualifications are accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in England, the Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills (DCELLS) in Wales, and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in Northern Ireland.   Michael Nunn and William Trevitt, BalletBoyz founders, became new artistic directors of the British Ballet Organization, at the time when the company went through a major rebrand in 2016.
