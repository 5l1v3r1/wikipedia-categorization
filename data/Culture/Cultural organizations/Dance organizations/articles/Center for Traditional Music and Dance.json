Originally established as the Balkan Arts Center in 1968, CTMD assists the city's ethnic and immigrant communities in maintaining their traditions and cultural heritage. CTMD has developed a range of programs that emphasize research, documentation, collaboration, presentation, and education to help advance its mission of cultural equity. Over the past four decades, CTMD\u2019s programs have led to the creation of nationally renowned ensembles, folk arts festivals, and community-based cultural organizations.

Over the next few years Koenig, along with fellow New Yorker and folk music enthusiast Ethel Raim, also conducted fieldwork for <a href=\"/wiki/Ralph_Rinzler\" title=\"Ralph Rinzler\">Ralph Rinzler</a> in an effort to scout artists and performers for the annual Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife (now known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Smithsonian_Folklife_Festival\" title=\"Smithsonian Folklife Festival\">Smithsonian Folklife Festival</a>). Raim eventually joined Koenig as co-director of the Balkan Arts Center in the mid-Seventies, around the same time as the establishment of the Folk Arts Program within the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts\" title=\"National Endowment for the Arts\">National Endowment for the Arts</a> and the enactment of the American Folklife Preservation Act. With the financial support of the NEA, Koenig and Raim proceeded to build an organization that would focus exclusively on the music and dance traditions of New York City's immigrant and ethnic populations.\n</p><p>Originally promoting the arts of Albanian, Macedonian, and Greek cultures, the Balkan Arts Center expanded its operations into other communities as New York's demographic makeup shifted with each new influx of immigrants. Over the course of four decades and two name changes (the Ethnic Arts Center in 1981 and the Center for Traditional Music and Dance in 1997), CTMD has worked with dozens of ethnic and immigrant communities throughout the five boroughs.\n</p><p>According to its current mission statement CTMD is a nonprofit organization \"dedicated to preserving and presenting the performing arts traditions of New York\u2019s immigrant and ethnic communities through research-based educational programming, public performance, and community partnerships.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Towards this end, CTMD has established and collaborated on a number of projects, including Community Cultural Initiatives (CCI), Sharing Traditions youth education programs, Touring Artist series, an extensive archive of audio and visual documents from over forty years of performances and events, the production of major festivals, the publication of printed materials, and the release of audio and visual recordings. These programs and projects are designed to advance the mission of cultural equity, a concept advanced by <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Lomax\" title=\"Alan Lomax\">Alan Lomax</a> in his appeal for the recognition of the right of every culture to promote and preserve its unique heritage and traditions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Programs\">Programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Center_for_Traditional_Music_and_Dance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Community Cultural Initiatives</b>\n</p><p>According to the CTMD website, the Community Cultural Initiative (CCI) program is \"the Center\u2019s most effective tool for advancing its mission of cultural equity \u2013 the right of every cultural group to express and sustain its distinctive cultural heritage.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The multi-year CCI model places a strong emphasis on ethnographic fieldwork in New York City's ethnic and immigrant communities, collaboration with community members, documentation of events and artists, presentation of performing arts traditions to the wider public, and education in traditional music and dance for the youth. CCI programs are also designed to promote sustained interest in and financial support for the performing arts traditions of New York's diverse communities.\n</p><p>CCI programs are generally structured in three phases occurring over the course of five years. The first phase, lasting approximately one year, consists of initial contacts with musicians and teachers, investigation and documentation of local performing arts traditions, the establishment of working relationships between CTMD and community members, and an assessment of available resources and pressing needs in the community. The middle phase of the CCI model, generally lasting three years, involves program development through ongoing collaboration between CTMD and local artists, teachers, and organizations. CCI programs conclude with a transition to ongoing and self-sustaining cultural activities within immigrant and ethnic communities, sometimes with the development of new or strengthened autonomous cultural organizations.\n</p><p>Current CCI programs include work in the Chinese, Ukrainian, and Colombian communities, as well as the An-Sky Institute for Jewish Culture. Previous CCI programs have taken place in the Greek, Jewish, Italian, Irish, Puerto Rican, Albanian, Arab, Dominican, Asian-Indian, Indo-Caribbean, West African, Soviet Jewish, Filipino, Mexican, and Peruvian communities.\n</p><p><b>Sharing Traditions</b>\n</p><p>The Sharing Traditions program began in the late 1990s as part of an effort to help foster awareness and appreciation among the youth of New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities for the traditional performing arts of their respective cultures. This program provides support for education in traditional music and dance, and has incorporated intensive classes and workshops for children in the Mountain Jewish, Bukharan Jewish, Indo-Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, and Ukrainian communities. The Mariachi Academy of New York and Pachamama Peruvian Arts are two recent examples of successful organizations that evolved from Sharing Traditions programs.\n</p><p><b>Touring Artists</b>\n</p><p>CTMD Touring Artists Program showcases performing arts ensembles from a variety of cultural traditions. Touring Artists works to bring these performers to stages across the United States in an effort to celebrate and cultivate awareness for the traditional performing arts.\n</p><p><b>Masters on Stage: Major Concerts and Festivals</b>\n</p><p>CTMD presents both local and international artists each year through a variety of concerts, festivals, and workshops in New York City. These events include the Heritage Sunday Festival, produced in partnership with <a href=\"/wiki/Lincoln_Center\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lincoln Center\">Lincoln Center</a> Out of Doors, and the New York World Festival, produced in partnership with <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Park_SummerStage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Central Park SummerStage\">Central Park SummerStage</a>, World Music Institute, and Lotus Music and Dance.
