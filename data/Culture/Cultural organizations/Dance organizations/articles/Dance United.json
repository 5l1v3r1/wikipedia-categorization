It was never to be made, for during the research for the film he was challenged by a senior aid agency executive not to speak for the young people but to give them the tools to speak for themselves.\n</p><p>In unfamiliar territory, Andrew instinctively turned to the two worlds he knew, film and the performing arts. He created a partnership with an Addis Ababa NGO, the Ethiopian Gemini Trust and together they established Gem TV, a film-making company run by former street and working children which continues to this day. For the <i>live</i> art form they chose dance. A range of distinguished teachers came to work with Adugna including Tara-Jane Herbert, Susannah Broughton, Mags Byrne, Tamara McClorg and Royston Maldoom.\n</p><p>Over six years, eighteen young Ethiopians were intensively trained to become professional dancers, teachers and choreographers. Together, they went on to form the Adugna Dance Theatre Company.\n</p><p>After watching this project unfold and in an attempt to expand the work, Andrew Coggins, Royston Maldoom and Mags Byrne founded Dance United, as a registered UK charity in 2000.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Berlin\">Berlin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dance_United&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Berlin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Sir Simon Rattle of the <a href=\"/wiki/Berliner_Philharmoniker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Berliner Philharmoniker\">Berliner Philharmoniker</a>, insisted that his work with the orchestra include outreach work within the community. Dance United was brought in to develop three major dance performance partnerships from 2003-2005. The final performance of Stravinsky's <a href=\"/wiki/Rite_of_Spring\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rite of Spring\">Rite of Spring</a>, formed the basis for an internationally successful documentary: <a href=\"/wiki/Rhythm_Is_It!\" title=\"Rhythm Is It!\">Rhythm Is It!</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Northern_Ireland\">Northern Ireland</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dance_United&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Northern Ireland\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Mags Byrne began the process of developing work in Northern Ireland. She designed a sensitive programme of dance-led projects with disadvantaged young people. Her work grew steadily over the years and in early 2007 she was able to launch a completely independent organisation: Dance United Northern Ireland.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criminal_Justice\">Criminal Justice</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dance_United&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Criminal Justice\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 2001 Royston Maldoom and Susannah Broughton had delivered a seminal project in <a href=\"/wiki/HM_Prison_Holloway\" title=\"HM Prison Holloway\">HM Prison Holloway</a> and Susannah undertook a tracking initiative to gauge just what impact the work had, over time on the women who had taken part. Encouraged by what she discovered, Susannah invited Tara-Jane Herbert (who went on to become Dance United's Artistic Director from 2005-2011) to join her in creating a longer programme of activity specifically aimed at working with women in prison. Over the next four years the two artists created and led an impressive sequence of three-week intensive performance projects at a range of prisons across the country.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Academy\">Academy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dance_United&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Academy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Young people living within the community commit to attending five days a week, six hours a day. While maintaining contemporary dance training of a professional standard, participants can earn qualifications at levels 1 and 2 through a National Open College Network accredited curriculum. The programme culminates in public performances which demands cooperation and responsibility. This often leads to a sense of achievement, which, in return, encourages ambition.
