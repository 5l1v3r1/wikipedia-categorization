A Christian dance company is a dance company usually specializing in ballet that uses dance as a ministry to reach out to non-Christians, strengthen the faith of Christians, and to bring joy to poor countries or devastated areas. Christian dance companies perform, and up to the time of the performance usually participate in missionary style work in the area they have traveled to, engaging in activities such as feeding the homeless or building housing in rural areas.
