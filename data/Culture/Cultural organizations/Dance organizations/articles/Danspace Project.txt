Danspace Project was founded in 1974 to provide a performance venue for contemporary dance.  Its performances are held in St. Mark's Church in the East Village area of the Manhattan borough of New York City. "Danspace[Project] has played a significant role in the arts ecology of New York and the entire dance world." Michael M. Kaiser, President of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Danspace has presented a number of artists at early stages of their careers including Douglas Dunn, Bill T. Jones, John Kelly, and David Rousseve.  Danspace also serves established artists such as Seàn Curran, Yve Laris Cohen, David Gordon, Iréne Hultman, Bebe Miller, Emily Coates (dancer and choreographer) and Meredith Monk who return to Danspace for its supportive environment, often to show work-in-progress or work specifically developed for the space. Danspace Project fully presents twenty-five to thirty weeks of contemporary dance (including local, national, and international artists) each season.
