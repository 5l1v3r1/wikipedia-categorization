The purpose of the BDF is: These general aims are interpreted mainly from the point of view of professional competitors,  though many of its activities do also benefit amateur competitors. The Federation has been responsible for starting many events:  Delegates from the Executive Committee of the Federation sit on the board of directors for the British Dance Council; the Federation sees a major part of its role as bringing about changes in the BDC.
