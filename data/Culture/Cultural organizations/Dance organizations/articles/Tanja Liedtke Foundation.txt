The Tanja Liedtke Foundation (German: Tanja Liedtke Stiftung) is a German-based charity supporting Modern and Contemporary Dance.  It was established in July 2008 in honour of the dancer and choreographer, Tanja Liedtke who was killed the year before in a car accident in Sydney, Australia.    The Foundation’s purpose is "to support the enrichment and advancement of contemporary dance theatre, and the development of Australian/European artistic connections."   The Tanja Liedtke Foundation is registered as a tax-privileged organization in Stuttgart, Germany as Tanja Liedtke Stiftung  accordance with German law.  Additionally, the Tanja Liedtke Gift Fund has been established in Australia as a sub-fund of the Perpetual Foundation Gift Fund. The Tanja Liedtke Gift Fund reflects the vision, aims and priorities of the Tanja Liedtke Foundation.  The inaugural Tanja Liedtke Fellowship was offered, in partnership with Radialsystem V – New Space for the Arts (Berlin), and the contemporary dance company Sasha Waltz & Guests (Berlin), to an Australian dancer/choreographer between the ages of 20 and 35 years. It was awarded to Anthony Hamilton of Melbourne.  He conducted his residency in Berlin where his project "Black Series 1" was received with great enthusiasm. The 2011 Tanja Liedtke Fellowship was awarded to Katarzyna Sitarz,  a Polish dancer/choreographer with a broad international experience in Poland, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Germany.  She will direct her creative residency at Arts House Melbourne in March 2011 and participate in the development of a new collaboration by Australian choreographer Lucy Guerin.
