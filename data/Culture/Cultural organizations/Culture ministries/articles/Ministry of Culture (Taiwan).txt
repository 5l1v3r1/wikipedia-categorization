The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China (MOC) is the ministry of the Republic of China that promotes cultural and creative industries in Taiwan. The ministry also maintains the National Repository of Cultural Heritage. Established in 1981 by Executive Yuan, the ministry was initially called the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA). The council was upgraded to ministerial level in May 2012 under the name Ministry of Culture. The ministry was inaugurated on 21 May 2012, in a ceremony attended by President Ma Ying-jeou, Premier Sean Chen and several prominent artists, including poet Chou Meng-tieh, film director Li Hsing and singer Lo Ta-yu. President Ma stated in a speech during the ceremony that if politics is a "fence", then culture is "the pair of wings that fly over the fence". He expressed hope that the MOC would spread "Chinese culture with Taiwanese characteristics" around Taiwan and the world.
