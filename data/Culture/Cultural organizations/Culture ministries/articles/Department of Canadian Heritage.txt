The Department of Canadian Heritage, or simply Canadian Heritage (French: Patrimoine canadien), is the department of the Government of Canada with responsibility for policies and programs regarding the arts, culture, media, communications networks, official languages, status of women, sports, and multiculturalism. The Department oversees Royal visits of the Queen of Canada and members of the royal family to Canada. It was formerly a part of the Department of Communications, until that department's technical side was merged into the Department of Industry in 1996, forming the Department of Canadian Heritage from its non-technical side. In late 2008, the multiculturalism component of this department was transferred to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. The department's headquarters are in the Jules Léger Building (South) (Édifice Jules Léger (Sud)) in Terrasses de la Chaudière, Gatineau, Quebec,  across the Ottawa River from the Canadian capital of Ottawa.
