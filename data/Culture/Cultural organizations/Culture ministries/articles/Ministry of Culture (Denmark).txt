The Ministry of Culture Denmark (Danish: Kulturministeriet) is a ministry of the Danish Government, with responsibility for culture, sport and media. The Danish Ministry of Culture was founded in 1961 with Julius Bomholt as its first cultural minister.  The Ministry is located at Gammel Strand with address from Nybrogade (da) 2. The building is a former mayor's house dating from 1729–30, built for mayor Christian Bjerregård. Originally, it was a three-winged building but a fourth wing facing the canal (da) was added by the architect Philip de Lange. It served from 1759 to c. 1950 as a pawnbroker's shop (da). In 1962, the Ministry of Culture moved in after the building had undergone a thorough restoration.
