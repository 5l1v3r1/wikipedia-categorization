Artspace in Richmond, Virginia began in 1988 and is a non-profit, artist-run 501-C3 gallery and performance space currently located south of the James River in the Manchester area of the city at Zero East 4th Street in the art complex Plant Zero. The gallery began as Artspace 1306 in a donated, rent-free space at 1306 Cary Street in Richmond's historic Shockoe Slip. Upon the loss of its free space, the gallery moved to North 18th Street in Shockoe Bottom, retaining its original name of Artspace 1306. The gallery's next move as Artspace 1306 was to a much larger building at 6 East Broad Street in Jackson Ward,  and the name of the gallery was changed at the request of the Richmond post office to Artspace, removing its former street number to prevent confusion at the new location. Artspace was the first of the Shockoe Bottom art galleries incorporated as non-profit organizations to locate on Broad Street, and it became an anchor gallery for Richmond's First Friday Art Walk and a popular and long-lasting venue for the Arts and Cultural District formed for Broad Street and Downtown Richmond.   Drawing membership from the Richmond Artists Association, the Richmond Printmaking Workshop,  the local branch of the Women's Caucus for Art, and artists allied either as exhibiting artists, faculty, or students with the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the School of the Arts at Virginia Commonwealth University, the first organizational meeting of Artspace was held at the home of artist Henrietta Near and her husband, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts curator Pinkney L. Near, in Richmond's Fan District. The gallery opened soon after in 1988 as Artspace 1306 in Richmond's Shockoe Slip. The gallery name reflected its location at 1306 East Cary Street in "The Slip." The name Artspace 1306 was retained when the gallery relocated in Shockoe Bottom on North 18th Street and incorporated as a 501C-3 organization. Limited by the small size of their rental space, flooding of galleries in the "Bottom" before construction of the Richmond flood wall, and absence of parking space for overflow crowds, Artspace 1306 moved to 6 East Broad Street in Jackson Ward. At the request of the U.S. Postal Service Artspace dropped the former street number from its name.Around 2000 there began a membership split at Artspace over the location and uncertain future of the gallery, and the majority of Artspace members at Artspace on Broad voted to move to Plant Zero in the Manchester, VA area of Richmond south of the James River. Six dissenting founding members and supporters of Artspace remained at the Broad Street location of the gallery and incorporated a new non-profit gallery which they named art6. The original six members held an organizational meeting at Caf√© Gutenberg in Shockoe Bottom, inviting new members for the Broad Street location. The lower-case "a" eventually evolved into the name as Art6 or Art 6. In Shockoe Slip, at Artspace 1306, there were monthly changing exhibitions, primarily by gallery members or other artists curated by an exhibition committee, a tradition that continues today. Some early member exhibitors were Nancy Rice, John Bailey, Doug Hayes, Henrietta Near, Judy Little, Paul Muick, Marian Hollowell, Frances Wessells, Etta Edwards, Roomy Pak, Kay Franz, Ed Franz, Sharon Hill, Helena Davis, Anna Golden, Bea Klein, and Jane Ware.  In 1989 at Artspace 1306 in the Slip, Roomy Pak and founding member Mitzi Humphrey presented the exhibition Enchanted Garden.  In the January 1990 newsletter of the Richmond Artists Association (RAA), Henrietta Near announced the move of Artspace to 2 1/2 North 18th Street in Shockoe Bottom.   In Shockoe Bottom Artspace held an exhibition featuring children's art selected by Artspace members entitled Small Stuff.  In 1991, the Richmond Women's Caucus for Art put together a group show called Lust, which Richmond Times-Dispatch art critic Robert Merritt called "a collection of individual responses to a strong, ever disturbing subject." WCA artists participating in the show included Jacqueline Wall, Mitzi Humphrey, Carol Sprenkle, Deborah Singer, Joan Rough, Suzanne Grandis, Frances Wessells, and Laura Heyword.  In Shockoe Bottom, Droit de Regard 3-D+ in 1992 at Artspace 1306 at 2 1/2 N. 18th Street featured five Richmond artists' individual approaches to the subject of sexuality. Steroscopic photographs by E.D. Franz and Doug Hayes and multi-media works by W. Jean Gilbert, Tavel, and Pam Taylor were exhibited.  A three-person exhibition of paintings, prints, and sculpture, Humphrey/Coppola/Humphrey, was also shown in 1992.   Artspace on 18th Street in Shockoe Bottom presented Collaborations, an exhibition of 26 works of art achieved collaboratively. Some of the collaborative teams were: Mary Holland and Steven Glass, Henrietta Near and Etta Edwards, Susan Papa and Jane Ware, Gloria Blades and Mitzi Humphrey, Patricia Martin-Nelson and Hall Fitzgerald, Larry Mullins and Jim Nottingham, and the trio Michael Clautice, Mitzi Humphrey, and Caryl Burtner.  Art ex Libris: The National Book Art Show at Artspace on Broad in 1994 filled the rooms of the gallery with experimental book art by invited book artists from the United States, Canada, and Europe.   A two-day book art forum was held in conjunction with the exhibition, featuring speakers Isota Epes on How Virginia Woolf Brought Me Up, Dr. Clifford Edwards on Books as Icons in the Paintings of Van Gogh, Jeanne Boomhower, Jennifer Yane, and Richard Dawson on Comic Book Art and Cartooning, Anne Iott on The Artist and the Book, Betsy Pittman on Book Art at VCU, and John Field on The Artist/Bookbinder.
