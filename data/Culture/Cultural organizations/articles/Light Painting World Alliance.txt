Light Painting World Alliance (LPWA) is a nonprofit organization (NPO). Its goal is to offer the light painting community a cross-border platform to show its art, to set up networks and to promote social concerns and further training by means of light painting. For this purpose LPWA established a network of local representatives  from currently 30 countries worldwide. It was founded in December 2011 by Russian artist Sergey B. Churkin. LPWA showcases light painting works of its members in the context of exhibitions, conferences and special events using an advisory board of lightpainters for selection. In September 2014 LPWA was awarded status as an official Collaborating Partner   of the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015 (IYL2015) by UNESCO. This happened in accordance with the proclaimed International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015  by UNESCO. As representatives of LPWA artists Sergey Churkin, Eric Mellinger, Hugo Baptista und JanLeonardo were officially invited to attend opening ceremonies at UNESCO Headquarters Paris.
