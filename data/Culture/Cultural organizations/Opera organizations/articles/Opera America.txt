Opera America, officially OPERA America, is a service organization promoting the creation, presentation, and enjoyment of opera in the US.  Almost all professional opera companies and some semi-professional companies in the United States are members of the organization including such opera companies as the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, and Dallas Opera. Opera America also includes international affiliated opera companies such as the Theatro Municipal de SÃ£o Paulo. Opera America also hosts businesses, educational institutions, libraries, foundations, guilds, and opera artists such as singers and composers. It is also the home of New York Children's Opera Studio.  The organization was founded in 1970 and has been led by President and CEO Marc A. Scorca since 1990. In April 2014, advisers from Opera America worked with San Diego Opera to develop a plan to prevent the company's closure.
