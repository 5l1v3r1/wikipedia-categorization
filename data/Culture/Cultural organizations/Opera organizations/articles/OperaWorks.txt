OperaWorks is an opera training program, founded by program director Ann Baltz, and conducted in Northridge, California, USA. OperaWorks is a training program for singers and instructors working in the field of classical music. Accepting a limited number of students selected each year from up to eight cities across the United States, the program operates from the beginning of June and runs through the end of July, annually. OperaWorks was founded in 1987  by classical pianist Ann Baltz as a response to what she saw as the myopic tendencies of conventional operatic training. Baltz envisioned a new approach to the training of vocalists, in which the "total instrument" would be addressed, not just the voice itself. Over the years, her program has expanded to include instruction in movement, Yoga, acting, visualization, conducting, improvisation and the Alexander technique, as well as career management.    Borrowing to some degree from teaching techniques long utilized in contemporary theatrical training, OperaWorks strives to free the individual vocal artist in such a manner that the physical conventions and artifice of opera performance can fall away, hopefully revealing something altogether truer to life itself. Recognizing the uniqueness of each individual artist, OperaWorks endeavors to develop singers from the inside out, thus enabling them to trust their own instincts â€“ musically, emotionally, dramatically. In 2006, Baltz invited independent filmmaker Brad Mays to spend an entire summer filming the various classes and events at OperaWorks. The results are to be seen in the documentary feature film SING*ularity.
