The Country Dance and Song Society (abbreviated CDSS) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote participatory dance, music, and song with English and North American roots. Its motto is "Continuing the traditions. Linking those who love them."  CDSS began in 1915 as a series of American chapters of the English Dance and Folk Society established by Cecil Sharp.  The organization consolidated in 1940 and grew steadily through the present.  Today, it supports over 300 local affiliate groups.   CDSS promotes a number of types of traditional dance, including contra dance,  English country dance, Scottish country dance , square dance,  morris dance, rapper sword, and clogging.  CDSS runs several sessions annually at Pinewoods Dance Camp and other sites.
