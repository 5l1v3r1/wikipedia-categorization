El Tío (The Uncle), is believed in Cerro Rico, Potosí, Bolivia as the "Lord of the Underworld'. There are many statues of this devil-like spirit in the mines of Cerro Rico. El Tío rules over the mines, simultaneously offering protection and destruction. Some figures are really in the shape of a goat.  Miners bring offerings such as cigarettes, coca leaves, and alcohol for the statues   and believe that if El Tío is not fed, he will take matters into his own hands. Villagers of Potosi ritually slaughter a llama and smear its blood on the entrance to the mines.  The miners of Cerro Rico are Catholics and they believe in both Christ and El Tío. However, worship of El Tío is condemned  strongly by the Catholic Church.  Images of El Tío are usually not allowed outside of the mines, as this is seen as the realm of God and El Tío has no place there. Likewise, Christian symbolism isn't allowed inside of the mines, as this "Underworld" is seen as El Tío's realm.  Every year, the Carnaval de Oruro is held, and costumes and statues of El Tío are paraded around in a ceremony that represents his defeat at the hands of the Archangel Michael. This is the only time that images of El Tío are allowed above the surface of the mines.
