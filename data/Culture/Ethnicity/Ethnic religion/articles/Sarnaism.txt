Sarnaism or Sarna    (local languages: Sarna Dhorom or Sarna Dharam, meaning "religion of the woods"), also known as Sariism (Sari Dharam, literally "sal tree religion") or Adiism (Adi Dharam, literally "original religion"), is the collective designation of the indigenous religions of the Adivasi populations of the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, and Chhattisgarh, centred around the worship of nature represented by trees. Followers of these religions primarily belong to the Munda, Ho, Bhumij, Santal and Khuruk ethnic groups. Sarna means "grove" and it is etymologically related to the name of the sal tree, sacred to the religion, from which also derives Sari Dhorom ("religion of the sal tree"). A  large population of Munda, Ho, Santal, Bhumij and Kurukh continue to practice Sarnaism. Sarna followers have been organising protests and petitions to have their religion recognised by the government of India in census forms.   Adherents of Sarnaism believe in, worship and revere Dharmesh,   or God as the creator of the universe, who is also called Marang Buru, Singbonga or by other names by different tribes. Adherents also believe in, worship and revere Chalapachho Devi, the mother goddess, identified as the earth, nature, and the world tree, symbolised by the sal tree. Dharmesh is believed to manifest himself in sal trees. Sarna temples are called Jaher than  or Jaher gar, and can be found in villages, while worship can be performed also in jaher, or sacred groves. Sal trees are present both in the temples and the sacred grove. The ceremonies are performed by the whole village community at a public gathering with the active participation of village priests, pahan. The chief assistant of village priest is called Naike.
