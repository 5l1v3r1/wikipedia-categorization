Citébeur is a French gay pornographic film studio that has pioneered and specialised in the availability of gay pornographic film content of French men of colour and of various ethnicities—Arabs, Latins, Blacks, rather than white males. The name Citébeur connotes "Beur", the French colloquial term to designate French-born people of immigrant parents predominately from northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. Citébeur films also include a play on fetish, fantasy and stereo-typical perceptions by non-whites of the ethnic man: work-horse, well-endowed genitalia, urban style clothing, liaisons in the unknown poor and dangerous suburbs of large cities, and interracial sexual relations. Aspiring porn actors have become notable after working at Citébeaur. François Sagat is an example; he was recruited by the company and made his debut   becoming in a short period of time, one of the most prominent French international gay pornographic actors. He then moved on to more well-established companies such as Raging Stallion Studios and Titan Media. During his debut at Citébeur, Sagat initially used his screen name Azzedine before reverting to his real name François Sagat. Citébeur in agreement with Syndicat national des entreprises gaies' (SNEG) has promoted fashionable series of public awareness advertisements for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in its series of Boris et Nadir.  Some of the Citébeur porn actors take part in these series.  In 2008, Citébeur Studios won the Best Black/Latino Gay Film Award for Matos de Blackoss 3 at the European Gay Porn Awards 2008 (EGPA).
