The White Privilege Conference is a yearly conference held to discuss the issue of white privilege.     The conference features several workshops and groups for students and adults about racism, race, perceived white privilege, sexism, black oppression, racial injustice, as well as discussions of lesbian, gay and transgender rights, as well as Islam and Islamophobia.  The White Privilege Conference was founded in 2000 by Eddie Moore Jr., a former diversity director at Brooklyn Friends.   As of 2016, many New York private schools had students and faculty attending the conference.  At the 2016 White Privilege Conference attendees complained that the conference was "too white".   Inspired by the 2015 Twitter #OscarsSoWhite campaign, Twitter users adopted the hashtag #WPCSoWhite and claimed the conference that was supposed to fight white privilege instead entrenched it.  The Twitter tag appeared to have been started by Aeriel Ashlee, an Asian American education consultant who attended the 2016 conference and objected to many sections of a keynote address delivered by white historian James W. Loewen, including his use of the N-word.  The conference has been criticized by some in the media  as nothing more than white guilt.
