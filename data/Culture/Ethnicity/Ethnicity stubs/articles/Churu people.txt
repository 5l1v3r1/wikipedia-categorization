The Churu (or Chru; called Chu Ru or người Chu Ru in Vietnamese, người meaning "people") people live in Lâm Đồng Province, in Vietnam's Central Highlands. The group's population is approximately 15,000.  They speak Chru, a Malayo-Polynesian language. During the French colonial period, the most influential highland leaders in the Da Lat area were Churu. They were said to be the most advanced among the highlanders because of their historical links to the Cham.  Encouraged by Touneh Han Dang, the Churu adopted some economic innovations from the Cham in the fields of weaving, pottery, and plowing in 1907.
