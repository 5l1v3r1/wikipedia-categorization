Safed-Posh Kafirs or Sped-Posh Kafirs  ("White-Robed Kaffirs") , also known as the Lal-Posh Kafirs("Red-Robed Kaffirs")  were designations for three Nuristani clans: These names were based on the traditional colors of their clothes and the Islamic term kafir, meaning "unbeliever," "disbeliever," or "infidel" – reflecting their status as a religious and ethnic minority, the members of which long rejected – or continues to reject – conversion to Islam Some authors, such as George Scott Robertson, have considered this classification unsatisfactory, and regard the three groups as separate, on the same level as the Siah-Posh Kafirs. Robertson claimed that the Presunguli were the original inhabitants of Nuristan (also known as Kafiristan) and that the Ashukuns were allied to the Waigulis.
