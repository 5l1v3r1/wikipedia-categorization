 Critical Mixed Race Studies (CMRS) is the transracial, transdisciplinary, and transnational critical analysis of the institutionalization of social, cultural, and political orders based on dominant conceptions of race. CMRS emphasizes the mutability of race and the porosity of racial boundaries in order to critique processes of racialization and social stratification based on race. CMRS addresses local and global systemic injustices rooted in systems of racialization.   The biannual Critical Mixed Race Studies (CMRS) Conference is organized by faculty members of various universities and hosted by DePaul Universityâ€™s Global Asian Studies and Latin American and Latino Studies programs.   Its accompanying academic Journal of Critical Mixed Race Studies was founded by G. Reginald Daniel, Wei Ming Dariotis, Laura Kina, Maria P.P. Root and Paul Spickard founded in 2011 through UC Santa Barbara.    CMRS symposiums have been held both in the U.S. and abroad,  with hundreds of academics citing it as a research interest.
