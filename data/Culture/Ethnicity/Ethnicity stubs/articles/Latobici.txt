Latobici (Latovici, Λατόβικοι) were a Celtic   tribe settling in modern-day Slovenia mentioned by Ptolemy.  In Roman times, their cities were Praetorium Latobicorum (modern Trebnje) and Municipium Latobicorum, or later Neviodunum (modern Drnovo). Their name seems to be connected to the theonym Latobius ('He who is most ardent') , of which 6 inscriptions have been found at two locations in Austria.
