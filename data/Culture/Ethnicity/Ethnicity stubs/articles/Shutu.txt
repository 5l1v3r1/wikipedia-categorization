Shutu /ˈʃuːtuː/ or Sutu /ˈsuːtuː/ is the name given in ancient Akkadian language sources to certain nomadic groups of the Trans-Jordanian highlands, extending deep into Mesopotamia and Southern Iraq. Many scholars[who?] have speculated that "Shutu" may be a variant of the Egyptian term Shasu.  An Egyptian execration text of the 17th century BCE refers to an "Ayyab" (possibly a variant form of the name Job) as king of the Shutu. Some scholars[who?] have tenuously identified the Shutu as the progenitors of the Moabites and Ammonites .
