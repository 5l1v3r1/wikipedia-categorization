The Vaqueiros d'alzada  ("nomadic cowherds" in Asturian language, from their word for cow, cognate of Spanish Vaquero) are a northern Spanish nomadic people in the mountains of Le√≥n and Asturias, who practiced transhumance, i.e. moving seasonally with cattle.  Historically, they had been discriminated against by the valley dwellers (xaldos) and by the church in Asturias, because vaqueiros were a free people in the mountains. There are few studies about the origin of vaqueiros and their culture. They distinguish themselves by their costumes and dialect. Their nomadic lifestyle placed them out of the reach of the Church and the Government.
