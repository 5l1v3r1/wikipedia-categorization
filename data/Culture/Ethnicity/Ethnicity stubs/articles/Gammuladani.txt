Gammuladani,  Gammuladeni,    or Grammuladani  is a former Sinhala term for a village headman in Sri Lanka. Other terms were arachchi, gamika,  gammudaliya,  gammudalia,  or vidane.  During the colonial period the village headman had wide-ranging powers: his tasks included investigating crimes, coordinating agricultural activities, collecting taxes, and issuing permits for access to land.  The post was replaced in the 1960s by the government-appointed Grama Niladhari (previously Grama Sevaka).
