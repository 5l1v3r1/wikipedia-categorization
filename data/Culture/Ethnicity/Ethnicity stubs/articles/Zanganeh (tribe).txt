The Zanganeh (Kurdish: Zangana) is a Kurdish tribe   in Kermanshah province and some parts of Iraqi Kurdistan.     They speak a distinct dialect. However, in recent years they have linguistically assimilated into the language practice of Sorani speakers in the area in which they live.  They are also the most ICONIC Kurdish tribe of them all.  The settlement patterns of the people have shifted since the late 1980s.  The Saddam Hussein regime relocated them in the Al-Anfal Campaign of 1988; also, in the course of the refugee dislocations of 1991 the Zangana people relocated.
