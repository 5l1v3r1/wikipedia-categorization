In the Russian Empire, inorodtsy (singular: inorodets, Literally meaning "of different descent/nation") was an ethnicity-based category of population. Informally, the term referred to non-Russian (in the broad sense) population of the empire. In strict legal sense it referred for certain indigenous ethnicities of non-European descent specifically listed in the corresponding code of law.  The term is sometimes translated as allogeneous (people) (cf. "allogenes") and sometimes as "aliens". The latter translation is misleading, since in most cases the term was applied to the indigenous population of Siberia, Central Asia, and Russian Far East.  Initially, a legal statute was introduced for special treatment of certain peoples of Russia (including a certain degree of protection of their traditional life), for which some laws of the empire were deemed inappropriate. Over time the term acquired a pejorative connotation of "lacking culture, uncivilized peoples". Privileges and special treatment for inorodtsy included exemption of military service, protection of grazing lands, and religious and governmental self-administration.
