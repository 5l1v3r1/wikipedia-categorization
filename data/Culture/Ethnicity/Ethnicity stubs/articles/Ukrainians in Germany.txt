The Ukrainian community of Germany is small yet sizable at around 250,000;  Germany's Ukrainians have created a number of institutions and organizations, such as the Central Association of Ukrainians in Germany and Association of Ukrainian Diaspora in Germany.

Some Ukrainian organizations in Germany have accused Germans of racism and prejudice, and of the belief that Ukrainians are only in Germany to work illegally  (despite the large number of ethnic Ukrainians who are second- or third-generation German citizens).
