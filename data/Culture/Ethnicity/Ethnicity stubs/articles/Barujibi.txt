Barujibi is a Bengali Hindu agricultural caste spread throughout the Indian subcontinent whose traditional occupation is the cultivation of betel.  Barujibis or Baruis are listed as Other Backward Class (Category-B) in West Bengal.  A related upper caste Baishya Barujibis and "Brahmin Barujibis" are the ones involved mainly in the business or trade of Paan (prepared using betel leaf) and fall under the Forward caste or General category. In the Brihaddharma Purana it is mentioned that some ancestors of this caste were the heirs of Brahmanas.
