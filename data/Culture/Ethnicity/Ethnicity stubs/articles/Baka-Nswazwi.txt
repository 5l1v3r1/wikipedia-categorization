The Ba-ka-Nswazwi people are originally Bapedi of Mujaji (Rain Queen). They are found in Tutume, Nswazwi, Marapong, Masunga and Nkange in Botswana. The Baka-Nswazwi have been assimilated over the years into Kalanga (Bakalanga) culture and lost their language.  They were led by John Madawo Nswazwi, who was born in Nswazwi in then Bechuanaland in 1875. John Nswazwi was exiled to Mafikeng in 1947 by the colonial government as a result of a conflict with the Bangwato regent Tshekedi Khama. Tshekedi Khama was the uncle of Seretse Khama, the first president of Botswana. Chief Nswazwi died on May 14, 1960.   He was buried in Jetjeni and his remains were later transferred to Nswazwi village in 2002.
