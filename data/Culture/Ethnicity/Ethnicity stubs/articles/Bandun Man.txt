The Bandun Man (simplified Chinese: 板楯蛮; traditional Chinese: 板楯蠻; pinyin: bǎndùn mán) were an ancient people living along the Jialing River valley, in the area of modern Langzhong in Sichuan, China. Their name, literally meaning "board shield barbarians", is derived from their fighting style of charging with shields to break the enemy line. They were also called the Bohu Yi (白虎夷), meaning the "white tiger barbarians". In the second century CE, the Bandun Man converted to the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice.
