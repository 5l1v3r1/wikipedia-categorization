The Norweilemil were an indigenous Australian people of the Northern Territory. The were a small tribe with, in Tindale's estimation, some 400 sq. miles of territory  on the southeastern flank of the Van Diemen Gulf, and west of the West Alligator River. They were also attested around Stuart Point.   Baldwin Spencer classifies them with  many other contiguous tribes in that area:- To the same group of tribes belong, apparently, the Koarnbut, Quiradara, Norweilemil, Punuurlu, Kumertuo, Geimbio, Malanji, and, possibly, the Larakia. These, together with the Iwaldji, Kakadu, and the Melville and Bathurst Islanders, form a group of tribes sharply marked off, not only by the absence of class organisation, but by the fact that their initiation ceremonies are distinguished by the absence of both circumcision and subincision. He also adds that, like the others, they do not appear to have used bullroarers.
