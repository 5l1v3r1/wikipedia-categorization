The Poya were a subgroup of indigenous Tehuelche people living in the Andes of Llanquihue and Palena Province as well as on the southern shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake in present-day Argentina. The Jesuit priest Nicol√°s Mascardi divided the Poya language  into two linguistically distinct groups the one spoken by the "comarcanos" of Nahuelhuapi and another one spoken further east as far away as to the Atlanctic Ocean.
