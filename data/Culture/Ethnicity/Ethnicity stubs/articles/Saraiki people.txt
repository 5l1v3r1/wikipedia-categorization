Predominantly Sunni Islam  The Saraikis (Saraiki: سرائیکی قوم‎), also known as Multanis,  are an ethnolinguistic group in central and southeastern Pakistan, primarily southern Punjab. Their language is Saraiki.  Saraiki people did not see themselves as a distinct ethnic group until the 1960s.  An Islamic identity formed the basis of the majority community's group consciousness for centuries prior to the establishment of Pakistan.  The Saraiki people follow many religions, though most are predominantly followers of Islam.  A small minority of Saraikis follow Christianity, Sikhism and Hinduism.  After the independence of Pakistan in 1947,  some of the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India.
