The Berau people, also known as Berau Malays or Berau Benua is a sub-ethnic group of Malays that lives in Berau, in the north of East Kalimantan province, Indonesia.  The Berau culture began with the former Berau Sultanate, an Islamic kingdom established in Kalimantan in the 14th century to the early 1700s.  They speak Berau language or Berau Malay, which is a variant of Malay.
