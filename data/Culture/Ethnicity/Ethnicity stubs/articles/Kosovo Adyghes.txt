The Kosovo Adyghes are a small group of the Adyghe people who lived in Kosovo beginning in the mid-19th century, when they relocated to the Ottoman Empire after the Circassian defeat in the Caucasian War. In 1998 they numbered 200. After the Kosovo War began, they emigrated to the Republic of Adyghea in the Russian Federation. There they founded an aul named Mafekhable near the republic's capital of Maykop.
