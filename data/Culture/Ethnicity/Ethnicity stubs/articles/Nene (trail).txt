Nene (pronounced n√©e-nee) is a word in the language of the Seminole Indians.  Roughly translated into English, it means "path" or "trail."  In the city of Tallahassee, Florida, United States, it is often used in the same way that street, road, drive, terrace, or boulevard are used:  following the name of the thoroughfare. Examples:  Ohbah Nene, Chowkeebin Nene, Chuli Nene, Wahalaw Nene. All of the above are actual examples of nenes that can be found in the Indianhead Acres neighborhood of Tallahassee, Florida.
