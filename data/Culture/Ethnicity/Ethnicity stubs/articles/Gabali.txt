The Gabali were a Gallic Tribe from Gallia Aquitania, in the mountainous region, where the Oltis (Lot) and the Elaver (Allier) emerge. They were subject, and allied to the Averni. They are mentioned in Book VII of Caesar's Commentaries. During Caesar's conquest of Gaul they were raiding the country of the Provincial Ruteni, and they were among the tribes that sent relief troops to the Gallic army trying to break the siege in Alesia.
