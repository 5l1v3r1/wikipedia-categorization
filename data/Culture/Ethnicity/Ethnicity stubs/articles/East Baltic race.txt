The East Baltic race is one of the subcategories of the Europid (Caucasian) race into which it was divided by biological anthropologists and scientific racists in the early 20th century.  Such racial typologies have been rejected by modern anthropology for several reasons.  The term East Baltic race was coined by the anthropologist Rolf Nordenstreng, but was popularised by the race theorist Hans F. K. GÃ¼nther. This race were living in Finland, Estonia and northern and central European Russia. It was characterized as "short-headed, broad-faced, with heavy, massive under-jaw, chin not prominent, flat, rather broad, short nose with low bridge; stiff, light (ash-blond) hair; light (grey or whitish blue) eyes, standing out; light skin with a greyish undertone."  Gunther also considered Poles to be predominantly of the "East Baltic" race, which he deemed inferior to the Nordic race, saying: "However, owing to contra-selection among the Nordic warrior ruling classes, the conquest through the birth-rate by the East Baltic race among the north and west Slavs, must have had its beginning, and soon have become definitive."   The American Eugenics Society described East Baltic people as being Mongolized.  The Nazi philologist Josef Nadler declared the East Baltic race to be the main source of German Romanticism.    Also in the Third Reich the philologist Julius Petersen wrote that Ludwig Tieck's Romanticism might have been promoted by his possible Slavic heritage, referring to the American biographer Edwin H. Zeydel's theory, that Tieck's grandmother was Russian.
