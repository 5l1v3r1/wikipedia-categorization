Gabacho (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡaˈβatʃo]; feminine, gabacha) is a word used in the Spanish language as a pejorative reference to French people. It derives from the Occitan word gavach, which translates as "someone who speaks with a faulty speech".  Gabacha is also a word used in Guatemala for apron.  In Central America, it is used to refer to certain types of coats, such as that of a doctor, a kindergarten student, a lab coat or a graduation vest. In the United States, it is a slang, derogatory term used for white Americans.
