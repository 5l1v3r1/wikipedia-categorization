The ethnonym Turks (Greek: Τούρκοι/Tourkoi, Serbo-Croatian: Turci/Турци) has been commonly used by the non-Muslim Balkan peoples to denote Muslims, regardless of ethno-linguistic background.  In the Ottoman Empire, the Islamic faith was the official religion, with members holding all rights, as opposed to non-Muslims who were restricted.  Non-Muslim (dhimmi) ethno-religious  legal groups were identified by different millets, meaning "nations".  The term "Turk" was used as a synonym for Muslims, apart from ethnic Turks also notably denoting (the Islamized) Muslim Albanians and Slavic-speakers.  For the Balkan Christians, converting to Islam meant to 'become a Turk'.  There were also derivative terms, such as poturi and poturice (South Slavic for "Turkified"),   and tourkalvanoi (Greek for "Turco-Albanians" ). In modern Turkey, all Muslims are regarded Turks, regardless of ethnicity and or language, as opposed to non-Muslim minorites.  With the transformation of the Ottoman Muslim millet into the modern Turkish nation, Turkish nationalism viewed all Muslims in Turkey as Turks, leaving the Christian outside the Turkish nation.
