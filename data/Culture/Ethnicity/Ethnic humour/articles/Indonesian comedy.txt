Indonesian comedy has a long tradition in local cultures, for example Ketoprak in East Java, Lenong in Jakarta, and Berbalas pantun in North Sumatra. The most popular form of stage comedy in Indonesia is comedy troupes doing skits or sketches, usually following a simple storyline and improvised by all actors. Among the comedic elements involved are banters, physical humour, cross-dressing, and socio-political commentary. Examples of popular comedy groups are Srimulat, Jayakarta, Kwartet Jaya, Bagito, Warkop DKI, Patrio, and SQL. Many of the comedy groups had situation comedy or sketch shows on television. Also, many individual members went on to become quiz show or talk show hosts. Some of the most successful groups and comedians also branched out to films. Warkop DKI was especially productive, making more than 35 films from 1979 to 1994. Other film comedians are Jojon, S Bagio, Benyamin Sueb, and Ateng. Two of the longest running Indonesian caricature series are Panji Koming and Oom Pasikom. Both are biting social and political commentary published weekly on the newspaper Kompas.
