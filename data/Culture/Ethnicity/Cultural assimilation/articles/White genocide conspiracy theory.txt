  The white genocide conspiracy theory is a neo-Nazi, alt-right, white nationalist/supremacist conspiracy theory,  which contends that any one of; mass immigration, racial integration, miscegenation, low fertility rates, abortion, governmental land-confiscation from whites, organised violence or eliminationism are being promoted in either predominantly white countries, or supposedly white-founded countries, to deliberately turn them minority-white and hence cause white people to become extinct through forced assimilation or violent genocide.  The conspiracy theory was developed by the neo-Nazi David Lane in about 1995. It is commonly used both interchangably with,  and as a broader and more extreme version of Renaud Camus's 2012 The Great Replacement conspiracy theory, which focuses on the white Christian population in France.   The phrase "Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white", coined by high-profile white nationalist Robert Whitaker, is commonly associated with the topic of white genocide.   It has appeared on billboards in the United States near Birmingham, Alabama  and in Harrison, Arkansas.  The conspiracy theory had already been purported in Nazi Germany by a pamphlet written for the "Research Department for the Jewish question" of Walter Frank's "Reich Institute" with the title "Are the White Nations Dying? The Future of the White and the Colored Nations in the Light of Biological Statistics".  In August 2018, US President Donald Trump was accused of endorsing the conspiracy theory in a foreign policy tweet,  instructing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate South African "land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers",   claiming that the "South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers".   The often critical narrative derived from farm attacks, and land reform, is an established subset theme of the broader conspiracy theory,  portrayed in media as a form of gateway issue to "white genocide" within the wider context of the Western world.  The topic in relation to South Africa and Zimbabwe, is also simply used interchangably with the subject,  as well as being used by white nationalists as a parabolic concept to justify policies to retain or increase white majorities in nation-states, or otherwise maintain their vision of white supremacy.  During the era of Nazi Germany, the Institute for Study of the Jewish Question cooperated with Walter Frank's "Reich Institute for the History of the New Germany", especially with its "Research Department for the Jewish question" which was led by the demographer Dr. Friedrich Burgdörfer, who had published the pamphlet "Are the White Nations Dying? The Future of the White and the Colored Nations in the Light of Biological Statistics" which became the origin of the conspiracy theory.  The explicit phrasing of "white genocide" first appeared sporadically in the neo-Nazi publications White Power  and WAR  in the 1970s and 1980s, where it primarily referred to contraception and abortion. The conspiracy theory was developed by the neo-Nazi David Lane in his White Genocide Manifesto (c. 1995, origin of the later use of the term),     where he made the claim that the government policies of many Western countries had the intent of destroying white European culture and making white people an "extinct species".  Lane—a founding member of the organization The Order—criticized miscegenation, abortion, homosexuality, the legal repercussions against those who "resist genocide", and the "Zionist Occupation Government" that he said controls the United States and the other majority-white countries and which encourages "white genocide".  In the 2000s, the conspiracy theory spread beyond its explicit neo-Nazi and white nationalist origins, to be embraced by the newer alt-right movement, becoming adopted as dog-whistling by some mainstream conservative political figures. Anders Behring Breivik's entitled manifesto makes frequent mention of an alleged ongoing genocide against white Europeans.  In 2016, Donald Trump garnered controversy after retweeting Twitter user @WhiteGenocideTM,  and @EustaceFash, whose Twitter header image at the time also included the term "white genocide".  A 2016 analysis of his Twitter feed during the Republican presidential primaries showed that 62% of those that he chose to retweet in an average week followed multiple accounts which discussed the conspiracy theory, and 21% followed prominent white nationalists online.  Andrew Anglin of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer said that "it isn't statistically possible that two ['white genocide' tweets] back to back could be a random occurrence. It could only be deliberate [...] Today in America the air is cold and it tastes like victory."  Discussion threads on the white nationalist Internet forum Stormfront often center around the theme of white people being subjected to genocidal policies by their governments.  The concept has also been popularized by the alt-right movement in the United States.   The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia referenced the conspiracy theory as tiki torch-wielding protestors yelled "You will not replace us!" and "Jews will not replace us!". The notion of racial purity, homogeneity, or "racial hygiene" is an underlying theme of the white genocide discourse and it has been used by people with neo-Nazi and white supremacist backgrounds.   While individual iterations of the conspiracy theory vary on who is assigned blame, Jewish influence, people who hate whites,  and liberal political forces are commonly cited by white supremacists as being the main factors leading to a white genocide.     This view is held by prominent figures such as David Duke, who cites Jews and "liberal political ideals" as the main causes.   White nationalist Robert Whitaker, who coined the phrase "anti-racist is a code word for anti-white" in a widely circulated 2006 piece seeking to popularize the white genocide concept online, used "anti-White" to describe those he believed are responsible for the genocide of white people, and continued to view it as a Jewish conspiracy while emphasizing that others also supported the "anti-White" cause.        However, the view that Jews are responsible for a white genocide is contested by other white supremacist figures, such as Jared Taylor.  Advocates and alleged advocates of the conspiracy theory include: Critics and alleged critics of the conspiracy theory include: Figures on the right of French politics, such as Renaud Camus, have claimed that a 'white genocide' or "Great Replacement" is occuring in France.  Camus's definition, which focuses largely on the white Christian population in France, has been used in media interchangably with white genocide,   and described as a narrower, less extreme and more nationally focused version of the broader conspiracy theory.   Despite his focus on the specific demographics of France, Camus also believes all Western countries are facing a form of "ethnic and civilizational substitution".  Far-right and alt-right figures, such as singer Steve Hofmeyr, have claimed that a "white genocide" is taking place in South Africa.   The manifesto of far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence devotes an entire section to an alleged "genocide" against Afrikaners. It also contains several other references to alleged persecution of whites in South Africa and the attacks on white farmers.  Mike Cernovich, an American alt-right commentator, has previously stated that "white genocide in South Africa is real."  The survivalist group the Suidlanders has claimed credit for publicizing the issue internationally.  Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch has condemned the misuse of his groups's reports of the threat of polarization in South Africa to further a the idea of "white genocide".  Africa Check, a fact-checking organisation, has rejected these claims as false: "In fact, whites are less likely to be murdered than any other race group." Africa Check reported that while whites account for nearly 9% of the South African population they represent just 1.8% of murder victims. Lizette Lancaster from the Institute for Security Studies has said that "Whites are far less likely to be murdered than their black or coloured counterparts."    Critics of the conspiracy theory in the context of South African land reform include:
