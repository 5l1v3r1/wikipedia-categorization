Sinhalisation is a term, derived from Sinhala, that has number of meanings in Sri Lanka. In a sociological context it could refer to the assimilation of ethno-cultural minorities in Sri Lanka such as the Sri Lankan Tamils, Colombo Chetties and indigenous Veddas into the majority Sinhalese identity,  including some Sinhala Buddhists of the interior such as the Demalagattara and some Catholics such as the Bharatha of the coastal areas of the island nation.        Many noted elite elite[›] families of foreign origins were supposedly Sinhalised during the pre-colonial period.   (see abstract here) In a political context it could refer to the Sinhala language-favouring policies PS[›]of the post colonial governments of Sri Lanka  that is considered to be a major cause   of the Sri Lankan civil war. It is termed as culturo-ideological exclusivism by some[who?] when one's cultural values and norms are absolutised in such a manner that a particular way of life is enshrined as superior to all others and must therefore be adopted by others (e.g. the Tamil reaction to the perceived "Sinhalisation" processes of the Sri Lankan state)  It was said to be a cause of the abortive coup by disgruntled Catholic army officers in 1962.  Currently some observers note that Sri Lankan political parties such as JHU and JVP adhere to a policy of political Sinhalisation.  Medias use the word "Sinhalisation" to refer to the process by which the Sri Lankan government funded and sponsored settlement of Sinhala people in Tamil-dominant regions in order to make Tamil as minorities. Some reports claims that the Sinhalese and Sinhala military families are settled in houses built by money from the Indian government that was intended to improve the welfare of the Tamil people.      ^ elite: The late President J. R. Jayewardene's first paternal ancestor was a Colombo Chetty and there is an excerpt from the biography of J.R., authored by Prof. K.M. De Silva & Howard Wriggins, in support of this. Don Adrian Jayewardene, J.R.'s paternal great-grandfather, descended from a Chetty family, but two or three generations earlier, a male of this family had married a Sinhalese by the name of Jayewardene from the village of Walgama near Hanwella and had taken on the name of Jayewardene and by the time Don Adrian arrived on the scene at the tail-end of the 18th century, the process of 'Sinhalisation' of his family had been completed.  ^ PS: Sri Lanka’s nation-building programme became intimately linked with a Sinhalisation of the state directive. It was expected that the minorities would be assimilated into this new Sinhalese Buddhist nation-state. Moreover, the 1956 election marked the beginning of an era of ethnically-based party politics.
