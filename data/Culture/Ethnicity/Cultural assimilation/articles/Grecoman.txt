Grecoman or Graecoman (Greek: Γραικομάνοι, Grekománoi, Bulgarian: Гъркомани, Garkomani, Macedonian: Гркомани, Grkomani, Romanian: Grecomani, Albanian: Grekomanë, Aromanian: Gricumanji) is a pejorative term used in Bulgaria, the Republic of Macedonia, Romania and Albania to characterize Arvanitic-,  Aromanian-,  and Slavic-speaking  Greeks. The term generally means "pretending to be a Greek" and implies a non-Greek origin.  Another meaning of the term is fanatic Greek.  The term is considered highly offensive to the Greek people.  The "Grecoman" is regarded as an ethnic Greek in Greece, but as Hellenized minorities in neighboring countries.
