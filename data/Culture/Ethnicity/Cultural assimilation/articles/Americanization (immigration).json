Up until 1885, immigrants were overwhelmingly Northwestern European (90% in that year) which brought a similar culture to that already existing in the U.S. maintaining stability within their bubble of natives and newcomers.

Close to half of the foreign-born populace were males of voting age; but only 4 out of every 1,000 of them were being educated to learn English and about American citizenship.

At a time of increasing demand for immigration restriction, Schiff supported and worked for Jewish Americanization.

The NCJW's Americanization program included assisting immigrants with housing, health, and employment problems, leading them to organizations where women could begin to socialize, and conducting English classes while helping them maintain a strong Jewish identity. The council, pluralistic rather than conformist, continued its Americanization efforts and fought against restrictive immigration laws after World War I.

Early on, both Mexican migrants and <a href=\"/wiki/Mexican_Americans\" title=\"Mexican Americans\">Mexican-Americans</a> were actively trying to become a part of the Anglo-American society. One of the examples of Americanization is found through Mexican and Mexican-American youth. From the 1910s and onward there has been a big focus put onto the youth in California. There were, and still are, stereotypes of the youth ranging from <a href=\"/wiki/Illegal_aliens\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Illegal aliens\">illegal aliens</a> to trouble makers. One of the first steps to get rid of these stereotypes was through Americanization with the help of education, promoted by the <a href=\"/wiki/Nativism_(politics)\" title=\"Nativism (politics)\">Nativists</a> in California.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In Merton E. Hill\u2019s \u201cThe Development of an Americanization Program,\u201d Hill states that \u201cthe public must be aroused to a realization of the great and immediate need of making provision for educational, vocational, and sanitation programs that will result in\u2026promoting the use of the English language, the right American customs, and the best possible standards of American life.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> The goal was to integrate Ethnic Mexican youth into American society so they would become truly American in the public\u2019s view. This Americanization took over the people\u2019s Mexican culture and made labeled \u201coutwardly Mexican\u201d culture as un-American.\n</p><p>The Americanization efforts were also passed on through the home. From the point of view of Anglo-Americans, the best way to change the youth was through the help of mothers. Mothers were one of the preferred vessels of the Americanization of Mexicans because they were the ones that spent more time in the home and they could pass on their learned American values to the youth. In order to Americanize the mothers, they were taught through the help of the Home Teacher Act of 1915. With this act, teachers were allowed to enter the homes of Mexicans in California and teach the women how to be American and to pass on values to their children.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Other than the mothers, another effort that was made to Americanize the youth was to Americanize young Mexican girls. Young girls were starting to be taught in schools about different American values and customs through activities such as sewing, budgeting, and motherhood.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> The same idea for educating young girls was the reason that they were educating mothers, the girls would grow up to be mothers and have an influence on the lives of Mexican Americans in and outside the household.\n</p><p>Education was the main focus of the Americanization efforts. Soon, it became engraved in the minds of Mexican-Americans that the best way to become a part of American society was through leaving their own Mexican culture behind. Throughout the southwest, new organizations were being created to fully integrate Mexican-Americans into society. One example is the <a href=\"/wiki/League_of_United_Latin_American_Citizens\" title=\"League of United Latin American Citizens\">League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)</a>, which only United States Citizens were allowed to join. Found in a LULAC pamphlet is the phrase \u201cWe believe that education is the foundation for the cultural grown and development of this nation and that we are obligated to protect and promote the education of our people in accordance with the best American principles and standards,\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> showing the organization\u2019s dedication to Americanization. Through organizations that supported Americanization being created before <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, there came a larger divide between Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans.\n</p><p>The people benefitting from the integrative policies were the Mexican-Americans and they actively tried to separate themselves from Mexicans. Most of the Mexican-Americans involved in the organizations were from the middle class, causing an even larger separation of the people. Leading up to <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, there were more tactics being used to bring the people in America together. One of the policies that emerged was the <a href=\"/wiki/Good_Neighbor_policy\" title=\"Good Neighbor policy\">Good Neighbor Policy</a> in which the United States promoted the idea that everyone in the Americas should be united. This brought forth the idea that everyone was considered American and people should treat one another with respect. Through the Good Neighbor Policy another large Americanization tactic emerged: joining the war effort during World War II.\n</p><p>During World War II, many Mexican Americans began to join different units, some integrated and others <a href=\"/wiki/Racial_segregation\" title=\"Racial segregation\">segregated</a>. To their content, during the War Mexican-American soldiers were being treated by the Anglo-Americans as one of their own in their units. In others, there was still discrimination that occurred, especially once the soldiers returned home. The efforts to Americanize were not as prominent as some people began to see that even though they were fully American they were not going to stop being treated as foreign in their own country.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_uses\">Other uses</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Americanization_(immigration)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Other uses\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The term also is used for the cultural transformation of areas brought into the U.S., such as Alaska,<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> and on the <a href=\"/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans\" title=\"Cultural assimilation of Native Americans\">assimilation of Native Americans</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Impact_on_other_countries\">Impact on other countries</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Americanization_(immigration)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Impact on other countries\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The term <a href=\"/wiki/Americanization\" title=\"Americanization\">Americanization</a> has been used since 1907 for the American impact on other countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Americanization_(immigration)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Americanization_(foreign_culture_and_media)\" title=\"Americanization (foreign culture and media)\">Americanization (foreign culture and media)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Melting_pot\" title=\"Melting pot\">Melting pot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Civic_nationalism\" title=\"Civic nationalism\">Civic nationalism</a>, and its converse, <a href=\"/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism\" title=\"Ethnic nationalism\">ethnic nationalism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Nativism_(politics)\" title=\"Nativism (politics)\">Nativism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States_of_America\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immigration to the United States of America\">Immigration to the United States of America</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Salad_bowl_(cultural_idea)\" title=\"Salad bowl (cultural idea)\">Salad bowl (cultural idea)</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Americanization_(immigration)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: Hill, Howard C.. \u201cThe Americanization Movement\u201d.
