Interracial attraction is the attraction to individuals of a different race.  The biggest determinants of interracial attraction is the location of which individuals live. The United States is frequently referred to as a melting pot, owing to the diverse ethnic groups that make up the country.  Ethnic minorities, such as Hispanics or African Americans, are more likely to marry and be attracted to people outside of their race than European Americans, especially in areas where they make up only a small percentage of the population.  The rate of approval of interracial marriage has been steadily increasing since the 1950s, a 2013 study found 87% of Americans approve of interracial marriage, compared to just 4% in 1958. The same study concluded that 96% of blacks approved, and 84% of whites. Approval is highest among 18-to 29-year-olds, at 96%, and lowest among those 65 years and older, at 70%.   Researchers have found social influence to be a factor in deciding partners.
