Torna atrás (Spanish pronunciation: [toɾnaˈtɾas]) or Tornatrás is a term once used in Spain and its former overseas colonies to describe a mixed race person (mestizo) that showed phenotypic characteristics of only one of the "original races",  that is, white, black, Amerindian or Asian. The term was also used to describe an individual whose parentage was half white and half "albino".  Under the casta system of colonial Spanish America, the torna atrás (in English, similar in meaning to throwback, hark back to) could also make reference to the appearance of racial characteristics not present in the parents. Such as in the colored child of a white person and albino. The albino casta refers to the seemingly white offspring of a white and black-descended parent (afromestizo). It was also used in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era from the 16th to 19th century, to describe persons of mixed indigenous Austronesian (referred to as Indio), Chinese (referred to as Sangley), and Spanish ancestry (referred to as Filipinos/Insulares or Peninsulares). It is likely that a majority of Filipino people today would have been classified as Tornatrás under this system due to centuries of intermarriage among various foreign and indigenous ethnic groups throughout the islands. Although Tornatrás was originally used to describe a descendant of mestizos, albinos and Europeans, in the Philippines they were commonly known as those born from a Spanish father ('Filipino' or 'peninsular') and a Malay-Chinese (mestiza de sangley) mother. Most people of the Tornatrás caste in the Philippines used Spanish as their primary language and in many cases converted to the Catholic faith.  There are no official statistics on the number of people of Tornatrás ancestry around the world, although it is believed that most are to be found in South America and the Philippines.
