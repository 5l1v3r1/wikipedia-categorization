The various ethnolinguistic groups found in the Caucasus, Central Asia, Europe,  the Middle East, North Africa and/or South Asia demonstrate differing rates of particular Y-DNA haplogroups. In the table below, the first two columns identify ethnolinguistic groups. Subsequent columns represent the sample size (n) of the study or studies cited, and the percentage of each haplogroup found in that particular sample. (Data from studies conducted in the early 2000s may be inaccurate or a broad estimate, due to obsolete haplogroup naming systems â€“ e.g. the former Haplogroup 2 included members of the relatively unrelated haplogroups known later as Haplogroup G and macrohaplogroup IJ [which comprises haplogroups I and J].)
