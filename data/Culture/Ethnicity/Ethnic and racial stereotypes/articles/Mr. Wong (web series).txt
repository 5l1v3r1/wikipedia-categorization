Mr. Wong is an internet television series which debuted in 2000 and lasted 13 episodes (an unaired 14th episode was made available for the DVD release ). It features the adventures of a Chinese American butler for a wealthy socialite WASP named Miss Pam.  He previously worked as a butler for Bing Crosby and often mourns him.  It has developed a cult following whilst being hosted on the website Icebox.com, which also features independently made cartoons such as Queer Duck. But the cartoon has drawn fierce criticisms from the Asian American community who viewed it as racist.   Mr Wong's creators, Pam Brady and Kyle McCulloch, also write for the television series South Park.  The DVD was released under the "National Lampoon's Presents" banner. The music for Mr. Wong was composed and performed by Fuzzbee Morse. The theme song was sung by former Monkees lead singer Davy Jones.  In September 2000 a direct to video film adaptation of Mr. Wong called "Crap Attack" was in negotiation between IceBox Incorporated and Artisan Entertainment, however, when the film was publicly announced by Artisan president Bill Block the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans initiated a letter-writing campaign that successfully convinced Artisan to drop the project. The Coalition later took out an advertisement in Daily Variety criticizing the cartoon and thanking Artisan for abandoning the movie project.     The character has had a negative reaction from critics in the mainstream media and Asian American groups yet maintains a limited cult following.
