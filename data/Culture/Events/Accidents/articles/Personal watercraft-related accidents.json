No person shall operate a personal watercraft in an unsafe or reckless manner. Unsafe personal watercraft operation shall include, but not be limited to the following:<br />\n (1) Becoming airborne or completely leaving the water while crossing the wake of another vessel within [100 feet] of the vessel creating the wake. <br />Or wake jumping\n      (2) Weaving through congested traffic.<br />\n      (3) Operating a vessel at greater than slow/no wake speed within [100 feet] of an anchored or moored vessel, shoreline, vessel underway, dock, pier, boat ramp, marina, swim float, marked swim area, person in the water, person(s) engaged in angling, or any manually-propelled vessel. <br />\n      (4) Operating contrary to the \"Rules of the Road\" or following too close to another vessel, including another personal watercraft. For the purposes of this section, following too close shall be construed as proceeding in the same direction and operating at a speed in excess of [10 MPH] when approaching within [100 feet] to the rear or [50 feet] to the side of another motorboat or sailboat which is underway unless such vessel is operating in a narrow channel, in which case a personal watercraft may operate at speed and flow of other vessel traffic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-nasbla_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nasbla-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reckless driving is defined differently by state. For example, in Florida reckless driving on a PWC is defined as \"maneuvering a personal watercraft by weaving through congested vessel traffic, jumping the wake of another vessel unreasonably close or when visibility around the vessel is obstructed, or swerving at the last possible moment to avoid collision is classified as reckless operation of a vessel\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-florida_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-florida-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\nIn U.S. law, the penalties for operating a vessel in a negligent or reckless manner are defined as following:</p><blockquote>\n<p>(a) A person operating a vessel in a negligent manner or interfering with the safe operation of a vessel, so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of a person is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 in the case of a recreational vessel, or $25,000 in the case of any other vessel.<br />\n(b) A person operating a vessel in a grossly negligent manner that endangers the life, limb, or property of a person commits a class A misdemeanor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-code_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-code-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Driver_inattention\"><span id=\"Driver_Inattention\"></span>Driver inattention</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Personal_watercraft-related_accidents&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Driver inattention\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Because of the increasing popularity of water sports (particularly PWC), the number of vessels in use has increased in the last several decades.

Because of the increased congestion caused by the number of vessels, a heightened need for attention and caution is required by operators. In 2007, 17.2 percent of all PWC-related accidents were caused by driver inattention.<sup id=\"cite_ref-oseven_16-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-oseven-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Excessive_speed\"><span id=\"Excessive_Speed\"></span>Excessive speed</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Personal_watercraft-related_accidents&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Excessive speed\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As the market has grown for PWC manufacturers, vessel power has also increased. Modern PWC engines have more than 250 horsepower and can reach speeds of over 70 miles per hour (110&#160;km/h).<sup id=\"cite_ref-wave_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-wave-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Excessive speed accounted for nearly 15 percent of all PWC-related accidents in 2007, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.<sup id=\"cite_ref-oseven_16-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-oseven-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Off-throttle_steering\"><span id=\"Off_Throttle_Steering\"></span>Off-throttle steering</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Personal_watercraft-related_accidents&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Off-throttle steering\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3><p>\nThe steering characteristics of jet boats (including personal watercraft) when they are \"off throttle\" seem to differ from conventional steering. All recreational planing boats steer with thrust. Jet boats (including PWCs) generate that thrust with a moveable nozzle connected to a jet pump; propeller boats generate thrust through a downward-placed, exposed propeller. The fact that the propeller is placed downward in the water and is exposed means that even when it is not generating thrust that some amount of steering effect is possible. Jet boats have no downward projection, and achieve no additional steering effect from the device. If the operator of a jet boat releases the throttle, steering effectiveness decreases roughly in proportion to  thrust reduction. The NTSB related an example of an off-throttle steering accident in the personal watercraft safety study of 1998: </p><blockquote>\n<p>The Florida Marine Patrol accident description states, \"[Operator] was\nattempting to make a turn south through a cut in the mangroves . . . . He was not real familiar with operating a jet ski with a passenger.  When he attempted to make a left turn he let off the throttle which caused the PWC to lose steering capabilities.  The forward momentum of the PWC took [operator] and passenger into the mangrove shoreline.\n[Operator] received a puncture wound to the left side of his neck . . . .\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-ntsb_17-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ntsb-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the NTSB, 24 percent of reported PWC accidents list steering problems or loss of control as contributing factors;<sup id=\"cite_ref-ntsb_17-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ntsb-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> in Florida, it is the second-leading cause of PWC-related accidents. PWC manufacturers have been working to develop a system to prevent off-throttle steering. Modifications have been made to solve this problem in newer PWC models.<sup id=\"cite_ref-rideo_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-rideo-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Driver_inexperience\"><span id=\"Driver_inexperience\"></span>Driver inexperience</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Personal_watercraft-related_accidents&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Driver inexperience\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Because of the ease of operating a PWC, little training and experience is required to perform basic maneuvers of a PWC. The NTSB reported in 1998 that 32 percent of operators involved in accidents reported that they had operated a vessel between zero and ten times prior to the accident; 86 never, 75 once and 225 between 2 and 10 times.

He also admitted that he did not read the safety recommendations in the operator\u2019s guide nor watch the safety video.  Counsel for BRP in the Thomas case, Scott Sarason, commented on the case that, \u201cStatistically speaking, the probability of the type of incident involved in this case is extremely rare. Owners, operators and passengers of personal watercrafts must think safety first. It\u2019s important for people to realize that these watercraft are classified as boats. That\u2019s why the watercraft industry has been working diligently with authorities like the U.S. Coast Guard to introduce programs like \u2018Know Before You Go\u2019 in an effort to prevent accidents and injuries.\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> The Thomas case is just one example, of a handful, where such a rare accident is caused by extraneous persons or factors (including, but not limited to, the presence of alcohol, operator inexperience/inattention, careless or reckless operation, violation of state/local boating laws, failure on the part of the operator and/or owner to convey necessary safety information provided by the manufacturer, etc.).  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_and_references\">Notes and references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Personal_watercraft-related_accidents&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Notes and references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Rickman, Roy Scott; Michael M.
