An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental, and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.  Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, moving objects, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc. Poisons, vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries. According to a 2005 survey of injuries sustained at home, which used data from the National Vital Statistics System of the United States National Center for Health Statistics, falls, poisoning, and fire/burn injuries are the most common causes of death.  The United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.  This program was revised in 2000 to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products.  Data on emergency department visits is also collected through the National Health Interview Survey.  In The U.S. the Bureau of Labor Statistics has available on their website extensive statistics on workplace accidents.  Many models to characterize and analyze accidents have been proposed,  which can by classified by type. Notable types and models include:  Ishikawa diagrams are sometimes used to illustrate root-cause analysis and five whys discussions.
