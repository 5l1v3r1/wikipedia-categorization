These alternative endings are a special type of <a href=\"/wiki/Deleted_scene\" title=\"Deleted scene\">deleted scene</a>. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.\n</p><p>Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.\n</p><p>The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/1408_(film)\" title=\"1408 (film)\">1408</a></i>: An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like <i>The Butterfly Effect</i>, with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/28_Days_Later\" title=\"28 Days Later\">28 Days Later</a></i>: Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/3_Ninjas\" title=\"3 Ninjas\">3 Ninjas</a></i>: The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Starz_(TV_channel)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Starz (TV channel)\">Starz</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Showtime (TV channel)\">Showtime</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Showtime_MAX&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Showtime MAX (page does not exist)\">Showtime MAX</a>; international <a href=\"/wiki/DVD\" title=\"DVD\">DVDs</a> have this version, as well.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Army_of_Darkness\" title=\"Army of Darkness\">Army of Darkness</a></i>: In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams \"I slept too long!\"</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Astronaut%27s_Wife\" title=\"The Astronaut&#39;s Wife\">The Astronaut's Wife</a></i>: When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Blade:_Trinity\" title=\"Blade: Trinity\">Blade: Trinity</a></i>: The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director <a href=\"/wiki/David_S._Goyer\" title=\"David S. Goyer\">David S. Goyer</a>. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_(2002_film)\" title=\"The Bourne Identity (2002 film)\">The Bourne Identity</a></i>: An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect\" title=\"The Butterfly Effect\">The Butterfly Effect</a></i>: Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his <a href=\"/wiki/Umbilical_cord\" title=\"Umbilical cord\">umbilical cord</a> and dies, <a href=\"/wiki/Stillbirth\" title=\"Stillbirth\">stillborn</a>. This \"<a href=\"/wiki/Director%27s_Cut\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Director&#39;s Cut\">Director's Cut</a>\" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Child%27s_Play_2\" title=\"Child&#39;s Play 2\">Child's Play 2</a></i>: An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Clash_of_the_Titans_(2010_film)\" title=\"Clash of the Titans (2010 film)\">Clash of the Titans</a></i>: After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Clerks\" title=\"Clerks\">Clerks</a></i>: Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Clue_(film)\" title=\"Clue (film)\">Clue</a></i> had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of <i>three</i> of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Die_Hard_with_a_Vengeance\" title=\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a></i>: In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. His career is in ruins and he is keen to take it out on Gruber whom he invites to play a game called \"McClane Says\". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Dodgeball:_A_True_Underdog_Story\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story\">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</a></i>: The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the \"real\" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, \"You happy now?\")</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Ella_Enchanted_(film)\" title=\"Ella Enchanted (film)\">Ella Enchanted</a></i>: The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Fatal_Attraction\" title=\"Fatal Attraction\">Fatal Attraction</a></i>: Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex \"If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you\". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Destination_(film)\" title=\"Final Destination (film)\">Final Destination</a></i>: Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Destination_2\" title=\"Final Destination 2\">Final Destination 2</a></i>: The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Destination_3\" title=\"Final Destination 3\">Final Destination 3</a></i>: The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Final_Destination\" title=\"The Final Destination\">The Final Destination</a></i>: In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, \"The chain is broken.\" Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Destination_5\" title=\"Final Destination 5\">Final Destination 5</a></i>: In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/First_Blood\" title=\"First Blood\">First Blood</a></i>: In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_III\" title=\"Friday the 13th Part III\">Friday the 13th Part III</a></i>: Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_The_Final_Chapter\" title=\"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter\">Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter</a></i>: An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Game_of_Death\" title=\"Game of Death\">Game of Death</a></i>: This movie has two alternative endings. In the <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong\" title=\"Hong Kong\">Hong Kong</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Cantonese\" title=\"Cantonese\">Cantonese</a>  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the <a href=\"/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese\" title=\"Mandarin Chinese\">Mandarin</a> print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of <a href=\"/wiki/Bruce_Lee\" title=\"Bruce Lee\">Bruce Lee</a>. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Happy_Death_Day\" title=\"Happy Death Day\">Happy Death Day</a></i>: An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Hide_and_Seek_(2005_film)\" title=\"Hide and Seek (2005 film)\">Hide and Seek</a></i>: This movie had many different endings on whether <a href=\"/wiki/Dakota_Fanning\" title=\"Dakota Fanning\">Dakota Fanning</a>'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(film)\" title=\"I Am Legend (film)\">I Am Legend</a></i>: The \"Monster Woman\" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a \"cure\" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the \"Alpha Monster\" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the \"Monster Woman\" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the \"Alpha Monster\" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer\" title=\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a></i>: In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads \"I still know\". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Infernal_Affairs\" title=\"Infernal Affairs\">Infernal Affairs</a></i>: In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming (<a href=\"/wiki/Andy_Lau\" title=\"Andy Lau\">Andy Lau</a>) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Infernal_Affairs_III\" title=\"Infernal Affairs III\">Infernal Affairs III</a></i>, follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_(1986_film)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)\">Little Shop of Horrors</a></i>: In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Men_in_Black_II\" title=\"Men in Black II\">Men in Black II</a></i>: The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Orphan_(2009_film)\" title=\"Orphan (2009 film)\">Orphan</a></i>: In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Paranormal_Activity\" title=\"Paranormal Activity\">Paranormal Activity</a></i>: In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Paycheck_(film)\" title=\"Paycheck (film)\">Paycheck</a></i>: Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel \"do you believe in fate?\" and they kiss.
