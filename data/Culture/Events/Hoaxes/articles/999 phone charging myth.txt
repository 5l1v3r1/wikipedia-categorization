  The 999 phone charging myth is an urban myth which claims that if a mobile phone has low battery then dialing 999 (or any regional emergency number) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls. The basis for the myth was a feature of BlackBerry phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services. People discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up, it would override the shutdown for a number of minutes so that phone calls could be made.  The myth is believed to have originated in BlackBerry forums around 2012.   In 2013, Derbyshire Constabulary released a press release telling people not to believe the myth that calling 999 charges the battery.  They cited that for every silent or aborted 999 call received, the operators have to call the person back to make sure there is no emergency.  These hoax calls waste police time that could potentially block responses to real emergencies.  Bedfordshire Police also released information asking people not to call 999 except for an emergency as they stated that in the last six months of 2013 they had an increase in hoax 999 calls from people believing the myth.  Other sources supplemented these press releases by stating that misusing the 999 number is illegal.  They also stated that the police could cut off telephones being used to abuse the 999 service.  A related myth emerged: that when Siri on an iPhone is told, "Charge my phone to 100%", the phone would call emergency services as a secret safety code. This was later traced to a bug in Apple programming that was fixed within a day. The myth continued to spread on social media as a prank.
