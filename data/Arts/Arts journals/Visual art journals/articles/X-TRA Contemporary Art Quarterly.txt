X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly is an independent journal published quarterly to promote and provoke engaged critical discourse about contemporary visual art in Los Angeles. X-TRA is composed of features, long-form reviews, columns, and artist projects. In 1997 artists Stephen Berens and Ellen Birrell   founded X-TRA to address a need for in-depth dialogue about art in Los Angeles, which was rapidly becoming an international art capital. For nearly eighteen years, X-TRA has steadily published articles and artist projects for a growing audience, making it the longest running contemporary art journal in Los Angeles. Project X Foundation for Art and Criticism (a 501c3 nonprofit corporation) was created in 2002 to act as publisher for X-TRA. X-TRA’s audience includes a broad range of practicing artists, art curators, art dealers, critics and writers, the general art audience and students. Current readership for X-TRA is estimated to be about 7,000 people per issue, or 28,000 people per year. Project X Foundation for Art and Criticism and X-TRA receive funding and support from public and private sources. Current and recent institutional donors include The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts,  National Endowment of the Arts, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, Isambard Kingdom Brunel Society of North America, The Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts, The Getty Foundation, and the Pasadena Art Alliance.  X-TRA is collaboratively edited by the Editorial Board, which is composed of Los Angeles-based artists and writers, all of whom work on a volunteer basis. This collaborative editorial process insures that X-TRA presents an array of perspectives and ideas. Current Editorial Board members are Stephen Berens, Ellen Birrell, Leslie Dick, Travis Diehl, Karen Dunbar, Jon Leaver, Shana Lutker, Mario Ontiveros, Elizabeth Pulsinelli, Nizan Shaked, and Brica Wilcox. X-TRA also has a board of contributing editors from around the country that help recruit writers and suggest artists and exhibitions. Current contributing editors are Ken Allan (Seattle), Neha Choksi (Bombay and Los Angeles), Allan deSouza (San Francisco), Jae Emerling (Charlotte), Michelle Grabner (Chicago), Micol Hebron (Los Angeles), Aram Moshayedi (Los Angeles), Kristina Newhouse (Los Angeles), Jan Tumlir (Los Angeles) Anne Walsh (Berkeley) and Damon Willick (Los Angeles).  The design and printing process of the magazine has changed over the years. X-TRA has worked with different designers over the course of its history. Starting as a folded newspaper, its current incarnation is as a full color, perfect-bound journal, X-TRA is currently designed by Brian Roettinger and the X-TRA’s website, x-traonline.org, by Takumi Akin and Jon Gacnik.  X-TRA hosts a range of events, supplementing the journal with programming to enhance community building.  Some recent examples include: · "Chinese Cocktail", a concert by Robert Wilhite at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre as part of the Pacific Standard Time Performance and Public Art Festival organized by the Getty Foundation and LAXART. January 24, 2012 · "Kitchen Table", reprise, a re-imagining of the series of conversations organized by Eugenia P. Butler in 1993 at the ART/LA art fair. Situated within the College Art Association Conference at the same LA Convention Center that was the site for the ’93 talks, these talks brought together a group of cultural thinkers—primarily artists—seated around a table over lunch to speak freely about art, politics, and whatever come to the fore. February 22–24, 2012 · X-TRA has staged five 1 IMAGE 1 MINUTE events, most recently at the LA Art Book Fair in 2015. Based on the artist Agnès Varda's series for French television in which members of the art community were invited on stage to speak for one minute about an image of their choosing. This event references a column of the same name, conceived by Micol Hebron, which ran in X-TRA from 2006 to 2010.
