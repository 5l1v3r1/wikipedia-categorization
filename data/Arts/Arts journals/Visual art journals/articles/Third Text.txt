Third Text is a bimonthly academic journal on art in global context.  After founder and editor Rasheed Araeen's earlier art magazine Black Phoenix, started in 1978, published only three issues, it was relaunched as a theoretical art journal in 1987.  From 1992 - 1999 the journal was edited by Jean Fisher. Third Text challenges the boundaries of the visual arts and the confines of the Western academy, featuring leading critics alongside new voices and advanced scholarship interspersed with radical interdisciplinary work that goes beyond the confines of Eurocentricity.
