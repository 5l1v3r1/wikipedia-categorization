The Cornell Journal of Architecture is a critical academic journal of architecture and urbanism produced by the Department of Architecture at the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning.  The journal was established in 1981 and is edited by architecture students with guidance from faculty. In 2011 the journal was revived after publication was suspended for eight years.  The journal has been published/distributed by Rizzoli, Distributed Art Publishers, and most recently by ACTAR/Birkh√§user Verlag.
