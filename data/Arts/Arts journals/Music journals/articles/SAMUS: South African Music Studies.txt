SAMUS: South African Music Studies is a peer-reviewed academic journal and the official journal of the South African Society for Research in Music (SASRIM). Contents and abstracts are listed in RILM Abstracts, The Music Index, Sabinet Online, and African Journals OnLine. SAMUS succeeds the now defunct South African Journal of Musicology which was published by the former Musicological Society of Southern Africa. SASRIM is a post-apartheid amalgamation of the Musicological Society of Southern Africa and the Ethnomusicology Symposium. Consequently SAMUS is an interdisciplinary journal, which publishes an eclectic range of research in the disciplines of musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory and analysis, popular music, composition, performance, music therapy, and music education. The journal is published once a year. Notable music researchers who have published in both the South African Journal of Musicology and SAMUS include Christopher Ballantine, John Blacking, Michael Blake, Sylvia Bruinders, Nicholas Cook, David Coplan, Lindelwa Dalamba, Chatradari Devroop, Michael Drewett, Veit Erlmann, Robert Fokkens, Klaus Heimes, Marie Jorritsma, Clare Loveday, Christine Lucia, Winfried Lüdemann, J.P Malan, James May, Stephanus Muller, Grant Olwage, Beverly Parker, Roger Parker, Mary Rörich, Martin Scherzinger, Ruth A.
