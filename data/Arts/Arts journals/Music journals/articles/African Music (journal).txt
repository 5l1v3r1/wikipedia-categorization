The International Library of African Music (ILAM) was also established in he same year, near Roodepoort, South Africa. Hugh Tracey was the editor of the journal African Music until 1977.  African Music is an annual, peer reviewed, accredited, academic journal. The journal publishes original articles, not previously published, pertaining to contextualized studies of African music and related arts. Since it was re-launched in 2007 it features a CD compilation of audio examples illustrating the articles in each edition, which generally consists of field recordings from the article authors' research.
