Epps Jr. graduated from the College of Arts and Letters at Michigan State University, and has since gone on to teach at the University of Southern California.  Epps Jr. came to California to become a director, but he did not have the money or know-how to do so. He decided to first write a script and to hope that this would lead to directing. Partnering with Anderson House, they sold a script to Hawaii Five-O. He continued to work with House for a few years, before partnering with Jim Cash.  After completing seven unproduced screenplays together, Epps Jr. and Cash produced Top Gun. This film went on to become the number-one worldwide box office hit in 1986. After this, they quickly wrote other screenplays that were produced, including Legal Eagles and The Secret of my Success. Epps co-authored over 25 screenplays and eight motion pictures that he produced well into the following decade, including Dick Tracy, Turner & Hooch and Anaconda.  He wrote for some of the most successful actors in the industry including Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, Tom Hanks, Warren Beatty and others.
