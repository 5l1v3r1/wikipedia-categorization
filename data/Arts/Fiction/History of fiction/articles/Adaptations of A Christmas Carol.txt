  A Christmas Carol, the popular 1843 novella by Charles Dickens (1812â€“1870), is one of the celebrated British author's best-known works. It is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy miser who hates Christmas, but is transformed into a caring, kindly person through the visitations of four ghosts. The classic work has been dramatised and adapted countless times for virtually every medium and performance genre, and new versions appear regularly. The novel was the subject of Dickens' first public reading, given in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute on 27 December 1852. This was repeated three days later to an audience of 'working people', and was a great success by his own account and that of newspapers of the time.  Over the years, Dickens edited and adapted the piece for a listening, rather than reading, audience. Excerpts from A Christmas Carol remained part of Dickens' public readings until his death. Several performers, including American entertainer Mike Randall  and Australian actor Phil Zachariah,   tour shows in which they perform the public readings in character as Dickens. Between 1944 and 1956, most television versions of the story were staged live. None of the later versions were done live, but were either shot on videotape or filmed. They include:   The basic plot of A Christmas Carol has been put to a variety of different literary and dramatic uses since Dickens' death, alongside sequels, prequels, and stories focusing on minor characters.
