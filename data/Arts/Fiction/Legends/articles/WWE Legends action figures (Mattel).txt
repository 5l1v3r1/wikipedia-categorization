At the Toyfair 2010 in New York City, Mattel revealed the WWE Legends action figure line.  The figures are elite style and some also come with accessories. Series 1 arrived at stores in July 2010 with Series 2 right around the corner to be hitting the shelves in August 2010. Series 3, 4, 5 and 6 were announced at the 2010 San Diego ComicCon and followed in tow, being released to stores in September 2010, October 2010, November 2010 and December 2010 respectively. There was much hype surrounding the line from collectors, most notably for WWE legend Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat who had not had a WWE (WWF) figure released of himself since his WWF Hasbro figure in 1992. Toys "R" Us is currently the exclusive carrier to the WWE Legends 2-Packs Series 1 which were released in late August 2010. There are 6 figures in total with 2 to a box.
