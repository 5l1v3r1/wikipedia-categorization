The Bongy Westphall Universe is a fictional universe of 44 related films released by Full Moon Entertainment. Series creator Charles Band took inspiration from team up comics he read as a child.  The universe is named after the Tommy Westphall Universe and also the film Evil Bong which presents the largest crossover in the fictional universe. The named was coined by film podcast Double Feature during their "Killapalooza" episode highlighting the Puppet Master franchise.  Evil Bong represents the largest overall crossover in the Bongy Westphall universe. Ooga Booga (Blood Dolls), Ivan Burroughs (Decadent Evil), Gingerdead Man, Jack Attack (Demonic Toys), and Jack Deth (Trancers) are all featured. Footage from Vampire Journals is used at the beginning of the movie which ties the Subspecies series to the Bongy Westphall Universe. Jack Attack's appearance in Evil Bong brings Demonic Toys into the Bongy Westphall Universe. The Dollman crossover also incorporates Bad Channels due to a small Dollman cameo. By crossing over with Demonic Toys, all ten other Puppet Master films are entered into the Bongy Westphall Universe although Puppet Master never crosses over directly with Evil Bong. Zombies Vs. Strippers (2012): The character Hambo (played by Chance A. Rearden) later appears in Ooga Booga and several Gingerdead Man films. Crash and Burn (1990): The character Quinn (played by Bill Moseley) later appears in Evil Bong (2006). The following is the list of films in Bongy Westphall Universe (in order of release):
