In fiction, a plot hole, plothole or plot error is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot.  Such inconsistencies include such things as illogical or impossible events,  and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline. The term is more loosely also applied to "loose ends" in a plot â€“ side-lined story elements that remain unresolved by the end of the plot.
