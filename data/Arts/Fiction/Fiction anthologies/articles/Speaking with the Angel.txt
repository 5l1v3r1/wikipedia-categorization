Speaking with the Angel is a collection of short stories edited by Nick Hornby. It was initially published by Penguin Books in 2000, with a paperback edition published by Riverhead Books in 2001. Featuring stories from twelve established writers, the book acted as a fundraising effort for TreeHouse, a charity school for severely autistic children in London where Hornby's son was a student.
