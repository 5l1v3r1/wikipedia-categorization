Son Of Retro Pulp Tales is a collection of short fiction edited by Joe R. Lansdale and his son Keith Lansdale. Continuing in the same vein as the earlier book titled Retro Pulp Tales, these stories are more in the tradition of early pulp stories in cheap magazines and pre-1960s horror films. This book was published exclusively by Subterranean Press.
