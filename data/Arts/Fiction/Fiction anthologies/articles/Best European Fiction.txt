Best European Fiction is an annual anthology of European short stories published by Dalkey Archive Press since 2010. The first four editions were edited by the Bosnian American novelist Aleksandar Hemon, whilst the 2014 anthology was edited by the Slovenian writer Drago Janƒçar. The 2015 volume was edited by West Camel, and both the 2016 and 2017 editions were edited by Nathaniel Davis. Some of the contributors have never before been translated into English, although they have been writing in their own languages for decades.
