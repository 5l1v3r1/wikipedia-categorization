Nancy Basile in her review for About.com  Legends of Bikini Bottom received positive reviews from media critics. Nancy Basile of About.com positively reacted to the series and gave it a 4 out of 5 rating.  She cited her favorite episodes like "Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Triangle" and "The Main Drain".  She said "Firstly, you know an episode will be funny when it's titled 'Bikini Bottom Triangle'. My children had no idea why I was laughing at the title frame."  her favorite scenes from the episode were "Gary's booty, watching the old sea dog spit his story and figuring out why Patrick wears cuff links."  In another episode called "The Main Drain", she said "I won't ruin the set up because it's just so funny, but my favorite line is, 'It's now or never.' You have to see it to know why."  In his review for the DVD Talk, Paul Mavis said "SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom is all-new, and therein lies what has becoming [sic] increasingly routine: haphazard quality. Some are mildly amusing, and others blow their promising set-ups."  He added "Still, 'The Main Drain' and 'Trenchbillies' are fairly funny, while the magical warrior dolphin in 'Sponge-Cano!' may be worth the price of admission alone here."  Danielle Sullivan of Babble.com said "My 13-year-old still loves SpongeBob and his quirky underwater friends, and I have to admit that the show makes me laugh a lot. Itâ€™s one of those unique blends that appeals to kids and parents." Michelle Lincaster of AllVoices, on the airing of the series on Facebook, said "SpongeBob SquarePants has a 16,000,000 fan following on Facebook so the premiere of The Legends of Bikini Bottom on Facebook shouldn't come as a surprise."  Jeff Robbins of the DVD Verdict was mixed on the series and said "SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom, get Lost."  Citing "The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom", he said "What is also notable here is the episode's ending, which features a brilliant call-back to an earlier seen flashback (more shades of Lost) that ties up the threads of the episode as well as any Larry David penned half-hour. This first short is SpongeBob at its best." Robbins called "The Main Drain" as "Not a good episode." and "Sponge-Cano!" as "A strong segment."  In reviewing "The Curse of the Hex", Robbins said "Unfortunately, this lousy episode ends the disc on a sour note as a hagfish curses The Krusty Krab. The only notable aspect to this dull segment is that the hagfish is voiced by Saturday Night Live's Kristen Wiig, which, depending on your current view of the comedy institution, may make the episode more or less interesting. Either the writers got tired of attempting allusions to Lost by this point, or I simply got tired of looking for them."
