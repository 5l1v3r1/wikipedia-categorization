A film à clef (or cinéma à clef, movie à clef,  film à clé ([film‿a kle], French for "film with a key"), is a film describing real life, behind a façade of fiction.  "Key" in this context means a table one can use to swap out the names. Film à clef is the film equivalent of the literary roman à clef, and the two share the same techniques.  Many films à clef are biopics of Hollywood personalities.
