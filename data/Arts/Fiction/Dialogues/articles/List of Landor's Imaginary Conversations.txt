This is a list of the Imaginary Conversations of Walter Savage Landor, a series of dialogues of historical and mythical characters. It follows the retrospective order and arrangement of the five-volume collection, chosen by Landor himself and to be found in his Collected Works. These were then published separately (1883). The original spelling and use of honorifics and titles is retained, but some names are made fuller in order to disambiguate.
