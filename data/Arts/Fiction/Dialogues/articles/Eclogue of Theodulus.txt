The Eclogue of Theodulus was a Latin verse dialogue, which became a standard school text of the Middle Ages. Scholarship generally dates it to the 10th century, though earlier dates are also given.  The work is attributed to Gottschalk of Orbais, and in fact the name Theodolus is the Greek translation of Gottschalk (God's slave). The poem is an argument between Alithia (truth) and Pseustis (falsehood}, with Phronesis (reason), acting as referee.
