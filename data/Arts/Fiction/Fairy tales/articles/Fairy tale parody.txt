Fairy tale parody is a genre of fiction which parodies traditional fairy tales.  The genre was popularized on television by the Fractured Fairy Tales segments on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.  The 2001 computer-animated film Shrek brought great popularity to the genre. Parodies soon eclipsed traditional fairy tales. The genre garnered some praise for its more modern views but was also criticized for supplanting the traditional stories.  Children's books that have been classified as fairy tale parodies: Politically Correct Fairy Tales and Politically Correct Bedtime Stories: Modern tales for our life and times by James Finn Garner have been called "Adult fractured fairy talesÂ ... still humorous but the humor is for adults".
