He orders his Vizier to find a solution to keep him occupied during the long, sleepless nights. His Vizier knows that the best way to entertain Sultan is storytelling. He says “My Sultan. The land you chose for the capital has the most skillful storytellers. I’ll gather the best ones in your sultanate and assign them with the task of narrating you one of their tales every night.” With that he starts sending a storyteller to Sultan to tell him a new story every night. The Bedside Tales of Sultan comprises 15 stories. Some characters are noble people from the royal court – Sultans, Viziers, merchants, judges; some possess magical powers – magicians, sorcerers; some are ordinary people like peasants, gardeners, shoemakers, bakers, tutors. And some tales are built upon pure imagination and we meet with walking clouds, talking fingers, migrating watermelons and fighting letters. Every tale is different but they all have one common characteristic; they are bedside tales that aim to educate us on morals, deepen our imaginations and entertain us.
