The story revolves around ninth century India, just after the sudden demise of <a href=\"/wiki/Adi_Shankara\" title=\"Adi Shankara\">Adi Shankaracharya</a> - a time when a unique and exotic <a href=\"/wiki/Ikshvaku_dynasty\" title=\"Ikshvaku dynasty\">Ikshavaku</a> tribe lives somewhere in Rudraputra. Their scion, Eklavya, as per the predictions of a high priest, will take birth with a purpose of demolishing the evil from the earth. The child is declared mystic. However, he would later be clutched in the hands of <a href=\"/wiki/Kali_Yuga\" title=\"Kali Yuga\">Kali</a>, the darkness.\n</p><p>A storm hits this part of the world a day before the birth of Eklavya, claiming many lives. Soon after Eklavya\u2019s birth, his mother dies, and a series of unfortunate events follows. The village deemed the child as sullied and cursed. Eklavya\u2019s father loses his sanity after all this, and his grandmother dies mysteriously. Eklavya is forced to leave the village. He tries to end his life by taking a plunge into the mighty <a href=\"/wiki/Ganges\" title=\"Ganges\">Ganges</a>, but a stranger saves his life by asking his way to the cemetery. Eklavya and that stranger become friends. The stranger offers Eklavya a job in the cemetery. Upon reaching there, Eklavya finds an old man who, as per the stranger, is his father. The stranger disappears in the morning. The old man reveals that he never had any child. Eklavya is baffled and wonders about the stranger.\n</p><p>As days pass by, Eklavya starts sharing a bond with the old man and helping him maintain the cemetery. Everything was going fine until one day Eklavya finds his father dead and brought over to the cemetery for cremation. Weak and thrashed from inside, Eklayva decides to go back to his village, where he was outcast from, after being deemed as sullied. Before he could go there, the high priest came to meet him in the cemetery. It is during a heated conversation that the high priest revealed that he had some hidden motives against Eklavya and his father, and that he was the reason behind Eklavya\u2019s mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s death. Seeing the high priest repent his deeds, Eklavya let him go alive.\n</p><p>Eklavya, after few days, leaves the cemetery and the old man, and goes out to find the truth of life. Soon, he attains higher consciousness. During his adulthood, Eklavya trains an entire village to fight against bandits, finds a girl who earlier had saved him from being killed by a tribe, witnessed the death of the old man and eventually, the girl killed by the bandits. It is then revealed that the high priest had become the Chief Minister of the state of Rudraputra and to pay back the cost of his spared life, he helps Eklavya become the King of Rudraputra. Eklavya in his kingship improves the socio-economic condition of his country. And hence, the prophecies of him conquering the world and ending <a href=\"/wiki/Kali_Yuga\" title=\"Kali Yuga\">Kaliyuga</a> made before his birth became true.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Draft:God_of_the_Sullied&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2222\nCached time: 20180913215312\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.092 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.128 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 864/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 5090/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 889/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 20/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.030/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.39 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  112.774      1 -total\n 70.01%   78.952      1 Template:Infobox_book\n 58.56%   66.035      1 Template:Infobox\n 23.93%   26.989      1 Template:Italic_title\n 21.95%   24.756      1 Template:ISBNT\n 20.42%   23.027      1 Template:ISBN\n  8.91%   10.049      1 Template:Catalog_lookup_link\n  5.87%    6.615      1 Template:Reflist\n  4.37%    4.928      1 Template:Error-small\n  3.08%    3.470      4 Template:Yesno\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:58439641-0!canonical and timestamp 20180913215312 and revision id 859411667\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"God of the Sullied","*":"2018_books"},{"sortkey":"God of the Sullied","*":"Indian_books"},{"sortkey":"God of the Sullied","*":"Fiction_books"},{"sortkey":"God of the Sullied","*":"21st-century_Indian_novels"},{"sortkey":"God of the Sullied","*":"Historical_novels"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Adi Shankara"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Fiction"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ganges"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gaurav Sharma (author)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Historical fiction"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ikshvaku dynasty"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"International Standard Book Number"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kali Yuga"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Italic title"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox book"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Yesno"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Longitem"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:ISBNT"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:ISBN"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Catalog lookup link"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Trim"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Yesno-no"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Error-small"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Tl"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Both"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Template other"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Wikidata image"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Infobox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Navbar"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Wikidata"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:I18n"},{"ns":828,"*":"Module:Infobox/i18n"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check isxn"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Error"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Publication","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Draft:God_of_the_Sullied","byteoffset":683,"anchor":"Publication"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Synopsis","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Draft:God_of_the_Sullied","byteoffset":798,"anchor":"Synopsis"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Draft:God_of_the_Sullied","byteoffset":3726,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Draft:<i>God of the Sullied</i>","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"displaytitle","*":"Draft:<i>God of the Sullied</i>"},{"name":"defaultsort","*":"God of the Sullied"}]}}
