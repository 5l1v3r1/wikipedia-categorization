In drama, a frame is a situation or position of importance given to a person, and distance relates to how engaged the frame makes the group.  For example: Dorothy Heathcote created the idea of frames and distance. These concepts can be applied to thinking about a target group and how willing they would be to interact with the drama. A younger child is more likely to want to become part of the action, while a teenager is more likely to want to observe and comment on the action.
