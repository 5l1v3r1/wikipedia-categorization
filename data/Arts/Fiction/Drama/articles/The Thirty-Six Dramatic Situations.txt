The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations is a descriptive list which was created by Georges Polti to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. To do this Polti analyzed classical Greek texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction, Polti claims to be continuing the work of Carlo Gozzi, who also identified 36 situations. â€”Goethe  This list was published in a book of the same name, which contains extended explanations and examples.  The original French-language book was written in the 19th century. An English translation was published in 1916 and continues to be reprinted to this day. The list is popularized as an aid for writers, but it is also used by dramatists, storytellers and many others. Other similar lists have since been made. Each situation is stated, then followed by the necessary elements for each situation and a brief description.
