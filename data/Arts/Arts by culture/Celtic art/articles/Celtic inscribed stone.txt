Celtic inscribed stones are stone monuments dating from 400 to 1000 AD. They are inscribed with Celtic or Latin text, which can be written in Ogham or Roman letters. Some stones have both Ogham and Roman inscriptions. The stones are found in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, the Isle of Man, and parts of western England (mainly Cornwall, Devon, and Lundy).  They relate to other standing stones with decoration, such as the Turoe Stone and Castlestrange Stone.
