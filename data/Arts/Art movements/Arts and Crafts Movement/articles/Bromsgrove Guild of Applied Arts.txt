The Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts (1898â€“1966) was a company of modern artists and designers associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, founded by Walter Gilbert. The guild worked in metal, wood, plaster, bronze, tapestry, glass and other mediums.  The Guild received a Royal Warrant in 1908.  The Guild's most famous works on public display are the main gates of Buckingham Palace and the Canada Gate both part of Sir Aston Webb's memorial scheme to Queen Victoria.  Unlike many other Arts & Crafts companies that faded away after a few decades, for instance the William Morris company, the Bromsgrove Guild survived until the early 1960s.
