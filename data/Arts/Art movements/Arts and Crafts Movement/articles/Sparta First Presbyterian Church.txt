Sparta First Presbyterian Church is a historic Presbyterian church located at Groveland Station in Livingston County, New York. The building is a simple but sophisticated combination of Arts and Crafts principals and freely styled Tudor Gothic detailing executed with modern building materials.  It was constructed in 1915-1916 and is composed of a large principal gable block with a gabled wing.  It features a crenellated tower rising a full story above the ridgeline of the roofs.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.
