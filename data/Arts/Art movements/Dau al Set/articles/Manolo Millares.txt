Manolo Millares (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, 17 January 1926 – Madrid, 14 August 1972) was a Spanish painter. Self-taught as an artist, Millares was introduced to Surrealism in 1948. In 1953, he moved to Madrid and became an abstract painter. In 1957, Millares along with other artists like Antonio Saura, Rafael Canogar or Manuel Rivera founded the avant-garde group El Paso (The Step) in Madrid. After showing his work in San Pablo in 1957, Millares' work was introduced to the United States in 1958.  He attained an international reputation by the early 1960s, and had a solo show at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York in 1961.
