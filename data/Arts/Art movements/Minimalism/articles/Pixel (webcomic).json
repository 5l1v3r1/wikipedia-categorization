It is set in the aptly named \"pixel universe\", inhabited by <a href=\"/wiki/Pixel\" title=\"Pixel\">pixels</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Voxel\" title=\"Voxel\">voxels</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Vector_graphics\" title=\"Vector graphics\">vectors</a>, plasmas (a satire on the plasma screens used by <a href=\"/wiki/Apple_Inc.\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">Apple</a> computers), and <a href=\"/wiki/Polygon\" title=\"Polygon\">polygons</a>. The comic is known for its very literal sense of humor, and its constant breaks of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourth_wall\" title=\"Fourth wall\">fourth wall</a>. The text of the comic is written entirely in upper case with very little punctuation other than the occasional hyphen or exclamation point. Each comic comes with a short note, usually split into three lines at seemingly arbitrary points. These are also written in capitals with no punctuation, and usually explain or expand upon the strip.\n</p><p>Material from <i>Pixel</i> is included in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Attitude:_The_New_Subversive_Cartoonists\" title=\"Attitude: The New Subversive Cartoonists\">Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists</a></i>.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Development\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Development</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Cast\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Cast</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Pixels\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pixels</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Voxels\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Voxels</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Polygons\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Polygons</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Vectors\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Vectors</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Plasmas\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Plasmas</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development\">Development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Chris Dlugosz initially started <i>Pixel</i> in 2002 as a response to <a href=\"/wiki/Sprite_comics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sprite comics\">sprite comics</a>, which were proliferating at the time. In an interview in 2006, Dlugosz stated that he began posting <i>Pixel</i> as a \"casual gag\" to make fun of the sprite comic genre, and that the logistics of his <i>Pixel</i> universe expanded over time. Dlugosz was primarily inspired by <i><a href=\"/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes\" title=\"Calvin and Hobbes\">Calvin and Hobbes</a></i>, which he described as \"the sole reason [he] was not afraid to occasionally get rhetorical or philosophical in some of [his] own strips.\" Dlugosz was introduced to the webcomic format by <i><a href=\"/wiki/Penny_Arcade\" title=\"Penny Arcade\">Penny Arcade</a></i>, which he also listed as an influence. His visual style, however, is entirely different, as the world of <i>Pixel</i> is populated with anthropomorphic geometric shapes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Attitude_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Attitude-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When creating a <i>Pixel</i> strip, Dlugosz always starts with the script, as he finds that text has \"the annoying tendency to cover up much of your art.\" Meanwhile, he describes \"interesting visual effects\" as a \"side hobby\" of his. Dlugosz has a text file on his computer in which he keeps a list of ideas for new strips, though he noted that jokes that hit him spontaneously often make for better strips than those he thought about for longer periods of time. Dlugosz uses a template file, consisting of a blue block and a red block (pixels) standing in front of a green horizon and blue sky. He then uses a <a href=\"/wiki/Random_number_generator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Random number generator\">random number generator</a> in order to produce two <a href=\"/wiki/Web_colors\" title=\"Web colors\">web colors</a> with which to color in the two pixels, before entering the text and other effects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Attitude_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Attitude-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cast\">Cast</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Cast\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pixels\">Pixels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Pixels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Pixels are the main focus of the strip. They're square, genderless and monochromatic. Every pixel is of a different <a href=\"/wiki/24-bit\" title=\"24-bit\">24-bit</a> colour, and there is a pixel of every colour, so there are exactly 16,777,216 of them at any given time. A pixel's first name is his colour value in hexadecimal (e.g. 0000FF), and his second name is this same value in binary (e.g.. 000000000000000011111111). Although pixels can die, they are instantly reborn as infants, usually to a parent of a similar colour. There is no pregnancy, and any pixel can give birth at any moment. Birth is painless, and merely involves an infant appearing near his parent. Infants are smaller than adult pixels, with rounded corners which quickly sharpen.\n</p><p>Pixels do not have limbs or faces, but they can manipulate objects by mild telekinesis. Some of them wear clothes, but usually this is limited to a tie, collar and shirt pocket (without a shirt).\n</p><p>Although there are only 2<sup>24</sup> of them, pixels can create composite images by screencapping themselves (that is, creating non-living temporary duplicates).\n</p><p>In one minor <a href=\"/wiki/Story_arc\" title=\"Story arc\">story arc</a>, some pixels managed to achieve transparency (became <a href=\"/wiki/32-bit\" title=\"32-bit\">32-bit</a>). As of strip No. 265, this ability still exists.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Voxels\">Voxels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Voxels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A voxel is the three-dimensional equivalent of a pixel, being cubic and able to move in the Z-axis. Their births differ from those of the pixels in that the child grows inside the parent until they are of equal size, at which point the parent dies and another voxel becomes pregnant with the recently deceased.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Polygons\">Polygons</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Polygons\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Polygons are uniformly triangular, and although they are two-dimensional, they have the ability to <a href=\"/wiki/Rotation\" title=\"Rotation\">rotate</a> in three dimensions. They are constantly taking part in jousting matches, in which two polygons attempt to bisect each other. This is also their means of procreation, as the two parts of the loser each become an infant polygon. Unlike the other races, they are silent. Their means of communication is via \"saying\" images to one another. Unlike the images \"said\" by voxels, their word-images are well-drawn and well-defined.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vectors\">Vectors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Vectors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Vectors in the pixel universe aren't vectors per se; they are <a href=\"/wiki/Quadrilateral\" title=\"Quadrilateral\">quadrilaterals</a> described by vectors. Like pixels, they are limited to two dimensions. In the comic, vectors are displayed with control boxes and a central anchor point similar to those used in graphics editors such as <a href=\"/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop\" title=\"Adobe Photoshop\">Photoshop</a>. Each one is capable of changing these vectors at whim, allowing them to shape-shift and fly. They are belligerent and not very bright. Vectors do not have a known means of procreation, aside from Vectorball, which appears similar to basketball. They have also been noted to have the ability to shrink to microscopic size. It is not known what consequences this development will bring.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plasmas\">Plasmas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Plasmas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Plasmas are similar to pixels in size, shape, and reproductivity, although their corners are rounded like those of an infant. Actual infants are spherical. They use blank DVDs for many things, including coffee mugs. They represent the <a href=\"/wiki/Apple_Macintosh\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Apple Macintosh\">Mac</a> user from the perspective of the PC user.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pixel_(webcomic)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Pixel</i> went on hiatus in 2007 from May 13 until November 9, when he altered the design and layout of the website itself.
