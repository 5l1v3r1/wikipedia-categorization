Untitled is a sculpture created by American artist Donald Judd in 1967, located at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. It consists of a brass bar over a series of five steel boxes in Judd's signature cadmium red.  The long brass bar is both hollow and open at both ends. The red boxes increase geometrically in size from right to left, with the fifth box being sixteen times the length of the first. Conversely, the voids between the boxes decrease geometrically, the leftmost space being one quarter the size of the rightmost. The actual fabrication was performed by the Bernstein Brothers firm.  Untitled is part of Judd's progression series.  By 1967, Judd was a leader of the Minimalism movement, albeit a reluctant one. He argued that the strict geometry of pieces like Untitled did not render them coldly mathematical or devoid of meaning, but rather focused attention on the materials themselves.  His end goal was to remove all signs of the artist from the work, by employing such a strict formula and having it painstakingly crafted in an industrial shop, allowing the viewer to focus on the clean, sharp forms, simply "one thing after another".  Untitled was acquired by the IMA in 1992 with the assistance of the Morris Goodman Sculpture Fund and the Alliance of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. It is currently on display in the Anna S. and James P. White Gallery. It has the acquisition number 1992.362.
