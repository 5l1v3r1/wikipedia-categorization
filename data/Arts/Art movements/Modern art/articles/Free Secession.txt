The Free Secession (German: Freie Secession) was an association of modern artists in Berlin organizing joint exhibitions 1914â€“1923.  The Free Secession was formed after 42 members in late 1913 left the Berlin Secession, which thereby lost a majority of its members and nearly all of its most prominent artists.   Max Liebermann, a former co-founder and leader of the Berlin Secession was made honorary president of the Free Secession.
