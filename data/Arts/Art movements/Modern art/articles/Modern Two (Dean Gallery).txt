  Modern Two, formerly the Dean Gallery, in Edinburgh, is one of Scotland’s national art galleries. It is part of the National Galleries of Scotland. Since its opening it has housed the Paolozzi Gift, a collection of his works given to the National Gallery of Modern Art in 1994 by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi. It contains a large collection of Dada and Surrealist art and literature, much of which was given by Gabrielle Keiller. It is also used for temporary exhibitions. The Dean Gallery is twinned with the National Gallery of Modern Art which lies on the opposite side of Belford Road. The building was built as a replacement for the Orphan Hospital at Shakespeare Square (formerly at the east end of Princes Street).  The building's high Baroque grandeur was designed to serve as the Dean Orphanage. It was designed by Thomas Hamilton in 1831 and took three years to build. The upper towers over the staircases contain chimneys and contribute to the Edinburgh skyline in the west of the city. The clock above the entrance comes from the 1764 demolition of the Netherbow Port on the Royal Mile, which formerly separated the High Street from the Canongate.  The building served as the Dean Education Centre for many decades before conversion to a gallery. The plot of allotment gardens at the main entrance dates from 1940 when many school grounds were used for such purposes. The gallery was opened in 1999, opposite the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which is its sister gallery. In 2011 the buildings were renamed Modern Art Two and Modern Art One respectively. The conversion of the building into a gallery was designed by the architect, Terry Farrell.  A selection of works are available to view online. A free shuttle bus service links the gallery to the city centre galleries. A small gate on the rear east side of the car park gives access to the Dean Cemetery.
