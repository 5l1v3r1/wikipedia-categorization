The Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij (Dutch drawing society) was an international art society founded in 1876 in The Hague whose purpose was to promote watercolor painting as an art in itself, which until then had been known only as a sketching technique. In 1855 the Société Belge des Aquarellistes was established in Brussels and one of the founders was Willem Roelofs. The society organized exhibitions of Belgian watercolor painters. After a few years members of the Hague School were invited to attend. Soon after this the Dutch sister society was founded (on 31 January 1876). The founders were: Bernardus Johannes Blommers,  Johannes Bosboom, Jozef Israëls, Jacob Maris, Willem Maris, Anton Mauve, Hendrik Willem Mesdag, Philip Sadée, Kate Bisschop-Swift, Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Johannes Stortenbeker.  The society enjoyed international acclaim and had honorary members living outside the Netherlands. Among the honorary members were several artists who visited the Netherlands, such as: Paul Jean Clays,  Paul Joseph Constantin Gabriël, Charles Hermans, Edouard Huberti,  Jean Baptiste Madou,  Charles Rochussen and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. The German painter Max Liebermann was a summer resident, as was Hubert von Herkomer  from Londen. Mose Bianchi  from Milan and Vincenzo Cabianca  from Rome, were also members. Among the Dutch members were: David Adolph Constant Artz,  Albert Neuhuys, Elchanon Verveer,  Sina van Houten and Willem Bastiaan Tholen.
