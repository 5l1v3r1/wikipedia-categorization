The Gruppo dei Sei or the Sei di Torino is a young group of painters emerging from the mentorship of the painter of the painter Felice Casorati in Turin, and who exhibited together for 2-3 years starting in 1929. They had individual styles, but were linked by the influence of Parisian post-impressionism and fauvism, including the works of Modigliani, and an initially anti-fascist ideology. In this latter manner, they seem to be in current departing from the Novecento Italiano and perhaps Futurism. The six included: The association of these painters was promoted by the art critics Edoardo Persico and Lionello Venturi, and the patronage of the wealthy industrialist and contemporary art collector Riccardo Gualino (1879-1964). Gualino and his wife also had purchased a theater in Turin sponsoring avante garde music, dance, and plays. The six first exhibited in 1929 at the galleria Guglielmi of Turin, later in Genoa, and in November at the galleria Bardi of Milan. But pressures, both personal, economic and political split the group apart. The patronage of Gualino disappeared with his economic failures in 1929, and subsequent confinement under house arrest by the Mussolini government. Levi, Menzio, and Pulucci continued to exhibit together until 1935.   Lionello Venturi Carlo Levi in his studio Francesco Menzio in his studio
