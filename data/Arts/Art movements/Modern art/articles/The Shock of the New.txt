 The Shock of the New is a 1980 documentary television series written and presented by Robert Hughes produced by the BBC in association with Time-Life Films and produced by Lorna Pegram.  It was broadcast by the BBC in 1980 in the United Kingdom and by PBS in 1981 in the United States.   It addressed the development of modern art since the Impressionists and was accompanied by a book of the same name; its combination of insight, wit and accessibility are still widely praised. In 2004 Hughes created a one-hour update to The Shock of the New titled The NEW Shock of the New.  The series consisted of eight episodes each one hour long (58 min approx).  It was re-broadcast on PBS in the United States. In the three cases, where PBS changed the titles, they are given in square brackets below. Quotations are spoken by Martin Jarvis. The book of the series was published in 1980 by the BBC under the title The Shock of the New: Art and the century of change.  It was republished in 1991 by Thames and Hudson.  The televised edition of The Shock of the New is posted on the internet   and is published as a set of DVDs.
