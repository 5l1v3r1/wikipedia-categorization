Cinéma du look (French: [sinema dy luk]) was a French film movement of the 1980s, analysed, for the first time, by French critic Raphaël Bassan in La Revue du Cinéma issue n° 448, May 1989,  in which he classified Luc Besson, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax as directors of "le look".  These directors were said to favor style over substance, spectacle over narrative.  It referred to films that had a slick, gorgeous visual style  and a focus on young, alienated characters who were said to represent the marginalized youth of François Mitterrand's France.  Themes that run through many of their films include doomed love affairs, young people more affiliated to peer groups than families, a cynical view of the police, and the use of scenes in the Paris Métro to symbolise an alternative, underground society.  The mixture of 'high' culture, such as the opera music of Diva and Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, and pop culture, for example the references to Batman in Subway, was another key feature.  French filmmakers were inspired by New Hollywood films (most notably Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart and Rumble Fish), late Fassbinder films (Lola), as well as television commercials, music videos, and fashion photography.
