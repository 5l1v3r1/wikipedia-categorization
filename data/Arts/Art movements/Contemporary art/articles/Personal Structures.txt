Personal Structures is an international contemporary art platform, which generates the possibility for artists and art historians to discuss philosophical concepts in art. Personal Structures was initiated in 2003 by the artist Rene Rietmeyer. At first, the platform took shape in the form of exhibitions. Later on, in 2005, symposia were added as means for expressing thought. The first Personal Structures symposium was held at the branch of Ludwig Museum in Koblenz, Germany. Personal Structures developed in the years after. In 2007 and 2008 a symposium series was organised about the concepts time, space and existence. Artists who have been involved in Personal Structures are, amongst others, Joseph Kosuth, Wolfgang Laib, Roman Opa≈Çka, and Lawrence Weiner.
