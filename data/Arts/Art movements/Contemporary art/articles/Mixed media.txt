In visual art, mixed media is an artwork in which more than one medium or material has been employed. Assemblages and collages are two common examples of art using different medias that will make use of different materials including cloth, paper, and/or wood.   When an artist is doing painting or photography work using mixed media, care should be taken to allow enough drying time between layers, to ensure the final work will have structural integrity. If several different mixed medias are used with the artwork, it is important to choose a sturdy foundation upon which the different media layers are imposed.  Many artistic effects can be achieved by using mixed media. Found objects can be used in conjunction with traditional artist media to attain a wide range of self-expression.  Some children's picture books also use mixed media illustrations. For example, 's Nachts by  Wolf Erlbruch. Mixed media art, a visual art, is distinguished from multimedia art which combines visual art with non-visual elements, such as recorded sound, literature, drama, dance, motion graphics, music, or interactivity.
