Art on Paper was a bi-monthly art magazine published from 1996 to 2009. The magazine's editorial scope included limited-edition prints and artists' books, drawings, photographs, and ephemera. The magazine was founded in New York City in 1970 as The Print Collectors Newsletter  by Paul Cummings,  with Judith Goldman as editor. Within a year, Cummings sold it to Jacqueline Brody, who continued to publish it until 1996. From the start, the title The Print Collectors Newsletter, was a misnomer. The newsletter covered artists' prints from the Renaissance to the present, but it also published on artists' books, multiples, ephemera and photography. An issue typically included a feature story or interview, industry news, reviews of recently released prints or photographs, auction reports, and book reviews. Contributors included Holland Cotter, Richard S. Field, Nancy Princenthal, Susan Tallman, Larry Qualls and others. In 1996, Gabriella Fanning, the former editor of the art magazine Contemporanea, purchased The Print Collectors Newsletter. She changed the name to On Paper, converted it to a journal format and expanded its coverage to include drawings. In 1998, she changed its title and format again, this time to a full-color glossy magazine titled Art on Paper. Faye Hirsch, later Senior Editor at Art in America, acted as Editor-in-Chief. Fanning sold the title in 2004 to Darte Publishing LLC, a company established by the magazine's then editor, Peter Nesbett, and two partners. Art on Paper ceased publication in December 2009.  Nesbett resigned under a cloud of mystery. Art in Print, the bimonthly journal on artists' prints that began publication in 2011, was founded as a not-for-profit organization and has no formal relationship to Art on Paper, though many of the same writers contribute.
