The Ultra-Lettrist movement was an art form developed by Jean-Louis Brau, Gil J Wolman, and François Dufrêne, in the 1950s, when they split from Isidore Isou's Lettrism.  They issued a periodical called grammeS: Review of the Ultra-Lettriste Group, which ran for seven issues between 1957 and 1961. They used their journal to publish hypergraphics  which included exchanges and discussions with the Lettrists' Poésie Nouvelle and the Situationist International. Some Ultra-Lettrists went on to form the Nouveau réalisme school while others joined the Situationist International.
