The Boros Collection is a private collection of contemporary art by Karen and Christian Boros, which has been on display since 2008 in a World War II era bunker (called the Reichsbahnbunker) in Berlin, Germany  . The collection comprises artworks in the mediums of sculpture, photography and painting by international contemporary artists. The works are installed on five floors of the bunker, which the architect Jens Casper transformed into a compendium of individual rooms that interconnect on multiple floors . While some rooms were transformed into classic white cube spaces, others still bare traces of the bunker’s lineage when it was used as a prison, storage facility and techno club . Each exhibition in the bunker additionally includes site-specific works that refer to and interact with the various interior spaces and their history. The collection is accessible to the public from Thursdays through Sundays only in the form of guided tours via prior application on the website of the collection. The current collection, “Boros Collection / Bunker Berlin #3” opened in May 2017 and presents recently acquired works as well as pieces from the 1990s and 2000s. The second exhibition was visited by over 200,000 guests.  The first exhibition was visited by over 120,000 guests.
