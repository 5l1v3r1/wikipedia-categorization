Alma Siedhoff-Buscher (1899–1944) was a German designer. She trained in crafts at the Reimann School and the Museum of Decorative Arts in Berlin.  In 1922 she joined the Bauhaus and initially attended the introductory course taught by Johannes Itten and classes by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. She was subsequently accepted to the weaving workshop, but in 1923, under the guidance of Georg Muche and Josef Hartwig, Siedhoff-Buscher switched to the wood sculpture workshop. In conjunction with the major Bauhaus exhibition of 1923, she designed the furnishings of the children’s room in the Haus Am Horn as well as a puppet theater and children’s toys. In 1924 her furniture designs and toys were displayed at the exhibition for the conference of professional organization for kindergarten teachers, youth leaders, and day-care providers. Siedhoff-Buscher moved with the Bauhaus to Dessau in 1925 and continued to work there after graduation. In 1927, her last year in Dessau, she designed coloring books and cut-out kits for the publisher Verlag Otto Maier Ravensburg. Thereafter she traveled with her husband, who was an actor and had two children. Siedhoff-Buscher was the victim of a bombing raid in Buchschlag near Frankfurt am Main.     This article incorporates text from a free content work.
