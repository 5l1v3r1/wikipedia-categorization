The Max-Liebling House is an architecturally significant, Bauhaus-style modernist building in Tel Aviv, Israel. Located at 29 Idelson Street, it was designed by architect Dov Karmi and built in 1936.   The house is notable for being the first building in Israel to use elongated recessed balconies, an adaptation of Le Corbusier's strip windows.   Horizontality is emphasized by the narrow intervals between the building's parapet and overhang; not only does this have the design impact of  emphasizing the horizontal style, it has the practical effect of screening out the heat of the Mediterranean sun.   The timbered pergola, a design element frequently seen in Jerusalem, is unusual in Tel Aviv.  In 2014 the Max-Liebling House was one of the first 10 modernist buildings to receive restoration grants under the Getty Foundation's new "Keeping It Modern" initiative.   In 2015 the German government funded the restoration of the House as a Bauhaus museum from which the restoration and preservation of Tel Aviv's notable Bauhaus buildings could be planned and overseen.    The restored building is expected to reopen as an additional Bauhaus museum.    Tel Aviv's White City district, a designate World Heritage Site, is the largest collection of German Bauhaus-style buildings found anywhere in the world.
