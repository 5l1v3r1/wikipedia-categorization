The Bauhaus-Museum is a museum dedicated to the architectural style of Bauhaus. Since 1995 it has been housed in a former coach house on Theaterplatz rebuilt by Clemens Wenzeslaus Coudray. It includes ruins of the Weimarer Zeughaus or arsenal.  A new Bauhaus Museum by Heike Hanada is scheduled to open in 2019. It displays about 250 works by teachers and students of the Bauhaus school (1919-1933), including seminal works by Walter Gropius, Johannes Itten, Lyonel Feininger and Marcel Breuer, along with several works from the movement's precursor, the 1907 Henry van de Velde School.
