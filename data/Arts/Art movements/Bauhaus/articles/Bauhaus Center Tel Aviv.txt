Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv is an organization dedicated to creating a platform for Bauhaus architecture and design in the city of Tel Aviv, Israel. Buildings designed in the International Style, commonly known as Bauhaus, comprise most of the center of Tel Aviv known as The White City. The vision behind the Center is to raise awareness of the Bauhaus heritage and be part of the cultural and artistic development in Tel Aviv. The Bauhaus Center was founded by Asher Ben Shmuel, Micha Gross and Shlomit Gross in 2000. It is located at 77 Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv, Israel. The founders recognized the need to document the history and patrimony of the Bauhaus architecture in Tel Aviv. They established the Center in order to increase people's awareness of this heritage, and to expose the Bauhaus as a style that crosses boundaries between different art media. The Center has been collaborating closely with the Israel National Commission for UNESCO since the designation of Tel Aviv as a World Heritage Site in 2003.  The Center also cooperates with the Municipality of Tel Aviv and several educational institutions, galleries, museums and associations of engineering and architecture. The center was formerly located at 99 Dizengoff St. as well as 155 Dizengoff St.
