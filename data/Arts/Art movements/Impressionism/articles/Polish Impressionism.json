The movement is characterized by the exposition of light in its changing stages, open composition and visualization. Artists worked mainly in the outdoor \u2013 en plein air, the most important thing being to emphasize vivid colors from everyday life. Although impressionism brought freshness and a completely new perspective of the world, it was received with skepticism at first. Contrary to expectations it received the attention of artists and soon won recognition all around the world. Within a short period of time it came also to <a href=\"/wiki/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_artists\">Notable artists</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Polish_Impressionism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Notable artists\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Olga_Boznanska\">Olga Boznanska</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Polish_Impressionism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Olga Boznanska\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first Polish artist who represented impressionism was <a href=\"/wiki/Olga_Boznanska\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Olga Boznanska\">Olga Boznanska</a> (born on 15 April 1865 in <a href=\"/wiki/Krakow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Krakow\">Krakow</a>, died on 26 October 1940 in Paris), who studied painting in her childhood.
