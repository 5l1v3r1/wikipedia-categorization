Idea art, is an art form in which small individual idea(s) and not the grand concept(s) or ideologies involved in the work take precedence over generic aesthetic, material and disciplinary concerns. Works of idea art may be in text, found object, 2d, 3d, moving images, sound, performance, digital, interactive media and/ or as installations. This method was fundamental to Turkish artist Genco Gulan's definition of idea art, one of the first to appear online.  In idea art the idea is the most important aspect of the art work. It may be start a project and/ or maybe attached to it later, after he or she finishes the production. In this way, the artist not only works like and architect or an engineer, as in the case of conceptual art but also works like a curator and/ or an art writer. Idea art should not be confused with idealism or in other words, perfectualism. Individual ideas for art should not be perfect or beautiful but appropriate.
