Indigenous Futurisms is a movement consisting of art, literature, comics, games, and other forms of media which express Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present in the context of science fiction and related sub-genres. Such perspectives may reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional stories, historical or contemporary politics or other cultural realities.  Like Afrofuturism, Indigenous futurism encapsulates multiple modes of art making from literature to visual arts, fashion and music.  The term was coined by Grace Dillon,  Professor in the Indigenous Nations Studies Program at Portland State University.  Indigenous Futurisms critiques the historization of Indigenous people which is used to separate from them the contemporary world while challenging notions of what constitutes advanced technology  . Prominent artists working within the field of Indigenous futurism include Skawennati, a Mohawk multi-media artist best known for her project TimeTravellerâ„¢, a nine-episode machinima series that uses science fiction to examine First nations histories,  Grace Dillon, who is editor of Walking the Clouds: An Anthology of Indigenous Science Fiction,  Stephen Graham Jones, a Blackfeet Native American author, and Wendy Red Star, a Native American contemporary multimedia artist.  Additionally, Lou Catherine Cornum is a writer and scholar currently working in the field of Indigenous futurism.
