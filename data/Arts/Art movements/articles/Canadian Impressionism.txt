Canadian Impressionism is a subclass of Impressionist art influenced from French Impressionism. Guy Wildenstein of the Wildenstein Institute in Paris states in the foreword of A.K. Prakash's Impressionism in Canada: A Journey of Rediscovery that Canadian impressionism is "the Canadian artists who gleaned much from the French but, in their improvisations, managed to transmute what they learned into an art reflecting the aesthetic concerns of their compatriots and the times in which they lived and worked".  The early Canadian Impressionist painters belong into the "Group of who?" as coined by James Adams of The Globe and Mail.  Canada's first affair with Impressionism occurred in 1892 in Montreal at W. Scott & Sons' premises. Eight paintings were exhibited including works of Monet, Renoir, Pissarro and Sisley.  Canadian Impressionism was first recognized as a historical movement in Canadian Art in 1950.  Prakash acknowledges in his book a few notable collectors of Canadian Impressionist art.
