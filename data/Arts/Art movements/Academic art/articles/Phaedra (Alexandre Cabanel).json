Oil on canvas, 194 x 286 cm. Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier.</div></div></div>\n<p><i><b>Phaedra</b></i> is a later work of <a href=\"/wiki/Alexandre_Cabanel\" title=\"Alexandre Cabanel\">Alexandre Cabanel</a>, a French <a href=\"/wiki/Academic_painter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Academic painter\">academic painter</a> working from the 1840s until his death in 1889. This work was exhibited in the <a href=\"/wiki/Salon_(Paris)\" title=\"Salon (Paris)\">Salon</a> of 1880 and later donated by Cabanel to the <a href=\"/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_Fabre\" title=\"Mus\u00e9e Fabre\">Mus\u00e9e Fabre</a>, located in his hometown of Montpellier, France. <i>Phaedra</i> is a large oil painting of a classical subject in literature, which can be attributed to Cabanel's studies in the Paris <a href=\"/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_Beaux-Arts\" title=\"\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts\">\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As Cabanel's painting career developed, he expanded his style to preserve the French Academy while appealing to his personal interests in literature, often depicting new perspectives in contradiction with tradition. Alexandre Cabanel's painting of <i>Phaedra</i> exemplifies his pull toward academic paintings of theatrical heroines in reference to the social happenings of late nineteenth-century France.\n</p><p>The painting depicts <a href=\"/wiki/Phaedra_(mythology)\" title=\"Phaedra (mythology)\">Phaedra</a> stretched out on her side in a lavishly decorated bed, one arm at supporting her head and one hanging off the edge fingering the expensive drapery. She stares out of the left side of the picture plane, her face dark and resolute, while her unkempt hair is splayed on the decorated pillow. Her pale nude body covered by a sheer white sheet contrasts with the deep red, black, and gold tones around her. Two ladies in waiting are on the right. One is standing, but crouched over slightly, and active. Her body is half out of the picture plane as she peers over at Phaedra, hands clasped as if silently imploring the woman to move. The second lady sits at Phaedra's bedside sleeping, eyes closed, head leaned back, as if resting from the exhaustion of some heavy emotion. The luxurious fabrics on the bed are scattered and slipping off, as if the bed hadn't been made for a while. On the floor sits an expensive fur rug, its golden tones reminiscent of the shield, helmet, and sword tied to a column before Phaedra's bed. The furniture and architecture are adorned with oriental designs, creating a foreign look of drama and wealth. The light source for the painting comes from outside of the picture plane on the left, contrasting with the dimly lit lantern in the background.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Technical_properties\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Technical properties</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Medium\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Medium</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Size\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Size</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Subject\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Subject</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Rome_and_theatricality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rome and theatricality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Elements_from_his_past_works\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Elements from his past works</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Portraiture\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Portraiture</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#The_Female_Nude\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Female Nude</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#What_the_critics_thought\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">What the critics thought</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Technical_properties\">Technical properties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phaedra_(Alexandre_Cabanel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Technical properties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Medium\">Medium</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phaedra_(Alexandre_Cabanel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Medium\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Cabanel used the <a href=\"/wiki/Oil_painting\" title=\"Oil painting\">oil painting</a> technique, which creates a luminosity akin to the wealth and luxury of the subject, due to the shiny quality of the medium.

This painting type was heavily used and venerated by the traditional group of academic painters, of which Cabanel was a part. However, in Cabanel's time, subjects from literature and mythology were also used for this painting type, as exemplified in <i>Phaedra</i>. Therefore, Cabanel, in alignment with his time, is taking an element of the traditional style and applying it to an alternate intelligent subject matter.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subject\">Subject</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phaedra_(Alexandre_Cabanel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Subject\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The subject of the work was brought on by Cabanel's affiliation with literature, an infatuation that began with the Paris \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Cabanel spent time at the school as a student and teacher, where he was exposed to classical works of literature, as well as important French writers of the past centuries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Cabanel would have studied Euripides' <a href=\"/wiki/Hippolytus_(play)\" title=\"Hippolytus (play)\">Hippolytus</a>, written in 429 BCE, a play that details Phaedra's love and betrayal of her stepson, Hippolytus, who denies his stepmother's love. In her sorrow, Phaedra hangs herself, but leaves a suicide note of sorts calling Hippolytus her seducer. Theseus, her husband, banishes and ultimately kills his son, although the truth is revealed and their relationship reconciled before Hippolytus finally dies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> However, a more recent version of the subject had been written by <a href=\"/wiki/Ph%C3%A8dre\" title=\"Ph\u00e8dre\">Racine</a> in 1677, and was performed and celebrated during Cabanel's life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Sylvain Amic suggests that, because of the contemporary attention to the play, Cabanel was likely trying to revive an interest in antiquity among the rapidly progressing art that rejected traditional subjects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In fact, the Salon program's description of Phaedra contained an excerpt from Euripides' classical play: \u201cConsumed with love's sorrow, Phaedra has locked herself in her palace. A delicate veil covers her head. This is the third day she has gone without food as she is intent on ending her wretched existence.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This reference to antiquity was Cabanel's way of stating his own intelligence, while attempting to reach a larger group with the academic reminder of the subject's origins in antiquity. This excerpt also places Cabanel's <i>Phaedra</i> in a weakened and emotional moment, showing the artist's innovation in contrast to the often heroic and instructive works of the Academy. Further, Cabanel tended to progress his works according to people's tastes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> While opposed to the anti-academic modes of painting, Cabanel was able to accept certain changes within the painting world, attempting to use the progression as a way of circling contemporary thoughts back to the classical subjects accepted by the Academy. <i>Phaedra</i> can be understood as another way that the artist tried to assimilate his own artistic ideals with a developing artistic age.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rome_and_theatricality\">Rome and theatricality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phaedra_(Alexandre_Cabanel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Rome and theatricality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This work relays a certain level of theatricality, which can definitely be attributed to the main source of the work being a play, but also to the result of Cabanel's time spent painting in Italy, influencing his decorative works commissions. Cabanel received the <a href=\"/wiki/Prix_de_Rome\" title=\"Prix de Rome\">Prix de Rome</a> award for his accomplishments in history painting in 1845.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> He spent the next five years in Rome, absorbing the dramatic <a href=\"/wiki/Renaissance\" title=\"Renaissance\">Renaissance</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Baroque\" title=\"Baroque\">Baroque</a> works that permeate the city. Upon his return to Paris, Cabanel was commissioned to help decorate the Salon des Cariatides in the <a href=\"/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_de_Ville,_Paris\" title=\"H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris\">H\u00f4tel de Ville</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The final work was destroyed, but his cartoons show influences of Michelangelo's heroic and thoughtful figures of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling\" title=\"Sistine Chapel ceiling\">Sistine Chapel ceiling</a>, Raphael's introspective philosophers and mathematicians of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/School_of_Athens\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School of Athens\">School of Athens</a></i>, and the theatrical compositions and movement of Annibale Carracci's <a href=\"/wiki/Farnese_Gallery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Farnese Gallery\">Farnese Gallery</a> decorations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> These cartoons are evidence of the effect that Roman works of the past had on Cabanel. The heroic figures are absent from <i>Phaedra</i>, but there is an air of brooding tension and drama that can reasonably be attributed to his influence by the Renaissance and Baroque masters.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Elements_from_his_past_works\">Elements from his past works</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phaedra_(Alexandre_Cabanel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Elements from his past works\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cabanel incorporates various elements of his earlier works into <i>Phaedra</i>, namely the aforementioned dramatic literature (see <b>Subject</b>), portraiture, and the female nude.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Portraiture\">Portraiture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phaedra_(Alexandre_Cabanel)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Portraiture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Cabanel,_Alexandre_-_Olivia_Peyton_Murray_Cutting_-_1887.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Cabanel%2C_Alexandre_-_Olivia_Peyton_Murray_Cutting_-_1887.png/220px-Cabanel%2C_Alexandre_-_Olivia_Peyton_Murray_Cutting_-_1887.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"297\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Cabanel%2C_Alexandre_-_Olivia_Peyton_Murray_Cutting_-_1887.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"222\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Cabanel,_Alexandre_-_Olivia_Peyton_Murray_Cutting_-_1887.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Alexandre Cabanel, <i>Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting</i>, 1887.

These elements can all be seen in <i>Phaedra</i> in the dark background illuminating her pale body, the luscious fabrics that shine and ripple, and the opulent luxury of her bedchamber's adornments.

This work shows a reclining female nude with her hands above her head, harkening back to Titian's <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Bacchanal_of_the_Andrians\" title=\"The Bacchanal of the Andrians\">Bacchanal of the Andrians</a></i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Her sexualized pose emphasizes the erotic nature of Venus, while her overlapped legs suggest a soft modesty.

Critics called the work lackluster and confusing. This was likely due to the odd mixture of Cabanel's wish to please the public while retaining the academic style and adding a personal, unique perspective. Academic critics thought Cabanel's portrayal of the classical <i>Phaedra</i> in a weak state was unbefitting, and his composition boring, especially in contrast to the luxurious setting.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> The avant-gardists completely rejected the academic style as a part of their struggle for artistic progression. Further, his public was either strictly academic or progressive, so Cabanel's in-between style appeared flat and uninteresting to his contemporaries. Even after his death in 1889, later critics looked back on Cabanel's works with disdain. <a href=\"/wiki/Camille_Mauclair\" title=\"Camille Mauclair\">Camille Mauclair</a> in <i>The Great French Painters</i> described other of Cabanel's works from the Salon of 1880 as \u201cunpleasant,\u201d \u201cwithout life or emotion,\u201d and \u201cpictures that do not take their proper place in the building.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> However, a modern audience can view the work with a different perspective, not bound by the French Academy or the need to expressly think in terms of the avant-garde.  Cabanel's <i>Phaedra</i> can be seen as a culmination of the artist's practices and experiences melding together as a retrospective of his past, while struggling to retain a foothold in a fast-pace art world. Now, the richness of painting can be appreciated as it appears from an expert hand, finding the beauty in the \u201cunpleasant\u201d and emotion in the mundane, asserting, finally, a \u201cproper place.\u201d\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
