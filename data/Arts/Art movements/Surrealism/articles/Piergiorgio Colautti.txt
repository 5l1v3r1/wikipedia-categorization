 Piergiorgio Colautti (born 16 October 1934, Rome, Kingdom of Italy) is modern Italian painter and sculptor, who lives and works in Rome. He is known for his own distinctive style, sometimes labelled "Hyperfuturism", in which figurative elements are enmeshed and submerged by symbols reflecting a cold and modern technological world.  Piergiorgio (Pio Giorgio) Colautti was born in the family of sculptor. When the Second World War began, he moved to Veneto where he attended school of design, worked and socialized with the greatest Venetian painters. His works were first introduced to public as part of the exhibitions in Pordenone, Venice and Mestre. Then he took part in exhibitions held in Ancona and Macerata, where he moved in 1955. In 1958, Colautti returned to Rome where he attended Rome's School of Ornamental Art in Via San Giacomo. At the same time, along with other artists, Colautti presented his works in the exposition of Via Margutta.  In Rome his talent was recognized by Alberto Ziveri, who was his tutor and mentor during 5 years. It was Ziveri who pushed Piergiorgio towards the idea of personal exhibition. His first personal exhibition was held in 1958 at "La Scaletta" art gallery, where the greatest celebrities of the "Roman school" had made their first entry "into society".  Colautti has exhibited in France, USA, Italy, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, etc. Besides paintings, Colautti practices frescoes, wall paintings, lithography and sculptures. Also, being inspired by the works of his famous grandfather, Arturo Colautti, Piergiorgio follows the journalistic path. His articles about the rigors of the professional artist's life were and are still being published by "Inciucio", a low-budget Italian version of People Magazine.  In addition, in 1982 his poetry was published in the collection of poems titled "L'altra alternativa"   His works are in many public and private collections in Italy and abroad.
