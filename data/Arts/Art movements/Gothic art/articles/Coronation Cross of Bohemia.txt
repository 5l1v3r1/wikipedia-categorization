The Coronation Cross of Bohemia or the Gold Reliquary Cross is the most precious object of the Treasury of the St Vitus Cathedral in Prague.  It is usually exhibited together with the Czech (Bohemian) Coronation Jewels and is sometimes considered to be part of them.  It is a gold reliquary in shape of a cross, which was created to contain the most valuable relics of the Czech Kingdom. The cross was made by order of Charles IV, probably around 1354.  The Reliquary Cross was not originally part of the St Vitus Treasury, but belonged to the Treasury of Karlštejn Castle.  Since 1645 it has been permanently in Prague and became part of the St. Vitus Treasury. The cross was used during the coronations of Bohemian kings in St Vitus Cathedral, although it was not originally made for this purpose.  The cross is made of gold plates by court goldsmiths. The entire front is covered with a rock crystal plate that allows one to see the relics of the Crucifixion of Christ: the wood from the Holy Cross, thorns and a part of the sponge, rope and a nail. The sides of the cross are lined with sapphires that are set in such a way so that light could penetrate them, thus creating a halo. The back of the cross is adorned with engraved gem cameos with beautiful reliefs that date from Antiquity to the 12th century and cover small compartments for other precious relics. In the middle of the back of the cross, there is a little rock crystal window with another part of the wood from Christ’s cross.
