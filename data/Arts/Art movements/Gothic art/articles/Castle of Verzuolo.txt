The Castle of Verzuolo (Italian: Castello di Verzuolo) is a medieval castle in the Piedmont region of Italy, near Verzuolo, Province of Cuneo.  It is located around 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the city of Saluzzo and 84 kilometres (52 mi) from Turin.  The castle was originally built in the 11th century and was modified in its original structure by order of Frederick II in 1377.  The successors of Frederick II continued modifying the structure of the building, turning it into the main fortress of the Marquisate of Saluzzo.  In 1528, Giovanni Ludovico, Marquess of Saluzzo, was imprisoned in the castle.  In 1600 the castle facade was renovated, changing its aspect from that of a military fortress to that of a luxury mansion, and it has since been used as a summer residence of illustrious personalities, including Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and Giambattista Bodoni.  On 18 June 1916, valuable documents referring to the history of Piedmont were lost in the collapse of one of the castle's two towers.
