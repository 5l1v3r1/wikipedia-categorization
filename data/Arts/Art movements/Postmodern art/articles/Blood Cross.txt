Blood Cross is one of American photographer Andres Serrano's early religious-themed postmodernist images, released in 1985, two years before the controversial Piss Christ was debuted. This image depicted a plexiglass cross filled with cow's blood; the cross leaked slightly making it appear as though it was bleeding.  It was exhibited along with Milk, Blood as part of Serrano's Fluids series.  In 1999 a print of Blood Cross fetched GBP 17,825 at auction, considerably higher than the original estimate of GBP 5,000 - GBP 8,000.
