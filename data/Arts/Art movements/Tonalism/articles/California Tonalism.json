During this era, the 1870s and 1880s, the French Barbizon school was at the height of its popularity in France and <a href=\"/wiki/French_Impressionism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"French Impressionism\">French Impressionism</a> was just beginning to emerge.  In the annual Salons, the American painters were exposed to the soft, simple, muted Barbizon landscapes of forests and ponds painted by artists like <a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Baptiste-Camille_Corot\" title=\"Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot\">Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot</a> (1796\u20131875), Rosseau and Diaz de la Pena.  They also saw the roughly painted peasant scenes by <a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Millet\" title=\"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet</a>, who lived in the tiny village of Barbizon, south of Paris.  Some of the Americans became enthusiastic acolytes of the French movement and actually moved to the Village of Barbizon.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The Bostonian <a href=\"/wiki/William_Morris_Hunt\" title=\"William Morris Hunt\">William Morris Hunt</a> (1824\u20131879) studied under Millet for several years after the conclusion of his Parisian studies.  Hunt was responsible for popularizing the works of the French painters with American patrons of the <a href=\"/wiki/Gilded_Age\" title=\"Gilded Age\">Gilded Age</a> and by the 1880s, their works were highly sought after and extremely valuable, from New York and Boston to San Francisco.  Hunt's student John La Farge (1835\u20131910)  also carried the Barbizon torch and developed his own, expressive versions of the French works.  Other painters who were similarly influenced were <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Wyant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alexander Wyant\">Alexander Wyant</a> (1836\u20131892), <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Ward_Ranger\" title=\"Henry Ward Ranger\">Henry Ward Ranger</a> (1858\u20131916), <a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_William_Tryon\" title=\"Dwight William Tryon\">Dwight William Tryon</a> (1849\u20131925) and <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Warren_Eaton\" title=\"Charles Warren Eaton\">Charles Warren Eaton</a> (1857\u20131937).  The established landscape painter <a href=\"/wiki/George_Inness\" title=\"George Inness\">George Inness</a>, who began his career when the <a href=\"/wiki/Hudson_River_School\" title=\"Hudson River School\">Hudson River School</a> was at its zenith, began to simplify his works and adopt what is now known as the Tonalist style, but then it could be referred to as <a href=\"/wiki/Quietism_(philosophy)\" title=\"Quietism (philosophy)\">Quietism</a>.  As American artists who had traveled or studied abroad brought the Barbizon style back with them, even homegrown talents were influenced.  By the 1890s, dozens of Eastern American painters, in the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Barbizon_school\" title=\"American Barbizon school\">American Barbizon school</a>, were painting muted, intimate landscapes with a narrow range of colors and some of them were even exhibiting works of French <a href=\"/wiki/Peasant\" title=\"Peasant\">peasants</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Whistler_influence\">Whistler influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Tonalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Whistler influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The other major influence on the development of American Tonalism was the expatriate American painter <a href=\"/wiki/James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler\" title=\"James Abbott McNeill Whistler\">James Abbott McNeill Whistler</a>.  Whistler was eccentric and unique  and there were a number of different influences that were responsible for his artistic development. Because he lived and studied in Paris, he was familiar with the Barbizon School and knew a number of the French artists, but he was also a major exponent of <a href=\"/wiki/Japonisme\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Japonisme\">Japonisme</a>, the European and American movement influenced by  Japanese art, especially their woodblock prints.  Whistler was a major influence on a number of younger American artists with whom he came into contact in Europe.  He advocated close color harmonies and simplified compositions, devoid of what he considered extraneous detail.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tonalism_in_Northern_California\">Tonalism in Northern California</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Tonalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Tonalism in Northern California\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At the same time the California landscape became domesticated and its cities and towns were becoming well-developed, a group of artists a generation younger than William Keith and Thomas Hill were emerging in <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_California\" title=\"Northern California\">Northern California</a>.  Their development coincided with the popularity of the French Barbizon School with collectors and the growth of an  American school of painters  who had been influenced by the French movement.  So, it seems natural that they turned to Tonalism to render and express their vision of the Northern California landscape, especially when the climate was often wet and misty.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tonalism_in_Southern_California\">Tonalism in Southern California</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Tonalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Tonalism in Southern California\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In spite of <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_California\" title=\"Southern California\">Southern California</a>'s intense sunlight, a number of the artists who worked in and around Los Angeles in the last decade of the 19th century and the first few years of the 20th century at least began their careers as Tonalists.  At that time, Barbizon paintings were extremely popular among collectors and many of the most successful American painters worked in Barbizon an influential style.  The wooded glades that artists in France and Northern California favored were not abundant in Southern California, so some of the painters such as Elmer Wachtel, <a href=\"/wiki/William_Lees_Judson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"William Lees Judson\">William Lees Judson</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charles_Ward_(painter)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Charles Ward (painter) (page does not exist)\">Charles Ward</a> painted the wooded arroyos in the Barbizon style.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  When <a href=\"/wiki/Granville_Redmond\" title=\"Granville Redmond\">Granville Redmond</a> returned to California from Europe, he settled in Southern California, rather than farther north where he had grown up.  The paintings that he painted in Southern California were not the poppy filled landscapes that most viewers are familiar with today, but very atmospheric landscapes or even scenes of sheep that show the influence of the Barbizon School.  It was only many years later that he would turn to poppy fields rendered in an almost <a href=\"/wiki/Pointillist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pointillist\">pointillist</a> technique.  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_Bond_Francisco&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"John Bond Francisco (page does not exist)\">John Bond Francisco</a>, painter and symphony violinist, also began is career with Tonalist landscapes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"California_Pictorialist_Photography\">California Pictorialist Photography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Tonalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: California Pictorialist Photography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There was also a strong Camera Pictorialist movement in California and many of these photographers worked in a Tonalist manner, shooting and developing gauzy photographs of figures or landscapes or even figures in the landscape with a soft focus and absence of dramatic contrast. The aim of the early <a href=\"/wiki/Pictorialist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pictorialist\">Pictorialists</a> (a term that came into wide use about the turn of the 20th century) was for their photography to emulate painting and etching and Camera <a href=\"/wiki/Pictorialism\" title=\"Pictorialism\">Pictorialism</a> developed in parallel with Tonalist painting. In fact, one of the most famous  figures in the Eastern Pictorialst movement was <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Steichen\" title=\"Edward Steichen\">Edward Steichen</a>, who was both an artist and a photographer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  Two of the California Pictorialist photographers <a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Matson\" title=\"Victor Matson\">Victor Matson</a> (1895\u20131972) and Otis Williams (1888\u20131962), both Southern Californians, were also painters.
