Akhmatova Orphans (Russian: Ахматовские сироты) was a group of four twentieth-century Russian poets — Joseph Brodsky, Yevgeny Rein, Anatoly Naiman, and Dmitri Bobyshev — who gathered as acolytes around the poet Anna Akhmatova.   Akhmatova called them her "magic choir", but after Akhmatova's death they were called "Akhmatova's Orphans".
