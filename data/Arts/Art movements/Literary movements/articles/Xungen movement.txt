The xungen movement (simplified Chinese: 寻根文学; traditional Chinese: 尋根文學) is a cultural and literary movement in mainland China emphasizing local and minority cultures. It began in the late 1980s. Its premise is that the Cultural Revolution damaged a pluralistic Chinese identity that had existed for centuries, and that the reconstruction of that identity requires a healthy appreciation of local cultures.
