Many numbers of classical poets have enriched the poetry and the literature with their works. The modern poetry has influenced the Telugu poetry up to 1950s. Urbanization, Industrialization, strained relations with the nature and in family, lack of love and unity between human beings etc., have created a fear psychosis and loneliness in the modern man which was unknown to him earlier. Modern poets have reacted to this pathetic condition of man and expressed their feelings in poetry.\n</p><p>Encounters with British rule have generated all kinds of responses \u2013 from downright <a href=\"/wiki/Self-deprecation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Self-deprecation\">self-deprecation</a> to rabid self-righteousness. Telugu poetry in the twentieth century hinges more or less on these two extreme responses. On the one hand, there are poets who still swear by old classical virtues of artistic finesse, refined idiom and sacred sentiments; on the other, there are poets who sing in coarse <a href=\"/wiki/Colloquialism\" title=\"Colloquialism\">colloquial language</a> with overtly irreverent tones.\n</p><p>Twentieth century Telugu poetry one finds a clear divide, almost a running feud, among twentieth century Telugu poets over the issue of what constitutes the right stuff for poetry. The impact of English education and various <a href=\"/wiki/Reform_movement\" title=\"Reform movement\">social reform</a> movements is clearly visible in these lines.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Poetry_of_Feeling\">Poetry of Feeling</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paryavaran_Kavitodyamam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Poetry of Feeling\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Later a new school called Bhavakavitvam (poetry of feeling), spearheaded by Rayaprolu Subbarao and <a href=\"/wiki/Devulapalli_Krishnasastri\" title=\"Devulapalli Krishnasastri\">Devulapalli Krishna Sastri</a>, held sway for quite a while. With their accent on non-sexual love, the poets of this school tried to parody the erotic and sensuous poetry of their Sanskrit and Telugu predecessors. But very soon this school, for its lack of social and political consciousness, came under fierce attack from the Marxists. The soft imagery of moonlight, jasmine flowers, cool breeze, etc., was soon replaced by the stark and jarring images of violence, excreta and anarchy. Pathabi Rama Reddy, a poet of this raw new sensibility, writes: \"Sorry moon. What can I say?/ No one even mistakes you for a lost rupee coin/ Really you are not wanted here.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Progressive_.26_Revolutionary_Poetry\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Progressive_&amp;_Revolutionary_Poetry\">Progressive &amp; Revolutionary Poetry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paryavaran_Kavitodyamam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Progressive &amp; Revolutionary Poetry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>From the 1950s onward, it was the progressive poets who ruled the Telugu  poetry. The Abhyudaya Rachayitala Sangham (Progressive Writers\u2019 Association) followed by another association, the Virasam (Revolutionary Writers' Movement), along with many local Naxalite and Maoist associations, have dominated the Telugu literary scene. The poet who emerged almost as an icon was <a href=\"/wiki/Srirangam_Srinivasarao\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Srirangam Srinivasarao\">Sri Sri</a> who, much like Paash in Panjabi, created a powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-establishment\" title=\"Anti-establishment\">anti-establishment</a>, anti-colonial and <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-capitalism\" title=\"Anti-capitalism\">anti-capitalist</a> sentiment among the public at the grassroots level. In a poem entitled Myth of Myself, the poet imagines himself to be a Naxalite who transforms himself into a pumpkin after being killed by the police in a false encounter. When the pumpkin is swallowed by a cow, even resting in the intestines of a cow is a luxury: \"Aha! Moving about in the belly of the cow/ is like staying in a five-star hotel.\" The poet as rebel wants to \"return through cow's excrement\" so that he is ready for another round of armed combat with the power-structures. Sri Sri wants to lend \"his voice\" to \"the roar of the world,\" offer his \"tear\" to \"the rain of the world.\"\n</p><p>Revolutionary poets of Andhra Pradesh who continuously feed the Naxalite movement in Andhra Pradesh through their soul-stirring songs. These songs may not have an artistic tone, but written in dialects used by low castes, these songs go well with the masses in the countryside. Most of the songs border on plain <a href=\"/wiki/Rhetoric\" title=\"Rhetoric\">political rhetoric</a> and even sloganeering, but perhaps this is what the political and <a href=\"/wiki/Social_reality\" title=\"Social reality\">social reality</a> of Andhra-region. Similarly English writings also published in newspapers by the poets and journalists to support the movement.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Feminism_.26_Dalit_Movement\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Feminism_&amp;_Dalit_Movement\">Feminism &amp; Dalit Movement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paryavaran_Kavitodyamam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Feminism &amp; Dalit Movement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Later in 80\u2019s upcoming women and Dalit poets occupied the literary scenario taking the subject of <a href=\"/wiki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women&#39;s rights\">women rights</a> and freedom, Dalit rights etc. The ideology went for till 1990s and even it is continuing. Substantial literature came in Telugu on Feminism &amp; Dalit Movement. Many poets wrote on various issues of women and downtrodden people of the society. Some writers became mad of these subjects and leaving all other social issues. Dalit movement, sthree (women) movement are sporadic movements in Andhra Pradesh literature. They could not influence and their impact is very little and could not produce best literary works.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mini_Poetry_Movement\">Mini Poetry Movement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Paryavaran_Kavitodyamam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Mini Poetry Movement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Parallelly mini poetry came into the scene 1980s in the leadership of Dr Raavi Ranga Rao. Mini poetry went for a decade as a poetry movement. The main idea of this is to write poetry in short form to make the reader to understand easily. The main objective of mini-poetry is to convey the message sharply in few words. Some of the seniors, who were writing in traditional poetry and <a href=\"/wiki/Free_verse\" title=\"Free verse\">free verse</a>, opposed this short form of poetry. They argued that it is degrading the value of the modern poetry. But many poets got motivated for writing mini poetry and lot of literature came in Telugu.\n</p><p>All these movements are going in Telugu and also English language through English newspapers in Andhra Pradesh. In post independence, English newspapers have played a prominent role in literature not only for English but also for Telugu.  <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Indian_Express\" title=\"The Indian Express\">Indian Express</a></i>, <i>The Hindu</i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Deccan_Chronicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Deccan Chronicle\">Deccan Chronicle</a></i> newspapers have dominant role among English readers of Andhra Pradesh.
