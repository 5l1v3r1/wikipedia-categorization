Thomas William Marshall is an English post-impressionist painter and water colorist, born on (1875-10-28)October 28, 1875 at Donisthorpe in England. He passed away  on (1914-09-14)September 14, 1914 in Paris. He painted landscapes, portraits, nudes  and produced watercolours, in Paris, in Île-de-France, in Normandy, on the French Riviera and in Corsica. Between 1904 and 1914, He exhibited his work in Paris at the Salon d'Automne, as well as the Salon des Indépendants and also at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts. These art salons were at the peak of their glory, in this era, with well known painters such as Marquet, Modigliani, Sickert, Kandinsky, participating in them. Thomas William Marshall was born in 1875 in Donisthorpe, Derbyshire in England. He was the son of Robert Aldred Marshall (1852-1884) a wealthy mining engineer from Nottinghamshire who died in the Bullhouse Bridge rail accident , and Dorothy Ann Farr (1852-1879). Thomas William studied in both Oxford and in Cambridge. Wishing to become a painter despite his fragile health, he left England to live in Paris in 1897 and enrolled  in the Académie Julian. There he met the Canadian painter Albert Henry Robinson who would become his student and friend   . In Paris he was reunited with his English friends, also painters, such as Ernest Yarrow Jones (1872-1951). As of 1900, he began to participate successfully in some Parisian exhibitions . His studio was located at 3 rue Campagne-Première , he then moved to 51 rue de Sèvres  and then relocated to 49 boulevard du Montparnasse . In 1904, he participated for the first time in the Salon d'Automne where he would expose in average five to six paintings or watercolours per salon, every year until 1913. He was named as a member of the Salon in 1908. During this time, he showed works at the Salon des Indépendants in 1906 and then from 1908 to 1914. He also showed his works at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1911 and at the London Salon in London from 1908 to 1914. Thomas William Marshall was one of the founding members of the London Salon with Walter Sickert . Thomas William Marshall was a member of the Golf club of Paris (Société de golf de Paris) and played at the golf de La Boulie (fr) when he started. Therefore, he produced many drawings and caricatures inspired by this sport . Due to his fragile health, he left for the Côte d'Azur and settled in Corse in 1908, where he produced a large part of his body of work (oil on canvas or on cardboard, watercolours and caricatures). He transferred works he had created in Corsica onto canvas:landscapes and scenes inspired by daily life on the island back to Paris for exhibition. These works gained him much praise from the art critics of that era . In 1910, Thomas William Marshall married Marie-Louise Désagullier  who had been his companion and model for many years. He died prematurely from tuberculosis  on (1914-09-14)September 14, 1914 in Paris, at the age of 38, at the height of his talent. He was cremated at cimetière du Père-Lachaise and his ashes are resting at the columbarium (87th division, niche n° 2137). Wealthier than many of the contemporary artists of his time, he did not really need to sell much of his art to live  ; as a result, he remained relatively unknown until his rediscovery by art critic Yann Le Pichon (fr) in 1984. One of Thomas William Marshall's paintings, a landscape of Corsica painted in 1910, was selected by a specialized jury and art lovers, displayed at the Espace Pierre Cardin at the Champs-Élysées and was reproduced in colour in a edition of the magazine Paris-Match in december 1984 . Many exhibitions to honour his work followed : at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in 1986, at the Salon d'Automne in 1987 where an entire room was dedicated in tribute to him, and two personal exhibitions in Bastia in 1988  and in Villefranche-sur-mer in 1993. The Beauvais museum acquired a painting in 1987. Bastia and Villefranche-sur-Mer museums each have conserved one or more of his works in their public collections. Recognized by Jacques Foucart, general curator at the Paintings Department of the Musée du Louvre, the pictorial work of the English painter Thomas William Marshall, is both inspired by the last sparkling embers of the XIXth century and by the end of Impressionism. Composed of numerous oil paintings and watercolours, of rare quality, his work can be added to the post-impressionist and symboliste movements. Also certain pieces could be considered neo-Japonard or nabis. Regardless of how one classifies it, his work remains deeply original  .
