Marie-Berthe Cazin (born 16 August 1872 in Boulogne-sur-Mer (Pas-de-Calais)); died 1 June 1971 in Sèvres (Hauts-de-Seine))  was a French woman painter, potter, goldsmith. Marie-Berthe Cazin (née Yvart) was married to Jean-Marie Michel Cazin,   and studied with his father, Jean-Charles Cazin.  She produced mostly decorative works, such as vases and plates, working in ceramic, hammered copper and silver, leather, horn and other. It is believed that she worked alongside Jean-Michel throughout his entire career in ceramics and that many of the vases signed Jean-Michel were actually made by Berthe.  At some point she began to sign her ceramic work, which typically feature incised and relief floral decoration. In 1913 she participated in the exposition with Henriette Tirman in Lyceum-Club.
