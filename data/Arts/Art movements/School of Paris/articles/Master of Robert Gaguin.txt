 The Master of Robert Gaguin is an anonymous painter, active in Paris around 1485-1500. He was so named by Nicole Reynaud after a manuscript of Robert Gaguin's translation of Julius Caesar's De Bello Gallico, offered by the translator to Charles VIII, king of France.  He belongs to a circle of French artists, whose art follows the style of the Master François.  His style is very close to the work of the Master of Jacques of Besançon, with whom he collaborated and could have been the disciple. His art is more modern than his master, though. His manner is close to the style of Jean Colombe and the illuminators of Rouen.  He decorated several printed copies for Antoine Vérard and he also probably designed about thirty woodcuts used by this Parisian publisher.
