Psychic worker is the term first used around 2010 by the DAMTP (DAta Miners Travailleurs Psychique) to self define as a union of Data miners and psychic workers. . The term was used initially to describe their activities instead of using the term 'artist', in order to "supersede the art strike."   . It has subsequently also been used by members of DAMTP to describe and develop their avant-garde activities.
