Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies (PIPS), sometimes referred to as "People Interested in Participatory Societies," is a small collective of artists in Providence, Rhode Island which promotes artistic and social investigations in psychogeography.  PIPS grew out of a small group looking to investigate the urban environment in detail.
