Fluxus is a live coding environment for 3D graphics, music and games.  It uses the programming language Racket (a dialect of Scheme/Lisp) to work with a games engine with built-in 3D graphics, physics simulation and sound synthesis.  All programming is done on-the-fly, where the code editor appears on top of the graphics that the code is generating.       It is an important reference for research and practice in exploratory programming, pedagogy,  live performance  and games programming. Fluxus is known for hosting some of the most cutting-edge live coding research systems   by its author Dave Griffiths, such as the BetaBlocker language inspired by Core War, the Al-Jazari music environment based on interacting robots, the Daisy Chain music environment based on the Petri net model of computation, and the SchemeBricks visual interface for Scheme.
