COLT (Code Orchestra Livecoding Tool) is an ActionScript and JavaScript livecoding tool by Code Orchestra, available by subscription. The first version of COLT was released in May 2013, and at the time was the first available livecoding tool for the ActionScript Language. Further minor updates included mobile development support using Adobe AIR technology for iOS  and Android  devices. Version 1.1 included an upgraded Flex compiler boasting up to 3x compilation speed increase and allowed using the compiler bundled with an application as an external compiler for ActionScript IDEs using an external API.  Version 1.2 featured JavaScript support and a completely reworked user interface.  COLT is a separate tool that can be used with any IDE unlike most livecoding tools that limit a user to usage of a specific development environment.  A code/resource routine is triggered on alteration of a file within COLT's project configured paths.  It also provides an external API providing methods to export a project, run livecoding sessions and production build routines, etc. to ease the IDE integration.  To prevent an application from hanging or crashing due to the possible mistypes during live code updates, COLT manages to protect the running application from the following potentially dangerous cases: Version 1.2.2 includes support for ActionScript and JavaScript programming languages
