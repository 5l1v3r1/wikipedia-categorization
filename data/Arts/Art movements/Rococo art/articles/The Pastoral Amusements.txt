The Pastoral Amusements, known in French as "Les Amusements Champêtres", is a series of tapestries designed between 1720 and 1730  by Jean-Baptiste Oudry for Noël-Antoine de Mérou, then director of the Royal Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory. The first production of the designs took place at Beauvais in 1731.  After enjoying huge success the series was later adapted and further developed at Aubusson by Jean-Baptiste Huet the elder (d. 1811).
