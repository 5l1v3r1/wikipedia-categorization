Italian Rococo art refers to painting and the plastic arts in Italy during the Rococo period, which went from about the early/mid-18th to the late 18th century. Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by the rocaille or French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style. The styles of the Italian Rococo were very similar to those of France. The style in Italy was usually lighter and more feminine than Italian Baroque art, and became the more popular art form of the settecento.  The leading artistic centres during the Rococo in Italy were Venice, Genoa and Rome. Most Italian Rococo artists came from Venice, such as Canaletto, Tiepolo, Guardi, Piazzetta and Bellotto,  but also from Rome and Genoa, such as Piranesi and Pannini. Artists such as Castiglione and Alessandro Magnasco brought the vogue of Rococo art to Genoa, and Neapolitan Rococo was mainly based on landscapes and naturalistic themes.  Canaletto and Tiepolo were among the most prominent painters of the age, and they painted many frescos and cityscapes (particularly Canaletto).
