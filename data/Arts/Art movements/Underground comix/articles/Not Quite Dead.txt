Not Quite Dead is an underground comic book series by Gilbert Shelton and the French cartoonist Pic,  published in France by the magazine Flag, in the U.S. by Rip Off Press, and in the U.K. by Knockabout Comics. The title is the name of a fictional band.   The main characters—the band members—first appeared on the cover of Rip Off Comix #19 (1988), and their first adventure was published in Rip Off Comix #25 (Winter 1989). The first issue of Not Quite Dead was published in the U.S. in 1993. Issues came out about once a year through issue #4. After a nearly decade-long hiatus, issue #5 appeared in 2005, published by the U.K. publisher Knockabout Comics (as Rip Off Press was no longer publishing comics by then). The most recent issue, #6, "Last Gig in Shnagrlig," was published by Knockabout in 2010.  The band members are named Sweaty Eddie, Elephant Fingers, Felonius Punk, Thor, and Cat Whittington; their manager is named Gnarly Charlie.
