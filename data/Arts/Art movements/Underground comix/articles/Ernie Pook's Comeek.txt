Ernie Pook's Comeek is an American underground comic/alternative comic by Lynda Barry.  It features the everyday events of a young boy, Ernie Pook, and a young girl, Marlys Mullen. It was first published in 1979 by Matt Groening and John Keister in their respective college newspapers without Barry's knowledge. While Barry swore it wasn't autobiographical, it was loosely based on her own childhood years.  It ran in over 70 alternative newspapers,  such as The Chicago Reader.  It was discontinued in 2008.  Drawn & Quarterly reissued the comic in 2016.
