Weirdo is a magazine-sized comics anthology created by Robert Crumb and published by Last Gasp from 1981 to 1993. Weirdo served as a "low art" counterpoint to its contemporary highbrow Raw.  Early issues of Weirdo reflect Crumb's interests at the time â€“ outsider art, fumetti, Church of the SubGenius-type anti-propaganda and assorted "weirdness." It also introduced artists such as Peter Bagge, Dori Seda and  Dennis (Stickboy) Worden.  With issue #10, Crumb later handed over the editing reins to Bagge; with issue #18, the reins went to Crumb's wife, cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb (except for issue #25, which was again edited by Bagge). The three editorial tenures were known respectively as "Personal Confessions", the "Coming of the Bad Boys", and the "Twisted Sisters".  Weirdo's final issue, #28, an internationally themed 68-page giant titled Verre D'eau (in French, "glass of water"), was published in 1993.
