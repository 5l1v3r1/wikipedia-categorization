Boiled Angel was an independent comic book by Florida-based underground comic book artist Mike Diana in the early 1990s. The comic contained graphic depictions of a variety of taboo and gory subject matters.   It effectively became the first comic book in the United States to cause its creator to be convicted for artistic obscenity.  In a 1990 review, Mike Gunderloy of Factsheet Five called Boiled Angel "a prime candidate for banning in the 90s."  In 1993, a copy of Boiled Angel #8 (or "Ate") found its way into the hands of Florida Assistant State's Attorney Stuart Baggish. Diana was subsequently charged with several counts of obscenity and fought a long legal battle with the aid of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which he eventually lost.
