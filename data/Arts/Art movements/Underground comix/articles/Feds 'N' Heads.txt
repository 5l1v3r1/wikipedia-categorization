Feds 'N' Heads  is an underground comic book, created and self-published by Gilbert Shelton, which introduced the world to the Shelton characters Wonder Wart-Hog and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. In the spring of 1968, cartoonist Gilbert Shelton, already somewhat known in college humor and underground comix circles for his Superman parody Wonder Wart-Hog, self-published a 28-page one-shot, Feds 'N' Heads Comics, much of the material of which had previously appeared in the Austin, Texas, underground paper The Rag. Feds 'N' Heads was later reprinted an additional 13 times by the Bay Area underground publisher the Print Mint, selling over 200,000 total copies by 1980. The Wonder Wart-Hog lead story (co-written by Lieuen Adkins) featured the Hog of Steel's alter-ego, Philbert Desanex, going assignment to San Francisco to cover the Human Be-In (where he encounters Janis Joplin), only to face the diabolical supervillain the Chameleon. Feds 'N' Heads also featured a variety of whimsical strips about hippies, freaks, and above all recreational drugsâ€”and introduced the trio that would become Shelton's most famous creation: The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.  Other stories in the issue included a couple of psychedelic interpretations of folk and Blues songs and a parody of the novelty ads frequently found in mainstream comic books of that era. Feds 'N' Heads had an initial print run of 5,000 copies, and were hand collated, folded, and stapled by Gilbert Shelton in his Austin garage.  Including subsequent printings by Print Mint, the comic had sold over 200,000 copies by 1980.   Details on the different printings: Feds 'N' Heads was also released as a board game based on the comic book, published as a fold-out in the September 1971 issue of Playboy magazine.
