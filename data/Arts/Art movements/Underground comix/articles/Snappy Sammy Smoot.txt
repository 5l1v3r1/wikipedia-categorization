Snappy Sammy Smoot is an American underground comix character created by Skip Williamson in 1968. A counterculture Candide who never loses his innocence,  Snappy Sammy Smoot appeared in his own strips in a number of comix titles, most notably Bijou Funnies, Comix Book, and Blab!. Cultural critic David Manning White wrote about the strip, "But what is . . . interesting about 'Snappy Sammy Smoot' is that it manages to be politically radical at the same time it is satirical and funny," and that it is "one of more highly stylized in the field".  Snappy Sammy Smoot first appeared in Bijou Funnies #1 (Summer 1968), and was featured in almost every issue of the title until 1972. After a short hiatus, he was featured in the first two issues of Comix Book, the short-lived attempt by Marvel Comics to get into the underground publishing movement.  In Jan. 1979, Kitchen Sink Press collected all the Snappy Sammy Smoot stories published at that point in a 36-page self-titled one-shot. The character's adventures were again collected in 1988 as part of the Skip Williamson collection The Scum Also Rises: An Anthology of Comic Art, published by Fantagraphics. They were reprinted again in Smoot #1, self-published by Williamson in 1995. Snappy Sammy Smoot reappeared in 1989 in the annual anthology Blab!, published by Kitchen Sink; and was featured in most later issues through issue #7 (1992). The character's last major appearance was in the Fantagraphics anthology Zero Zero #9, published in 1996. The character was brought to life in the 1960s by the actor Carl Reiner on the TV show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.
