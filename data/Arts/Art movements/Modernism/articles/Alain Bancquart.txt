Alain Bancquart (born 20 June 1934 in Dieppe) is a French composer. He had his musical formation at the Conservatoire de Paris (violin, viola, chambre music, counterpoint, fugue and composition) with Darius Milhaud. He was a violist with the Orchestre National de France until 1973. He became Directeur Musical des Orchestres de Régions at the ORTF (1973–1974), then musical director of the Orchestre National de France (1975–1976). Since 1967 he has dedicated his compositional work to the study of micro-intervals in a neo-serial approach using quarter-tones,  and more recently 16th tones.  He is married to French poet Marie-Claire Bancquart.
