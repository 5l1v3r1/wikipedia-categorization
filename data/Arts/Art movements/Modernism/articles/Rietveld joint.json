It was a prominent feature in the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_and_Blue_Chair\" title=\"Red and Blue Chair\">Red and Blue Chair</a> that was designed by <a href=\"/wiki/Gerrit_Rietveld\" title=\"Gerrit Rietveld\">Gerrit Rietveld</a>.\n</p><p>Rietveld joints are inextricably linked with the early 20th century Dutch artistic movement called <a href=\"/wiki/De_Stijl\" title=\"De Stijl\">De Stijl</a> (of which Gerrit Rietveld was a member), a movement whose aims included ultimate simplicity and abstraction. This led to the movement's three-dimensional works having vertical and horizontal lines that are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements and giving a piece a visually raw and simplified look.\n</p><p>In Gerrit Rietveld's furniture, many of these joints were doweled, meaning that the adjoining faces were connected with glued wooden pins. The first two connections were made by boring a hole about 1&#160;mm deeper than the dowel length, but the third connection was made with\na longer dowel, boring through a batten, leaving a circular mark that had to be painted over.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rietveld_joint&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Drijver et Niemeijer: <i>How to construct Rietveld furniture</i>, p 15.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2176\nCached time: 20180916201828\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.012 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 22/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 358/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:17889101-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916201828 and revision id 728239299\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"De_Stijl"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Modernism"},{"sortkey":"","*":"History_of_furniture"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Dutch_inventions"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Batten"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cartesian coordinate system"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"De Stijl"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gerrit Rietveld"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Red and Blue Chair"}],"templates":[],"images":["Rietveld-joint-with-dowels.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Rietveld_joint","byteoffset":1617,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Rietveld joint","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7333191"}]}}
