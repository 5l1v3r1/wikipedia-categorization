Henri Collet (French: [kɔlɛ]; 5 November 1885 – 23 November 1951) was a French composer and music critic who lived in Paris. Today his music is seldom performed and he is best remembered for his 1920 article in Comoedia in which he coined the term Groupe des six to designate a young group of musicians at the Conservatoire de Paris which included Francis Poulenc and Darius Milhaud.
