Philip Randolph\">A. Philip Randolph</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Chandler_Owen\" title=\"Chandler Owen\">Chandler Owen</a> dropped out of college, joined the <a href=\"/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_America\" title=\"Socialist Party of America\">Socialist Party</a>, and gave soapbox orations on street corners around Harlem. Their socialist and labor union propagandizing gained them celebrity in the area. When they walked into the office building at 486 <a href=\"/wiki/Lenox_Avenue\" title=\"Lenox Avenue\">Lenox Avenue</a>, while looking for a meeting space for their Independent Political Council, they were recognized by William White, President of the Headwaiters and Sidewaiters Society of Greater New York. He suggested they move into his society\u2019s headquarters and edit a monthly magazine for waiters. \n</p><p>From January until August 1917, Randolph and Owen published the <i>Hotel Messenger</i>. But their expos\u00e9 of union corruption (wherein the headwaiters were selling uniforms to sidewaiters at high prices and pocketing the kickbacks from uniform dealers) resulted in their immediate dismissal.\n</p><p>They moved into an office next door at 513 Lenox Avenue. With the patronage of Randolph\u2019s wife Lucille, they launched <i>The Messenger</i>. The first issue cost 15 cents (its price would never change) and ran the mission statement written by Randolph and Owen:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\u201cOur aim is to appeal to reason, to lift our pens above the cringing demagogy of the times, and above the cheap peanut politics of the old reactionary Negro leaders. [This was a reference to <a href=\"/wiki/Booker_T._Washington\" title=\"Booker T. Washington\">Booker T. Washington</a>, who promoted rural skills and compromise at <a href=\"/wiki/Tuskegee_Institute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tuskegee Institute\">Tuskegee Institute</a>.] Patriotism has no appeal to us; justice has. Party has no weight with us; principle has. Loyalty is meaningless; it depends on what one is loyal to. Prayer is not one of our remedies; it depends on what one is praying for. We consider prayer as nothing more than a fervent wish; consequently the merit and worth of a prayer depend upon what the fervent wish is.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Declaring that \u201cwith us, economics and politics take precedence to music and art,\u201d the magazine\u2019s first two years were primarily devoted to advocating black labor unionism and socialism, and denouncing the War and its effects on black Americans. The magazine attacked President <a href=\"/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson\" title=\"Woodrow Wilson\">Woodrow Wilson</a>\u2019s call to make \u201cthe world safe for democracy,\u201d when the black community was at risk in the U.S. Since the late 19th century, it had suffered  a high rate of lynchings and violence in the South. At the turn of the century, most blacks were  <a href=\"/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era\">disenfranchised</a> by changes in state law across the region that raised barriers to voter registration. They were excluded from the political system. The editors of the <i>Messenger</i> also criticized major northern black figures such as <a href=\"/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois\" title=\"W. E. B. Du Bois\">W. E. B. Du Bois</a>, who was pro-war at the time, and <a href=\"/wiki/Marcus_Garvey\" title=\"Marcus Garvey\">Marcus Garvey</a>, an activist from <a href=\"/wiki/Jamaica\" title=\"Jamaica\">Jamaica</a>. They believed that Garvey's program to \u201crepatriate\u201d native-born American black citizens to Africa was illogical and far fetched.\n</p><p>The <i>Messenger</i> declared: \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNo intelligent Negro is willing to lay down his life for the United States as it now exists. Intelligent Negroes have now reached the point where their support of the country is conditional.\u201d</p></blockquote><p> Such statements led to <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice\" title=\"United States Department of Justice\">Justice Department</a> agents ransacking the <i>Messenger</i>\u2032s editorial office in the dead of night, breaking furniture and confiscating back issues. Randolph and Owen conducted a public speaking tour against the war, appearing in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Cleveland\" title=\"Cleveland\">Cleveland</a>, while selling copies of their fiery July 1918 issue. \n</p><p>Reaching Cleveland on August 4, Randolph and Owen took turns addressing the mass meeting gathered by the city's Socialist Party leader <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Walter_Bronstrup&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Walter Bronstrup (page does not exist)\">Walter Bronstrup</a>. He sold issues of the <i>Messenger</i> in the crowd until an undercover Justice Department official bought an issue and broke up the meeting. The DOJ official pulled Randolph from the stage, arrested him and Owen, and held them the following day for investigation. Randolph and Owen were held for trial under charges of violating the <a href=\"/wiki/Espionage_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Espionage Act\">Espionage Act</a> by: \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cunlawfully, knowingly and feloniously, the United States being then and there at war with the <a href=\"/wiki/German_Reich\" title=\"German Reich\">Imperial German Government</a>, willfully print and cause to be printed, publish and cause to be published, circulated, in a certain language intended to incite, provoke and incur resistance to the United States and to promote the cause of its enemies in a certain publication known as the <i>Messenger</i>.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-Anderson_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Anderson-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>After two days in jail, the two men were brought to trial. The judge, looking at the two men and what they had written, said that he could not believe they were old enough, or, being black, smart enough to write that \u201cred-hot stuff\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Anderson_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Anderson-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> He did not doubt that they were being used by white socialists who had written the editorials for them. He said there would be no trial and ordered Randolph and Owen returned to their parents' homes; telling them to leave town quickly. The men continued their tour. When they returned to New York, they learned that the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General\" title=\"United States Postmaster General\">Postmaster General</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Burleson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Albert Burleson\">Albert Burleson</a> had denied second-class mailing privileges to their magazine because of its content.\n</p><p>Socialism failed to attract followers in Harlem. By February 1920 the <i>Messenger</i> identified as \u201cA Journal of Scientific Radicalism;\u201d in June 1923, it billed itself as \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Negro Monthly.\u201d It published increasing amounts of poetry, stories, and other work of Harlem intellectuals as the area became the center for black culture.\n</p><p>Although lacking a literary editor, <i>The Messenger</i> was influential in the <a href=\"/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance\" title=\"Harlem Renaissance\">Harlem Renaissance</a>; it published a range of new writers before they had reached literary reputations. <a href=\"/wiki/Theophilus_Lewis\" title=\"Theophilus Lewis\">Theophilus Lewis</a>, the magazine\u2019s drama critic from September 1923 till May 1926, supported the African-American <a href=\"/wiki/Little_theatre_movement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Little theatre movement\">little theatre movement</a>, and helped develop a black aesthetic in the theater. Lewis may have been untrained and was not paid for his contributions (apparently the <i>Messenger</i> offices paid only for his cab fare to and from shows), but his enthusiasm for the theater led to well-developed criticism. He helped shape African-American theater on many levels, from the little theaters to <a href=\"/wiki/Broadway_theatre\" title=\"Broadway theatre\">Broadway</a>.\n</p><p>Lewis helped recruit <a href=\"/wiki/Wallace_Thurman\" title=\"Wallace Thurman\">Wallace Thurman</a> to the magazine as a contributing editor. He later founded the influential magazine <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fire!!\" title=\"Fire!!\">Fire!!</a></i> Thurman worked at <i>The Messenger</i> from late 1925 to 1926 and helped to publish <a href=\"/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston\" title=\"Zora Neale Hurston\">Zora Neale Hurston</a>\u2019s \u201cEatonville Anthology,\u201d as well as the early stories of <a href=\"/wiki/Langston_Hughes\" title=\"Langston Hughes\">Langston Hughes</a> (Hurston and Hughes joined Thurman as an editors of <i>Fire!!</i>). Thurman also became known for his novels <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> and <i>Infants of Spring</i>. <a href=\"/wiki/George_S._Schuyler\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George S. Schuyler\">George S. Schuyler</a>, a staple of the magazine for his satiric column \"Shafts and Darts\" (which he sometimes wrote with help from Lewis), contributed the piece \u201cHobohemia\u201d to the <i>Messenger.</i> He became a correspondent and Chief Editorial Writer for the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pittsburgh_Courier\" title=\"Pittsburgh Courier\">Pittsburgh Courier</a></i>. Schuyler earned some renown for his satirical novel <i>Black No More</i>.\n</p><p>While the magazine was based in Harlem, its essays from the 1920s onward took a look at black culture across the whole nation with contributors such as Schuyler, Thurman, Lewis, <a href=\"/wiki/E._Franklin_Frazier\" title=\"E. Franklin Frazier\">E. Franklin Frazier</a> and others (see: Tom Lutz and Susanna Ashton\u2019s edited collection of a series of essays from this period known as \"These 'Colored' United States\").

Contributors received only token payments. Money problems forced the magazine to change offices after being evicted from its first base. They were evicted again after three years, and leased space at 2311 Seventh Avenue. It published from there until folding in 1928 from lack of funds.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_influence\">Social influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Messenger_(magazine)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Social influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In addition to providing a platform for African-American literature, <i>The Messenger</i> published much political writing.

It was described as \"The most feared black publication\" during its reigning era from 1917 until 1928.
