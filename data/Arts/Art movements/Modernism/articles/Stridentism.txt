Stridentism (Spanish: Estridentismo) was an artistic and multidisciplinary avant-garde movement, founded in Mexico City by Manuel Maples Arce at the end of 1921 but formally developed in Xalapa where all the founders moved after the University of Veracruz granted its support for the movement. Stridentism shares some characteristics with Cubism, Dadaism, Futurism and Ultraism, but it developed a specific social dimension, taken from the Mexican Revolution, and a concern for action and its own present. Stridentists were part of the political avant-garde, faced to the "elitist" modernism of Los Contemporáneos. 1921: Mexico City, December 31, Manuel Maples Arce gives the first manifesto out. 1923: Maples Arce and List Arzubide give out the second manifesto, in the city of Puebla. 1924: First Stridentist Expo, at the "Café de nadie", in Mexico City. 1925: The group moves from Mexico City to Xalapa (recreated in their works as "Estridentópolis").
