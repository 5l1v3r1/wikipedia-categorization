Although highly educated and astute in matters of philosophy and literature, Davy is far less capable as a socialite and is confused by the new-fangled tastes and expectations of the young urban elite.  His complicated attraction to the very modern Caroline Rhodes, daughter of his landlady, motivates many of his letters.</li>\n<li>Caroline Rhodes \u2013 The most free-spirited of the women Davy meets in Washington, Caroline is a member of the high-class black elite of the city.  Spending much of her time going to parties and other gatherings as a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Flapper\" title=\"Flapper\">flapper</a>,\" Caroline manages to reject many of the societal expectations placed on women of her status.  That she smokes, drinks, spends profligately, and does not consider her darker skin a social liability sets her apart from the other women of Davy\u2019s acquaintance, and he grows more and more infatuated with her as his stay progresses.</li>\n<li>Bob Fletcher \u2013 The recipient of Davy\u2019s series of letters, Bob served in the military with Davy during the first World War.

His initiation comes about through the machinations of his landlady\u2019s daughter Caroline, who introduces him to her friends and ensures that he is invited to the city\u2019s best and most significant parties.  As Davy gets to know the various members of the social scene, he becomes more and more suspicious of his fellow lodger, Jeffries, whose questionable activities include attending seedy cabarets, and may extend to theft or money laundering.  The tension between the two comes to a head when Jeffries invites Caroline to join him and his friends at a cabaret.  Davy follows the two, and arrives just as Jeffries attempts to rape Caroline.  To the surprise of everyone present, Davy floors Jeffries with one punch and carries the unconscious Caroline out.  After this episode, Caroline\u2019s reckless behavior diminishes and her respect for Davy increases\u2014facts that everyone but Davy himself can plainly see.  The last months of Davy\u2019s stay in Washington, D. C. are spent studying at the Library of Congress and enjoying the friendships he has made.  Although his letters to Bob betray a fixation on Caroline and his relationship with her, Davy does not consider her as a romantic option until just before he is scheduled to depart.  When he finally voices his feelings to Caroline, she responds: \u201cI think I loved you from the first day.\u201d  They embrace, and the novel ends.\n</p><p><i>When Washington Was in Vogue</i> explores the spoken and unspoken rules of color politics within African-American society of the period.  Unusually, Williams\u2019s novel has no white characters.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McKible_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McKible-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Davy is a light-skinned man who elects not to pass for white, and throughout the novel he and other characters discuss the tendencies of many African-American men (of any shade) to prefer women of lighter skin tones.  Davy himself is quite open-minded when it comes to female beauty, and often takes the time to describe his various attractive friends to Bob.  Significantly, Caroline is the darkest of Davy\u2019s female friends, thus making his choice of her as his romantic partner a transgression of the unspoken norms.  The novel has been compared to <a href=\"/wiki/Nella_Larsen\" title=\"Nella Larsen\">Nella Larsen</a>\u2019s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Passing_(novel)\" title=\"Passing (novel)\">Passing</a></i> as a significant literary exploration of the politics of the intra-racial <a href=\"/wiki/Color_line_(civil_rights_issue)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Color line (civil rights issue)\">color line</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Additionally, the novel offers an analysis of 1920s society from the viewpoint of a conservative narrator.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McKible_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McKible-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Davy, while educated and possessing a well-tuned aesthetic sense, is unquestionably the product of an earlier time.  His and Caroline\u2019s early interest in each other stems from this difference, as her radical modernity and his stolid traditionalism render them mutually fascinating.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Publication\">Publication</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=When_Washington_Was_in_Vogue&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Publication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>When Washington Was in Vogue</i> was serialized in <i>The Messenger</i> as \"The Letters of Davy Carr: A True Story of Colored Vanity Fair,\" editors <a href=\"/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph\" title=\"A.
