 Klingen (meaning Blade in English) was a Danish art magazine based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The magazine existed between 1917 and 1920. Klingen was established in 1917 and the first issue appeared in October 1917.   The founder was the painter and graphic artist Axel Salto.   The magazine was based in Copenhagen.  It was considered to be a significant vehicle for the entrance of modernism in Denmark.   In addition, it was instrumental in expanding avant-garde art into Nordic countries.  The magazine had significant effects on painters, writers and intellectuals.  The artists attached to the magazine had an optimistic view following World War I, and argued that  the beauty in art had social and political significance in that it provided a means in understanding and responding to the chaotic situation of post-war Europe.  Major contributors were Otto Gelsted, Emil Bønnelycke, Poul Henningsen and Sophus Danneskjold-Samsøe.  Klingen ceased publication in November 1920 and a total of thirty-six issues was published.  In 1942 an anniversary issue was published.  Several issues of Klingen were digitized by the Royal Library of Denmark  in 1996.
