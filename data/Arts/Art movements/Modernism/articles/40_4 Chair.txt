Frame: steel rod  The 40/4 chair, designed by David Rowland in 1964, is the first compactly stackable chair invented. Forty chairs can be stacked within a height of 4 feet (120 cm), hence its name "40 in 4".  It is an all-purpose chair providing large-capacity movable seating, compact economical storage and comfort in sitting for long periods. It is considered a masterpiece of industrial design, and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as other museums internationally.        The frame of the chair is made of 7/16” solid steel rod. The seat and back are formed sheet metal with 3/16” rolled edges and coated in vinyl.  Some models substitute wood veneers, plastic resin and upholstery over wood as components.  Chairs can be stacked on specially designed dollies for easy moving and storage.   Forty chairs on a single dolly take up 5.1 ft2 /  0.47 m2 of floor space. The chairs can also be linked together horizontally to form movable and stackable rows.   Linked chairs in rows of two, three or four can be stacked up to 40 chairs high on special double, triple, or quadruple dollies. One hundred sixty chairs on a quadruple dolly take up less than 21.5 ft2 / 2 m2 of floor space.   In 2004 Rowland worked with Howe a/s to introduce an expanded family of the 40/4 chair. Rowland developed the 40/4 chair over a period of 8 years.   In 1963 he was awarded a patent for the chair's design.       Initially, Rowland showed the chair to many companies in an effort to license the design.  In 1961, Florence Knoll licensed the chair for her company, Knoll Associates, however canceled a license after six months.  Rowland later showed the chair to Davis Allen, head of interior design at the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM).  Allen requested 17,000 chairs for the a campus SOM was designing for the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  To fulfill the request, Rowland licensed the design to General Fireproofing Co. (GF) in Youngstown, Ohio.    In May 1965, While the first order for was still being produced, 250 chairs were hand assembled and installed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City for the opening of its new wing.  The 40/4 was an immediate success.   It won the grand prize at the prestigious 13th Milan Triennale,  and has been included in museum collections and exhibitions internationally. In the book the Modern Chair, Clement Meadmore described the chair as having “beautiful simplicity and total appropriateness.”  Twenty five hundred 40/4s were installed in St. Paul’s Cathedral in London in 1973, site of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s wedding,  and remain in use. In 2001 it was named #1 of The Top 10 Commercial Interiors products of the Past 50 Years by Contract Design Magazine.  The chair has been in continuous production since its introduction and has sold over 8 million units.    General Fireproofing held the license for the chair from 1963 until 2002 when the company was taken over by OSI Furniture LLC.  In 2013, Howe Europe, (now Howe a/s), of Denmark, which had had a sublicense to the chair in Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (except for Indonesia) acquired the license for the 40/4 in the United States and Canada.
