Productivism was an art movement founded by a group of Constructivist artists in post-Revolutionary Russia who believed that art should have a practical, socially useful role as a facet of industrial production. The group formed to contradict Naum Gabo's assertion that Constructivism should be devoted to exploration of abstract space and rhythm. Aleksei Gan led the group which included Alexander Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova and focused on applied arts. Productivism became the prevailing aesthetic and artists such as Kazimir Malevich, El Lissitzky and Liubov Popova designed furniture, textiles, clothing, ceramics, typography, advertising and propaganda, as well as theater set design.
