Neo-pop is a postmodern art  movement of the 1980s. The term refers to artists influenced by pop art and pop culture imagery, such as Jeff Koons , but also artists working in graffiti and cartoon art, such as Keith Haring.  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami is described as the first of the Japanese neo-pop artists to "break the ice in terms of recycling Japanese pop culture".  Japanese neo-pop is associated with the otaku subculture and the obsessive interests in anime, manga and other forms of pop culture. Artists such as Kenji Yanobe exemplify this approach to art and fandom.
