Dragestil ("Dragon Style") is a style of design and architecture that originated in Norway and was widely used  principally between 1880 and 1910.   It is a variant of the more embracing National Romantic style and an expression of Romantic nationalism.  The foremost sources of inspiration for the Dragestil style were the Viking and mediaeval art and architecture of Scandinavia. It had roots in preservation of the stave churches and the recent excavated of historic relics of the past such as the Tune, Gokstad and Oseberg ships.      It often featured Norse motifs, such as serpents and dragons, hence its popular appellation. Important proponents in the modern era included Norwegian architects Holm Hansen Munthe and Balthazar Lange.   In Germany the Kongsn√¶s' sailors station in Potsdam and the Rominten Hunting Lodge were erected for Kaiser Wilhelm II.
