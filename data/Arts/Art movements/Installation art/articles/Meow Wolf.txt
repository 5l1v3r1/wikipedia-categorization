The organization was founded in 2008.  Meow Wolf was formed in February as an Artist Collective in 2008 by "a group of young residents hoping to supply Santa Fe with an alternative art and music venue."  They initially leased commercial spaces to hold gallery shows and underground music events, but switched to a decentralized model in 2010.   In 2016 Meow Wolf opened their first permanent space, The Meow Wolf Art Complex, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The building is also home to the group's first permanent installation, House of Eternal Return. As a company, they focus on sharing abilities and processes amongst their artists to create elaborate maximalist art installations with a focus on interactivity, narrative and immersive art. Notable Santa Fe-based installations created by Meow Wolf include "Biome Neuro Norb" (2008) a Sci-Fi inspired installation,  "Auto Wolf" (2009) an installation centered around the destruction and reuse of a donated car,  "The Moon is to Live On", a multimedia theatrical play,   "Geodecadent I" and "Geodecadent II" (both 2010) a series of installations based on geodesic domes,   "The Due Return" (2011) an installation consisting of a 70-foot long ship with two levels, and filled with rooms and objects suggesting details of implied fictional inhabitants' lives.  In pursuit of teaching collaborative arts practices Meow Wolf formed CHIMERA in 2011. In 2012 CHIMERA worked with approximately one thousand Santa Fe students to create "Omega Mart", a collaborative art installation in the form of a fictitious grocery store stocked with hand-made satirical goods.   "Omega Mart" was deliberately placed away from Santa Fe's arts district to attract a more diverse audience.   In 2013, CHIMERA began working with the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History's classroom mentorship program for gifted students to create an installation named "Project Dreamscape".  Meow Wolf has built notable shows outside of Santa Fe. "Glitteropolis" (2011), at the New Mexico State University Art Gallery, used 50 pounds of glitter for the installation.  "Nucleotide" (2013) was a drippy pastel cave-like installation built by Meow Wolf artists in Chicago at the Thomas Robertello Gallery.  The majority of "Nucleotide" was conceived and built in Chicago over a 3-month period by 18 members of the collective.  In January 2015, author George R. R. Martin pledged $2.7 million to renovate and lease a vacant bowling alley to create a permanent facility for Meow Wolf. This was supplemented by additional funding, including $50,000 from the city of Santa Fe and $100,000 from a crowd-funding campaign.    The Meow Wolf Art Complex opened March 17, 2016.   Its main exhibit, House of Eternal Return, received a 2017 TEA Award  and has been cited as the tenth best music venue in the United States.  In January 2018, Meow Wolf announced that it will be opening two new art complexes in Las Vegas, Nevada and Denver, Colorado.
