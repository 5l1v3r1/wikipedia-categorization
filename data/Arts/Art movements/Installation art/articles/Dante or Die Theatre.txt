Dante or Die Theatre is a British site-specific theatre company which registered as a company limited by guarantee in 2006. The non-profit organisation specialises in engaging with spectators and create performances in a variety of spaces such as hotels, leisure centres and storage facilities.  Inspired by contemporary stories and occurrences, they create unpredictable theatre for their audiences.  Company members include: Daphna Attias (Co-Artistic Director), Terry O'Donovan (Co-Artistic Director) and Lucy Atkinson  (Executive Producer). Terry Oâ€™Donovan, from Limerick and Daphna Attias, from Tel Aviv formed Dante or Die after they both attended The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama's MA in Advanced Theatre Practice.  The name 'Dante or Die' comes from the site where Terry & Daphna first made a site-specific performance together in the skate park of Kennington Park alongside Clare Parke-Davies and Anthea Neagle. The graffiti that has the words Dante or Die is still there today.  Terry and Daphna are regular guest lecturers at The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama whilst also facilitating site-specific creative workshops with a range of higher education courses, professional artists and community groups. They regularly collaborate with creative artists such as Chris Goode (playwright) and designers Jenny Hayton and Amy Jackson. Dancer Anna Woolhouse is also an associate artist.
