He worked at BHP steel works, in the coke ovens as part of the immigration program at the time, which required people to work for two years in an industry chosen by the Australian Government.  A year after arriving in Australia, he built his own home on Warners Bay Road, Charlestown. It was hard work, as the acre block he selected, was dense Australian bush land. To clear the block he used hand saws and an axe. He built the home with a small loan from the Commonwealth Bank, coming home after his shift at BHP to cut timbers and paint. The house has remained relatively unchanged to this day.\n</p><p>Over the years he presented one of his paintings to every man who retired from the Newcastle Steel Works coke ovens department using art supplies given to him by BHP, he became very well known for this. He worked for the BHP for 35 years before retiring.\n</p><p>Degenhardt won the inaugural Newcastle Art Prize and was a regional winner of Maitland Art Prize.  He presented a one-man exhibitions at Barry Stern Galleries 1968, Sydney and Lights Gallery, Newcastle 1963.

They have a general relationship to such contemporary events as the Vietnam War and the Bangladesh tragedy, but do not relate to any one event in particular. They present a general view of <a href=\"/wiki/Man%27s_inhumanity_to_man\" title=\"Man&#39;s inhumanity to man\">man's inhumanity to man</a> in the world of today. But it is not just a view of sorrow. There is some beauty too. Beauty in the lives of the human figures and particularly in the hands and their expressive qualities. Forms and features are over emphasised to heighten expression and feeling. Colours are restricted to black and white to give a stronger effect, with red conte added as a softener and enlivening touch. (verbal information from the artist 19 September 1972)</li></ul>\n<p>Irene, born in Cologne, Germany. A writer for the Mavis Branson show, met Wolfgang whilst travelling in the war years. She was responsible for organising his gallery appearances and named many of his works.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1234\nCached time: 20180909215537\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.096 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.144 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 247/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 5382/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 389/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\nLua time usage: 0.045/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.38 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  124.643      1 -total\n 35.33%   44.035      1 Template:Authority_control\n 32.60%   40.628      1 Template:More_citations_needed\n 29.86%   37.213      1 Template:Ambox\n 25.58%   31.879      1 Template:Use_dmy_dates\n 15.47%   19.285      2 Template:DMCA\n 12.93%   16.112      2 Template:Dated_maintenance_category\n  7.90%    9.843      2 Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME\n  6.26%    7.799      1 Template:Use_Australian_English\n  5.71%    7.112      2 Template:Ns_has_subpages\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:12050153-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909215537 and revision id 847270630\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","hidden":"","*":"Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2015"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","hidden":"","*":"Use_Australian_English_from_June_2015"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","hidden":"","*":"All_Wikipedia_articles_written_in_Australian_English"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","hidden":"","*":"Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2008"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_additional_references"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","*":"German_emigrants_to_Australia"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","*":"Expressionism"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","*":"1924_births"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","*":"1993_deaths"},{"sortkey":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang","*":"20th-century_Australian_painters"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Use dmy dates from June 2015"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Use Australian English from June 2015"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles needing additional references from May 2008"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Blake Prize for Religious Art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bremen"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Charlestown, New South Wales"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Germany"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Greta, New South Wales"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hunter Region"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Man's inhumanity to man"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Milan"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Newcastle, New South Wales"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Use dmy dates"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:DMCA"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Dated maintenance category"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:FULLROOTPAGENAME"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ns has subpages"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Use Australian English"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:More citations needed"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Authority control"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Ns has subpages"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Authority control"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:ResolveEntityId"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Navbox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Navbar"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Wolfgang Degenhardt","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Degenhardt, Wolfgang"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q8030055"}]}}
