Karl Christian Ludwig Hofer or Carl Hofer (11 October 1878 in Karlsruhe – 3 April 1955 Berlin) was a German expressionist painter. One of the most prominent painters of expressionism, he never was a member of one of the expressionist painting groups, like "Die Brücke", who influenced him. His work was considered degenerate art by the Nazis, and only after World War II did he regain recognition as one of the greatest German painters.
