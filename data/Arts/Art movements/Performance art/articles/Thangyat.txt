Thangyat (Burmese: သံချပ်) is a Burmese performance art that blends traditional folk verse performances accompanied by the beat of traditional drums or a hsaing waing ensemble,  and interspersed with song, dance and chant routines,  and performed during festive occasions, particularly during Thingyan in the lead up to the Burmese New Year.  Thangyat are often humorous and satirical in nature, expressing social and political commentary and public opinion.  Consequently, from 1974 to 2013, thangyat performances were banned by the Burmese government under the rationale that thangyat performances undermined national security.   Since 2013, the Burmese government has required thangyat troupes to submit lyrics to municipal thangyat committees for pre-approval.   Thangyat performances are comparable to slam poetry, as performers use numerous poetic and narrative formulae, and employ traditional theatrical devices, such as shifting voices and tones.  A common format involves a call and answer segment between a lead performer called ataing (အတိုင်) and the chorus of followers called ahpauk (အဖောက်).  Thangyat performances are enjoyed for their wit and use of wordplay.
