Meltdown is an annual festival held in London, featuring a mix of music, art, performance and film. Meltdown is held in June at Southbank Centre, the arts complex covering 21 acres (85,000 m2) and including the Royal Festival Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and The Hayward. Each year the festival chooses an established music artist or act as director of the event and they pick the performers of their choosing. Previous Meltdown directors have included Elvis Costello, David Bowie, Patti Smith, Lee Scratch Perry, Morrissey, Jarvis Cocker, Nick Cave, Scott Walker, John Peel and Ornette Coleman. The festival has been held annually since 1993, except in 2006 when the Royal Festival Hall was closed for refurbishment. In 2018, Robert Smith, lead singer of The Cure, curated the 25th Meltdown. 65daysofstatic | Alcest | God Is an Astronaut | Kristin Hersh | Low | Maybeshewill | Mono | The Notwist | Suzanne Vega  A Dead Forest Index | The Anchoress | And Also the Trees | Black Moth Super Rainbow | Blue Crime | The Church | De Rosa | Douglas Dare | Drahla | Eat Static (DJ Set) | Emma Ruth Rundle | False Advertising | Fear of Men | Hilary Woods | I Like Trains | Indian Queens | Is Bliss | Jambinai | James Walsh | Jo Quail | Jónsi, Alex Somers & Paul Corley: 'Liminal' | The Joy Formidable | JoyCut | Kælan Mikla | Kagoule | Kathryn Joseph | Kiasmos DJ Set | Kidsmoke | Kite Base | The KVB | Loop | Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard | Martinez | Matt Holubowski | Misas Fall | | Moon Duo | The Penelopes | Planning for Burial | PG.
