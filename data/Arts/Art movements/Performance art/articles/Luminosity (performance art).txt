Luminosity (1997) was a work of performance art by Serbian artist Marina Abramović in Sean Kelly Gallery, New York. The woman sitting on a bicycle saddle in the center of a wall was dissolved in the powerful stream of light directed on her. She, exposed on a public inspection, was vulnerable. This was performance about loneliness, pain, spiritual firmness, luminous intensity and transcendental essence of the human being, which body – only the tool.
