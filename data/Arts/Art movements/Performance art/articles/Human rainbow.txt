A human rainbow is where a group of people form a pattern on the ground by placing themselves in the typical characteristics of a rainbow. For example, wearing the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet and forming a rainbow arch at the same time. Some human rainbows are formed in celebration of anniversaries and for charitable purposes. These human rainbows usually involve a large number of people participating and this has resulted in world records being broken. These records are officially recognised by the Guinness World Records.
