Waterwheel is an "interactive and collaborative platform",  capable of being used as a medium for sharing media and ideas, performances and presentations. It allows users to upload and engage with media, and provides a platform through which the media can be utilised and expanded on in a live performance. Waterwheel was instigated by Suzon Fuks.  Waterwheel is a free Thematic digital performance platform  that sends out an invitation to everyone, “performers and artists, scientists and environmentalists, students and academics”, anyone who is capable of accessing their facilities to, in their own words, “test the water”.  There have been symposiums held to discuss the matters Waterwheel stand for.
