Waterfall was a style of furniture design in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the most prevalent variation on Art Deco furniture during this time,  primarily created for the mass market and for bedroom suites.   The style was distinguished by numerous features. It was named "Waterfall" due to its distinctive rounded drops at the edges of all horizontal surfaces, intended to mimic a flowing waterfall. Pieces in this style were usually finished with a blond veneer, though a small percentage were finished in a darker walnut finish. Drawer faces on more expensive Waterfall furniture often featured unusual designs such as decorative crossbanding and bookmatched panels. Handles were typically of orange Bakelite and brass, and some vanities had illuminated spheres or frosted panels.  Pieces in this style were sometimes paired with oversized round mirrors with etched trim.  The furniture was made with plywood, which would be molded during manufacturing.  Waterfall furniture contrasted from boxy walnut or mahogany pieces of the 1920s due to Waterfall's curved lines and its use of imported woods, including blond-colored Carpathian elm and golden padouk.
