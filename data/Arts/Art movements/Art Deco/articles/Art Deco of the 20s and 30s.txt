Art Deco of the 20s and 30s is an art history book by English historian Bevis Hillier.   It was initially published in 1968 by Studio Vista. The author discusses how the style of cubism, expressionism, Ancient Egyptian art, Mayan art, and so on influenced Art Deco, and how Art Deco itself changed the style of disciplines as various as modern architecture, jewelry, ceramics, tableware, metalwork, glass, textiles, and many others.   According to historian Thomas Mellins, it was the publication of this book in 1968 that popularised the term Art Deco.  Otherwise, the genre may have been referred to as Art Moderne.
