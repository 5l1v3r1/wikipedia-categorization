  Denis Dunlop (1892-1959) was a sculptor working throughout England during the first half of the 20th century. His work is instantly identifiable for the bold use of stylised Art Deco forms, breath-taking attention to detail and ingenious composition. Dunlop joined the London Scottish Regiment as a private in 1914. After the war, he became a clerk on a cargo ship sailing between London and Vladivostok. He studied at St. Martins and Central School of Arts and Crafts before going on to become an assistant in the studio of Alfred Gilbert, the sculptor of Eros in Piccadilly Circus. In 1932, he married acclaimed modernist artist, Aletta May Lewis. He exhibited in the summer exhibition at the Royal Academy on three occasions: Ant (1930); Pegasus (1933); Head of Harold Lewis (1948). On many occasions, Dunlop worked with architectural giants, Whinney Son & Austen Hall - his works forming the centre-piece of their designs. Much of his work was part of the regeneration of London after the war. Despite Dunlop's immense talent, his work is relatively unknown. Furthermore, the survival and location of much of his work is unknown. In December 2014, a striking plaster panel depicting muscled men and signed D.C. Dunlop (Denis Cheyne Dunlop) appeared on BBC's Antiques Roadshow. The owner of the panel was unaware of its provenance and the antiques expert was unfamiliar with the sculptor. Much intrigue surrounded this handsome panel leading to the filming of a spin-off episode on Antiques Roadshow Detectives. Sadly, the origins of the panel remain unknown.
