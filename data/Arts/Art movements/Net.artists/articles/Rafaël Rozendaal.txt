Rafaël Rozendaal (born 1980) is a Dutch-Brazilian visual artist currently living and working in New York City. Rozendaal founded BYOB (Bring Your Own Beamer),  an open source exhibition concept. The idea is that anyone can create an exhibition of media art without any budget; the manual of BYOB reads: "Find a space, Invite many artists, Ask them to bring their projector".  With this concept Rozendaal wanted to bring the internet to a real life physical space and allow viewers to "‘walk through the internet". Since its beginning in 2010, more than 150 BYOB events  were organized around the world. In 2011, BYOB was the theme of the II Internet Pavilion for the Venice Biennale   Rafael Rozendaal is one of the first artists to sell websites as art objects.  His websites are sold to art collectors, who then own the domain name of that work. Both the artist and the collector sign a contract that the work has to remain publicly accessible. The name of the collector is placed in the source code and the title of the webpage. Rozendaal created the Art Website Sales Contract  which is a public document that can be used by any artist or collector to help in the selling of public website art. In 2013, Rozendaal’s http://www.ifnoyes.com website sold at an auction at Phillips (auctioneers) in New York for $3,500.
