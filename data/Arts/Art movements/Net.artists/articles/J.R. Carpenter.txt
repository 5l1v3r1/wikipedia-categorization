Her thesis, Writing Coastlines: Locating Narrative Resonance in Transatlantic Communications Networks  "contributed to the creation of a new narrative context from which to examine a multi-site-specific place-based identity by extending the performance writing methodology to incorporate digital literature and locative narrative practices, by producing and publicly presenting a significant body of creative and critical work, and by developing a mode of critical writing which intertwines practice with theory."  She was a 2015 Visiting Fellow at the Eccles Centre for North American Studies at the British Library, London, UK.
