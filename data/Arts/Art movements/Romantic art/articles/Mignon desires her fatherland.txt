Mignon desires her fatherland (Dutch: Mignon verlangende naar haar vaderland) is an 1836 painting by the Dutch-French artist Ary Scheffer. The picture depicts a young woman Mignon, inspired from a character in Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.  The 1866 Ambroise Thomas opera Mignon was based on the same character, and Scheffer's feminine representation of Mignon in a dress influenced her portrayal by Thomas.  The painting currently hangs in the Dordrechts Museum in Dordrecht, Netherlands.
