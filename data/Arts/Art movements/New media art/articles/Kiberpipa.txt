Kiberpipa (Slovene: Cyberpipe) was a hackerspace in Ljubljana, Slovenia, established in 2001  as a part of the K6/4 Institute. After a breakup with the parent organization and moving to a different location in 2013 it ceased most operations in 2015. The hackerspace operated as a cultural centre, computer laboratory and Internet caf√© (with free wireless access) at Kersnikova 4, Ljubljana. Kiberpipa engaged primarily in open source programming, electronic art and the recycling of computer devices . Between 2005  and 2013 it also hosted a small living computer museum . The mostly volunteer team in the hackerspace organised workshops, lectures, and entertainment and information events, with around 150 events yearly at the height of its activity . In 2013, the Student Organization of University of Ljubljana, the owner of the building where Kiberpipa originally operated, decided to re-purpose the building as a restaurant and a parking garage. After failing to negotiate a new position within the organization, Kiberpipa team opted to continue operating independently of the Student Organization and moved to a new location . In the same year, the Student Organization opened its own hackerspace Rampa . In 2014, Kiberpipa re-opened at a new location at Gosposvetska 2 using volunteer work and donations . It continued to organize lectures and open source software-related events at the new location until closure in 2015. In 2015 a web server malfunction also resulted in the loss of the Kiberpipa website and archived content .  Kiberpipa co-operated with other organizations in Slovenia, e.g. the Slo-Tech and 3delavnica teams, regional multimedia centres (including Ljudmila - Ljubljana Digital Media Lab, KIBLA Multimedia Centre) and organizations abroad (Mama New Media Centre in Zagreb, HackLab in Pula for example). Kiberpipa organised the bi-annual HAIP Festival (Hack/Act/Interact/Progress Festival). Kiberpipa was a member of the m3c Multimedia Centres Network of Slovenia.
