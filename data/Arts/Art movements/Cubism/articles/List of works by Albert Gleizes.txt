This is a list of works by the French artist, theoretician, philosopher Albert Gleizes; one of the founders of Cubism and an influence on the School of Paris.     The artistic career of Gleizes spanned more than fifty years, from roughly 1901 to the year of his death in 1953. He was both a prolific painter and writer. This incomplete list is a selection of some of Gleizes' better-known oil paintings, or includes those for which images are available. Also listed is an extensive selection of his writings; both books and articles.    "Gleizes' individual development, his unique struggle to reconcile forces," writes the art historian Daniel Robbins, "made him one of the few painters to come out of Cubism with a wholly individual style, undeflected by later artistic movements. Although he occasionally returned to earlier subjects... these later works were treated anew, on the basis of fresh insights. He never repeated his earlier styles, never remained stationary, but always grew more intense, more passionate. [...] His life ended in 1953 but his paintings remain to testify to his willingness to struggle for final answers. His is an abstract art of deep significance and meaning, paradoxically human even in his very search for absolute order and truth." (Daniel Robbins, 1964) 1.
