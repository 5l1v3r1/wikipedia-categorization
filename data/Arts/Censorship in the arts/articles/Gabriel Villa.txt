Gabriel Villa (born 1965, El Paso, Texas, USA  ) is a Pilsen, Chicago-based artist and muralist. His influences have been "Family, U.S Texas/Mexico Border Culture, American Sports, 1960’s Counter Culture, 1980’s Reaganomics, Indigenous and Western Art".  In May 2009, he was commissioned to paint a mural on a private property in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood depicting three Chicago Police Department public surveillance cameras that carried the CPD logo along with other images, like a crucified Christ, a deer head and a skull. The mural was painted over completely by the Graffiti Blasters   at the behest of 11th ward Alderman James Balcer, who said about the mural "My main concern is the safety and well-being for the people in this community. We have gang violence and children getting shot, and I believed that the mural sent the wrong message.”  The incident sparked a local controversy over censorship, surveillance and private property.
