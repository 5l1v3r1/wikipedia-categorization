The Video Standards Council (VSC) is an administrator of the PEGI system of age rating for video games. It was established in 1989, and has been responsible for the age ratings of video games sold in the UK since 2012.  The organisation is accountable to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The VSC was established in 1989 following concerns from the Home Secretary about the video industry.  The organisation designed a code of practise  to ensure that the video and video games industries delivered their products to the public responsibly. It also provides retailers with staff training courses concerning the supply of age restricted videos and video games. Since 1994, the VSC has been responsible for the age ratings of video games. Initially, they worked on behalf of the UK Interactive Entertainment Association (formerly ELSPA). Since 2003, they have been administrators of the PEGI system, which was incorporated into UK law in 2012. Since then, the VSC has been the statutory body responsible for the age rating of video games in the UK,  which it does through its sub-body, the Games Rating Authority (GRA). The GRA also rates games for at least 30 other European countries.
