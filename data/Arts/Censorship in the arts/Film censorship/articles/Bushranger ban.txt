  The bushranger ban refers to a ban on films about bushrangers that came in effect in Australia in 1911-12. Films about bushrangers had been the most popular genre of local films ever since The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906). Governments were worried about the influence this would have on the population and bans against films depicting bushrangers were introduced in South Australia (1911), New South Wales (a 1912 amendment to the 1908 New South Wales Theatres and Public Halls Act ) and Victoria (1912).   The decision had a considerable impact on the local industry as it meant filmmakers could not work in a popular genre.  Australian film production, which in 1911 was one of the highest in the world, went into decline.   The ban was still in effect in the 1930s and hurt efforts to make a number of Australian movies, including an adaptation of Robbery Under Arms from director Ken G. Hall.   A ban on a film about Ned Kelly, When the Kellys Rode was not lifted until 1942.  The Hollywood bushranging film Stingaree (1934) was screened in every state of Australia except for New South Wales because of the ban.
