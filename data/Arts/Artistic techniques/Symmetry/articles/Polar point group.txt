In geometry,  a polar point group is a point group in which there is more than one point that every symmetry operation leaves unmoved.  Therefore, a point group with more than one axis of rotation or a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation cannot be polar. A straight line joining unmoved points defines a unique axis of rotation, unless symmetry operations do not allow any rotation at all, such as mirror symmetry, in which case, the polar direction must be parallel to any mirror planes. Of the 32 crystallographic point groups, 10 are polar:  The space groups associated with a polar point group do not have their origins uniquely determined by symmetry elements.  When materials having a polar point group crystal structure are heated or cooled, they may temporarily generate a voltage called pyroelectricity. Molecular crystals that occupy polar space groups will exhibit triboluminescence.  A common example of this is sucrose, demonstrated by smashing a wintergreen lifesaver in a darkened room.
