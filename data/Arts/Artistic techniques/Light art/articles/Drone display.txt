A drone display is the use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), often quadcopters, flying in a coordinated fashion for public display. The are usually equipped with LEDs, and the display held at night. The displays may be for entertainment, where the drones may use flocking or swarming behaviour.  The drones may also be coordinated to produce images. Using this emerging technology, displays have been employed for advertising purposes as well. Intel has produced the Shooting Star, a type of drone used in light shows.  They were used during the 2018 Winter Olympics, a Super Bowl halftime show in 2017, and a 2018 4th of July celebration.  Drone light shows differ from fireworks displays in that drones are reusable, and do not produce air and noise pollution.  However, drone displays cannot take place during rain or strong winds.
