They appeared in <a href=\"/wiki/Catalonia\" title=\"Catalonia\">Catalonia</a> in the 1850s, and have been widely used in Europe and America. They represented a revolution in flooring in their day because they were much cheaper, more durable and easier to make than the previous handmade glazed ceramic tiles and were therefore more universally available for houses, and they allowed for profuse decorative patterns, their age of splendour being the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th centuries, before they were gradually superseded by newer technology as of the 1960s, such as terrazzo, salt-glazed stoneware, etc. that didn't allow for such decorative embellishment but were cheaper.\n</p><p>They are mostly known throughout the world as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Encaustic_cement_tile&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Encaustic cement tile (page does not exist)\">encaustic cement tile</a>. Like their predecessors, encaustic clay tiles, they derive their name from the term \"encaustic\" which is an art term used for metal enameling that uses a type of lost wax procedure. They have this name because of the intricate patterns and designs that mimic the encaustic enameling process. Cement tiles are not fired; there is no glaze layer on the surface of the tile. They derive their durability from the combination of finely dehydrated ground <a href=\"/wiki/Portland_cement\" title=\"Portland cement\">Portland cement</a> layer and a more coarse layer of sand and cement. The pigment layer is hydraulically pressed into the surface and becomes a part of the tile.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Manufacture_and_quality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Manufacture and quality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cement_tile&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cement tile appeared in the 1850s in Catalonia.

Around the turn of the 20th century, the tiles were very popular and were considered a high-end floor covering. It was used in thousands of landmark public buildings and palaces.

The metal mold is handmade following specific design drawings. The pigment composition is a mixture of high quality white Portland cement, marble powder, fine sand, and natural mineral colour pigments. Cement tiles being handmade are expected to have slight imperfections, which give them character and depth.\n</p><p>There are numerous cement tile manufacturers worldwide. The primary difference between manufacturers is the hydraulic method used. Small companies employ a hand-operated hydraulic press; the quality of the tiles varies due to inconsistent pressure.  Larger manufacturers use electric-powered hydraulic presses that produce a consistently higher quality product. The higher pressure (1,500 PSI) permits a thicker pigment layer to be embedded into the cement layer. The pigment layer is usually 3\u20134&#160;mm thick.\n</p><p>Another difference is the quality of the pigments used. High quality producers use mineral-based pigments only. Non-mineral based pigments fade with age.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cement_tile&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Encaustic_tile\" title=\"Encaustic tile\">Encaustic tile</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cement_tile&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2200\nCached time: 20180920205102\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.056 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 82/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 317/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 75/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   32.260      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   32.260      1 -total\n 10.60%    3.419      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:21187578-0!canonical and timestamp 20180920205102 and revision id 853888292\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ca","url":"https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paviment_hidr%C3%A0ulic","langname":"Catalan","autonym":"catal\u00e0","*":"Paviment hidr\u00e0ulic"},{"lang":"de","url":"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zementfliese","langname":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","*":"Zementfliese"},{"lang":"es","url":"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaico_hidr%C3%A1ulico","langname":"Spanish","autonym":"espa\u00f1ol","*":"Mosaico hidr\u00e1ulico"},{"lang":"fr","url":"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carreau_ciment","langname":"French","autonym":"fran\u00e7ais","*":"Carreau ciment"},{"lang":"it","url":"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementine","langname":"Italian","autonym":"italiano","*":"Cementine"},{"lang":"pt","url":"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladrilho_hidr%C3%A1ulico","langname":"Portuguese","autonym":"portugu\u00eas","*":"Ladrilho hidr\u00e1ulico"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Tile, cement","*":"Cement"},{"sortkey":"Cement Tile","*":"Mosaic"},{"sortkey":"Cement Tile","*":"Floors"},{"sortkey":"Cement Tile","*":"Pavements"},{"sortkey":"Cement Tile","*":"Building_materials"},{"sortkey":"Cement Tile","*":"Tiling"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Catalonia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Encaustic tile"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"International Exposition (1867)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Portland cement"},{"ns":0,"*":"Encaustic cement tile"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":["Floor-stone_02.JPG","Moule_\u00e0_carreau.jpg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Cement_tile","byteoffset":1505,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Manufacture and quality","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Cement_tile","byteoffset":2130,"anchor":"Manufacture_and_quality"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Cement_tile","byteoffset":3313,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Cement_tile","byteoffset":3348,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Cement tile","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Cement Tile"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q3700458"}]}}
