Together with the standard parameters necessary to create a mosaic the following features are available: As of version 3.32[update] AndreaMosaic is available in Standard and Professional versions. Both share the same features but the Professional version exceeds the Standard version's limits of 200 megapixels and 30,000 tiles. AndreaMosaic is supported on Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 2003 and also on Mac OS X and Linux distributions through the free Wine software. The software can be installed using the standard installer or through a fully portable no-install archive. A collection of 500 sample images  is freely available. The license allows free use of the software, including commercial use, but it requires that every published or printed photographic mosaic, or derivative work, includes a reference to AndreaMosaic. Also the publishing or display to a large audience of a particular mosaic should be added to the public list of artworks created with AndreaMosaic.
