The idea of an \"intellectual\" animal was not new. A similar attraction known as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Bankes%27s_Horse\" title=\"Bankes&#39;s Horse\">Marocco</a> the thinking horse\" (c.1586\u2013c.1606) had been exhibited over a century earlier; there were also contemporary examples of the \"horse of knowledge\", exhibited for example at <a href=\"/wiki/Astley%27s_Amphitheatre\" title=\"Astley&#39;s Amphitheatre\">Astley's Amphitheatre</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> But performing horses were nothing unusual. No performing pigs are known to have been trained before.\n</p><p>The pig was shown with great success in Dublin. After Bisset's death the pig was taken over by a Mr Nicholson, who toured it in Britain.<sup id=\"cite_ref-jan_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jan-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> It was exhibited in Nottingham in 1784, coming to London in the following year.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-bent_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-bent-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> According to publicity at the time,\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>This entertaining and sagacious animal casts accounts by means of Typographical cards, in the same manner as a Printer composes, and by the same method sets down any capital or Surname, reckons the number of People present, tells by evoking on a Gentleman's Watch in company what is the Hour and Minutes; he likewise tells any Lady's Thoughts in company, and distinguishes all sorts of colours.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The show was a great success, and the pig later toured the provincial towns, returning to London later in the year and then moving on to the continent of Europe. After a career of four years a report stated that the pig died in 1788. However, a later report claimed that it had just returned from France following the revolution of 1789, and was ready to \"discourse on the Feudal System, the Rights of Kings and the Destruction of the Bastille\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-jan_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jan-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The phenomenon caused much comment. <a href=\"/wiki/James_Boswell\" title=\"James Boswell\">James Boswell</a> recalls conversations with <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Johnson\" title=\"Samuel Johnson\">Samuel Johnson</a> in which he joked about the pig's scholarship. Johnson never saw the pig. He died just before it came to London, but he commented on a report of its show in Nottingham. He suggested that  \"the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. <i>Pig</i> has, it seems, not been wanting to <i>man</i>, but <i>man</i> to <i>pig</i>. We do not allow <i>time</i> for his education, we kill him at a year old.\" Another man present joked that <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Pope\" title=\"Alexander Pope\">Alexander Pope</a> would not have used the pig as a symbol of \"the lowest degree of grovelling instinct\" in his works if this creature had been known to him, but added that the pig had probably been subject to some form of torture to force it to respond to commands. Johnson replied that at least it had escaped slaughter: \"the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been <i>educated</i>, and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The discussion about how the pig had been trained also led to disputes about the cognitive abilities of pigs; whether the animal actually recognised letters or even words, or whether it was simply responding to direct prompting. The phenomenon was also discussed in instructional literature aimed at children, to describe the essential difference between human and animal capacities and to warn against cruelty to animals, on the assumption that the pigs were badly beaten by their trainers to force them to behave. Mrs Trimmer in her children's book <i>The Robin Redbreasts</i> (1788), \"designed to teach children the proper treatment of animals\", mentions the pig in chapter entitled \"The Cruel Boy\": aiming to teach that animals are not \"mere machines, actuated by the unerring hand of Providence\", it says that the sight of the Learned Pig, \"which has lately been shown in London, has deranged these ideas, and I know not what think\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_pigs\">Later pigs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Learned_pig&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Later pigs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Toby_the_sapient_pig.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Toby_the_sapient_pig.jpg/220px-Toby_the_sapient_pig.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"363\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Toby_the_sapient_pig.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"264\" data-file-height=\"435\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Toby_the_sapient_pig.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Poster for Toby the Sapient Pig</div></div></div>\n<p>In 1798 a learned pig appeared in the United States.

Toby could \"discover a person\u2019s thoughts\", a skill \"never heard of before to be exhibited by an animal of the swine race\". Around 1817 Toby also published an autobiography, <i>The life and adventures of Toby, the sapient pig: with his opinions on men and manners. Written by himself</i>.\n</p><p>A pig owned by Pinchbeck was shown in London between 1818 and 1823. According to his publicity, the pig had acquired his wisdom from \"Souchanguyee, the Chinese Philosopher.\" He answered questions by \"pointing to cards, letters, and persons in the audience.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\"Toby\" became a standard name for a learned pig. The writer Harrison Weir depicts a learned pig called Toby, which he saw a \"year ago at Camberwell Fair\" for a penny. According to Harrison, the pig carried a correctly numbered card to a person who had called out a number; it spelled \"vittels,\" and then it left to have some, \"with a joyful grunt, and the show was over.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-bent_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-bent-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Caricature\">Caricature</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Learned_pig&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Caricature\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Downfall_of_taste.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Downfall_of_taste.JPG/220px-Downfall_of_taste.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Downfall_of_taste.JPG/330px-Downfall_of_taste.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Downfall_of_taste.JPG/440px-Downfall_of_taste.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3469\" data-file-height=\"2670\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Downfall_of_taste.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>The Downfall of Taste and Genius</i> (1784).
