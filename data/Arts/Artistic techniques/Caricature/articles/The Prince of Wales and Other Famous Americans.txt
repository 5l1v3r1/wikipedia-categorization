The Prince of Wales and Other Famous Americans is a 1925 book by Miguel Covarrubias, a Mexican cartoonist. The book features several dozen black-and-white caricatures of famous American (mostly New York-based) personalities from the 1920s. Many of the drawings were originally published in Vanity Fair magazine, which employed Covarrubias as a staff cartoonist. The book's introduction is authored by Carl Van Vechten.
