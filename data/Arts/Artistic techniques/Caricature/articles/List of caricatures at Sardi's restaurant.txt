 The following is an incomplete alphabetized list of celebrities who have posed for caricatures at Sardi's restaurant in New York City. The single common denominator is that they have all eaten at Sardi's. The date or year each caricature was added to Sardi's is often mentioned in brackets after the celebrities' name. Also mentioned is either the production the actor was in at the time of the unveiling or the play that included their definitive role; producers' companies are listed instead. Finally, some of the caricatures listed also include the cartoonist's name: Alex Gard, John Mackey, Donald Bevan and Richard Baratz are the four artists to date who have created all the caricatures in the restaurant. In 1979, Vincent Sardi, Jr. donated a collection of 227 caricatures from the restaurant to the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The contributed caricatures date from the late 1920s through 1952. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  Double portraits â€” Quadruple portraits
