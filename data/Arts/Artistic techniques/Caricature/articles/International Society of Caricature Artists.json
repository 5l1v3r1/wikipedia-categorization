Buddy created a forum for caricaturists by providing a quarterly newsletter and annual convention. The original goal was to create an organization that would seek out charitable and mutual benefits for united artists. It operated briefly as a booking agency until filing its application in compliance with article 5154a making it a trade union in 1994. In 1995 the new constitution was ratified in San Antonio, TX, the NCN was granted non-profit status, and the first election was held. In 2005, the NCN was changed into a non-profit, unincorporated association.\n</p><p>The association boasts some of the most recognizable names in the industry as members and friends of the NCN. <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_Davis_(cartoonist)\" title=\"Jack Davis (cartoonist)\">Jack Davis</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sergio_Aragones\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sergio Aragones\">Sergio Aragones</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mort_Drucker\" title=\"Mort Drucker\">Mort Drucker</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Richmond_(illustrator)\" title=\"Tom Richmond (illustrator)\">Tom Richmond (illustrator)</a> of Mad Magazine, <a href=\"/wiki/Jan_Op_De_Beeck\" title=\"Jan Op De Beeck\">Jan Op De Beeck</a>, Maria Bolton, Sam Norkin, Rudy Cristiano, Bruce Blitz, C.F. Payne, Pancho Willmarth, Mike Peters, Steve Silver and <a href=\"/wiki/Sebastian_Kr%C3%BCger\" title=\"Sebastian Kr\u00fcger\">Sebastian Kr\u00fcger</a> have all been keynote speakers and members. Many NCN members are accomplished as artists not only in caricaturing, but in other artistic fields as well.\n</p><p>The NCN officially changed its name to the International Society of Caricature Artists in 2009 to better reflect its international growth and presence. As of 2010 it has over 600 members worldwide. In recent years the International Society of Caricature Artists annual convention has featured guests of honor such as Sam Viviano, Dan Adel, Tom Richmond, Hermann Mejia, Mark Fredrickson and Bill Plympton. In 2011, ISCA will celebrate its 20th anniversary.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Society_of_Caricature_Artists&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><span class=\"official-website\"><span class=\"url\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.caricature.org\">Official website</a></span></span></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1265\nCached time: 20180904031015\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.072 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.108 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 171/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 2358/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 550/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 11/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\nLua time usage: 0.041/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.02 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   98.047      1 -total\n 69.19%   67.841      1 Template:When\n 47.39%   46.464      1 Template:Fix\n 32.27%   31.640      2 Template:Category_handler\n 30.69%   30.086      1 Template:Official_website\n 11.47%   11.247      1 Template:Delink\n  4.20%    4.119      1 Template:Fix/category\n  2.28%    2.239      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:2120050-0!canonical and timestamp 20180904031015 and revision id 844976442\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_with_vague_or_ambiguous_time"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Vague_or_ambiguous_time_from_June_2018"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Arts_and_media_trade_groups"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Caricature"},{"sortkey":"","*":"International_organizations_based_in_the_United_States"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Arts_organizations_based_in_Texas"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Arts_organizations_established_in_1989"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1989_establishments_in_the_United_States"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Vague or ambiguous time from June 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Caricature"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jack Davis (cartoonist)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jan Op De Beeck"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mort Drucker"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sebastian Kr\u00fcger"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sergio Aragones"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tom Richmond (illustrator)"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:When"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Fix"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Category handler"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Fix/category"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Delink"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Official website"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Delink"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Official website"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:URL"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.caricature.org"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"International_Society_of_Caricature_Artists","byteoffset":1083,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"International_Society_of_Caricature_Artists","byteoffset":2711,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"International Society of Caricature Artists","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6971278"}]}}
