Aaron, Son of the Devil is the name given to an anti-Semitic caricature of an English Jew appearing on an Essex county document dated 1277. The document concerns fines imposed on some Jews and Christians who had pursued a doe after it had escaped from hounds near the city of Colchester, an offence against the forest laws of the time. One Jew, however, had supposedly evaded arrest and became the subject of the caricature. The caricature is the earliest dated portrait of a Jew.  He wears the medieval English Jewish badge (the two tablets resembling windows) on his upper garments.
