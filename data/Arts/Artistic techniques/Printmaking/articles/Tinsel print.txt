A  Tinsel print  is a rare type of old master print parts of which are  decorated with small thin shiny fragments of metal or quartz crystal applied to glue. Gold leaf fragments were used on some, and colour was applied before the tinsel. Hind   cites fewer than ten examples as being "practically all whose location is known... all seem to date between about 1430 and 1460". All are religious woodcuts, and probably German in origin.
