The Glasgow Looking Glass was the first mass-produced publication to tell stories using illustrations, and as such is regarded as the earliest comics magazine.  The final issue was published on 3 April 1826.  The title was published by Glasgow lithographic printer John Watson  and its principal strip illustrator was William Heath.  The fourth issue contained History of a Coat, its first comic strip. After the fifth issue, the title was changed to The Northern Looking Glass to reflect broader Scottish concerns. The fortnightly publication provided satirical snapshots of Glasgow society, British culture and Nineteenth century fashions. Innovations included use of the term "To be continued" and word balloons.
