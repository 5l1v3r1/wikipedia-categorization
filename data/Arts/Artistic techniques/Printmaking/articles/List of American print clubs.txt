This is a list of American artist printmaking societies and print clubs in chronological order of their founding. Note: The purpose of this timeline is to focus on the organization of artist printmakers into societies, and not to focus on clubs of collectors. The distinction between "society" and "club" is not necessarily reflected in the name of the organization nor in the inclusion of an organization in this list.
