A digiglyph is the final stage of a printmaking process that combines traditional monoprinting techniques with digital manipulation and outsourcing. A digiglyph differs from a traditional monoprint or monotype in that it uses a completed hand-drawn monoprint/monotype as the first stage of a final piece. The monoprint is scanned, and then its composition is further manipulated using computer software, before being reprinted and hand embellished. Digital digiglyph files can be used to produce editions; however, hand embellishment of each print transforms the digiglyph into a one-of-a-kind image. Starting out as a traditional monoprint, the digiglyph departs from hand work by using computer software to scan the completed print and layer in conceptually related material. The completed digital composition is exported and the finished digital print is then embellished by hand, creating a unique print.
