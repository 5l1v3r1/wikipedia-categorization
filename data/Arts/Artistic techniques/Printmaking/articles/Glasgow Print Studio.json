Finding nowhere that they could continue printmaking after graduation, they were supported by the <a href=\"/wiki/Glasgow_School_of_Art\" title=\"Glasgow School of Art\">Glasgow School of Art</a>'s Head of Printmaking, Philip Reeves, to establish their own workshop.\n</p><p>As membership of the organisation increased, the 1976 move to Ingram Street in the city centre provided a larger workshop plus a gallery. Here, artists had a space to sell their work and the programme ranged from contemporary print to the popular Scottish Cartoonists exhibition and a retrospective by <a href=\"/wiki/L._S._Lowry\" title=\"L. S. Lowry\">LS Lowry</a>. At Ingram Street, the Print Studio was at the centre of a social and artistic whirl. Bands played and plays were performed in the gallery, while the Print Studio Press published books by Scottish writers including <a href=\"/wiki/Liz_Lochhead\" title=\"Liz Lochhead\">Liz Lochead</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Alasdair_Gray\" title=\"Alasdair Gray\">Alasdair Gray</a>. The Studio also organised an annual Midsummer Ball, which became a key event in Glasgow\u2019s social calendar.\n</p><p>Fruitful relationships have developed with established artists such as <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_Blackadder\" title=\"Elizabeth Blackadder\">Elizabeth Blackadder</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Wiszniewski\" title=\"Adrian Wiszniewski\">Adrian Wiszniewski</a>, Scott Myles, <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Lambie\" title=\"Jim Lambie\">Jim Lambie</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Claire_Barclay\" title=\"Claire Barclay\">Claire Barclay</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ciara_Phillips\" title=\"Ciara Phillips\">Ciara Philips</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Byrne_(playwright)\" title=\"John Byrne (playwright)\">John Byrne</a>, who work collaboratively with the Studio\u2019s master printers. The Studio offers both traditional and digital printing facilities and uses its expertise to work with contemporary galleries like <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Modern_Institute&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Modern Institute (page does not exist)\">The Modern Institute</a>.
