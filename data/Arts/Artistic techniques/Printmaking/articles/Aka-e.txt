An aka-e (赤絵 "red picture") is a type of ukiyo-e that is printed entirely or predominantly in red.  Aka-e were said to be talismans against smallpox, especially when they bore images of Shōki the demon queller.  A woodblock print having a significant portion of the design entirely in red may also be considered to be an aka-e.
