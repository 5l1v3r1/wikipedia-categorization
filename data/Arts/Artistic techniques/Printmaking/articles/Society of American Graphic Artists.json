Founding members included Troy Kinney, Eugene Higgins, Fred Reynolds, Paul Roche, and Ernest Roth. Approximately 200 etchings by sixty-five artists including John Taylor Arms, Frank W. Benson, Mary Cassatt, Childe Hassam, John Marin, and Mahonri Young where exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum as part of the organization\u2019s inaugural exhibition.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The organization continued to grow aggressively during the first fifteen years of its existence with both the membership and number of prints exhibited at the annual exhibitions tripling. The first international exhibition was organized at the Anderson Galleries in New York in 1922, including works by several major European and American artists such as Mary Cassatt, Ernest Haskell, Childe Hassam, Edward Hopper, Wilhelm Lembrook, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Camille Pissarro, and John Sloan. \n</p><p>The organization decided to rename to the Society of American Etchers, Inc. since membership had grown to include many other geographic areas beyond Brooklyn, and the exhibitions were moved from the Brooklyn Museum to the National Arts Club in New York. Membership grew to include important printmakers of the 1930s including Isabelle Bishop, Mina Citron, Kenneth Hayes, Stanley William Hayter, John Sloan and Reginald Marsh. Further, it was during this time that exhibit exchanges with European print clubs were organized. \n</p><p>In 1947, the society organized the largest show in its history, a collection of over 650 prints at the National Academy. Since many of these prints utilized techniques such as woodcut, wood engraving, and lithography, the organization was renamed to the Society of American Etchers, Gravers, Lithographers, and Woodcutters, Inc. and then again to its current designation the Society of American Graphic Artists in 1952.\n</p><p>With the ever changing climate of visual arts, printmaking has also undergone changes from the birth of non-objectivity, to surrealism, abstraction and beyond. A study of the catalogues of SAGA's exhibitions reflects these changes but it also shows SAGA's openness to all styles. In this respect the society has always followed the precept of its longtime president from 1931 to 1952, John Taylor Arms, who felt that SAGA should represent all techniques and styles in order to represent a true cross section of contemporary printmaking.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_past_and_present_members\">Notable past and present members</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Society_of_American_Graphic_Artists&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Notable past and present members\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Since its inception, SAGA has promoted many renowned professional artists as members and exhibitors.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_members\">Notable members</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Society_of_American_Graphic_Artists&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Notable members\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Grace Albee, John Taylor Arms, Will Barnet, <a href=\"/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore\" title=\"Lionel Barrymore\">Lionel Barrymore</a>, Isabelle Bishop, Jean Charlot, Mina Citron, Howard Cook, Adolph Dehn, Johan Gross-Bettelheim, Childe Hassam, Kenneth Hayes, Stanley William Hayter, Edward Hopper, Marvin Jules, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Robert_Kipniss_(Artist)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Robert Kipniss (Artist) (page does not exist)\">Robert Kipniss</a>, Kathe Kollowitz, Armin Landeck, Claire Leighton, Wilhelm Lembrook, Martin Lewis, John Marin, Reginald Marsh, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_A._Noble_(Artist)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"John A.
