Pastels or pastel colors belong to a pale family of colors, which, when described in the HSV color space, have high value and low to intermediate saturation.   The name comes from pastels, art media characteristic of this color family. The colors of this family are usually described as "soothing",  "soft", "near neutral", "milky", "washed out", "desaturated", and lacking strong chromatic content.  Pink, mauve,  and baby blue  are commonly used pastel colors, as well as magic mint, periwinkle, and lavender. In the 1980s, there was a huge trend of pastel colors in men's fashion. In particular, the NBC television police series Miami Vice popularized what was already a growing trend even further as its lead character Sonny Crocket (Don Johnson) all but exclusively wore pastel shirts and suits, setting a fashion that stood popular even years after the show ended. The abundance of pastel was, and still is, also visible in the shooting locations with Art Deco buildings around the Miami area. There is also a type of goth style called pastel goth which combines the pastel color pallet with classical goth fashion elements.
