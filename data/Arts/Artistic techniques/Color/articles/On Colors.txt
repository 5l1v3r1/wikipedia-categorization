[*]: Authenticity disputed On Colors (Greek Περὶ χρωμάτων; Latin De Coloribus) is a treatise attributed to Aristotle  but sometimes ascribed to Theophrastus or Strato. The work outlines the theory that all colors (yellow, red, purple, green, and blue) are derived from mixtures of black and white. On colors had a pronounced impact on subsequent color theories and remained influential until Isaac Newton's experiments with light refraction.
