{"parse":{"title":"King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre","pageid":21759440,"revid":762927679,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre</b> is a region in the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Riyadh\" title=\"Riyadh\">Riyadh</a>, the capital of <a href=\"/wiki/Saudi_Arabia\" title=\"Saudi Arabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>. It is not the \"historic center\" of the city as this lies to the south around <a href=\"/wiki/Masmak\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Masmak\">Masmak</a> fort and the main Friday Mosque\" in the Dira district. The origin of the <i>King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre</i> is the former compound of <a href=\"/wiki/Murabba_Palace\" title=\"Murabba Palace\">the Murabba' Palace</a>, that was built in 1936/37 by <a href=\"/wiki/Ibn_Saud\" title=\"Ibn Saud\">King Abdul Aziz</a> about one and a half kilometers to the north of the old city and well outside of the then still existing city walls. \n</p><p>After 1953 the palace compound ceased to be used as main royal residence and slowly fell into dissuse. The \"Murabba' Development Project\" was later started to make use of the area for projects involved with the <i>Centennial Celebrations</i> in 1999.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As such the area was chosen to be the site of several cultural institutions focusing on the national history in general and the history of the current Saudi State and its founder in detail. Consequently what had remained of the old palace compound buildings was restored or remodeled on plans similar to the original buildings. The surrounding area was made into a landscape of parks and plazas and new buildings were built such as the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Museum_of_Saudi_Arabia\" title=\"National Museum of Saudi Arabia\">National Museum of Saudi Arabia</a>.\n</p><p>The units on the west side of the area are from south to north: A remodeled mosque, the old original Murabba' Palace with main Diwan renovated as \"living museum\", the \"Memorial Hall\" on the outlines of an old courtyard house, a modern exhibition hall for the car collection, on the footprints of the old majlis and assembly hall the new Al-Dara main lobby and multipurpose hall, a documentation center with a separated men's and women's library each, an art gallery and a large internal garden. On the east side the new <i>National Museum of Saudi Arabia</i> was built together with the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=King_Abdul_Aziz_Foundation_for_Research_and_Archives&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives (page does not exist)\">King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives</a>. To the south the area around the old water tower has been remodelled and now includes a small theme park. The whole project is said to have cost some 680 million Saudi riyals (about 181.33 million U.S. dollars at the time)<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and covers an area of some 360,000 square meters (3,000,000 sq ft).<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_and_references\">Notes and references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=King_Abdul_Aziz_Historical_Centre&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Notes and references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=9686\">Project</a> listed at Archnet.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>Saudi Arabia Celebrates the Centennial of a Historic Event</i> in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagWinter99/centennial.htm\">Saudi Arabia Magazine Winter 1999, Volume 15, Number 4</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/saudi.arabia.s.centennial.the.centennial.s.jewel.riyadh.htm\"><i>Saudi Arabia\u2019s Centennial: The Centennial\u2019s Jewel\u2014Riyadh</i></a> by Arthur Clark in <a href=\"/wiki/Saudi_Aramco_World\" title=\"Saudi Aramco World\">Saudi Aramco World</a>, issue 1 from 1999.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2231\nCached time: 20180919081022\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.020 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.034 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 104/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 383/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 97/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 1395/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   22.633      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   22.633      1 -total\n 13.72%    3.105      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:21759440-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919081022 and revision id 762927679\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%83_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%8A","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"History_of_Saudi_Arabia"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Riyadh"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Museum_districts"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Organisations_based_in_Riyadh"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ibn Saud"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Masmak"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Murabba Palace"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Museum of Saudi Arabia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Riyadh"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Saudi Arabia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Saudi Aramco World"},{"ns":0,"*":"King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=9686","http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagWinter99/centennial.htm","http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/saudi.arabia.s.centennial.the.centennial.s.jewel.riyadh.htm"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Notes and references","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"King_Abdul_Aziz_Historical_Centre","byteoffset":2762,"anchor":"Notes_and_references"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6411199"}]}}
