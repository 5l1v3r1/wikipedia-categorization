Rosicrucian Park is the headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas of the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, located in San Jose, California. The Rosicrucian Park was established in 1927 by Harvey Spencer Lewis. It grew from one single lot to a 5-acre city block.  The museum was built in 1932, the Planetarium in 1936, the research library opened in June 1939. The Akhenaton Shrine was built in 1949.  The Peace Garden was added to the park in 2004 and dedicated by Rosicrucian Imperator Christian Bernard. In 2013, a new Alchemy Museum was announced for 2015.  The opening ceremony occurred during the Summer solstice of June 2015. The new museum includes an alchemy laboratory. The Alchemy garden in front of the new museum is composed of four elemental gardens representing the four elements.   From 2009 to 2015, the Park reduced its water consumption by 4.5 million gallons.  The park takes up nearly an entire city block and includes the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, the administration building for the Order, the Rosicrucian Planetarium, the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, the Rosicrucian Research Library, the Grand Temple, and a central fountain plaza and gardens. A rose garden is incorporated in the Park next to the Research Library. The park also includes the Akhenaten Shrine (named for the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten), which contains the ashes of AMORC founder Harvey Spencer Lewis and other former officials of the order. With the exception of the planetarium, all buildings in Rosicrucian Park were constructed with exteriors inspired by the Ancient Egyptian architectural tradition. In tribute to their claimed Egyptian heritage, cyperus papyrus plants are also incorporated into the landscaping.
