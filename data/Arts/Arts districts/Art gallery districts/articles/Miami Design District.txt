The Design District, historically a part of Buena Vista, is a neighborhood within the city of Miami, Florida, United States, south of Lemon City (Little Haiti).  It is roughly bound by North 36 St (US 27) to the south, North 43rd Street to the north, West First Avenue to the west and Biscayne Boulevard to the east.  The Design District was made up primarily of old low-rise warehouses that have been converted into retail spaces, art galleries, restaurants and cafés, but now includes a large amount of new construction, primarily for high-end retail.  The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy Wynwood neighborhood to the south, Lemon City (Little Haiti) and the historic 1920s Buena Vista neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy Upper East Side neighborhoods to the east. After decades of falling to urban decay, the Design District has risen to fame as a destination for the arts, design, and fashion. It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, architecture firms, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars.  Historically, the area today known as the Design District was originally known as Buena Vista. Today, the area has become its own, and is known colloquially as the Design District. Signs and names with the name Buena Vista can still be seen throughout the area such as the Buena Vista Post Office, and Buena Vista School. By the 1980s and early-1990s, the Design District had fallen to urban decay, and it wasn't until the late 1990s, and early 2000s, that art and design stores began opening up in the Design District. Throughout the 2000s, the Design District continued to grow in popularity, and with heavy public and private investment in the neighborhood, the streets and sidewalks were redone, and new trees were planted.  Credited to starting the district is Craig Robins, who purchased many run-down buildings in the 18 square block area and persuaded many top designers, such as Alison Spear, Holly Hunt and Peter Page to relocate.  On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit the Design District, Wynwood, and Midtown Miami areas to avoid getting the Zika virus.   The District is home to many flagship luxury stores including Hermès, Tom Ford, Louis Vuitton, Christian Louboutin, Prada, Celine and more.  Currently, there are over 70 stores open in the District, with another 60 set to open by mid-2017.  In 2009, the first luxury retailer opened in the Design District, Christian Louboutin, marking a new era for the Design District. Later that year, Yohji Yamamoto opened in the Design District. In 2011, Louis Vuitton announced plans to open a Louis Vuitton store in the neighborhood by 2014 after announcing its closure of its Bal Harbour Shops store (the first Louis Vuitton store to open outside of New York City), along with opening other brands from the LVMH company in the Design District, including stores such as Sephora, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, and Fendi.  In October 2011, Hermes, Cartier and Dior announced plans to move their stores from Bal Harbour Shops to the Design District in late 2011 and 2012.  Design Within Reach opened an 11,000-square foot design store in the district on Feb 1st, 2013.   The three-story, 13,000-square-foot Hermès store opened in November 2015 and is only the third U.S. flagship after Madison Avenue in New York City and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, CA.  By the end of 2017, Dacra will have 120 stores open on its own property, and other property owners will have another 40. Stores to open include, Be Miami, Aesop, Citco, Creed, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Faubourg Galerie & Café, Isabel Marant, Joseph, Loro Piana, Rag & Bone, Tod’s, Tory Burch, Van Cleef & Arpels, Saint Laurent, Sevan Biçakçi and Zilli.  The Design District offers a variety of dining options, including  James Beard Award-winning chef/owner Michael Schwartz's Michael's Genuine and the Cypress Tavern.  Future 2016 offerings will include ABC Kitchen from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and four restaurants from decorated Michelin Guidestar chef Joël Robuchon. All four restaurants, L'Atelier, Le Bar, La Boutique and La Terrace will open in what will be called Paradise Plaza, on the north end of the Design District, part of the area's Phase Three build out.  The Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (ICA Miami), promotes the work of contemporary artists, and the exchange of art and ideas throughout the Miami region and internationally.
