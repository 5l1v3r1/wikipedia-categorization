Is triangular, has 115.000 m (11.5 ha) surface and is limited by the street Acera de Recoletos, the Paseo de los Filipinos and Paseo de Zorrilla.  Its main entrance is in the Plaza de Zorrilla, where together with a modern bill gate lies a floral shield of the city. The park is closed around its perimeter by a simple fence that runs between pillars, with doors on all sides. Compared with the Retiro Park in Madrid is 10 times smaller in size (11'5 hectares compared to 118) and almost 30 times smaller in size than the Central Park in New York City (11'5 hectares compared to 341). Its origin as a park or, more specifically, as a garden area, dates back to 1787, although from the fifteenth century must be regarded as an important urban space.   A notable feature of the park is the abundant bird population. Spread over the surface lies a Faisanera, an aviary and a loft belonging to Castilla Pigeon Club, which make the peacocks, pheasants and pigeons very numerous and they've become the real inhabitants of the park. It has a variety of trees that are a true botanical garden. At various points in its history called Field of Truth and then Field of Mars but finally consolidated as Campo Grande.
