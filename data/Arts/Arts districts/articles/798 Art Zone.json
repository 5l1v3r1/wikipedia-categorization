By 1951, 156 \"joint factory\" projects had been realized under that agreement, part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Government of the People&#39;s Republic of China\">Chinese government</a>'s first <a href=\"/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China\" title=\"Five-year plans of China\">Five-Year Plan</a>. However the <a href=\"/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army\" title=\"People&#39;s Liberation Army\">People's Liberation Army</a> still had a dire need of modern electronic components, which were produced in only two of the joint factories. The Russians were unwilling to undertake an additional project at the time, and suggested that the Chinese turn to <a href=\"/wiki/East_Germany\" title=\"East Germany\">East Germany</a> from which much of the Soviet Union's electronics equipment was imported. So at the request of then-Premier <a href=\"/wiki/Zhou_Enlai\" title=\"Zhou Enlai\">Zhou Enlai</a>, scientists and engineers joined the first Chinese trade delegation to East Germany in 1951, visiting a dozen factories. The project was green-lighted in early 1952 and a Chinese preparatory group was sent to <a href=\"/wiki/East_Berlin\" title=\"East Berlin\">East Berlin</a> to prepare design plans. This project, which was to be the largest by East Germany in China, was then informally known as Project #157.\n</p><p>The architectural plans were left to the Germans, who chose a functional <a href=\"/wiki/Bauhaus\" title=\"Bauhaus\">Bauhaus</a>-influenced design over the more ornamental <a href=\"/wiki/Stalinist_architecture\" title=\"Stalinist architecture\">Soviet style</a>, triggering the first of many disputes between the German and Russian consultants on the project. The plans, where <a href=\"/wiki/Form_follows_function\" title=\"Form follows function\">form follows function</a>, called for large indoor spaces designed to let the maximum amount of natural light into the workplace. Arch-supported sections of the ceiling would curve upwards then fall diagonally along the high slanted banks or windows; this pattern would be repeated several times in the larger rooms, giving the roof its characteristic sawtooth-like appearance. Despite Beijing's northern location, the windows were all to face north because the light from that direction would cast fewer shadows.\n</p><p>The chosen location was a 640,000 square metre area in Dashanzi, then a low-lying patch of farmland northeast of Beijing. The complex was to occupy 500,000 square metres, 370,000 of which were allocated to living quarters. It was officially named <b>Joint Factory 718</b>, following the Chinese government's method of naming military factories starting with the number 7. Fully funded by the Chinese side, the initial budget was enormous for the times: 9 million <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_ruble\" title=\"Soviet ruble\">rubles</a> or approximately 140 million <a href=\"/wiki/Renminbi\" title=\"Renminbi\">RMB</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/US$\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US$\">US$</a>17 million) at today's rates; actual costs were 147 million RMB.\n</p><p>Ground was broken in April 1954. Construction was marked by disagreements between the Chinese, Soviet and German experts, which led at one point to a six-month postponement of the project. The Germans' harshest critic was the Russian technology consultant in charge of Beijing's two Soviet-built electronics factories (714 and 738), who was also head consultant of the Radio Industrial Office of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The disputes generally revolved around the Germans' high but expensive quality standards for buildings and machines, which were called \"over-engineering\" by the Russians. Among such points of contention was the Germans' insistence, historical seismic data in hand, that the buildings be built to withstand <a href=\"/wiki/Earthquakes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Earthquakes\">earthquakes</a> of magnitude 8 on the <a href=\"/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale\" title=\"Richter magnitude scale\">Richter scale</a>, whereas the Chinese and Russians wanted to settle for 7. Communications expert Wang Zheng, head of Communications Industry in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and supporter the East German bid from the start, ruled in favor of the Germans for this particular factory.\n</p><p>At the height of the construction effort, more than 100 East German foreign experts worked on the project. The resources of as many as 22 of their factories supplied the construction; at the same time, supply delays were caused by the Soviet <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Army\" title=\"Red Army\">Red Army</a>'s tremendous drain on East Germany's industrial production. The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the <a href=\"/wiki/Trans-Siberian_railway\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trans-Siberian railway\">Trans-Siberian railway</a>, and a 15&#160;km track of railroad between <a href=\"/wiki/Beijing_Railway_Station\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beijing Railway Station\">Beijing Railway Station</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Beijing_east_railway_station\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beijing east railway station\">Dongjiao Station</a> was built especially to service the factory. <a href=\"/wiki/Caltech\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Caltech\">Caltech</a>-educated scientist Dr. Luo Peilin (\u7f57\u6c9b\u9716), formerly head of the preparatory group in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase. Dr. Luo, now retired in Beijing, is remembered by his former colleagues as a dedicated <a href=\"/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)\" title=\"Perfectionism (psychology)\">perfectionist</a> whose commitment to the obstacle-strewn project was a major factor of its eventual success.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Operation\">Operation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Operation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:798artzone2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/798artzone2.jpg/300px-798artzone2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"185\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/798artzone2.jpg/450px-798artzone2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/798artzone2.jpg/600px-798artzone2.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1600\" data-file-height=\"985\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:798artzone2.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Joint Factory 718</div></div></div>\n<p>Joint Factory 718 began production in 1957, amid a grandiose opening ceremony and display of Communist brotherhood between China and East Germany, attended by high officials of both countries. The first director was <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Rui_(Communist_Party_of_China)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Li Rui (Communist Party of China)\">Li Rui</a> (\u674e\u745e), who had been involved in the early negotiations in Berlin.\n</p><p>The factory quickly established a reputation for itself as one of the best in China. Through its several <i>danwei</i> or \"<a href=\"/wiki/Work_unit\" title=\"Work unit\">work units</a>\", it offered considerable social benefits to its 10,000-20,000 workers, especially considering the relative poverty of the country during such periods as the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward\" title=\"Great Leap Forward\">Great Leap Forward</a>. The factory boasted, among others:\n</p>\n<ul><li>the best housing available to workers in Beijing, providing fully furnished rooms to whole families for less than 1/30 of the workers' income;</li>\n<li>diverse extracurricular activities such as social and sporting events, dancing, swimming, and training classes;</li>\n<li>its own athletics, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams for men and women, ranked among the best in inter-factory competitions;</li>\n<li>a brigade of German-made motorcycles, performing races and stunt demonstrations;</li>\n<li>an orchestra that played not only revolutionary hymns, but also German-influenced classical Western music;</li>\n<li>literary clubs and publications, and a library furnished with Chinese and foreign (German) books;</li>\n<li>Jiuxianqiao hospital, featuring German equipment and offering the most advanced dental facilities in China.</li></ul>\n<p>The factory even had its own volunteer military reserves or <i>jinweishi</i> (\u8fd1\u536b\u5e08), which numbered hundreds and were equipped with large-scale weapons and <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-aircraft_gun\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anti-aircraft gun\">anti-aircraft guns</a>.\n</p><p>Workers' skills were honed by frequent personnel exchanges, internships and training in cooperation with East Germany. Different incentives kept motivation high, such as rewards systems and \"model worker\" distinctions. At the same time, political activities such as <a href=\"/wiki/Maoism\" title=\"Maoism\">Maoism</a> study workshops kept the workers in line with <a href=\"/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China\" title=\"Communist Party of China\">Communist Party of China</a> doctrine.

The first Head of sub-Factory 798 (the largest) was Branch Party Secretary Fu Ke (\u5085\u514b), who played a major role in recruiting skilled workers from southern China and among returned <a href=\"/wiki/Overseas_Chinese\" title=\"Overseas Chinese\">overseas Chinese</a>.\n</p><p>However, the factory came under pressure during Deng Xiaoping's <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform\" title=\"Chinese economic reform\">reforms</a> of the 1980s. Deprived of governmental support like many <a href=\"/wiki/State-owned_enterprises\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"State-owned enterprises\">state-owned enterprises</a>, it underwent a gradual decline and was eventually rendered obsolete. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, most sub-factories had ceased production, 60% of the workers had been <a href=\"/wiki/Unemployment\" title=\"Unemployment\">laid off</a>, and the remains of the management were reconstituted as a real-estate operation called \"Seven-Star Huadian Science and Technology Group\", charged with overseeing the industrial park and finding tenants for the abandoned buildings.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Artistic_rebirth\">Artistic rebirth</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Artistic rebirth\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Dashanzi factory complex was vacated at around the time when most of Beijing's contemporary artist community was looking for a new home. <a href=\"/wiki/Avant-garde\" title=\"Avant-garde\">Avant-garde</a> art being frowned upon by the government, the community had traditionally existed on the fringes of the city. From 1984 to 1995, they worked in run-down houses near the <a href=\"/wiki/Old_Summer_Palace\" title=\"Old Summer Palace\">Old Summer Palace</a> (Yuanmingyuan) in northwestern Beijing, until their <a href=\"/wiki/Eviction\" title=\"Eviction\">eviction</a>. Many then moved to the eastern Tongxian County (now <a href=\"/wiki/Tongzhou_District,_Beijing\" title=\"Tongzhou District, Beijing\">Tongzhou District</a>), more than an hour's drive from the city center.\n</p><p>Then in 1995, Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), looking for cheap, ample workshop space away from downtown, set up in the now defunct Factory 706. The temporary move became permanent and in 2000 <a href=\"/wiki/Sui_Jianguo\" title=\"Sui Jianguo\">Sui Jianguo</a>(\u968b\u5efa\u56fd), Dean of the Department of <a href=\"/wiki/Sculpture\" title=\"Sculpture\">Sculpture</a>, located his own studio in the area. The cluttered sculpture workshops have always remained open for visitors to peek at the dozens of workers milling about.\n</p><p>In 2001, American Robert Bernell (considered by many to be the founder of contemporary 798) moved his Timezone 8 Art Books bookshop, gallery and publishing office into a former factory canteen; he was the first <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/laowai\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:laowai\">foreigner</a> to move in. One of Timezone 8's early employees was fashion designer Xiao Li, who along her husband, performance artist <a href=\"/wiki/Cang_Xin\" title=\"Cang Xin\">Cang Xin</a>,and Bernell,  helped artists secure and rent spaces in the area.\n</p><p>Through word-of-mouth, artists and designers started trickling in, attracted to the vast cathedral-like spaces. Despite the lack of any conscious aesthetic in the Bauhaus-inspired style, which grounded architectural beauty in practical, industrial function, the swooping arcs and soaring <a href=\"/wiki/Chimney\" title=\"Chimney\">chimneys</a> had an uplifting effect on modern eyes, a sort of <a href=\"/wiki/Post-industrial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Post-industrial\">post-industrial</a> chic. At the artists' requests, workers renovating the spaces preserved the prominent Maoist slogans on the arches, adding a touch of ironic \"<a href=\"/wiki/Mao_Zedong\" title=\"Mao Zedong\">Mao</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Kitsch\" title=\"Kitsch\">kitsch</a>\" to the place.\n</p><p>Later that year, Mr. Tabata Yukihito from Japan's Tokyo Gallery set up  Beijing Tokyo Art Projects (BTAP, \u5317\u4eac\u4e1c\u4eac\u827a\u672f\u5de5\u7a0b) inside a 400-m\u00b2 division of Factory 798's main area; this was the first renovated space featuring the high arched ceilings that would become synonymous with the Art District. BTAP's 2002 opening exhibition \"Beijing Afloat\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Curator\" title=\"Curator\">curator</a>: <a href=\"/wiki/Feng_Boyi\" title=\"Feng Boyi\">Feng Boyi</a>), drew a crowd of over 1,000 people and marked the beginning of the popular infatuation with the area.\n</p><p>In 2002, designer artist <a href=\"/wiki/Huang_Rui\" title=\"Huang Rui\">Huang Rui</a> (\u9ec4\u9510) and <a href=\"/wiki/Hutong\" title=\"Hutong\">hutong</a> photographer Xu Yong (\u5f90\u52c7) set up the 798 Space gallery (\u65f6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4) next to BTAP. With its cavernous 1200-m\u00b2 floor and multiple-arched ceilings at the center of Factory 798, it was and still is the symbolic center of the whole district. (Huang and Xu since designed at least seven spaces in the area and became the prime movers and <a href=\"/wiki/De_facto\" title=\"De facto\">de facto</a> spokespersons of the District.) A glass-fronted caf\u00e9 was set up in the former office section at the back of the 798 space, opening into a back alley now lined with studios and restaurants such as Huang's own At Caf\u00e9, and Cang Xin's #6 <a href=\"/wiki/Szechuan_cuisine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Szechuan cuisine\">Sichuan</a> restaurant, the area's \"canteen\".\n</p><p>In 2003, Lu Jie (\u5362\u6770) set up the Long March Foundation, an ongoing project for artistic re-interpretation of the historical <a href=\"/wiki/Long_March\" title=\"Long March\">Long March</a>, inside the 25,000 <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_units\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chinese units\"><i>Li</i></a> Cultural Transmission Center (\u4e8c\u4e07\u4e94\u5343\u91cc\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5fc3). Around that time, Singapore-owned China Art Seasons (\u5317\u4eac\u5b63\u8282\u753b\u5eca) opened for display for pan-Asian art, and was one of several new galleries setting up at that time.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_exhibitions\">Notable exhibitions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notable exhibitions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Several <a href=\"/wiki/Art_exhibition\" title=\"Art exhibition\">exhibitions</a> of note took place in 2003.

In September, \"Left Hand - Right Hand\" (curator: <a href=\"/wiki/Feng_Boyi\" title=\"Feng Boyi\">Feng Boyi</a>) showcased Chinese and German sculptors at 798 Space and Daoyaolu Workshop A. Among the works was Sui Jianguo's enormous <a href=\"/wiki/Concrete\" title=\"Concrete\">concrete</a> sculpture \"Mao's Right Hand\", which is just what the name suggests, and an example of modern Chinese art's ironic reflections on history.\n</p><p>The first <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bjbiennale.com.cn\">Beijing Biennale</a> was held on September 18, 2003 at the Art District and featured 14 exhibitions. \"Tui-Transfiguration\" (curator: Wu Hung; <i>tui</i> here roughly means <i><a href=\"/wiki/Moult\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Moult\">moult</a></i>) featured photographs by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=East_Village_(Beijing)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"East Village (Beijing) (page does not exist)\">East Village</a> chronicler Rong Rong (\u8363\u8363) and his wife, Japan-born Inri (\u6620\u91cc).

This first edition, named <i>Radiance and Resonance/Signals of Time</i> (\u5149\u2022\u97f3 / \u5149\u9634), was beset by logistical problems arising from landowner Seven-Star Group's increasing irritation with the art community. As such, the festival became as much a public protest against the area's upcoming destruction that a showcase of art itself.\n</p><p>One of the most (in)famous displays at the Festival was performance artist He Yunchang having himself <a href=\"/wiki/Cement\" title=\"Cement\">cemented</a> shut in a wooden box with only two pipes for <a href=\"/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)\" title=\"Ventilation (architecture)\">ventilation</a>, and staying there for 24 hours before being chiseled out, prompting the proverbial \"<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Is_it_art%3F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Is it art?

In 2000\u20132001, rents were 0.8 RMB per square metre per day (24 RMB or US$2.90/m\u00b2/month, or about US$0.27/sq.foot/month). They increased slightly to 30 RMB/m\u00b2/month in 2003, and then doubled to 60 RMB/m\u00b2/month (US$0.67/sq.foot/month) in 2004.

Some (but not all) of the resident artists and their patrons are quite rich compared to other occupants of the area, the remaining factory workers. Some of the workshops are still operational on a small scale, mostly doing car repair or industrial laundry.\n</p><p>Some local artists such as Zhang Zhaohui, a New York-trained art critic and curator, and architect Zhu Jun, a new Dashanzi resident, have criticized the Art District as being less about art and more about show. Says Zhang: \"Few of the artists come to seriously practice art. Most of them just come for opportunities to exhibit and sell works or just have parties and gatherings.\" (<i>China Daily</i>)<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> On the other hand, young artists like Zhang Yue find this atmosphere particularly conducive to establishing one's career.

The artists who later moved there were attracted from the fringes of the city as well. However, the area today sits right on the strategic corridor between the <a href=\"/wiki/Beijing_Capital_Airport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beijing Capital Airport\">Capital Airport</a> and downtown Beijing along the <a href=\"/wiki/Airport_Expressway_(Beijing)\" title=\"Airport Expressway (Beijing)\">Airport Expressway</a>. In the context of China's current <a href=\"/wiki/Real_estate\" title=\"Real estate\">real estate</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Bubble_(economics)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bubble (economics)\">bubble</a>, the district is highly likely to be demolished in the near future. Hints of development are already appearing with the western entrances of the complex flanked by the Jiuxian and Hongyuan luxury apartment towers. There is all the current government projects which call for the expansion of the neighbouring <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_park\" title=\"Industrial park\">industrial park</a> to turn all of Dashanzi into a high-tech development zone similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Zhongguancun\" title=\"Zhongguancun\">Zhongguancun</a>. Landowner Seven-Star Group thus hopes to re-employ some of the 10,000 laid-off workers it is still responsible for.\n</p><p>\nInfluential members of the artist community and architects are <a href=\"/wiki/Lobbying\" title=\"Lobbying\">lobbying</a> various government instances to persuade them to allow the old buildings to remain, as part of a cultural center which Beijing otherwise lacks and that can only grow organically. In 2003, International Architects Salon roped in architects from various international architectural associations and renowned architects like <a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_Tschumi\" title=\"Bernard Tschumi\">Bernard Tschumi</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Coop_Himmelblau\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coop Himmelblau\">Coop Himmelblau</a>'s Wolf Prix to hammer in the point how attractive spaces like Factory 798 can be to international design community. They point out that such communities are important if Beijing, and China, is to become a major source of creative design instead of mere low cost low value-added manufacturing. (This issue has far-reaching implications in the domain of <a href=\"/wiki/Intellectual_property\" title=\"Intellectual property\">intellectual property</a> protection in China - some experts believe that the local IP laws will start to be enforced only when China becomes a source of its own intellectual property.)</p><div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:798ArtZone2009.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/798ArtZone2009.jpg/300px-798ArtZone2009.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"203\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/798ArtZone2009.jpg/450px-798ArtZone2009.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/798ArtZone2009.jpg/600px-798ArtZone2009.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1857\" data-file-height=\"1256\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:798ArtZone2009.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Patrons stroll through the 798 Art Zone, Beijing, April 2009</div></div></div>\n<p>Part of the lobbying effort is resident sculptor Li Xiangqun, professor at the  Academy of Arts and Design<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> of <a href=\"/wiki/Tsinghua_University\" title=\"Tsinghua University\">Tsinghua University</a>, who was elected deputy of the 12th <a href=\"/wiki/National_People%27s_Congress\" title=\"National People&#39;s Congress\">National People's Congress</a> in 2004.

Those arguments have so far been ignored.\n</p><p>In 2004, Seven-Star Group froze the rental of new spaces and prohibited all renewals. Tenants resorted to subdividing and subleasing their spaces, to which the Group responded by attempting to forbid subleasing to cultural organizations or to foreigners, hoping to drive out the artists. Tenants, despite some of them having leases still valid for several years, were given the ultimatum of December 31, 2005 to vacate the premises.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>By 2006, public outcry was relentless, and prominent cultural organizations from around the world spoke up. An unlikely duo including SevenStar, a government-led consortium acting as stewards of a pension fund for former factory workers, and <a href=\"/wiki/Guy_Ullens\" title=\"Guy Ullens\">Guy Ullens</a>, a Belgian philanthropist who had amassed the world's largest collection of contemporary Chinese art, commissioned <a href=\"/wiki/Boston\" title=\"Boston\">Boston</a>-based design firm <a href=\"/wiki/Sasaki_Associates\" title=\"Sasaki Associates\">Sasaki Associates</a> to produce a vision plan which sought to re-purpose the district into a stable source of revenue while providing a much needed destination for China's burgeoning arts scene.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The plan needed to inspire multiple stakeholders with often divergent interests. First, the city government in <a href=\"/wiki/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a> wanted to ensure that the district would a visible and acclaimed destination. Second, land-holder SevenStar Group needed to generate a sustainable revenue stream to endow the pension fund of former factory workers. Third, international and Chinese non-profit cultural institutions investing in 798 such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Ullens_Center_for_Contemporary_Art\" title=\"Ullens Center for Contemporary Art\">Ullens Center for Contemporary Art</a> wanted to focus on culture and protecting the district\u2019s distinctive character. Finally, residents of adjacent neighborhoods were vocal about the need for community parks, recreation, and job opportunities. \n</p><p>Considering these voices equally, the <a href=\"/wiki/Sasaki_Associates\" title=\"Sasaki Associates\">Sasaki Associates</a> master plan for 798 endeavored to reach consensus with a long-game approach to redevelopment. Leading with clear principles and detailed guidelines, the plan was an opportunity to codify the values of the district. To address the city\u2019s concerns, connections from nearby transit stations were strengthened, historic buildings were catalogued, and guidelines for their preservation and adaptive reuse were outlined. Next, a long-term strategy for obtaining revenue from new building leases was realized. A proposed arts school, artist-in-residence program, and requirements that tenants are involved in a creative industry provided cultural institutions with a sense that 798 would attract new talent and ideas. Last, multiple parks and plazas responded to community desire for more public open space.\n</p><p>By the end of 2007 it was decided that the area would continue in its current format of a special art zone.  In 2009, the area has been refurbished and is thriving. 798\u2019s abandoned factory buildings have been transformed into new museums, galleries, and cafes. Fallow fields and once hidden courtyards have reemerged as settings for outdoor sculpture, fashion shows, and other cultural events. The roads have been repaved, new galleries have opened, and a <a href=\"/wiki/Coffee_culture\" title=\"Coffee culture\">cafe culture</a> is emerging. What began as a small collection of ephemeral studios and other work spaces has become the third most visited destination in Beijing, after the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/50_Moganshan_Road\" title=\"50 Moganshan Road\">50 Moganshan Road</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Book_references\">Book references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Book references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Huang Rui (\u9ec4\u9510), editor (2004). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040610164756/http://www.timezone8.com/798color.htm\"><i>Beijing 798: Reflections on Art, Architecture and Society in China</i></a> (798\u5de5\u5382\uff1a\u521b\u9020\u5317\u4eac\u7684\u65b0\u827a\u672f\u8857\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u793e\u4f1a).
