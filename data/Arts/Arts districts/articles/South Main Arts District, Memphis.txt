The South Main Arts District in Memphis, Tennessee makes up the southern portion of Downtown Memphis. It is located along South Main Street. Two great points of historical interest in Memphis reside in this area. One is the National Civil Rights Museum. The other is the historic restaurant the Arcade, located on the south corner of South Main and G.E. Patterson. It is the oldest coffee shop and one of the oldest family owned restaurants in Memphis. Elvis used to hang out at the Arcade  and it has become a favorite among filmmakers; several movies have had scenes filmed at the diner-styled restaurant. On the last Friday of each month, an event called "Trolley Night" is put on by the South Main Association, as well as owners of the South Main businesses and art galleries. From 6-9pm, this includes free MATA trolley service up and down Main Street, open art galleries, and longer hours for most area shops and restaurants.  Several notable locations and buildings are located in the South Main district. The South Main district has been featured in many films, sometimes as just background scenery in Memphis, sometimes masquerading as an older version of Beale Street.  Some of the films featuring scenes from the South Main district are:
