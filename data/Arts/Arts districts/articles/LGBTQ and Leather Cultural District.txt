The San Francisco Board of Supervisors established the district in June, 2018  and a ribbon cutting was held outside The Stud on 9th St., the city's oldest gay bar.   The area is bounded approximately by Howard St. on the northwest, 7th St. on the northeast, I-80 on the east and US 101 on the south. There is also an exclave between 5th and 6th streets, Harrison and Bryant.  It includes the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, which opened in 2017.   The aim of the district is to "honor and commemorate the people, places and institutions that gave South of Market its distinctive culture and appeal, and would also help protect the remaining businesses and spaces, and sustain the people who live, work and recreate there."
