Gazi (Greek: Γκάζι, pronounced [ˈga.zi]; formerly Γκαζοχώρι Gazochori or Φωταέριο Fotaerio) is a neighborhood of Athens, Greece. It surrounds the old Athens gasworks, which is the industrial museum and exhibition space "Technopolis", widely known as Gazi, next to Keramikos and close to the Acropolis. The old gasworks was founded in 1857. Around 1910, several brothels were set up in the area, a fact which led to brothels in general being referred to as 'Gazi'. During the mid-20th century, small dwellings with few rooms and large gardens began to spring up around the gasworks. These were generally home to large, poor families from Athens. Gazi was a deprived area but despite this, there was no associated high crime rate. The area was mainly inhabited by crate makers. In 1967, due to difficuly socioeconomic conditions in northern Greece, many Muslim families established a presence in the area, working at the gasworks. Over the years, numerous garages, paint shops, tinsmiths and spare parts shops opened up in the area. Most of the brothels, which the area was known for in the past, have moved north to Omonoia. To this day, there is a heavy Muslim presence in the area. A 'multicultural' school exists in the area, the 87th Elementary School of Athens, with a student body comprising 70% Muslim, 20% Greek Orthodox and 10% Albanian and Romanians. Gazi is home to the Technopolis of Athens, that spreads in an area of about 30,000 m2, an industrial museum of modern architecture. Since the start of the 21st century, Gazi has been home to numerous gay and lesbian bars and several new clubs, cafeterias and restaurants in general, establishing itself as an entertainment district. Kerameikos metro station on Line 3 of the Athens Metro is adjacent to the Technopolis of Gazi.
