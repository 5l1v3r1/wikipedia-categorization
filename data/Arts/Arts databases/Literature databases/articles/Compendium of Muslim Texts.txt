The Compendium of Muslim Texts contains the most known online hadith database, ranking highest in the Google search engine,  although the collections they have are incomplete due to being one of the earliest sites on Islam on the net.  The Compendium was compiled by the USC-MSA, the Muslim Students Association at the University of Southern California,   one of the largest private universities in the United States. The Compendium is entirely devoted to serving as a resource for students, faculty, and visitors, compiling many Muslim texts and making many of them searchable, including many translations of the Quran and translations of authentic hadith compilations. It was originally available on the USC website, but is now hosted at the website of MSA West, a West Coast regional council of the national MSA organization. The searchable Quran and hadith database are available on both the USC website and MSA West, however. The Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement has taken ownership of the compendium and houses it on its website since the MSA at USC has gone inactive.
