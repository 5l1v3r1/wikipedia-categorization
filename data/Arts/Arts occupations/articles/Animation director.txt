An animation director is the director in charge of all aspects of the animation process during the production of an animated film or an animated segment for a live action film or television.  This may include directing the storyboard, character design, background animation, and other aspects of animation. Some animated film productions may split the duties between an animation director, who focuses on the creation of the animation, and a director who oversees all other aspects of the film. A supervising animator is commonly in charge of all aspects of the design and artwork for a single major character.  The supervising animator oversees a group of animators who complete the entire scenes in which a particular character appears. The day-to-day responsibilities of an animation director may include checking and updating lists for each scene.
