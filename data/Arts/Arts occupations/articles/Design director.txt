A design director is a position usually found within the advertising, media, automotive or entertainment industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as web development and software development firms as well. The position has similarities to that of a creative director. The design director oversees the design of branding and advertising for a client, ensuring that the new branding and advertising fits in with the client's requirements and the image they wish to promote for their company or product. However, unlike a creative director, the design director is not responsible for the overall quality of the final creative work, but merely for the quality of the project's design elements. Another distinction between the two positions is that advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copywriting or art directing positions. Design directors, on the other hand, are promoted from senior designer positions.
