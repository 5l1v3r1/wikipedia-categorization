Theatre studies (sometimes referred to as theatrology or dramatics) is the study of theatrical performance in relation to its literary, physical, psycho-biological, sociological, and historical contexts. It is an interdisciplinary field which also encompasses the study of theatrical aesthetics and semiotics.  A late 20th century development in the area has been the ethnographic theory of theatre, pioneered by the Russian scholar Larisa Ivleva (1944â€“1995) who studied the influence of folk culture on the development of Russian theatre.   Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the field, those who have been described as theatrologists can vary widely in terms of the primary focus of their activities.
