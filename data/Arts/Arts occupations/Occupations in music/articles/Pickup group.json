Instead, New York soul <a href=\"/wiki/Accompaniment\" title=\"Accompaniment\">accompaniment</a> parts were usually recorded by <a href=\"/wiki/Session_musician\" title=\"Session musician\">session musicians</a> who were hired by a music contractor to play for a single recording.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Since the musicians playing New York soul were not a regular <a href=\"/wiki/Backup_band\" title=\"Backup band\">backup band</a> that played together all the time, the playing was not as loose and spontaneous as a typical Southern US \"house band\", in which the members played together all the time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, since the NYC session players were experienced musicians, they played with a professional style.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Considerations\">Considerations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pickup_group&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Considerations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When a music promoter is organizing a multi-city or multi-country tour for a <a href=\"/wiki/Lead_singer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lead singer\">lead singer</a> or solo instrumentalist (e.g., a solo guitar player or solo flute player), she needs to hire <a href=\"/wiki/Accompaniment\" title=\"Accompaniment\">accompaniment</a> musicians to play the <a href=\"/wiki/Chord_(music)\" title=\"Chord (music)\">chords</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Bassline\" title=\"Bassline\">bassline</a> and harmony parts which are used to support the lead performer. Similarly, if a touring <a href=\"/wiki/Broadway_musical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Broadway musical\">Broadway musical</a> group is performing a series of shows in cities across a country or around the world (e.g., several weeks of shows in each location), the organizer needs a <a href=\"/wiki/Pit_orchestra\" title=\"Pit orchestra\">pit orchestra</a> to accompany the singers who are performing.\n</p><p>The promoter needs to make a decision as to whether to hire an existing, longstanding <a href=\"/wiki/Music_ensemble\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Music ensemble\">music ensemble</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Backing_band\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Backing band\">backing band</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Orchestra\" title=\"Orchestra\">orchestra</a> or hire a \"pick-up group\" in each city or country. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Using a longstanding ensemble will provide a group which has extensive experience performing as a <a href=\"/wiki/Musical_ensemble\" title=\"Musical ensemble\">musical ensemble</a>. This can help the group to play with a more unified sound and style. If the backing band or backing ensemble required for a show is small (e.g., 3-4 musicians), it may be worth the cost of paying for the travel, hotel and food for a longstanding group. However, if the backing ensemble is large\u2013for example, a 20-piece <a href=\"/wiki/Big_band\" title=\"Big band\">big band</a> for a jazz singer or a 27-member <a href=\"/wiki/Pit_orchestra\" title=\"Pit orchestra\">pit orchestra</a> for a travelling musical, the cost of travel, hotels and meals for the backup group may be prohibitive.\n</p><p>Alternatively, in each town or city, the producer or promoter can pay a local music contractor to hire a local musicians to form a \"pickup\" orchestra or a \"jobbing band\". If a promoter decides to hire a pickup group in each town or city, this means that the promoter does not have to pay for the travel, hotels and meals for these musicians, since they live in the town or city where the show is taking place. There are some disadvantages; using a pickup group requires contractors to pay for a series of rehearsals for the new musicians in each town, so that they can learn the songs/pieces. As well, since the pickup group will not have experience playing together and since they may not have experience performing the songs/pieces in the show, a pickup group may not play with the same \"tight\" ensemble as a longstanding group which backs up a soloist or musical theatre/opera company on a permanent basis.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"As_occupation\">As occupation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pickup_group&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: As occupation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although the work provided by these ensembles is intermittent and of short duration, these ensembles are an important source of income for freelance musicians and session musicians. Since playing in \"jobbing bands\" and \"pickup groups\" only provides a limited amount of work per year, a performer that plays in these types of groups will typically have to have other sources of income, such as teaching music on her instrument. As well, playing in these ensembles give local performers an opportunity to work with well-known national- or international-level touring soloists and conductors.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Orchestras\">Orchestras</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pickup_group&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Orchestras\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When a <a href=\"/wiki/Musical_theater\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Musical theater\">musical theater</a> production, <a href=\"/wiki/Operetta\" title=\"Operetta\">operetta</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Opera\" title=\"Opera\">opera</a> is performed in different cities, the production company may hire local musicians in each town for the performance.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Jazz.2C_rock_and_pop_music_groups\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jazz,_rock_and_pop_music_groups\">Jazz, rock and pop music groups</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pickup_group&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Jazz, rock and pop music groups\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When a <a href=\"/wiki/Jazz\" title=\"Jazz\">jazz</a> singer or instrumental soloist, pop singer(s) or a <a href=\"/wiki/Rock_musical\" title=\"Rock musical\">rock musical</a> production that is accompanied by a rock band, pop group or jazz group is on tour, they may hire a band of local musicians (e.g. a <a href=\"/wiki/Horn_section\" title=\"Horn section\">horn section</a> or additional <a href=\"/wiki/Rhythm_section\" title=\"Rhythm section\">rhythm section</a> members) in each town that they play in.
