An azmari (literally "one who praises" in Amharic) is an Ethiopian singer-musician, comparable to the European bard or the West African griot.   Azmari, who may be either male or female, are skilled at singing extemporized verses, accompanying themselves on either a masenqo (one-stringed fiddle) or krar (lyre).  Azmari often perform in drinking establishments called tejbeit, which specialize in the serving of tej (honey mead). The Azamri introduced the popular Tizita ballad form.
