Recce /ˈrɛki/  is a production term used in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa which refers to a pre-filming visit to a location to determine its suitability for shooting, including access to necessary facilities and assessment of any potential lighting or sound issues, and is closely related to location scouting. A "wildtrack" is soundtrack sounds recorded without images for use in post-production at a later point. In the US, the term "site survey" or "tech scout" is commonly used with the same meaning. "Recce" is borrowed from the military expression of the same name, which derived from "reconnaissance" in the noun sense and "reconnoitre" in the verb sense. The term "recce" is also used to refer to scouting recording or broadcast locations for radio and TV production.
