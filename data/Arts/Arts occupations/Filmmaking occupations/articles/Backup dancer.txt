 A backup dancer also known as background dancer   is a performer who dances with or behind the lead performers in a live musical act or in a music video. Their movements (especially where there are many moving together) provide a visual symmetry and rhythm to accompany the music. Some notable performers began their music careers as backup dancers for other artists, including: On 25 February 2015, a backup dancer performing with Madonna at the Brit Awards accidentally pulled Madonna backwards down a small flight of stairs when performing an act that involved pulling a cape off of Madonna's neck.  Madonna quickly recovered and continued with the show, and later attributed the accident to the cape being tied too tightly.  At the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show on 1 February 2015, backup dancers dressed in shark costumes accompanied Katy Perry as she performed.  In September 2014, three backup dancers for Cher sued the performer for wrongful termination based upon allegations of racial discrimination.   At the time, Cher's publicist denied any wrongdoing, stating that "the accusations are ridiculous" and that "they couldnâ€™t be further from the truth".  In the lawsuit, it was stated that the dancers were informed that the firing occurred to "save costs on the tour".  The lawsuit sought over $10 million in damages.
