Suzanne Jackson (American, born 1944) is a visual artist with a luminous career spanning five decades with work exhibited in museums and galleries around the world. Since the late 1960's, Jackson dedicated her life to studio art with additional participation in the theatre, teaching, arts administration, community life, and social activism. Jackson’s oeuvre includes poetry, dance, theater and costume design, paintings (both two- and three-dimensional), prints, and drawings. Jackson has spent a time throughout her career teaching students and influencing future generations of artists and culture creators, as well as building and participating in close-knit art communities with peer artists and thinkers: San Francisco State (College) University and Bay Area artists and teachers including Charles White; Los Angeles during the 1960's-80's including Gallery 32 which she founded, its artistic circle, as well as her representation by Ankrum Gallery; life in Idyllwild, CA in the 1980's teaching and creating art; Yale University; the theatre communities in California, New Haven, CT, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, PA in the 1990's; and the Savannah, GA art community since 1996. Jackson was born in Saint Louis, MO and her family moved to San Francisco, CA when she was nine months old. Jackson lived in San Francisco until she was eight years old, Jackson was then raised in the city of Fairbanks, Alaska from 1952-61 (both during its time as a Territory and early Statehood), graduating from Monroe High School in 1961—the only Catholic high school in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fairbanks and the northernmost Roman Catholic high school in the Americas .  As a teenager in Alaska, she became a member of the National Audubon Society which has influenced some of the content of her work from a young age.  She was also the first African American to attend the National 4-H Congress in  Chicago in 1960 which helped her receive scholarships and allowed her to attend college.  She received the "World Peace, Humane Society, and Kindness to Animals" scholarship from The International Latham Foundation, the Banff School of Fine Arts Scholarship, the Standard Oil Scholarship, and National Home Study Art Course.  Jackson moved to the Bay Area in 1961 to attend San Francisco State (College) University, where she studied both art and ballet, eventually receiving a BA in painting in 1966. She later completed an MFA from the School of Drama, Yale University, in 1990, specializing in theater design.   At the age of 17, Jackson moved from Alaska to the Bay Area to attend college. She remained on the West Coast through the 1960's and ‘70's, mostly moving between Los Angeles and San Francisco. She opened Gallery 32 in Los Angeles which operated from 1968-70 (see Gallery 32). Jackson’s artwork was represented by the Ankrum Gallery from 1968 until 1989 and held solo exhibitions there in 1972, 1974, 1976, and 1978.  Ankrum Gallery was run by Joan Ankrum, a respected and renowned actress turned gallerist, along with William (Bill) Chalee from 1960-89. Jackson produced artists books of poetry and painting, "What I Love" (1972) and "Animals" (1978). (see Poetry)“When Bernie [Casey] brought to the gallery several of Suzanne’s paintings, I was immediately struck with the freshness and originality of her work. It is most unusual to find so young an artist with a valid philosophical statement (and to communicate it successfully). Her feelings about her blackness are expressed in somewhat symbolic terms, and her world of fantasy, love and hope is revealed to the viewer in a very refreshing style… She very well may be the first Black woman in America to make a truly important contribution to art.”      -- Joan Ankrum (1/5/1974)  In 1981, Jackson was first introduced to Savannah, GA through an invitation to be a visiting artist with Savannah College of Art and Design through the recommendation of Bernie Casey. Additionally, in 1981, Jackson’s work was included in the exhibition “Forever Free: African American Women” which traveled to the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, SC. Jackson lived in Idyllwild, CA from 1981–85 and was on faculty as a Visiting Artist at the Idyllwild School of Music and Arts (1981–82), and Chair of the Fine and Performing Arts at the Elliott-Pope Preparatory School (formerly Desert Sun School) (1982–85).  In 1987, Jackson relocated to New Haven, CT to attend Yale University, pursuing a master’s degree under the tutelage of Ming Cho Lee for scenography. She worked as a freelance scenic and costume designer moving throughout the region until taking a post at St. Mary's College of Maryland as a scenographer and Assistant Professor from 1994-96. In 1996, Jackson moved full-time to Savannah, GA to teach at Savannah College of Art and Design as Professor of Painting, where she taught full-time until 2009. Jackson officially retired from SCAD in 2009, but Jackson remained as a part-time and adjunct professor until 2013. Additionally, Jackson taught introductory art history courses, including African American Art History at Savannah State University in 2013-2014 school year. Jackson has remained an active member of the Savannah artistic community and continues to create and exhibit her work. Jackson co-hosts a weekly radio show featuring jazz and conversation, called Listen Hear on WHCJ 90.3 Savannah State University Radio, alongside Ike Carter, Jerome Meadows, Tom Van de Ven, Lisa Jackson and Carla Curran, PhD. Suzanne Jackson has had an extensive career an emphasized the importance of living the lifestyle of an artist, in her words, to be an artist is to solve problems as opposed to create images. She states, “I'm not an artist yet. I'm a painter. And I draw, and I work in theater as an "artist person," in quotes. But to become an artist takes a whole lifetime.”  Throughout her career, Jackson has looked to nature for inspiration, she has consistently related blackness to nature.  Her work has celebrated blackness through the representation of black bodies without an overtly political message. Jackson has worked in a variety of visual media including works on paper, works on canvas, and Monoprints. Her works on paper include both watercolors and drawings from throughout her career. Jackson has worked mostly with acrylic paint, her earliest paintings on canvas were with acrylic paint layered, the way one would layer oils paints. She stated, “the imagery that everybody has sort of become familiar with, with the really strong white background and the sort of washy layers and layers of paint—that basically is kind of an old masters technique of layering the color for translucency. It's like the layers and layers of color build a depth in the painting. And some of the paintings, as thin as the color looks, there could be a hundred and fifty layers of color on each of my paintings.”  The 1990s marked a shift in her work as she began to experiment with different combinations of media.  As her style progressed, Jackson began to forego the canvas in favor of netting as a substrate. She uses Novacolor'sacrylic gels to create 3-dimensional hanging works held together by fabric, papers, found objects, leaves, and or various netting.

Her costume designs were included in the exhibition Onstage: A Century of African American Stage Design, at the Library for the Performing Arts, Lincoln Center, New York. Among other regional theatre credits, Jackson's work includes: Jackson studied ballet and choreography at university, while a student she was a member of the Pacific Ballet Company (1961–66). Following graduation from college, Jackson participated in a State Department musical theatre tour of South America with Music Theatre U.S.A., and upon returning , Jackson was an instructor of dance and art at Watts Towers Art Center in Los Angeles from 1968-69. From 1982-85, Jackson was the Chair of the Fine Arts Department of the Elliot‑Pope Preparatory School, Idyllwild, CA where she choreographed performances including Oliver!, Grease, and the Cosmic Festival. Jackson’s poetry has been mentored by the Cave Canem Foundation, Lucille Clifton, St Mary’s Women’s Writing Group, and the International Women’s Writing Guild. Jackson’s published artist books featuring her poetry and paintings are “Animal,” and “What I Love.” Jackson’s poetry and drawings are included in Cave Canem Anthologies; “the ringing ear: Black Poets Lean South,” 2007,  I, II, and IV, 1996–99; Avatar 25, 1996; Potomac Review,  Winter 1996; In the Valley of the Moon, International Women’s Writing Guild, 1994.  Several of her Artist Statements are written in verse: MY ART DEALS WITH REALITY VERSUS FANTASY--- ALONENESS VERSUS LONLINESS… WHAT I PAINT ATTEMPTS TO EXPRESS THE CONFLICTS WITHIN THE MIND, CONFLICTS OF CHOICES--- OF LOVES, ---OF SENSITIVITIES SEARCHING, ORDERING, “FREEING” ONESELF TOWARD SOME CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF REDISCOVERING WHO, IN FACT, I MIGHT REALLY BE.  --Statement from Suzanne Jackson’s book, What I Love (1970)Many associate Jackson’s name with Gallery 32, an art gallery she ran in Los Angeles, a space dedicated to fostering a supportive artist community. Gallery 32 (1968-1970) was inspired by artist Charles White’s philosophy that art could be an effective vehicle for community activism and social change. Seeking to replicate Jackson's previous experiences of San Francisco bohemianism, Gallery 32 functioned less as a business than as a place for the exchange of ideas and philosophies. Jackson funded the gallery herself, largely with money she earned from teaching. The gallery became an important venue, hosting discussions, poetry readings, and fund-raisers for social causes, and exhibiting work that demonstrated strong political and civic engagement.  She aimed to make art from black artists with black themes accessible for all members of the community.  It quickly became one of the few art spaces in Los Angeles to exhibit emerging African American artists such as Gloria Bohanon, Emory Douglas, David Hammons, Betye Saar, and Timothy Washington. The gallery also hosted fund-raising exhibitions for the Black Arts Council, the Black Panther Party, and the Watts Towers Arts Center children's arts program. One of the gallery's important exhibitions was the 1970 Sapphire Show, the first Los Angeles survey of African American women artists. Gallery 32 played a vital role in the progressive struggles of the period while contributing to the diverse art scene of Los Angeles.  The remaining artworks and ephemera have been promised to the Smithsonian Institute per the artist’s request. 2014-2016   Adjunct Foundation Studies Professor, Drawing, Savannah College of Art and Design 2013-2014   Adjunct Professor of Fine Arts, Sabbatical Replacement History I & II; African American Art History, Savannah State University 2009-2013   Adjunct Professor of Painting, Graduate Studies, Savannah College of Art and Design eLearning 1996-2009   Professor of Painting, Savannah College of Art and Design 1994-1996   Scenographer / Assistant Professor, St. Mary's College of Maryland 1982-1985   Chair of the Fine and Performing Arts Department, The Elliott‑Pope Preparatory School, (formerly the Desert Sun School) Idyllwild, CA. 1972   Stanford University (Summer) 1970   Watts Tower Art Center, Watts California (Dance and Crafts Instructor) 1967-1968   Los Angeles Public Schools, Provisional Teacher, First and Second Grades 1965-1966   Art Instructor, Kindergarten – Eighth Grade, Saint Stevens School, San Francisco, CA 2019 (Upcoming) 2018 (Upcoming) 2017 2016 2015 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2005 2002 2000 1986 1985 1984 1981 1977 1975 1974 1972, '74, '76, '78 1973 1972 Bustion, Nathanial.
