Angelo Vergecio (Greek: Άγγελος Βεργέκιος, French: Ange Vergèce; 1505–1569) was a Greek copyist from Crete active in Venice and France. He became a royal scribe for Francis I of France and his successors, was responsible for copying over fifty Greek manuscripts, and played a role in the dissemination of Greek among the humanist circles in France. His handwriting formed the basis of the grecs du roi typeface designed by Claude Garamond.
