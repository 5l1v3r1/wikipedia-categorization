Dance critique is the act of producing a written or spoken review of a dance performance (often ballet, modern dance, or contemporary dance). The term may also refer to the report itself. As with other topics, a dance critique may employ its own technical language, and may also reflect the critic's opinions generally. Major newspapers cover the arts in some form and dance critiques may be included.  Dance critiques are available in other types of media as well, such as online publishing , through blogs, websites, and online videos.
