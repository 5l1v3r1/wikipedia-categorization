A capsule review is a form of criticism, usually associated with journalism, that offers a relatively short critique of a specified artistic work (movie, music album, restaurant, painting, etc.).  Capsule reviews generally appear in publications like newspapers and magazines, and can range anywhere from just a few sentences up to around 300 words. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide is a famous publication that includes hundreds of capsule movie reviews by prolific film writer Leonard Maltin, including the world's shortest capsule review according to the Guinness Book of World Records, a 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical Isn't It Romantic? that consisted of only the word "no".
