McMansion Hell is a website which humorously critiques "McMansions"; large suburban homes typically built from the 1980s to 2008, known for their stylistic attempt of appearing wealthy using mass-produced architecture. The website is run by Kate Wagner, a graduate student of acoustical studies at the Johns Hopkins University's Peabody Conservatory and architectural writer.   The blog has acquired many fans since it started in June 2016.   Wagner has been interviewed for Paper, The Washington Post, Slate, Business Insider, The Hairpin, and Der Spiegel in Germany, and has appeared on the 99% Invisible podcast.  She has gained wide name recognition in architectural circles  and has published in the Architectural Digest,  The Atlantic,  and Jacobin.  Besides critiquing the homes themselves, the website also criticizes the material culture of wastefulness McMansions can represent.  The website gives anecdotes of situations when McMansions have been a poor financial investment.  In June 2017 Zillow threatened a lawsuit against McMansion Hell for critiquing the homes depicted in photos which Zillow customers had uploaded to their website.  Various lawyers committed to defend the website as a matter of free speech and social justice.  However, after a few days Zillow chose not to pursue a lawsuit.
