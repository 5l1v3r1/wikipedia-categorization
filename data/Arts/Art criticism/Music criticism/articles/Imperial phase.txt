The imperial phase is the point in which an artist is regarded at their commercial and creative peak simultaneously. . Critic Tom Ewing said of it that it encompasses three parts; Command of the medium, goodwill towards their work from the public, and that it defines the artists career.  The phrase was coined[not in citation given] by Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys to describe the period between the release of their album Please in 1986 to the release of the single Domino Dancing in late 1988. After a sequence of number one singles it only peaked at number 7. Tennant later said: "...it entered the charts at number nine and I thought, 'that's that, then - it's all over'. I knew then that our imperial phase of number one hits was over."
