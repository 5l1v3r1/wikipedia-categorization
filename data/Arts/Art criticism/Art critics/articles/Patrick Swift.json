Paddy's 30 canvases are as grey and gloomy as Dublin itself \u2014 harshly realistic paintings of dead birds and rabbits, frightened-looking girls and twisted potted plants. Their fascination is in the merciless, sharply etched details, as oppressive and inquiring as a back-room third degree. Dublin Understands. Wrote Critic Tony Gray in <a href=\"/wiki/The_Irish_Times\" title=\"The Irish Times\">the Irish Times</a>: Swift 'unearths [from his subjects] not a story, nor a decorative pattern, nor even a mood, but some sort of tension which is a property of their existence.' Said the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Irish_Press\" title=\"The Irish Press\">Irish Press</a>: 'An almost embarrassing candor... Here is a painter who seems to have gone back to the older tradition and to have given the most searching consideration to the composition of his painting.' Dublin, which likes authors who write with a shillelagh, understood an artist who painted with one. The Word Is Tension. By 1950, Paddy was in Paris... Nights, he went to the galleries, and there he found what he wanted to do. He liked such old French masters as the 17th century's Nicolas Poussin, the 19th century's Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, such moderns as Switzerland's Alberto Giacometti and Britain's Francis Bacon. The much-admired decorative style of the Matisses is not for Paddy Swift. 'Art,' he thinks, 'is obviously capable of expressing something more closely related to life than these elegant designs.' His main idea is to suggest the tensions he finds in life. 'I believe when you bring, say, a plant into a room, everything in that room changes in relation to it. This tension \u2014 tension is the only word for it \u2014 can be painted.'\" This may have been Swift's only interview. A motif of his work at this time was his bird imagery, which appear to have symbolic overtones, and may have even been a subtle form of self-portraiture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> From early on he was involved with literary magazines,<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> such as <a href=\"/wiki/The_Bell_(magazine)\" title=\"The Bell (magazine)\">The Bell</a> and <i>Envoy</i>, contributing the occasional critical piece on art and artists he admired (e.g.<a href=\"/wiki/Nano_Reid\" title=\"Nano Reid\">Nano Reid</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> who painted Swift's portrait in 1950).

Swift's criticism is that of the practicing artist not that of a practicing critic, and when speaking of his criticism I do not merely mean only his occasional critical essays, but his activity as co-editor of a magazine and as champion of Bacon, Freud, Auerbach, Craigie Aitchison, Nano Reid, Giacometti and David Bomberg (whose posthumous papers he edited).\nThis is criticism in the valid, active, propagandistic sense, not merely the daily or weekly grind of reviewing all sorts and conditions of artists, good and bad, but mostly mediocre. Once again much of Swift's activity in this field was semi-underground, almost subversive, often done in the teeth of the modernist establishment of his day. His record in this field speaks for itself... I cannot think of any other Irish painter who achieved anything like what he did as a critic and editor and discoverer of talent, and very few painters in any other country either. <a href=\"/wiki/Wyndham_Lewis\" title=\"Wyndham Lewis\">Wyndham Lewis</a>, it is true, was a verbose propagandist, but on the whole he was a bad critic, and somehow his propaganda almost always turns out to be some form of self-aggrandisement, whereas Swift almost always pushed the fortunes and reputations of his friends and almost never his own. Yet, you do not get, from his general stance, that his motives were simply friendship and good intentions. There is a tone of dedication throughout, as though he was serving art, and not merely artists... It is a peculiarity of his very individual <a href=\"/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)\" title=\"Psyche (psychology)\">psyche</a> and personality that Swift cannot be \u2018placed\u2019 purely as a painter. He was an artist in the broad sense before he was specifically a painter, and his context embraces literature and other disciplines besides painting or drawing (It is noticeable that he had more friends who were literary men than friends who were painters). Swift is not a painter\u2019s painter, he is an artist\u2019s artist, a man whose mentality overlapped into other fields besides his own chosen one.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Posthumous\">Posthumous</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Patrick_Swift&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Posthumous\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:142px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG/140px-Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG\" width=\"140\" height=\"137\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG/210px-Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG/280px-Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"934\" data-file-height=\"917\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Hatch Street Studio</div></div></div><p> In 1993 Gandon Editions published a biography<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> of Swift to coincide with the IMMA Retrospective.

Essays on Swift by Anthony Cronin (poet) and Aidan Dunne (art critic ): He was never in any doubt that painting was a re-creation of what the painter saw: in his own case at least not what the painter had seen or could imagine, but what he was actually looking at during the act of painting. A faithfulness of the sort was part of the bargain, part of his contract with his art\u2026 [which] had nothing to do with description\u2026What was at stake was a faithful recreation of the truth to the artist of the experience, in the painter\u2019s case the visual experience, the artist being admittedly only one witness, one accomplice during and after the fact. Of course this faithfulness did not rule out expressionist overtones. The truth was doubtless subjective as well as objective. Swift's blues and greys were usually properties of what he was painting. They were also part of his vision of things, properties of his mind. We felt then that time could only find its full expression through an art that was frugal, ascetic, puritanical even...In faraway Paris, Samuel Beckett felt the same thing, writing the trilogy that was to give asceticism, frugality, puritanisim and the bitter humour that lies at the heart of the joke that is life, their full expression. Swift's avoidance of warm colours... was born in that time and afterwards harked back to it</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/John_Ryan_(Dublin_artist)\" title=\"John Ryan (Dublin artist)\">John Ryan</a> (founder of <a href=\"/wiki/Envoy,_A_Review_of_Literature_and_Art\" title=\"Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art\">Envoy</a>) in his introduction to Swift for the Rosc Catalogue 1971 (which included Swift's portrait of Kavanagh): \"'He painted the trees and gardens he cherished and the people he loved; because he was, happily, not unduly concerned, a style that came naturally to him shortly became his own distinctive 'style' \u2014 his signature \u2014 as uniquely his own as the subject content. Swift's peculiar style reminds us of nobody but the artist \u2014 a telling point with a painter who has set no store on this aspect of the job. In Swift we have, then, a man with an observation that is both curious and affectionate \u2014 for his attention to details in his subject is paternal and not academic\" - Rosc Catalogue, Irish Imagination, 1971; see also <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.adams.ie/BidCat/detail.asp?SaleRef=3074&amp;LotRef=94\">Adams auctioneers catalogue notes</a>; and in <i>Envoy</i> (1951): \"No clich\u00e9s are employed to simplify his task and no tricks are superimposed to foster an illusion of originality. Academicians and abstractionists will equally deplore him, and probably for the same reasons. He has rejected the debased technique of the one and the dogmas of the other.

In London he became more expressive in his use of paint, applying thick layers of paint, using the brush more and \"modelling\" the paint surface. In the Algarve he continues this trend into a heavy, broken impasto and some of his later work verges on becoming abstract.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/wiki/John_McGahern\" title=\"John McGahern\">John McGahern</a> (Swift drew his portrait in London in 1960) noted that he was fond of the line \"those particular trees/ that caught you in their mysteries\": \"It was he who first told me how well Constable wrote in letters about trees, especially the plane trees, with their peeled strips of bark \u2014 \u2018They soak up the polluted air' \u2014 and he quoted a favourite line, 'those particular trees/ that caught you in their mysteries\u2019, mentioning that he preferred trees to flowers\" (\"The Bird Swift\", <i>Love Of The World</i>, John McGahern, Edited by Stanley van der Ziel, Faber &amp; Faber, 2009). Swift wrote in his Italian Notebook (Gandon Editions 1993): \"I think that I probably have a real talent for painting trees if I developed it assiduously. I want to give them great density and depth pile heaps of detail into them and yet keep the sense of presence which is the whole point. I have started the painting of the palm tree outside the window. I can go straight at it because I have wanted to paint one for so long and have looked longingly into them so often in so many places\". His later work is almost exclusively \"tree portraits\" and rural landscapes. <a href=\"/wiki/Lima_de_Freitas\" title=\"Lima de Freitas\">Lima de Freitas</a> (Gandon Editions 1993) writing about Swift's Algarve tree paintings: \"Here his painting, which before had been sophisticated and \u2018cultured\u2019, was stripped bare and became a paean of praise, both voluptuous and sacred, to a perennial Spring. His exaltation bursts forth in a blaze of colour \u2014 like in Soutine, but a Soutine of happiness. He is intoxicated by a joy that casts away the erudite codes of style and revelled in the tangibility of the natural world. Impatiently, Patrick Swift searches out the roots of inner essence. A conjunction of opposites, of a characteristically fiery imagination and the cool verdure of plants and trees produced a kind of \u2018naturalism' \u2014 but one which is the antithesis of timid conformity and mediocrity and could only have emerged from a process of rediscovering and reshaping a lost innocence... Patrick Swift\u2019s paintings are an act of praise and wonder.\" Swift in 1952 also mentions \"naturalism\": \"He sees an inevitable swing in modern art from surrealism to naturalism, but adds at once: 'It must be a purely visual and personal naturalism without the formulae of the academics.'\"(AN IRISHMAN'S DIARY \u2014 QUIDNUNC, Seamus Kelly, <i>The Irish Times</i>, 11 October 1952)</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"A more rewarding approach to painting, in my opinion the only valid one, is to regard it as a deeply personal and private activity\" \u2014 Swift, \"By Way of Preface\", from a Report to the Committee of Cultural Relations, Dept of External Affairs, on a Year spent in Italy in the study of Art &amp; Painting, December 1955; \"The Art of painting is itself an intensely personal activity. It may be labouring the obvious to say so but it is too little recognised in art journalism now that a picture is a unique and private event in the life of the painter: an object made alone with a man and a blank canvas... A real painting is something which happens to the painter once in a given minute; it is unique in that it will never happen again and in this sense is an impossible object. It is judged by the painter simply as a success or failure without qualification. And it is something which happens in life not in art: a picture which was merely the product of art would not be very interesting and could tell us nothing we were not already aware of.\" \u2014  \"The Painter in the Press\", <i>X</i>, October 1960. It could be added that Swift did not subscribe to the \"idea of progress in the arts\" (\u201cOfficial Art and the Modern Painter\u201d, <i>X magazine</i>, November 1959), believing that \"the mass of modern art theory that developed around the fantastic changes of this century's painting can be largely ignored.\"(\"Nano Reid\", Envoy, March 1950)</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"...an atmosphere of heightened realism which\u2026 is intensely personal and strangely disturbing.\" \u2014 G.H.G.

It is hard to believe now that it was mainly a cultural impact and that he actually changed the older man's entire approach to poetry.\" (<i>Patrick Swift 1927-83</i>, Gandon Editions, 1993) Swift was responsible for Kavanagh having 19 poems published in the London-based literary magazine, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nimbus_(literary_magazine)\" title=\"Nimbus (literary magazine)\">Nimbus</a></i>, in 1956, which proved to be the turning point in Kavanagh's career; his next volume of verse, <i>Come Dance with Kitty Stobling</i>, was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in <i>Nimbus</i>. Antoinette Quinn (<i>Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography</i>, Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2001): \"Publication there [in <i>Nimbus</i>] was to prove a turning point \u2026 The publication of his next volume of verse, <i>Come Dance with Kitty Stobling</i>, was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in <i>Nimbus</i>, and his Collected Poems (1964)\". David Wright (then editor of <i>Nimbus</i>) in his introduction to <i>An Anthology from X</i> (OUP, 1988): \"These poems [19 of Kavanagh's poems were published] had been posted to me by Swift, whose brother James had invaded the poet's flat in Dublin, gathered up the trampled manuscripts scattered about the floor, and had them sorted, typed, and bound. One of the carbon copies was sent to me.\" Antoinette Quinn (<i>Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography</i>), however,  says that the idea of Jimmy Swift invading the poet's flat is a myth. Quinn states that Kavanagh had a typescript rejected by Macmillan's (\"Macmillan's rejection had left him very downcast\") and that subsequently Swift, on one of his trips to Dublin, \"was invited to peruse the contents and decided that the poems should be published. He had to return to London\u2026 but persuaded Kavanagh to entrust the precious typescript to his brother, Jimmy, to have three copies professionally typed up...[Jimmy,] acting under his brothers instructions... sent one copy each to David Wright and <a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Green_(author)\" title=\"Martin Green (author)\">Martin Green</a> in London\" (<i>Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography</i>, Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd, 2001, pp. 350-351). Wright's version of events is, no doubt, the story put out by Swift himself, and one which would not have displeased Kavanagh. Swift was also instrumental in the publication of Kavanagh's <i>Collected Poems</i> (1964). Martin Green (who put together the collection for MacGibbon and Kee in 1964): \"It was following the suggestion of the painter Patrick Swift and the poet Anthony Cronin that the publication came about.\"(<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview8\">Martin Green in a letter to <i>The Guardian</i>, 2005</a>; see also <i>Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography</i>, Antoinette Quinn, Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd, 2001, p. 359.) Kavanagh would often stay with Swift and his family at 9 Westbourne Terrace. Regarding their friendship, Antoinette Quinn says, \"Swift believed in his genius and indulged him and... the older man... came to lean on Swift as a beloved nephew.\"(<i>Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography</i>, p: 297) Kavanagh would often stay with Swift and his family at 9 Westbourne Terrace: \"In London he generally stayed with the Swifts\" (Antoinette Quinn, <i>Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography</i>).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-37\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-37\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">For Swift\u2019s involvement with McGahern in getting his first novel published see <i>Young John McGahern: Becoming a Novelist</i> by Denis Sampson (OUP, 2012)</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-38\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-38\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"The End or the Beginning of Love\", <i>X</i>, Vol. II, No. I ( March 1961).
