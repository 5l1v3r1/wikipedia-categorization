Rosa Martínez (b. Soria, Spain) is an independent curator, art critic and international art advisor based in Barcelona, Spain.  As an independent curator, Rosa Martínez has organised international exhibitions, including the 51st Venice Biennale with "Always a Little Further" at the Arsenale (2005).  The title of this exhibition was taken from a Corto Maltese book written by the Venetian-writer Hugo Pratt. In her curatorial statement Martínez elaborates on this by stating: "Taking a fictional character as inspiration is a way of affirming that art is an imaginary construct and that fantasy helps us towards a better understanding of reality".  Additionally, in 1997 she curated the 5th International Istanbul Biennial "On Life, Beauty, Translations and other Difficulties"   and curated the exhibition "Chacun à son gout", which celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2007).  As an art advisor, Rosa Martínez has broadened the collection of the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art, where she was the Chief Curator from 2004 to 2007.  Her collaboration with the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 2007 helped to update its contemporary collection, including works by outstanding young artists. In 2009, Martínez contributed to a publication that shed light on significant works from the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao collection in different historical and artistic contexts.  As an art critic, she is a regular contributor to several newspapers and art journals, notably Le Monde diplomatique en español, Flash Art International, El País, Atlántica, Letra Internacional and La Guía del Ocio. She has also written numerous essays for artists' catalogues.
