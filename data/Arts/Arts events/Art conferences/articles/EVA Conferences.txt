  The Electronic Visualisation and the Arts conferences (EVA Conferences for short, aka Electronic Information, the Visual Arts and Beyond) are a series of international interdisciplinary conferences mainly in Europe, but also elsewhere in the world, for people interested in the application of information technology to the cultural and especially the visual arts field, including art galleries and museums.   Started in London (UK), there are now EVA conferences in Berlin (Germany), Florence (Italy), Jerusalem (Israel), St Petersburg (formerly in Moscow, Russia), Australasia (first time in Canberra, Australia in 2016) and other major cities.  The first EVA Conference was held at Imperial College, London in 1990,  organised by the founders James Hemsley, Kirk Martinez, and Anthony Hamber. The conferences have been overseen by EVA Conferences International, based in London. Conference proceedings are published.   In addition, two collected volumes of revised papers are available.   The EVA London conference, founded in 1990 by James Hemsley,  is now organised through the Computer Arts Society (CAS), a Specialist Group of the British Computer Society (BCS) each July at the BCS London office.  Some V&A Digital Futures events organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum are held in conjunction with EVA London.   In 2016, it hosted an event for the Lumen Prize, an annual award for digital art.  The proceedings have published through the BCS Electronic Workshops in Computing (eWiC) series since 2008 and are indexed by DBLP.
