Mortal Kombat: Live Tour was a martial art theatrical stage show featuring Mortal Kombat characters, sound, and laser light effects on stage. The plot was based on three fighters rescuing their friends and retrieving a magic amulet from the evil master of Outworld, Shao Kahn, in order to save the Earth. The show debuted at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on September 14, 1995, followed by a 200 city road trip into 1996. It replicated Mortal Kombat martial arts and video game moves on stage mixed with dancing and music. Lip synching were pre-recorded and used to demonstrate the official MK sound effects, though there was no graphic violence or Fatalities visible in the show. The audience participated by yelling "Run!" or "Kick him!" as part of the live action. The following Mortal Kombat characters appeared in the show. The lasers were produced by Laser Fantasy International of Seattle and operated by Dave Haskell and Chris Thornberry. A medium frame Spectra Physics and a 40 watt laser scope were used along with a custom fiber system for these effects. It was produced in part by "David Fishof Presents".   Hakim Alston (Jax) played an Outworld warrior who was defeated by Liu Kang (Robin Shou) in the original MK movie a year earlier. Fight coordinator Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa also appeared in the movie as Shang Tsung. Note that Mortal Kombat: Live Tour had two separate touring companies running simultaneously, which is why some dates are listed twice.  In 2011, 1UP.com featured the show in the article "The Top Ten Times Mortal Kombat Went Wrong"  and GamesRadar ranked it as number one on the list of "most absurd Mortal Kombat offshoots".
