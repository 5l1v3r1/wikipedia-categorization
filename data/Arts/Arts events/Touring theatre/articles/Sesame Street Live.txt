Sesame Street Live is the live touring show based on the children's television show Sesame Street an produced by Feld Entertainment. Vee Corporation was started in March 1980  from an idea by founder Vincent Egan to produce a live character show just for Sesame Street.  He based it off his time working for the Ice Follies which had a segment with those Muppets. Egan approached Jim Henson's company and Children's Television Workshop, who were interested.  With outside funding, Vee was able to sign a licensing agreement with the Children's Television Workshop for the characters.  The first Sesame Street Live show opened in September 1980 at the Metropolitan Sports Center in Bloomington, Minnesota for a five-day run. That show was successful. The following shows in five locations had lackluster attendance costing VEE the profits made in Bloomington. Egan figured that the marketing material was confusing people in those markets as what type of show was not specified. He overhauled the script and marketing while getting his creditors to wait for payments. That Christmas, the show went on to play for four weeks at Madison Square Garden's 4,000-seat Felt Forum in New York City before an audience of 100,000 people.  VEE quickly ramp up to two different shows for the 1981 to 1982 season then added a third Australia show in 1982 to 1983. From the 1983-1984 season until the 1988-1989 season there were only two Sesame Street Live shows on tour.  On April 1, 2015, Blue Star Media, LLC purchased VEE Corporation with Egan continuing on as a consultant  and later that year was renamed VStar Entertainment Group.  In November 2016, Sesame Workshop announced an agreement with Feld Entertainment for a new Sesame Street Live show thus ending Vstar's arena version in July 2017.  But the company would continued other Sesame Street shows at various locations plus the United Service Organizations tour while still providing costumes.  In order to keep the show running annually in the same cities, new plot lines are created and rotated through the tour.  Because the target audience changes as children grow up, shows are often removed from the rotation for a few years, then return with some modifications.
