Venus Over Manhattan was founded in 2012 by Adam Lindemann. The gallery is now known as VENUS, with spaces operating in both Manhattan and Los Angeles. The New York space is dedicated to curated exhibitions both historic and contemporary, which cast a unique and often iconoclastic view on the work of established artists or artists whose works have been somewhat overlooked. Past exhibitions have included those of Alexander Calder,   Jack Goldstein,  William Copley,  Raymond Pettibon,   Walter Dahn,  Peter Saul,  and H.C. Westermann.  In New York, VENUS has collaborated with artist foundations, estates, and galleries including The Calder Foundation, White Columns, Spr√ºth Magers, David Zwirner, the estate of William Copley and the estate of Allan Frumkin. VENUS opened its Los Angeles space in May 2015.       The Los Angeles gallery hosts a primary program in a 14,500 square foot exhibition space in the downtown arts district. It presents exhibitions by a roster of established and emerging talent including Dan Colen,  Katherine Bernhardt,  Dan McCarthy,  Adel Abdessemed,  Marianne Vitale,  and Elaine Cameron-Weir.
