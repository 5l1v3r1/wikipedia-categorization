All Power to the People: Black Panthers at 50 is an exhibition put on by the Oakland Museum of California from October 8, 2016 to February 26, 2017. The exhibit was organized by OMCA's senior curator Ren√© De Guzman. The exhibition celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panther Party, combining objects which examine lesser known works of the Black Panther party, such as the Free Breakfast for School Children Program and, founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale's, Ten-Point Program, with pieces of contemporary art by artists whose work inspires questions about racial inequality 50 years later.  Power to the People featured work by contemporary artists Sadie Barnette, Hank Willis Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems, Mark Teemer, Trevor Paglen and David Huffman, among others. The timely-ness of the exhibit was remarked on in several exhibition reviews. Jeff Greenwald said "From Black Lives Matter to quarterback Colin Kaepernick's bended knee, the Black Panthers' political legacy remains alive in America's ongoing dialogue about race, justice and privilege."
