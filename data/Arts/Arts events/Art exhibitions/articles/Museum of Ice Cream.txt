Museum of Ice Cream, started in Manhattan, New York City, is an interactive art exhibit with ice cream and candy themed exhibits, all brightly colored, in a maze of rooms containing "among other things, a rock-candy cave, a unicorn, and a swimming pool of rainbow sprinkles".   The exhibits are very often the backdrop for selfies, and the many selfies posted to instagram, flickr, facebook, and other social media sites have served to promote the exhibit.  Each visitor is offered numerous tastings throughout.  Tickets must be purchased in advance for specific time slots online only. The term "museum" was chosen for the temporary art exhibition because it was something people would understand.  The exhibition was co-founded by Maryellis Bunn, from Laguna Beach, and Manish Vora, previously of equity research firm Monness, Crespi & Hardt.   The exhibition is the brainchild of Maryellis Bunn who was looking for a way to connect to millennial audiences.   She said "It's all about fun, and feeling like a kid again.  Everyone loves ice cream. It's a way to bring people together."  The exhibit first opened in Manhattan in the summer of 2016 and has since opened in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami.   It has been wildly popular, with celebrity visitors including Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow, Drew Barrymore, and on Mother's Day, Jay-Z, Beyonc√©, and Blue Ivy were photographed lounging in the museum's Sprinkle Pool.  The San Francisco exhibit sold out its first batch of tickets in 18 minutes.  As of November 2017 the exhibitions combined have had over 500,000 visitors.
