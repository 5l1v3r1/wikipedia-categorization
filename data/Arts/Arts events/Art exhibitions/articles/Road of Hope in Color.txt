Road of Hope in Color (Spanish: Ruta de Esperanza en Color; Macedonian: Патот на Надежта во Боја; Croatian: Put Nade u Boji) is an art exhibition and a movement against cancer that proposes the creation by law of an art workshop for each Regional Hospital along Chile, to benefit cancer patients and those who must face long-term illness, thereby improving the system of Public Health. It consists of 28 oil paintings on canvas, 12 of which were painted from February to August 2011 over the treatment of six sessions of chemotherapy of a 79-year-old patient diagnosed with cancer in December 2010, Prof. Dora Formas. Two renowned European artists, Tome Mishev and Chendo, contributed six works, each created especially for this exhibition. Marysol Salval, a Spanish artist who lives in Chile, contributed four paintings. The background music of the exposition is donated by Simon Trpčeski, piano soloist from the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. In addition, this initiative is being supported by ADICA (Professional Diplomats Association) and FALP (Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation against cancer). The collection opened in the Cultural Center “Palacio de La Moneda” and is planned to be presented in cities in Chile, United States, Spain, Croatia, Turkey, and Macedonia. It is a tribute to women as a symbol of fertility, creative force, beauty, harmony, and spiritual strength. It has depth and complexity, expressing theology, mythology and how they confuse each other to this day; it encourages reflection and perhaps a metaphysical concept along with other philosophical disquisitions. The Road of Hope in Color is a masterful expression of love for life. Each work reflects the symbolism of life, death and resurrection, spiritual peace, the Eucharist and the hope for renewal of faith.           http://www.ktv41.com.mk http://www.ktv41.com.mk http://mn.mk/kultura http://mkrevolucija.com http://www.24online.mk http://www.navidiku.eu http://www.mtv.com.mk http://getlocalne.ws http://24news.mk http://www.mia.com.mk http://www.time.mk http://www.mactel.com.au http://www.plusinfo.mk http://www.mn.mk http://daily.mk
