 The Photography Biennale of the contemporary Arab world is a cultural event, established by the Arab World Institute and the Maison européenne de la photographie (European Photography Institute) whose aim is to develop a unique panorama of the contemporary photographers operating in – and on – the Arab world since the early 2000s.   Curated by Gabriel Bauret, the first edition took place from 11 November 2016 to 17 January 2017 and aimed at showcasing a range of diverse images and points of view, between the Arab world and Europe.  The event took place in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, between the Arab World Institute and the Maison européenne de la photographie and six others places, such as the Cité Internationale des Arts of Paris, the Mairie du 4ème arrondissement, Photo12 Galerie, Galerie Basia Embiricos, Galerie Boa and Graine de Photographe.  The next edition will be held in November 2017. For this first edition, the Biennale presented works signed by about 50 artists.
