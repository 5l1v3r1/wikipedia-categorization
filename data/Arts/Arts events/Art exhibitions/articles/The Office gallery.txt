The Office is a  contemporary art gallery located in the centre of the old town  of Nicosia in Cyprus near the boundaries of the Green Line, which makes Nicosia the last divided capital in Europe.  The location is a stimulus for some artists who have exhibited their work in the Office gallery.   It was founded in 2009 by the Greek Anastasios Gkekas.  To date the gallery has mounted 20 exhibitions by both European and non-European artists. In 2015 and 2016 the gallery, along with solo shows, mounted two group shows with works by local and international artists. The 2015 show titled "Investment Opportunities" consisted solely of works from the gallery's collection,  and the 2016 show "To Express the Feelings of a Chair When We Sit on it" included works that were loaned for the purposes of this exhibition, accompanied by pieces from the gallery's collection.  In 2015, the Office gallery participated in the Art Brussels 2015 international art fair, presenting works by the Scottish artist Robert Montgomery and the Greek artist Dimitris Merantzas, entitled “Proof against the obtainment of new artwork”.
