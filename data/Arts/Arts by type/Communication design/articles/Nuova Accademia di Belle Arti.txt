It has approximately 3000 students,  some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the Erasmus Programme. NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.  In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the Comune of Milan.  In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the University of Plymouth’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,  offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology. NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to Laureate Education of Baltimore, Maryland, for €22 million.
