A style guide or style manual is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents. A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various academic disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and industry. Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international standards organizations. These are often used as elements of and refined in more specialized style guides that are specific to a subject, region or organization. Some examples are:     In the United States, both corporate and journalistic forms of mass communication rely on styles provided in the Associated Press Stylebook (AP).   A classic grammar style guide, which is designed to complement the AP Stylebook, is The Elements of Style. Together, these two books are referenced more than any other general style book for U.S. third-person writing used across most professions.
