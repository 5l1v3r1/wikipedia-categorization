Social impact entertainment (SIE) is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value. The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of Entertainment-education which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.  A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "Impact Producers" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building. Cinema of Change reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,  the most notable being Participant Media due to its $100 million+ funding.  Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center and UCLA TFT's Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.
