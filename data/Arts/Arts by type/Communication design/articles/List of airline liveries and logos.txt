The aircraft liveries and logos of airlines are used to provide distinctive branding for corporate and commercial reasons.  They also have to combine powerful symbols of national identity while being acceptable to an international market.  Other airlines which use non-specific birds include Kuwait Airways, Ariana Afghan Airlines, Biman Bangladesh and Ukraine International Airlines. British Airways introduced varied and unusual tailfin designs in 1997.  These "airline liveries and logos" were intended to make the airline's branding more cosmopolitan and were described as "arty" and "ethnic".  They were unpopular with many customers and also caused confusion for ground controllers who had more difficulty recognising the British Airways ethnic liveries aircraft to give clear taxiing instructions.  Despite the Â£60M expense of this livery, it was replaced completely in 2001 and the airline has now returned to a more traditional design based upon the Union flag.  Brussels Airlines' first logo was a stylised letter B composed of 13 dots resembling a runway.  This was thought to be unlucky and protests by superstitious passengers caused the airline to add another dot.
