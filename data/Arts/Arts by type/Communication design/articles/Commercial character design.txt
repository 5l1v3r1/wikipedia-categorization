Commercial character design is the process of creating a character and utilising it to enhance or publicise a commercial entity through design.  Examples of characters which have been designed to be used in a commercial application are found throughout the modern world, on advertisement billboards, murals, graphic marketing within interior spaces and within recent years, as animations on the Internet.

Commercial entities use characters which are designed to embody a brand image or enhance a sales campaign. Well known design companies include:
