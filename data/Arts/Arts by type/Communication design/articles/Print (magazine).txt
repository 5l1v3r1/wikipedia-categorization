Print, A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts was a limited edition quarterly periodical begun in 1940  and continued under different names through the end of 2017 as Print, a bimonthly American magazine about visual culture and design. In its final format, Print documented and critiqued commercial, social, and environmental design from every angle: the good (how New York’s public-school libraries are being reinvented through bold graphics), the bad (how Tylenol flubbed its disastrous ad campaign for suspicious hipsters[clarification needed]), and the ugly (how Russia relies on Soviet symbolism to promote sausage and real estate). Print was a general-interest magazine, written by cultural reporters and critics who look at design in its social, political, and historical contexts. From newspapers and book covers to Web-based motion graphics, from corporate branding to indie-rock posters, from exhibitions to cars to monuments, Print showed its audience of designers, art directors, illustrators, photographers, educators, students, and enthusiasts of popular culture why our world looks the way it looks, and why the way it looks matters. Print underwent a complete redesign in 2005, and ceased publication in 2017, with a promise to focus the brand on "a robust and thriving online community."   The journal was founded by William Edwin Rudge to demonstrate “the far reaching importance of the graphic arts” including art prints, commercial printing, wallpaper, etc.  Contents were eclectic covering typography, book making, book printing, fine prints as well as the trade journal aspects of printing candy bar wrappers.  Initially the publication included original prints such as the frontispiece for Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940) a two color woodcut by Hans Alexander Mueller and Vol 1, #3 (December 1940) a black and white wood engraving by Paul Landacre. By Volume 8 (1953) the focus of the periodical had shifted to a trade journal.
