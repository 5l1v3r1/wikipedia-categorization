Videoart at Midnight is an international forum fostering contemporary art, in particular film, new media art and video art. In a monthly program international artists are invited to show their work in the big cinema hall of the Kino Babylon in the Mitte neighborhood of Berlin. Videoart at Midnight is a private initiative, founded in 2008 by Olaf St√ºber and organized since then together with Ivo Wessel.    Once a month on a Friday always at midnight the two art proponents invite artists to show their works within in the "Dispositif cinema" to put them up for discourse. Every night is dedicated to one artist. The artist is present. It is often the occasion for a premiere of a video work, sometimes accompanied by live acts, such as performances, concerts, lectures or artist talks.   The aim of the screening series is to offer a forum for Berlin's international art scene and to give an insight into an artist media that is gaining an increasing importance within the contemporary art production.    Videoart at Midnight is a non-profit cultural program.
