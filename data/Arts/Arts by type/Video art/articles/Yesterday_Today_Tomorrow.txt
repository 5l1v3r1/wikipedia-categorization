Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow (Traceability is Credibility) is an ongoing conceptual art work created by Bryan McCormack, encompassing performance, social media installation art and drawings, on the subject of the European refugee crisis. Throughout 2016 and part of 2017, McCormack visited squats and refugee camps across Europe. At each location he worked with refugees, asking them to produce three drawings: one of their life before (Yesterday), one of their current life (Today) and one of their life imagined in the future (Tomorrow). The results of these drawings have been shared through the project's social media accounts.      Several hundred of these refugee drawings along with video performance studies inspired by the drawings will be part of a multidisciplinary installation created by McCormack at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini during the 2017 Venice Biennale. This installation is in conjunction with a performance, curated by the artist and Dr. Henry Bell, with over forty students from Sheffield Hallam University.
