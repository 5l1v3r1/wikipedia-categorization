The patadyong is a pre-Spanish wrap around loose skirt worn by Filipino women  particularly in the lowland regions of the Visayas islands.  It is similar to the "sarong" or malong used in Mindanao and Indonesia, but instead of the batik patterns it has colourful checked designs or patterns.  It is usually worn with a kimona (a blouse that was traditionally made of pineapple fibre).
