Textile arts are arts and crafts that use plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to construct practical or decorative objects. Textiles have been a fundamental part of human life since the beginning of civilization, and the methods and materials used to make them have expanded enormously, while the functions of textiles have remained the same.  The history of textile arts is also the history of international trade.  Tyrian purple dye was an important trade good in the ancient Mediterranean.  The Silk Road brought Chinese silk to India, Africa, and Europe.  Tastes for imported luxury fabrics led to sumptuary laws during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.  The Industrial Revolution was a revolution of textiles technology: the cotton gin, the spinning jenny, and the power loom mechanized production and led to the Luddite rebellion. A beater is a weaving tool designed to push the weft yard securely into place. In hand weaving, they may sometimes be combined with the shuttle into a single tool. They appear both in a hand-held form, and as an integral part of a loom. More... More...  More... More...
