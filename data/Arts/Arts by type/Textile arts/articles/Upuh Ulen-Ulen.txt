Upuh Ulen-Ulen, also known as kerawang gayo, is a traditional cloth of the Gayonese people in Aceh, Indonesia. The cloth is traditionally placed on a young couple during a wedding ceremony, as well as on the shoulders of guests of honour.  On April 6, 2018, the Acheh poet Lesik Kati Ara presented Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, with a cloth in the State Palace in Jakarta.   The cloth has many components.
