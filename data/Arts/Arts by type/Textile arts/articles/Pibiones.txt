The grain or pibiones weaving technique is most commonly found in the central and eastern areas of Sardinia, Italy. This is a particular type of stitched relief, created from the countless grains that make up the design. These are made by twisting the yarn around a needle which is arranged in a horizontal position on the loom; the needle is then pulled away, thereby creating a raised effect (grains). These grains are fastened by the weft threads and are fixed in position by one or more strokes of the beater. Operated entirely by hand, including the slay mechanism, i.e. the working phase effected by a complicated mechanism moved by the hands and feet which tightens the weft yarns one against the other once they have passed over the pin. The Pibiones technique was used in antiquity only for the best hand-woven bed covers “sa faona” and for household articles such as curtains, fabrics, cushions and tablecloths.
