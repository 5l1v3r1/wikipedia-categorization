Documenting the intimate in sartorial art: A mistress tailor films herself in the creative production of a three-piece suitÂ :  sketch, pattern, fabric, shaping, assembly, fitting, finalization - hundreds of (wo)man-hours, a story.a film... and an allegory. Art Sartorial is maybe a forgotten or unknown term, but corresponds to the art of the Master Tailor. And this film wants to show in detail the knowledge and practice thus of the technique of this art. A avant-garde documentary that was fallen right in the middle of the Fashion Week, while the press attaches are boosting their crazy fashion designer on social networks and while the fashion bloggers and the hippest people in the world Planet rush at the foot of the catwalk. L'architecte textile a perfect counterpoint, the precise work of a watchmaker in the space of the textile architect, who with his skillful hands structures and builds the garment that will sublimate the body by drawing clean lines, and, for the beauty of the gesture, sneak by the tip of the needle the pleats flying away at the slightest movement ... A masterpiece of precision micro mechanics ... the Art of the Grand Couture.  The original idea was to realize a school film for fashion students   so that traditional couture survives and we do not forget the technique of sartorial art, which is disappearing. The first provisional version of the film is 10 hours long. Finally, a 100-minute cinema film has been created to give "non-professionals" the opportunity to experience this exclusive and increasingly rare profession.
