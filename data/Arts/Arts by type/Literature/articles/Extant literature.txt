Extant literature and extant music refers to texts or music that has survived from the past to the present time, as opposed to lost work. Extant literature can be divided into extant original manuscripts, copies of original manuscripts, quotations and paraphrases of passages of non-extant texts contained in other works, translations of non-extant texts into other languages, or, more recently, photocopies or digital copies of texts.
