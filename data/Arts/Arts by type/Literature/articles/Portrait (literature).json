Historians of <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_antiquity\" title=\"Classical antiquity\">antiquity</a> recognised the task of the portrait as representation; we find the beginnings of the narrative portrait in <a href=\"/wiki/Livy\" title=\"Livy\">Livy</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tacitus\" title=\"Tacitus\">Tacitus</a>. However, the portrait began to emerge from the need to describe oneself (self-portrait) or one's contemporaries, as in the <i>Essays</i> of <a href=\"/wiki/Montaigne\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Montaigne\">Montaigne</a>. This latter work develops a line of questioning around the movement of the representation of the individual (or of a society) from the pictorial mode to the discursive mode.\n</p><p>The portrait can be realised in <a href=\"/wiki/Prose\" title=\"Prose\">prose</a> or in <a href=\"/wiki/Verse_(poetry)\" title=\"Verse (poetry)\">verse</a>. Its objectives vary according to context: sociocultural, sociopolitical, historical, or again according to the subjectivity of the portraitist (the writer). Thus one can speak of a fictional portrait (corresponding to the characters who populate the fictional universe of each <a href=\"/wiki/Author\" title=\"Author\">author</a>) as much as a realist one (representing real-life people).\n</p><p>The portrait oscillates between <a href=\"/wiki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fiction\" title=\"Fiction\">fiction</a>, between <a href=\"/wiki/Eulogy\" title=\"Eulogy\">eulogy</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Satire\" title=\"Satire\">satire</a>, between one portrait which imitates its original and another which moves away from it (such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Caricatures\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Caricatures\">caricatures</a> found in newspapers or in <a href=\"/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re\" title=\"Moli\u00e8re\">Moli\u00e8re</a>). Nevertheless, the objective portrait which describes the flaws and qualities of the individual represented (or equally the object or the idea) is quite widespread. The literary portrait evolved through the centuries and its development has been shaped by writers as well as literary critics and theorists.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#The_portrait_in_the_seventeenth_century\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The portrait in the seventeenth century</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_portrait_in_the_eighteenth_century\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The portrait in the eighteenth century</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_portrait_of_the_nineteenth_century\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The portrait of the nineteenth century</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#The_portrait_of_the_twentieth_century\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The portrait of the twentieth century</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_portrait_in_the_seventeenth_century\">The portrait in the seventeenth century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Portrait_(literature)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: The portrait in the seventeenth century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is from the 1650s that the portrait began to be defined as a literary genre. It is through the social innovations of the <i>pr\u00e9cieuses</i> - such as <a href=\"/wiki/La_Grande_Mademoiselle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"La Grande Mademoiselle\">La Grande Mademoiselle</a> who, influenced by the portrait-laden works of <a href=\"/wiki/Madeleine_de_Scud%C3%A9ry\" title=\"Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry\">Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry</a>, gathered around her (as a <i>salonni\u00e8re</i> or \u2018salon hostess\u2019) men of letters - that the portrait was transformed into a \u2018diversion of society\u2019.\n</p><p>The literary portrait held to the essential aesthetic rules of the pictorial mode - that is, it had to describe the individual (model) faithfully in order to disguinguish it as a type apart. Nevertheless, it was not to be inferred from the recognition of the individual represented, but rather from the portraitist's style. This narrative representation had the function of highlighting fixed and timeless physical and mental features, as one sees in the works of Moli\u00e8re or in the <i>Caract\u00e8res</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_de_La_Bruy%C3%A8re\" title=\"Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re\">Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re</a>. It had to be achieved through layers of successive description - as in painting - which were only distinct phrases describing the real model's features.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_portrait_in_the_eighteenth_century\">The portrait in the eighteenth century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Portrait_(literature)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The portrait in the eighteenth century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Age of Enlightenment heralded a new phase in the development of the literary portrait. It invaded literature and even contaminated music. <a href=\"/wiki/Mozart\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mozart\">Mozart</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Beethoven\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beethoven\">Beethoven</a> excelled in this genre. Nevertheless, the portrait carried more of the psychology of the model represented than his or her physical appearance.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Denis_Diderot\" title=\"Denis Diderot\">Denis Diderot</a>, it is precisely the pictorial portrait that is the occasion of a narrative self-portrait effected in the form of an artistic critique of the paintings and statues which were made of him. Thus he did not like the painting by <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_Michel_van_Loo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Louis Michel van Loo\">Louis Michel van Loo</a> portraying him:\n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p><i>Quite alive; it\u2019s his gentleness, with his vivacity; but too young, head too small, pretty like a woman, ogling, smiling, cute, giving a small kiss, affected mouth [\u2026] Sparkling close up, vigorous from afar, especially the skin.

Without the exaggeration of all the features in the engraving made from Greuze\u2019s pencil, I would have been infinitely better. I have a mask that deceives the artist; either there is too much melted together or the impressions of my soul succeed each other very quickly and paint themselves all over my face: the eye of the painter does not find me the same from one moment to the other; his task becomes much more difficult than he had believed it to be.</i> \n</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Diderot, only one painter managed to make a pictorial portrait of him in which he recognizes himself and that is <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jean-Baptiste_Garand&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jean-Baptiste Garand (page does not exist)\">Jean-Baptiste Garand</a>: by an apparent irony of fate, this success was the result of chance: \n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p><i>It never was done well save by a poor devil named Garand, who caught me, as happens to a fool who says a good word.

Thus, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Marie_Du_Deffand&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Marie Du Deffand (page does not exist)\">Marie Du Deffand</a>, taking the thermal waters at <a href=\"/wiki/Forges-les-Eaux\" title=\"Forges-les-Eaux\">Forges-les-Eaux</a>, was able to draw a sharp and cheerful portrait of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Madame_de_Pecquigny&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Madame de Pecquigny (page does not exist)\">Madame de Pecquigny</a>, the companion that fate had assigned her during her treatment: \n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p><i>La Pecquigny is no resource, and her spirit is like space; there is no extension, depth, and perhaps all the other dimensions that I can not say, because I do not know them; but this is only empty for use.

She has on her plate heaps of gnawed bones, of sucked skins, and, during that time, either I am bored to death or I eat more than I should. It is a curious thing to see her eat a biscuit; it lasts half an hour and the fact of the matter is that she eats like a wolf. It truly is an enraging exercise.</i>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Marie Du Deffand completes this portrait of an eccentric by linking her to her interlocutor: \u201cI am sorry that you have in common with her the impossibility of staying a minute at rest.\u201d After which she concludes, in accordance with the philosophy of resignation and disinterest she defends, the temporary nature of that which she will have to endure on this \u201choliday meeting\u201d: \n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p><i>Finally - do you want me to tell you?
