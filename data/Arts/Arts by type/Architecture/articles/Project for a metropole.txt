Project for a metropole is an architecture plan by Étienne-Louis Boullée designed around 1781. It deals with light, as do many of his designs, as an important element. Light is a metaphor for enlightenment as is darkness for ignorance. The plan features columns spaced closer together then the canon for classical architecture would have them be placed and oversized pendentives.
