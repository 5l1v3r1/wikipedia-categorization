The Harkleroad wind turbine was built to generate electricity.   It appears along a heavily traveled freeway in northern California.  Around 1960, Sam Harkleroad designed and constructed three unusual structures on a plot of land in Novato, Marin County, California: Sam Harkleroad was born on October 20, 1909, and grew up on a farm in Fresno.  His education ended with high school.  He lived much of his life in  Marin County.  Harkleroad died on June 12, 1993, at the age of 83. Harkleroad was a contractor, who liked to use recycled materials. The Harkleroad structures are on a street named Harkle Road.  The round house once appeared in a Popular Mechanics article, which explained how the house was able to rotate 320 degrees, while the plumbing and electrical systems continued to function.  One of the three buildings has a saddle roof made of 2 by 4 lumber.  This house was for sale in 1959, with a minimum bid of $32,000.  The roof of the workshop has a wind turbine, intended to provide electricity, however, it is no longer used.
