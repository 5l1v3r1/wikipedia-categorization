Zaguan refers to a house plan configuration where a central passageway leads from a front door to a patio or a courtyard.  This is found in historic houses in Mexico and in the southwestern U.S.  An example is the Ortiz House in Yuma, Arizona.  Another is the Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in New Mexico.
