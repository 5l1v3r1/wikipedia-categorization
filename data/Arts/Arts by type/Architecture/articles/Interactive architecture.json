Interactive architecture encompasses <a href=\"/wiki/Building_automation\" title=\"Building automation\">building automation</a> but goes beyond it by including forms of interaction engagements and responses that may lay in pure communication purposes as well as in the emotive and artistic realm, thus entering the field of <a href=\"/wiki/Interactive_art\" title=\"Interactive art\">Interactive art</a>.\n<b>Interactive architecture</b> part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_of_things\" title=\"Internet of things\">Internet of things</a>, a term first coined by <b>Kevin Ashton of Procter &amp; Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999</b>, can include both interior and exterior elements. Within the interior, many technologies are competing to see who will emerge as the dominant communicative signal. 4GLTE <a href=\"/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)\" title=\"LTE (telecommunication)\">LTE (telecommunication)</a> being replaced eventually by <a href=\"/wiki/5G\" title=\"5G\">5G</a>, is the obvious solution, however <a href=\"/wiki/Visible_light_communication\" title=\"Visible light communication\">Visible light communication</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Li-Fi\" title=\"Li-Fi\">Li-Fi</a>, a term first introduced by <b>Harald Haas during a 2011 TEDGlobal talk in Edinburgh</b>, is gaining ground as research into this type of data transfer method increases. <b>Interactive architecture</b> and designing our buildings with this technology embedded in it, is essential in the development of <b>smart cities</b>.\n</p><p>Another essential element in the development of a <a href=\"/wiki/Smart_city\" title=\"Smart city\">Smart city</a> is the <a href=\"/wiki/Landscape_architecture\" title=\"Landscape architecture\">Landscape architecture</a>. The space in-between buildings used by the public, or the public realm as it is more commonly termed. There are two levels of communication within the public realm and the difference between the two are commonly accepted as the differentiation between IoT and IoE. IoE, or The Internet of Everything, was a phrase first used by Cisco in an attempt to achieve polarity with competitors that had embraced the term IoT. In Cisco's definition however, they highlighted one main difference between IoT and IoE. This difference being interaction with the human node.\n</p><p>The two public realm communication protocols that make that space a smart space are:\n</p><p><b>The Intelligent Realm, i-realm.</b> Defined as a realm designed with embedded <b>information and communication technology</b>, which allows the silo elements of that space, lighting, ventilation, traffic signals, transportation, waste management, to communicate with one another for the purpose of making that urban area more efficient and effective.\n</p><p>The second communication protocol is <b>The Interactive Realm</b>. Defined as incorporating all of the technology needed to create an intelligent realm but in addition, using communication methods such as <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Positioning_System\" title=\"Global Positioning System\">Global Positioning System</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Geo-fence\" title=\"Geo-fence\">Geo-fence</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Near-field_communication\" title=\"Near-field communication\">Near-field communication</a>' and embedded <a href=\"/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy\" title=\"Bluetooth Low Energy\">Bluetooth Low Energy</a>, to allow communication between the architecture of the space and the consumers of it. Sometimes referred to as the <b>physical web</b> by <a href=\"/wiki/Google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a>, an interactive realm uses exterior <b>lighting, bollards, street furniture</b>, bus stops and other elements to communicate to the public via their <a href=\"/wiki/Smartphone\" title=\"Smartphone\">Smartphone</a> or tablet. \n</p><p>Whilst IoT concerns itself with communication between objects in order to make the design more efficient and interactive from an operational stand point. IoE in addition also incorporates communication between embedded objects and user devices. The applications are endless but include, <a href=\"/wiki/Wayfinding\" title=\"Wayfinding\">Wayfinding</a>, safety, anti-terrorism, <a href=\"/wiki/Targeted_advertising\" title=\"Targeted advertising\">Targeted advertising</a>, general information such as history of the space<b> or simply just to make the space more enjoyable.</b>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1320\nCached time: 20180901232657\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.059 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 66/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4091/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 14/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.016/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   44.883      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   44.883      1 -total\n 66.28%   29.747      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:47093327-0!canonical and timestamp 20180901232657 and revision id 837624173\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2017"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Architecture"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from September 2017"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"5G"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Architecture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bluetooth Low Energy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Building automation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Geo-fence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Global Positioning System"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Google"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Interactive art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Internet of things"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"LTE (telecommunication)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Landscape architecture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Li-Fi"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Near-field communication"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Smart city"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Smartphone"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Targeted advertising"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Visible light communication"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Wayfinding"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Interactive architecture","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q25052665"}]}}
