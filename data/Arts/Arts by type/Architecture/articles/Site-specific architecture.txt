Site-specific architecture (SSA) is architecture which is of its time and of its place. It is designed to respond to both its physical context, and the metaphysical context within which it has been conceived and executed. The physical context will include its location, local materials, planning framework, building codes, etc., whilst the metaphysical context will include the client's aspirations, community values, and architects ideas about the building type, client, location, building use, etc. It deals with board specific codes.
