A parti pris  is an organizing thought or decision behind an architect's design,  presented in the form of a basic diagram or a simple statement.  It may be shortened to "parti". The term comes from 15th century French, in which "parti pris" meant "decision taken." Later, it took on the meaning of "bias" or "prejudice".   The term developed in a particularly Euro-centric context of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France in which the proponents were predominantly white, male and well-to-do. The development of the parti frequently precedes the development of plan, section, and elevation diagrams.  Due to the fact that it defines the organizing thought prior to research, exploration, collaboration and the development of intentions, the "parti" is a passé approach to architectural design. Critics argue that recent historical attempts to recover the term for contemporary times are conservative and nostalgic for a simpler time. They make the case that parti is a stand in for a formalist approach to architecture that abdicates responsibility and social engagement.
