In architecture, an ell is a wing of a building that lies perpendicular to the length of the main portion.  It takes its name from the shape of the letter L.  Ells are often additions to an existing building which make it L-shaped in plan.  In connected farm architecture, the ell is often extended to attach the main house to another building, usually a barn.
