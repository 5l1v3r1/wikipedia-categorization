The term "Expressionist Rococo" was first used in 1928 by Max Osborn to describe the Theater am Kurf√ºrstendamm in Berlin designed by Oskar Kaufmann.  In difference to the original Rococo design Kaufmann emphasizes on the dynamic and movement as a whole concept. Asymmetrical details are subordinated to a large symmetrical frame.   Other protagonists of this style were Hans Poelzig,  Leo Nachtlicht and Gerhard Schliepstein.
