The Chiesa del Sacro Cuore ("Church of the Holy Heart") is a Catholic Church located in Alcamo, in the province of Trapani. The parish of the Holy Heart of Jesus was established by the bishop of Trapani, monsignor Ricceri, on October 4, 1967.   Several years before the Episcopal Curia (Catholic Church) of Trapani had bought a piece of land to build a Church which was to serve the new area that was expanding next to Viale Europa. They started with a prefabricated structure, with a roof  in asbestos cement, a hall and two rooms;  in 1978 they built the parsonage and other premises for the parish, but they had to wait until 1982 to start the real building which included the Church and the hall below it. In 1987 Vincenzo Settipani, an architect, substituted Li Santi, who had died; he designed the mosaics, the stained glasses, holy water stoups, Baptismal font, ambon and altar. They were realized by the firm Pierotti from Pietrasanta (in the province of Lucca) and by the mosaicist Fabriano Fabret; the artistic and huge wooden confessional was made by the firm Gaspare Ferrantelli.  The Church was completed in 1991 and was consecrated in 1993.  The Church is with one nave and has the characteristic of a roof shaped like a boat overturned;  inside it there are these works: In the sacristy there is a wooden statue of the Holy Heart of Jesus, made by Giuseppe Stuflesser from Ortisei in 1967.
