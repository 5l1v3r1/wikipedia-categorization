Evolving Definition : : Morphology in architecture is the study of the evolution of form within the built environment. Often specifically reducible to the interaction of people and the material world, this in fact broad concept references linguistics, history, sociology, physics, and biology to describe changes in the formal syntax of buildings and cities as their relationship to people and individuals evolves and changes.  Often morphology describes discursive processes, such as in the evolution of a design concept from first conception to production, but can also be understood as the categorical study in the change of buildings and their use from a historical perspective.  Similar to genres of music, morphology concretizes 'movements' and arrives at definitions of architectural 'styles' or typologies.  Architectural typologies are often described by the movements that gave rise to a certain aesthetic, the influences of which are usually cultural or philosophical in origin. Some examples are, indigenous architecture, classical architecture, baroque architecture, modernism, postmodernism, deconstructionism, brutalism, and futurism.  Recent advances in fluid and cross platform tools such as 3d printing, virtual reality, and building information modeling make the current contemporary typology formally difficult to pinpoint into one holistic definition. Advances in the study of Architectural (formal) morphology have the potential to influence or foster new fields of study in the realms of the arts, cognitive science, psychology, behavioral science, neurology, mapping, linguistics, and other as yet unknown social spatial practices or studies. Often Architectural Morphologies are reflexive or indicative of political influences of their time and perhaps more importantly, place.
