Tim Gunn's Guide to Style is an American reality television series on Bravo. The series debuted on September 6, 2007 and is hosted by Project Runway's Tim Gunn, and co-hosted by model Veronica Webb in the first season and Gretta Monahan in the second season.  Gunn and his cohost offer to make over guests following their style as long as they adhere to a set of style rules. The show's format consists of several segments. After meeting the guest and reviewing an interview tape, the show starts with the hosts reviewing and then discarding most of the guest's existing wardrobe. Another segment involves the use of OptiTex fashion design software to illustrate the appearance of different fashions on a computer simulation of the guest, followed by a solo shopping spree for "ten essential items", which the hosts then critique. The guest will also meet with specialty consultants, such as designers, hairdressers or runway coaches, for one-on-one coaching. The show ends with a revealing to the guest's friends and family to show off the changes in their style.
