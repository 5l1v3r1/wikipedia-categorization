For that purpose the Guild set up a \"Piracy Committee,\" which decided which of the designs registered by its members were original. It then employed shoppers in various parts of the country who visited the shops of retailers and report delinquents: if a retailer was found to be selling \"pirated designs,\" it must stop doing so, or else it would get no more dresses from the Guild's members; nor would it be allowed to see the designs exhibited in the Guild's New York show rooms. Retailers that co-operated with the Guild had to agree to accept the decision of the Piracy Committee, and to return to sellers any dresses that had been \"pirated.\" Furthermore, they had to warrant to customers that the designs of the dresses they sold had not been \"pirated.\" As a result of the Guild's efforts, approximately 12,000 retailers signed agreements to \"cooperate\" with the Guild's boycott program.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>If the Guild, upon auditing a member's books, found that a manufacturer was selling to a retailer dealing in pirated designs, the manufacturer was heavily fined.

The Court did not consider whether FOGA had property rights that were wrongfully invaded, or whether a boycott could be justified on some ground. It held horizontal boycotts (concerted refusals to deal) illegal <i>per se</i>.\n</p><p>The Court began by declaring, \"If the purpose and practice of the combination of garment manufacturers and their affiliates runs counter to the public policy declared in the Sherman and Clayton Acts, the Federal Trade Commission has the power to suppress it as an unfair method of competition.\" The Court then considered whether the challenged boycott violated the letter of the Sherman or Clayton Acts, and found both to have been violated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Court then found that FOGA's \"scheme\" vioated \u00a7&#160;3 of the Clayton Act because \"the scheme is bottomed upon a system of sale under which (1) textiles shall be sold to garment manufacturers only upon the condition and understanding that the buyers will not use or deal in textiles which are copied from the designs of textile manufacturing Guild members; (2) garment manufacturers shall sell to retailers only upon the condition and understanding that the retailers shall not use or deal in such copied designs.\" Since the FTC concluded \"that these understandings substantially lessened competition and tended to create a monopoly,\" the FTC \"correctly concluded that this practice constituted an unfair method of competition.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>FOGA's program also violated the policies of \u00a7\u00a7&#160;1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, in that: \"it narrows the outlets to which garment and textile manufacturers can sell and the sources from which retailers can buy; subjects all retailers and manufacturers who decline to comply with the Guild's program to an organized boycott; takes away the freedom of action of members by requiring each to reveal to the Guild the intimate details of their individual affairs; and has both as its necessary tendency and as its purpose and effect the direct suppression of competition from the sale of unregistered textiles and copied designs.\" In addition, FOGA's \"combination is in reality an extra-governmental agency which prescribes rules for the regulation and restraint of interstate commerce and provides extrajudicial tribunals for determination and punishment of violations, and thus 'trenches upon the power of the national legislature and violates the statute.'&#8239;\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>FOGA argued that the \" boycott and restraint of interstate trade is not within the ban of the policies of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, because 'the practices of FOGA were reasonable and necessary to protect the manufacturer, laborer, retailer and consumer against the devastating evils growing from the pirating of original designs and had in fact benefited all four. boycott and restraint of interstate trade is not within the ban of the policies of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, because 'the practices of FOGA were reasonable and necessary to protect the manufacturer, laborer, retailer and consumer against the devastating evils growing from the pirating of original designs and had in fact benefited all four.'&#8239;\" In addition, FOGA said, the copying of dress designs against which FOGA directed its conduct was itself tortious. The Court rejected these arguments, saying:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[E]ven if copying were an acknowledged tort under the law of every state, that situation would not justify petitioners in combining together to regulate and restrain interstate commerce in violation of federal law.

Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> the Supreme Court relied on the <i>FOGA</i> case to support the proposition: \"Group boycotts, or concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders, have long been held to be in the forbidden category. They have not been saved by allegations that they were reasonable in the specific circumstances, nor by a failure to show that they 'fixed or regulated prices, parcelled out or limited production, or brought about a deterioration in quality.'&#8239;\" In the <i>Klor's</i> case, the boycott was created when a retail store, Broadway-Hale, and ten household appliance manufacturers and their distributors agreed that the distributors would not sell household appliances (or would sell them only at discriminatory prices) to Broadway-Hale\u2019s small, nearby competitor, Klor\u2019s, a price-cutter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The defendants submitted undisputed evidence that their agreement hurt only one competitor (Klor\u2019s) and that so many other nearby appliance-selling competitors remained that competition in the marketplace continued to thrive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The Court held that this evidence was immaterial, because the conspiracy was \u201cnot to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <i>American Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v.

Discon, Inc.</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> the Supreme Court held that the <i>per se</i> rule against boycotts was limited to horizontal group boycotts. The Court said:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he specific legal question before us is whether an antitrust court considering an agreement by a buyer to purchase goods or services from one supplier rather than another should (after examining the buyer\u2019s reasons or justifications) apply the <i>per se</i> rule if it finds no legitimate business reason for that purchasing decision. We conclude no boycott-related <i>per se</i> rule applies and that the plaintiff here must allege and prove harm, not just to a single competitor, but to the competitive process, <i>i.e.</i>, to competition itself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Court pointed to precedent: <i>FOGA</i> involved \"a group boycott in the strongest sense: A group of competitors threatened to withhold business from third parties unless those third parties would help them injure their directly competing rivals.\" <i>Klor's</i> \"also  involved a horizontal agreement among those threatened, namely, the appliance suppliers, to hurt a competitor of the retailer who made the threat.\" Because the case before the Court \"concerns only a vertical agreement and a vertical restraint, a restraint that takes the form of depriving a supplier of a potential customer,\" it was not within existing boycott precedent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commentary\">Commentary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fashion_Originators%27_Guild_of_America_v._FTC&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Commentary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Wallace Kirkpatrick, an official of the Antitrust Division, writing shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in the <i>FOGA</i> case, pointed out the difference between Learned Hand's and Justice Black's respective approaches to boycotts against wrongdoers\u2014persons committing criminal or tortious acts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Judge Hand held that a boycott may be justified by the conduct of the person against whom the boycott is directed, even where the boycott was not a refusal to participate in unlawful acts. For instance, he said, it was justifiable for dress manufacturers to boycott retailers who got access to unpublished designs by a crime or a breach of contract, or who\nknowingly bought from a manufacturer who stole unpublished designs or copied them without the owner's consent. Justice Black, however, would not permit vigilante justice. He said that the fact that a person was engaged in tortious conduct would not allow a group to refuse in concert to deal with him and would not justify \"combining together to regulate and restrain interstate commerce in violation of federal law.\" Kirkpatrick pointed out that the Supreme Court, but not Judge Hand, properly followed the principle that the Supreme Court had explained in <i>United States v. American Livestock Comm'n Co.</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> which distinguished between joint refusals to participate in unlawful conduct and joint refusals to deal where \"the wrong is completely independent of the dealings\ninto which the combination refuses to enter.\" Kirkpatrick aligns himself with Black in saying that no private group has the right to \"assum[e] the power to decide who is fitted to enter into business and what is a prerequisite for engaging in interstate commerce.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Robert Merges observed of FOGA that  the only important differences between it (and similar guilds) and a formal statutory IP right covering fashion designs were: \n</p>\n<ol><li>the guilds were based on \"an informal, inter-industry quasi-property right, rather than a formal statutory right\";</li>\n<li>the guilds \"required concerted action to achieve any appropriability\"; and</li>\n<li>the guilds \"concentrated [their] enforcement efforts at the retail level by requiring retailers to sign contracts and by policing retailers, rather than targeting competing manufacturers.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup></li></ol>\n<p>In Merges's view, which is the diametric opposite of that of the Court in regard to \"an extra-governmental agency which prescribes rules for the regulation and restraint of interstate commerce and provides extrajudicial tribunals for determination and punishment of violations,\" the FTC and Court made a mistake in condemning FOGA \"out of hand\" simply because it ran a boycott. Rather, the \"Court should have considered whether the Guild tended to enhance economic efficiency,' and whether it did so at a lower cost than a formal property right in dress design.\" He would favor the Guild over a formal IPR [intellectual property right] granted by the state .&#160;.&#160;. [if] the combination of (1) enforcement at the retail level and (2) shared understandings about what qualifies as an 'original design' would make the system cheaper to administer than a formal, state-run system that created the same level of reward, and hence incentives.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> He concludes that the Court's rejection of the FOGA scheme:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>not only killed an interesting experiment in alternative intellectual property systems, but it also sent a far-reaching signal that when these systems are based on informal property rights, they are void <i>per se</i>.
