Dotted Swiss, also known as Swiss dot, is a sheer cotton fabric that is embellished with small dots.  The dots can be applied in a number of different ways and colors, and the fabric is used for baby clothes, wedding dresses   and curtains. The design is said to have originated around 1750 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, which emerged as a textile center in the 15th century.
