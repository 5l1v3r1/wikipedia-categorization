CCA offers diploma and certificate programs accredited by the accrediting commission of the American Culinary Federation. The school also offers basic courses for beginners and professionals as well as international degree succession and certification. CCA, Manila finds its roots with the opening of the Cravings Bakeshop on October 16, 1988. This gave birth to the Cravings Group of Companies. Thus, the conceptualization of CCA, Manila began and took form. This was materialized by the team of experts led by Dr. John Knapp, project coordinator of the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in Canada, and the University of the Philippines-College of Home Economics. It took three years to assess the needs of the industry, formulate an effective curriculum, form a team of chef instructors, and construct the culinary school itself. CCA was established on August 26, 1996, followed by the launch of the countryâ€™s first formal culinary education program, the Diploma in Culinary Arts and Technology Management (DCAM) in 1997. The CCA offers both diploma and certificate programs in either Culinary Arts or Baking and Pastry Arts. Apart from lectures and spending at least 5 hours daily in the kitchen laboratories, students undergo actual hotel work for their apprenticeship to acquire mastery of techniques. The school also offers an International Degree Succession program which is available through their partner schools should one decided to enhance their one- or two-year program and earn a degree.  These schools are William Angliss Institute in Australia, Johnson and Wales University in the US, Les Roches in Switzerland, Thames Valley University in the UK, and the Northern Alberta Institute in Canada.
