Non-vegetarian is an Indian English word that is used to refer to a person who is not a vegetarian i.e. someone who consumes meat, especially as a major source of protein.   Although the meaning is readily understood, this term is not common parlance in most English-speaking countries where meat consumption is the norm and vegetarianism or veganism is rare. A related word is Eggetarian, that refers to a vegetarian who consume egg-based products but not meat.
