Brandalism is an anti-advertising movement founded in July 2012 in London. Twenty-six British artists ran a "subvertising" campaign, whereby they covered billboard adverts in five English cities with art pieces.   In May 2014, 40 Brandalism activists replaced 365 outdoor advertisements in 10 British cities, at bus stops and elsewhere, with monochrome art. The posters were intended to evoke an anti-advertising sentiment.
