In art and art criticism, form and content are considered distinct aspects of a work of art. The term form refers to the work's style, techniques and media used, and how the elements of design are implemented. Content, on the other hand, refers to a work's subject matter, or what is being depicted.  Incongruity between form and content can be humorous.  Form is one of the most frequent terms in literary criticism.it is often used merely to designate a genre or for patterns of meter lines and rhymes.
