Artistic freedom is the extent of freedom of an artist to produce art to his/her own insight. The extent can deviate to customs in a certain school of art, directives of the assigner, etc.   Artistic freedom should not be confused to the freedom of art (e.g. Kunstfreiheit in Germanic countries), where it is a constitutional provision to prevent political censorship.    A related colloquial term is artistic license, the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of grammar or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an artist for artistic effect.  In the United States, the first amendment protects artistic expression.  In Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects artist expression.   UK laws do not define grossly offensive expression.  In 2012-2013, the United Nations carried out a comprehensive study on artistic freedom.[needs update] Based on a background report produced in June-July 2012, as well as an experts meeting and an open consultation in Geneva in December 2012, the UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights Ms. Farida Shaheed submitted her final report to the UN Human Rights Council in June 2013.  In 2017, the Danish free speech advocacy group Freemuse released their annual  report Art Under Threat about the state of artistic freedom in 2016 which showed a 119 percent increase in attacks and censorship  from 2015.  The music industry was the main target of serious violations, and second to film in overall violations, including non-violent censorship.  The most serious violations included the murder of Pakistani Qawwali singer Amjad Sabri and the killing of Burundi musician Pascal Treasury Nshimirimana.
