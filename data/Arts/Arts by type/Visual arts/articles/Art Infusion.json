The authors suggested that the creation and appreciation of art has evolved through the millennia of <a href=\"/wiki/Prehistory\" title=\"Prehistory\">human prehistory</a>, and that the universal human impulse to apply skill and creative effort to express oneself artistically is also reflected in the recognition of the objects thus created as belonging to a special category. This special category has several characteristics, including non-utility. This does not imply that artworks cannot have utility, but that creativity and skill are central to the creation and appreciation of the artwork, irrespective of any other functions, or lack thereof, that the artwork may serve. This non-utilitarian quest for excellence, when associated with other objects, leads to more favorable evaluations of those objects.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Art_Infusion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Corbett, Rachel (2008), \u201cStriking Their Fancy,\u201d <i>ARTnews</i>, 107 (6), 42.</li>\n<li>Hagtvedt, Henrik and Vanessa M.
