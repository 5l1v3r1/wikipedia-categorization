Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists was written by Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith   with George Plimpton (co-founder of the Paris Review) and published by Random House in April 1993. In 1974, Smith founded Very Special Arts, an educational affiliate of the Kennedy Center that provides opportunities in the creative arts for persons with disabilities in the United States and around the world. In February 2011, President Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom,  the nation’s highest civilian honor, for her work with people with disabilities. The 272 page book profiles 16 artists with disabilities who discuss how art has made a difference in their lives despite their unique challenges. Artists include Chuck Close, Mark Di Suvero, Jack Hofsiss, Tony Meléndez, Howie Seago and Randy Souders.  The book also includes a "disability awareness guide," a list of disability organizations and other resources. It was published in both hardcover and paperback editions.
