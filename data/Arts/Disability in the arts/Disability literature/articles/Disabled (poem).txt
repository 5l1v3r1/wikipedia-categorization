"Disabled" is a war poem by Wilfred Owen written in 1917. It expresses the tormented thoughts and recollections of a teenaged soldier in World War I who has lost his limbs in battle and is now confined to a wheelchair. The subject contrasts the predicament he is now in with the youthful pleasures he had enjoyed "before he threw away his knees". He recalls the impetuous circumstances in which he enlisted, notes how the crowds that greeted his return were smaller and less enthusiastic than those who cheered his departure, and laments how women no longer look at him but at "the strong men who were whole".
