He was one of the first generation of English actors to achieve wealth and a degree of social status by means of his trade.\n</p><p>Phillips first enters the historical record as a member of the amalgamation of <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Strange%27s_Men\" title=\"Lord Strange&#39;s Men\">Lord Strange's Men</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Admiral%27s_Men\" title=\"Admiral&#39;s Men\">Admiral's Men</a> that performed <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_(play)\" title=\"The Seven Deadly Sins (play)\">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></i> (perhaps by <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Tarlton\" title=\"Richard Tarlton\">Richard Tarlton</a>) between 1590 and 1592. In the surviving \"plot\" of this performance, Phillips is assigned the role of <a href=\"/wiki/Sardanapalus\" title=\"Sardanapalus\">Sardanapalus</a>; he is one of the few actors not required to play a double role. He is named in the touring warrant issued to Strange's Men in 1592; after the death of their patron <a href=\"/wiki/Ferdinando_Stanley,_5th_Earl_of_Derby\" title=\"Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby\">Ferdinando Stanley</a> he joined the new <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain%27s_Men\" title=\"Lord Chamberlain&#39;s Men\">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a>, presumably as a sharer.\n</p><p>Phillips remained with the company through its change to the <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Men_(playing_company)\" title=\"King&#39;s Men (playing company)\">King's Men</a> and to his death in 1605. Little is known with certainty of his roles with the company, except that he was probably already mature when the company assembled. He appears in the cast lists for <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Jonson\" title=\"Ben Jonson\">Ben Jonson</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Every_Man_in_His_Humour\" title=\"Every Man in His Humour\">Every Man in His Humour</a></i> (1598), <i><a href=\"/wiki/Every_Man_Out_of_His_Humour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Every Man Out of His Humour\">Every Man Out of His Humour</a></i> (1599), and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sejanus\" title=\"Sejanus\">Sejanus</a></i> (1603). He may be the author of a jig, <i>Phillips His Slipper</i>, entered for publishing in the <a href=\"/wiki/Stationers%27_Register\" title=\"Stationers&#39; Register\">Stationers' Register</a> in 1595.\n</p><p>He was one of the six sharers in the <a href=\"/wiki/Globe_Theatre\" title=\"Globe Theatre\">Globe Theatre</a> when it was built in 1598&#8211;9, with a one-eighth share. Over time this made him a comparatively wealthy man, at least as far as Elizabethan actors were concerned. Like Shakespeare, Phillips lived for many years near his occupation in <a href=\"/wiki/Southwark\" title=\"Southwark\">Southwark</a>, in Paris Garden near the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Swan_(theatre)\" title=\"The Swan (theatre)\">Swan Theatre</a>, and in <a href=\"/wiki/Aldgate\" title=\"Aldgate\">Aldgate</a>; but by the time of his death he owned a house in <a href=\"/wiki/Mortlake\" title=\"Mortlake\">Mortlake</a>, in <a href=\"/wiki/Surrey\" title=\"Surrey\">Surrey</a>.\n</p><p>In 1601, he was the representative of the company called to testify before the <a href=\"/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Privy Council of the United Kingdom\">Privy Council</a> about their involvement with the rebellion of the <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Devereux,_2nd_Earl_of_Essex\" title=\"Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex\">Earl of Essex</a>; the Chamberlain's Men had been paid by supporters of the Earl to perform Shakespeare's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Richard_II_(play)\" title=\"Richard II (play)\">Richard II</a></i> before the abortive coup. Phillips' testimony seems to have assuaged whatever anger the court may have felt towards the players; they were not punished, and indeed played for <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England\" title=\"Elizabeth I of England\">Elizabeth</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Whitehall_Palace\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Whitehall Palace\">Whitehall</a> on 24 February 1601, the night before Essex was executed. (The choice of Phillips as representative is interesting; why him, and not Shakespeare or Burbage? He testified that the Lord Chamberlain's Men had played at the request of Essex's supporters, specifically because they were offered 40 shillings more than their normal fee. This might indicate that Phillips had a role in keeping the financial accounts of the company.)\n</p><p>The evidence suggests a life deeply intertwined with the theater. He was a stepbrother of his fellow King's Man <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Pope_(16th-century_actor)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)\">Thomas Pope</a>, and his sister married another actor, <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Gough_(actor)\" title=\"Robert Gough (actor)\">Robert Gough</a>.\n</p><p>Phillips's daughters Magdalen and Rebecca were baptized in the parish of St. Saviour's in <a href=\"/wiki/Southwark\" title=\"Southwark\">Southwark</a> in 1594 and 1596 respectively. A son, Augustine or Austen, was baptized there in 1601 but buried three years later. Phillips's will, which was signed on 4 May 1605 and probated on 13 May 1605, mentions two other daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, and his wife Anne, plus brothers, sisters, and other relations of a large family. The will includes a number of interesting and revealing bequests:\n</p>\n<ul><li>a silver bowl worth \u00a35 to each of the executors, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Heminges\" title=\"John Heminges\">John Heminges</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Burbage\" title=\"Richard Burbage\">Richard Burbage</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/William_Sly\" title=\"William Sly\">William Sly</a>;</li>\n<li>a 30-shilling gold piece each to <a href=\"/wiki/Shakespeare\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shakespeare\">Shakespeare</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Condell\" title=\"Henry Condell\">Henry Condell</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Beeston\" title=\"Christopher Beeston\">Christopher Beeston</a> (Beeston is described as Phillips's \"servant;\" he was almost certainly a former apprentice);</li>\n<li>20 shillings in gold each to <a href=\"/wiki/Lawrence_Fletcher\" title=\"Lawrence Fletcher\">Lawrence Fletcher</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Armin\" title=\"Robert Armin\">Robert Armin</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Cooke\" title=\"Alexander Cooke\">Alexander Cooke</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Cowley\" title=\"Richard Cowley\">Richard Cowley</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Nicholas_Tooley\" title=\"Nicholas Tooley\">Nicholas Tooley</a>;</li>\n<li>40s. to his apprentice James Sands, along with a <a href=\"/wiki/Cittern\" title=\"Cittern\">cittern</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Bandora_(instrument)\" title=\"Bandora (instrument)\">bandora</a>, and a <a href=\"/wiki/Lute\" title=\"Lute\">lute</a>, all pending the \"expiration of his term of years in his indenture of apprenticehood;\"</li>\n<li>40s. to his \"late apprentice\" Samuel Gilburne, plus Phillips's \"mouse-colored\" velvet hose, his black taffeta suit and white taffeta doublet, his purple cloak, his sword and dagger, and his bass <a href=\"/wiki/Viol\" title=\"Viol\">viol</a>;</li>\n<li>and \u00a35 to be split among the hired men \"of the company which I am of.\"</li></ul>\n<p>The musical instruments obviously imply that Phillips was a musician, and as such he was probably involved in the dramatic music used in productions throughout his career.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Augustine_Phillips&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Edmund_Kerchever_Chambers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Edmund Kerchever Chambers\">Chambers, E.
