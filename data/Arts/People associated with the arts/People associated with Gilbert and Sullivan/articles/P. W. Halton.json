For nearly 25 years, Halton served as one of D'Oyly Carte's leading provincial musical directors.  Halton was the father of Frederick J. Halton, the author of \"The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Operas: A Concordance\" (New York, Bass, 1935).\n</p><p>In the early to mid-1870s, Halton moved to London and worked in a music store, playing the organ in a local church, and giving music lessons.  He also conducted at various music halls during this time.  In 1876, he was hired as a conductor by the Theatre Royal, in Manchester.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_years_and_premieres\">Early years and premieres</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=P._W._Halton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Early years and premieres\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In December 1879, D'Oyly Carte hired Halton in Hastings as music director for one of its touring companies, presenting <i><a href=\"/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore\" title=\"H.M.S. Pinafore\">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></i>.  In 1880 he toured with <i>Pinafore</i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Sorcerer\" title=\"The Sorcerer\">The Sorcerer</a></i>, along with shorter <a href=\"/wiki/Savoy_opera\" title=\"Savoy opera\">companion pieces</a>, and in December 1880, the company began to play <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance\" title=\"The Pirates of Penzance\">The Pirates of Penzance</a></i>.  Among the companion pieces included on this tour was Halton's own composition <i>Six and Six</i>, a one-act operetta with words by B. T. Hughes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In September 1881, Halton traveled to America to music direct <i><a href=\"/wiki/Patience_(opera)\" title=\"Patience (opera)\">Patience</a></i>, at the Standard Theatre in New York, until March 1882.  During the last month he also conducted <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Pottinger_Stephens\" title=\"Henry Pottinger Stephens\">Henry Pottinger Stephens</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Solomon\" title=\"Edward Solomon\">Edward Solomon</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Claude_Duval_(opera)\" title=\"Claude Duval (opera)\">Claude Duval</a></i>, alternating with <i>Patience</i>.  He then returned to England to music direct <i>Patience</i> on tour until December 1883.  Next, beginning in February 1884, was <i><a href=\"/wiki/Princess_Ida\" title=\"Princess Ida\">Princess Ida</a></i>.  Then, beginning in February 1885, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Trial_by_Jury\" title=\"Trial by Jury\">Trial by Jury</a></i> and <i>Sorcerer</i> were played in repertory with <i>Princess Ida</i>.\n</p><p>Back in New York, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Fifth_Avenue_Theatre\" title=\"Fifth Avenue Theatre\">Fifth Avenue Theatre</a>, Halton music directed the American premiere of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Mikado\" title=\"The Mikado\">The Mikado</a></i> from August 1885 to April 1886.  He then toured with <i>Pinafore</i> and <i>The Mikado</i>, first in England and then took in Germany and Austria, until January 1887. He then returned to New York and the Fifth Avenue Theatre, with most of the same principals, for the premiere of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ruddigore\" title=\"Ruddigore\">Ruddigore</a></i>, which ran until April.  He was back to Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and then Britain with <i>Patience</i> and <i>The Mikado</i> until December 1887.\n</p><p>In 1888, Halton toured with a repertory consisting at various times of <i>Pinafore</i>, <i>Patience</i>, <i>The Mikado</i> and <i>Pirates</i>, until October.  On November 1, 1888, he began a tour of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Yeomen_of_the_Guard\" title=\"The Yeomen of the Guard\">The Yeomen of the Guard</a></i>, which ran for over a year.  In January 1890, Halton was back in New York music directing the ill-starred premiere of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Gondoliers\" title=\"The Gondoliers\">The Gondoliers</a></i> at the Park Theatre.  The weak cast meant a disaster, and Carte and Halton assembled a new cast for a re-launch on February 18 at Palmer's Theatre, which was better received.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_years\">Later years</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=P._W._Halton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Later years\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Halton was called back to England to begin touring in March, 1890 with <i>The Gondoliers</i> until December.  After this, they added shows in repertory, including <i>The Mikado</i> in December 1890 and <i>Yeomen</i> in January 1891.  On 4 September 1891, he conducted <i>The Mikado</i> for <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Victoria\" title=\"Queen Victoria\">Queen Victoria</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Balmoral_Castle\" title=\"Balmoral Castle\">Balmoral Castle</a> &#8211; an assignment that the patriotic Irishman accepted grudgingly.  In October 1891, <i>Iolanthe</i> was added to the company's repertory, and from January to July 1892 they also included <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Nautch_Girl\" title=\"The Nautch Girl\">The Nautch Girl</a></i>.  The company continued to add more shows: <i>Patience</i> in August 1892, <i>Pirates</i> in May 1893, <i>Pinafore</i> and <i>Trial</i> in January 1894, <i>The Sorcerer</i> in April 1895, the curtain raiser <i>Cox and Box</i> in May, and <i>Princess Ida</i> in December 1895.  The repertoire was now eleven, and the tour continued through 1896.\n</p><p>In late November 1896, Halton sailed for South Africa for an ambitious tour through June 1897. It embraced all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas Halton had been conducting, except <i>Princess Ida</i>, and also included <i><a href=\"/wiki/Utopia,_Limited\" title=\"Utopia, Limited\">Utopia, Limited</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Grand_Duke\" title=\"The Grand Duke\">The Grand Duke</a></i>.  Halton toured Britain from December 1897 with most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas plus, briefly, <i>His Majesty</i>.  Over the next six-and-a-half years, with Halton as their musical director, the same touring company played all the G &amp; S operas except <i>Ruddigore</i> and <i>The Grand Duke</i> plus, in 1900, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Rose_of_Persia\" title=\"The Rose of Persia\">The Rose of Persia</a></i>.\n</p><p>Halton retired on June 18, 1904.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=P._W._Halton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/companions/six/index.html\">Information about <i>Six and Six</i></a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=P._W._Halton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Jones, Brian.  \"Patrick W.
