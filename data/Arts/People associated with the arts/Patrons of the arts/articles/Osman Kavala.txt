Osman Kavala (* 1957 in Paris) is a Turkish enterpriser and patron. Kavala visited the Robert College in Istanbul and studied Economics at the University of Manchester. 1982, after his father's death, he took over the family-owned enterprise Kavala Companies.  Since 2002, he has spent much time to work for the charitable foundation Anadolu Kültür he is presiding over. Anadolu Kültür has been operating  cultural centers in underdevelopped regions of Turkey and fosters cultural cooperation with countries of the European Union. Kavala is also known to be a sponsor of Amnesty International.  On 18. October 2017 he was arrested without hearing about reasons when he returned from Gaziantep (where he had met staff of the Goethe-Institut) to Istanbul Atatürk Airport. Some days after that, the newspaper Daily Sabah, close to the Erdogan government, alleged him being a "business tycoon with a shady background" and having contacts to the "Gülenist Terror Group" (FETÖ).  German politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit, in a public letter to Osman Kavala on 29 March 2018, wrote "I try to understand the reason behind your arrest, but I cannot apprehend it. (...) It is difficult to conceive the reason behind it. (...) I am convinced that democracy will triumph, and we will soon be able to toast to our common future by the Bosporus. I am waiting for you in Frankfurt".  Kavala's wife is professor of economics.
