The Incheon Women Artists' Biennale, held in Incheon, South Korea, and inaugurated in 2004, subsequently had editions in 2007, 2009,  and 2011 that focused on the work of contemporary women artists.  It is the first and only art biennale in the world focused on the work of female artists. The 2009 edition featured works by American feminist artists Faith Ringgold and Judy Chicago as well as 99 other artists from 25 other countries. Heng-Gil Han was the operating committee chairman and curator of the Tuning Exhibition entitled "The 21st Century, the Feminine Century, and the Century of Diversity and Hope," and the work exhibited encompassing a larger variety of media such as multimedia, performances, film, writing, discussion, and animation, and included male artists. It included artwork by Eun Mi Choi, Disband, Coco Fusco, Donna Huanca, Akiko Ichikawa, Chang-jin Lee, Hyuk Kang, Bo Sub Kim, Se Won Kim, Lee Mingwei, Xaviera Simmons, Carolee Schneemann, and Lorna Simpson.  The Participation exhibition showed the work exclusively of Korean artists, and, like the main exhibition, the work only of women. Kyung-ae Kwon was the president of the biennale organizing committee, and Eun-hee Yang the commissioner of the main exhibition.  The main exhibition for the 2011 edition, entitled "Terra Incognita," was curated by Jane Farver, former director of MIT's List Visual Arts Center. It included the art of Joan Jonas, LaToya Ruby Frazier, and Yael Bartana, and 25 other women from a total 13 countries.  The Tuning Exhibition that year was co-curated by Han, Gyoung Mo Rhee, Kyoeng Sub Yue, and two others, and the work shown focussed on social practice art by artists regardless of gender. The Participation exhibition included the work of women artists active in women's artists organizations around the world and those who specifically contributed to the advancement of the Incheon Women Artists' Biennale.
