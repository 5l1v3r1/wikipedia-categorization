The first volume, Miracle of Analogy, was published in 2015. Silverman has written extensively on a wide range of figures including artists: Jean-Luc Godard, Gerhard Richter, Marcel Proust, Ranier Maria Rilke, Terrence Malick, James Coleman, Jeff Wall, Chantal Akerman, John Dugdale (photographer), and thinkers: Jacques Lacan,  Friedrich Nietzsche,  Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Lou Andreas-Salom√©. Silverman co-wrote Speaking About Godard with the German artist and filmmaker Harun Farocki, her life partner from 1992-1999. George Baker of UCLA says of Flesh of My Flesh: "This is an extraordinary book: Silverman's magnum opus. In some respects it is sui generis, and yet its stakes are so high they could almost be called universal. In my opinion, this is the kind of book that one comes across only a few times in one's life. It is that important." .
