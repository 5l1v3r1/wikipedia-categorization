Ellen Rothenberg (1949-) is an American visual artist and writer whose socio-political art manifests itself in performance, installation, objects, and visual essays.  The content of her art addresses the politics of everyday life and how communities engage through collaborative practices. She has exhibited her work internationally at the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Brukenthal National Museum, Romania, the Neues Museum Weserburg, Bremen, Germany, among other institutions. Her writing has been published in "Immersive Life," University of Chicago Press; "Experimental Geography,‚Äù ICI NYC; Art Journal; and Woman Studies Quarterly, among other publications.    Informed by the anti-war, civic protests, and feminist movements of the 1960s, Rothenberg has brought her performances and installations into the public sphere and outside of traditional gallery and museum venues. Often concerned with labor issues  and intrusive government policies that limit individual mobility and rights, her performances since the 1980s have incorporated research to highlight the connections between historical events and contemporary issues of displacement and human rights.  Rothenberg's work is included in private, public and corporate collections, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University.   Rothenberg has received grants, fellowship and awards for her work, including three fellowships from the Illinois Arts Council, three fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Bunting Institute Fellowship from Radcliffe College, and grants from CEC Artslink, LEF Foundation, and the Propeller Fund among others.
