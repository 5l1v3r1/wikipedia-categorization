Women Artists in Revolution (WAR) was a New York City-based collective of American women artists and activists that formed in 1969. They seceded from the male-dominated Art Workers' Coalition (AWC), prompted by the Whitney Museum of American Art's 1969 Annual (later the Whitney Biennial), which included only eight women out of the 143 featured artists shown.  In 1970, WAR members sent letters to the Whitney Museum, as well as the Museum of Modern Art, demanding both museums change their policies to be more inclusive of women artists.  That same year, the Ad Hoc Women Artists' Group formed and also concentrated on the discrimination of women in the Whitney Museum's annual survey exhibitions.  These protest efforts led to an increase of women artists at the next Whitney Annual, rising from an average of 5 to 10% before 1969 to 22% in 1970.   Also in this year, WAR sponsored "X to the 12th Power", the first all-women's exhibition in New York, held at Museum, an alternative exhibition space organized by American minimalist artists Carl Andre and Robert Morris.  WAR, along with a group called Feminists in the Arts, also created the Women's Interart Center, the first alternative feminist space, where they established a graphics and silk-screen workshop taught by artist Jacqueline Skiles.  By 1972, WAR abandoned their efforts to change museum policies and focused more on consciousness-raising of the struggles of women artists.
