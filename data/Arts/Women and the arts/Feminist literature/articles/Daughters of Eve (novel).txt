Daughters of Eve is a 1979 novel by Lois Duncan.  Incorporating feminist themes, the novel follows a group of young women who become convinced to punish their fathers by a charismatic teacher.  A group of high school-aged girls in a small town in rural Michigan come under the influence of a charismatic new teacher named Irene Stark. Mrs. Stark preaches on issues regarding women's liberation, and convinces each of the girls to take revenge on their fathers for having oppressed their mothers in their lives. Due to its thematic concerns with rape, abortion, domestic violence, feminism and antifeminism, the novel was banned from libraries in several states upon its 1997 republication, namely from Jackson County School libraries in West Virginia in 1997, as well as school libraries in Virginia, Indiana, and New Mexico from 2000 to 2005.
