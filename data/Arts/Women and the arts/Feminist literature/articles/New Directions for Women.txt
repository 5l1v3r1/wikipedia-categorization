New Directions for Women was an important early feminist newspaper.  It began as a mimeographed newsletter in 1972 in New Jersey, but soon expanded into a tabloid-sized quarterly newspaper. Edited by Paula Kassell of Dover, a member of the Morristown chapter of National Organization for Women (NOW), the paper offered news reports from a feminist perspective as well as book reviews, women's history articles, and editorials, and was the first national feminist newspaper in the United States. After years of struggling to attain financial stability, the newspaper discontinued publishing in 1993.   This was five years before Pamela Wilder founded the non-profit drug rehab "New Directions for Women" in 1977 through the Junior League of Orange County. New Directions for Women is still helping women, pregnant women, and their children find recovery.  Template:US-addiction treatment for women
