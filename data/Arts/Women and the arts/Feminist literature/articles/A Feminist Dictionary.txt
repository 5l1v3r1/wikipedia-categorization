A Feminist Dictionary,   published in its second edition as Amazons, Bluestockings, and Crones: A Feminist Dictionary,  is an alternative dictionary compiled by Cheris Kramarae, Ann Russo, and Paula A. Tredichler, and first published by Pandora Press in 1985. It has over 2500 words and definitions from a feminist perspective, with the intent of â€œforcing us to consider who assembles the dictionaries usually consulted and to ask how the words have been chosen."   Described by one reviewer as "sort of a cross between the OED and the Whole Earth Catalog,"   the dictionary uses as its sources academic papers, speeches, graffiti, and quotes from famous women.
