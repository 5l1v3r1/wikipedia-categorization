WomaNews was a radical feminist newspaper that began in Gainesville, Florida in the 1970s before moving production to New York, New York.  Mainstream American newspapers addressed majority concerns and so different minority papers emerged in response to the need for a more comprehensive and multivocal approach to news. Women's sections in mainstream newspapers and women's newspapers provided a needed avenue for the dissemination of information and discussion of current concerns from and for women. The same is true for other minority newspapers, like the many African-American newspapers that covered human rights violations, oppression, and the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement, before mainstream newspapers offered regular or even-handed coverage.
