Dragon Ladies: Asian American Feminists Breathe Fire is a collection of 16 critical essays by Asian American writers, artists and activists first published in 1997.  Divided into four parts (Strategies and Visions; An Agenda for Change; Global Perspectives; and Awakening to Power), the book presents the views of a number of Asian women on feminism, often describing their frustration with the mainstream feminist movement in the United States which is seen to be dominated by white women. The collection also contains a number of interviews.   Edited by Sonia Shah, the work contains a preface by Yuri Kochiyama and a foreword by Karin Aguilar-San Juan. It sets out to "describe, expand, and nurture the growing resistance of Asian American women and girls and their allies" by bringing together the reactions of female Asian Americans.  Shah sees the work as contributing to an understanding of "a growing social movement and an emerging way of looking at the world" resulting from racism and patriarchy in American society and as well as U.S. aggression against Asia.  Dragon Ladies addresses the attitudes of Asian women on a wide variety of topics including insights on immigration, jobs, culture and the media.  The writers and activists who have contributed to the work are:
