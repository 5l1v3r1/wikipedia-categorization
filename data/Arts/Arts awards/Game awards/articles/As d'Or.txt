The As d'Or (Golden Ace) is a games award given out by a jury at the Festival International des Jeux in Cannes, France. The awards were established in 1988. From 1989 to 2003, a jury of journalists allotted "Golden Aces" by category to games presented by their editors.  A special prize, the Super As d'Or, was allotted to the best game from any category. In 2003, the process was modified to give more autonomy to the jury.  A single As d'Or was awarded, and 10 nominees were announced. In 2005, the award merged with the Jeu de l'Année.  It was decided that the combined award should be named after the year of awarding rather than year of publication, so the first combined award was the 2005 As d'Or Jeu de l'Année with awards in three categories: general public/family games, experts, and children. In 2012, the As d'Or Prix du Jury was added. L'As d'Or Jeu de l'Année combined in 2005 the L'As de'Or and the Jeu de l'Année into a single set of awards, presented in four categories.
