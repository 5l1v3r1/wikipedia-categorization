The Parents' Choice Award is an award presented by the non-profit Parents' Choice Foundation to recognize "the very best products for children of different ages and backgrounds, and of varied skill and interest levels."  It is considered a "prestigious" award among children's products,  and has been described by the Cincinnati Enquirer as the industry equivalent of an Academy Award. [not in citation given] The Parents' Choice Awards were established in 1978 by Diana Huss Green, who is currently the president of the Parents' Choice Foundation.  The award recipients are determined by a committee of educators, scientists, performing artists, librarians, parents and children. One of six award commendations are given to award winners: Classic, Gold, Silver, Recommended, Approved or "Fun Stuff."  The awards are held annually.
