The LafargeHolcim Awards is an international competition that seeks projects and visionary concepts in sustainable construction – irrespective of scale. A total of USD 2 million in prize money is awarded in each three-year cycle.   Eligible for entry are projects in: buildings and civil engineering works; landscape, urban design and infrastructure; and materials, products and construction technologies. The LafargeHolcim Awards is conducted by the LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction based in Switzerland.  Entries can only be made online.  The competition was known as the Holcim Awards from 2003. Holcim Ltd and Lafarge S.A. completed their global merger and launched LafargeHolcim, a world leader in the building materials industry, in July 2015. The name of the foundation was changed to LafargeHolcim Foundation, and the competition became the LafargeHolcim Awards.  The LafargeHolcim Awards competition opens with five regional LafargeHolcim Awards competitions and is followed by the Global LafargeHolcim Awards. The regional LafargeHolcim Awards are based on five geographic areas: Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa Middle East, and Asia Pacific. Entries in the competition are allocated to a region based on the location of the project. There are two categories within the competition:   The main category of the competition is open to architects, planners, engineers, and project owners that showcase sustainable responses to technological, environmental, socioeconomic and cultural issues affective contemporary building and construction. The fifteen projects that receive LafargeHolcim Awards Gold, Silver or Bronze in the five regions are then qualified for the competition for the Global LafargeHolcim Awards.  The “Next Generation” category is open to bold ideas and visions of students in between the age of 18 and 30. Submissions in both categories are evaluated by independent juries, using five “target issues” to define sustainable construction.  Three of these align with the triple bottom line concept of balanced social, environmental and economic performance. The two remaining target issues define contextual and aesthetic impact, as well as innovation and transferability. The independent juries consist of renowned experts from architecture, engineering, planning, and the construction industry.   The total prize money for each cycle of the regional and global LafargeHolcim Awards competitions is USD 2 million.  Source: LafargeHolcim Foundation
