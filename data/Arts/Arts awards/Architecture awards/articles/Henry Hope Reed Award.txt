Initiated in 2005, the global Henry Hope Reed Award or short Reed Award is given in conjunction with the Driehaus Architecture Prize at the University of Notre Dame, to an individual working outside the practice of architecture who has supported the cultivation of the traditional city, its architecture and art through writing, planning or promotion. The 2018 Reed Award is given to the German chair of the Society for Rebuilding Dresden's New Market (GHND),  Torsten Kulke.  The Henry Hope Reed Award winner receives a bronze medal of a bas relief cameo of Henry Hope Reed surrounded by laurel. It was custom designed by P.E. Guerin, the oldest decorative hardware firm in the United States, which produces the medal for each year's laureate.
