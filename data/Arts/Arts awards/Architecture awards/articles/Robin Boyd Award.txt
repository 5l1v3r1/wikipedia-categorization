  The Robin Boyd Award for Residential Architecture is an Australian architectural prize presented by the Australian Institute of Architects since 1981. The award is presented in memory of the Australian architect Robin Boyd (1919 - 1971) and is awarded to houses that set new benchmarks in terms of meeting the clientâ€™s needs, responding to its site and providing shelter which is at the leading edge of house design. While the award recognises private residences, their outstanding design excellence has resulted in many of these homes being widely recognised as residential icons.
