The American Architecture Awards   is a national and international awards program for new architecture, landscape architecture, interiors, and urban planning in the United States. The program was launched by the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design in 1994 to honor and celebrate the most outstanding architecture designed and built or unbuilt throughout the nation or abroad in foreign countries. The Awards Program is open to all American architecture offices and international firms with projects inside the United States from the past two years.  The American Architecture Awards are organized annually with The European Center for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies. The Awards are the Nation's highest public recognition for architectural design excellence given by a non-commercial, non-trade affiliated  public arts, culture and educational institution in the United States. "The Chicago Athenaeum believes that The American Architecture Awards serve the direct and distinct purpose of promoting Good Design and as a vehicle to further enlighten the general public's understanding and knowledge about architecture and the design arts," states Christian Narkiewicz-Laine.
