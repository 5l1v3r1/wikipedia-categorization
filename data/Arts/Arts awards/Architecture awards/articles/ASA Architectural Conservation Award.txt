The Architectural Conservation Award (Thai: รางวัลอนุรักษ์ศิลปสถาปัตยกรรมดีเด่น) is given by the Association of Siamese Architects in recognition of architectural conservation efforts by both the public and private sectors in Thailand. The awards, first given in 1982 and held annually since 2004, are presented to multiple winners in three categories, namely: buildings, people/organizations, and vernacular communities.
