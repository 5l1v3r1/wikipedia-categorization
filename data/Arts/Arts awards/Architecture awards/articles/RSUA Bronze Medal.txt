The RSUA Bronze Medal is awarded annually by the Royal Society of Ulster Architects to the student of architecture in the final year of the BA course at University of Ulster Belfast and the BSc course at Queen's University Belfast who, in the eyes of the assessors has produced the most successful major project. In the sense that it is awarded to a student on completion of a project, the medal is analogous to the RIBA President's Medals Students Award, but is not as prestigious.  Although the winner of the RSUA Bronze Medal is generally also nominated for the RIBA equivalent, no student has ever won both prizes.
