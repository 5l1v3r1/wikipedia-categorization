Grosch medal (Grosch-medaljen) is a Norwegian architecture prize awarded bi-annually. The prize was established on the 200th anniversary of the birth of Christian Heinrich Grosch, and the first medal was awarded to Sverre Fehn in 2001. The ceremony took place in the Old University Hall, Oslo, a room designed by Grosch. The organisation which awards the medal, Groschselskapet, was created in 2000. It works to create greater understanding of Grosch's work. The prize is to stimulate the quality of today's architecture.
