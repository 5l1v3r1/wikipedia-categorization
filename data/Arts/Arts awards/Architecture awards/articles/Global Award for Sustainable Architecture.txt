The Global Award for Sustainable Architecture was founded in 2006 by architect and professor Jana Revedin. The Global Award Community, which consists of the 55 contemporary architects from around the globe who have received the award, works towards a sustainable architectural ethic and fosters research, experimentation and transmission in the fields of sustainable architecture, urban renewal and academic social responsibility. It defines architecture as an agent of empowerment, self-development and civic rights. Each year the award honours five architects who share a belief in more sustainable development and who have pioneered innovative and holistic approaches in their own communities, in western and emerging countries, in developed cities and precarious districts, in megalopolises and in the countryside. The Award is partnered with Museum of Finnish Architecture, International Architecture Biennale of Ljubljana and the Università luav di Venizia. The Award for Sustainable Architecture is run by the Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine and is supported by BOUYGUES Batiment International and BNP Paribas Real Estate. Since 2011, the Award for Sustainable Architecture is under the Patronage of UNESCO. The laureats of the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture are selected by a scientific committee. The 2017 committee included Jana Revedin, Marie-Hélène Contal, Benno Albrecht, Kristiina Nivari, Spela Hudnik and honorary members, Patrice Doat and Anne Feenstra.
