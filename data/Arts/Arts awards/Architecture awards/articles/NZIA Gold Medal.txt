 The New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal is an award presented annually by the NZIA to a New Zealand architect. From 1927 until 1977 a gold, silver or bronze prize was awarded each for the design of a public building and was judged by the Royal institute of British Architects. In 1978 a "National Award" replaced the Gold Medal. The Gold Medal was reintroduced in 2001 and is awarded to an architect who, over a period of time, has made an outstanding contribution to the practice of architecture, rather than for a specific building. This contribution is demonstrated through the production of a consistently high-quality body of work.
