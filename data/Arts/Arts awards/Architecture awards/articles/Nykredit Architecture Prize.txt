The Nykredit Architecture Prize is the largest Danish architecture prize. Founded by the Nykredit Foundation (an arm of the Nykredit Group), it is awarded annually to a person, or group of people, who have personally, or through their work, made a significant contribution to the building industry in the form of architecture or planning, etc. The recipient receives DKK 500,000, making it one of the largest architecture prizes in the world in terms of prize money.  In 1991 the Nykredit Foundation began awarding the Motivational Award/Encouragement Prize to talented young architects who have made an impact on the architecture scene. 3XNCarsten HoffSusanne Ussing Arkitektgruppen Ã…rhus Inger and Johannes Exner Klaus Eggers Hansen (editor) KHR ArkitekterMogens Brandt Poulsen
