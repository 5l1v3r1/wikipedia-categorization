The Progressive Architecture Awards (P/A Awards) annually recognise risk-taking practitioners and seek to promote progress in the field of architecture. The editors of Progressive Architecture magazine hosted the first Progressive Architecture Award jury in 1954.  In 1996, the magazine folded and the venue was taken over by Architecture magazine.   In 2007, Architecture folded, and the awards were inherited by a new publication, titled ARCHITECT.
