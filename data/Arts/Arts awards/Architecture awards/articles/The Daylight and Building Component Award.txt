Upon its establishment in 1980, the Daylight and Building Component Award was given to Danish citizens who had made a significant contribution to the understanding and practical use of daylight. In the early years, this meant that many of the recipients were architects or artists, many of whom had worked with daylight in an architectural or design context.  Jørn Utzon, one of the most famous Danish Architects of the 20th century, was among the group awarded the first year.  Through the next twenty-five years, the award was given intermittently,  often to larger groups of individuals. In 2006, the award was given to the father-son team of architects  Povl Wilhelm Wohlert and Claus Ditlev Wohlert.  In 2008,   was converted to an annual award with four categories: The monetary prize   was also doubled in 2008 to 100,000 Euro, making it one of the largest of its kind within the  architecture  and   building communities worldwide.   In 2010, the award was given to American architect James Carpenter, whose recent projects include the design of 7 World Trade Center, the first building to be reconstructed at the site since Sept. 11, 2001. The award is given around the first of March each year at a ceremony in Hørsholm, Denmark. List of architecture prizes
