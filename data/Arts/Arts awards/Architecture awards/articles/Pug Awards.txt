The Pug Awards are a Toronto architecture award that rates buildings based on popular votes. Each spring the Pug Awards website lists all buildings completed the previous year in Toronto that have more than 50,000 feet of floor space. As of 2009, buildings outside the Old City of Toronto (including North York and Etobicoke) are eligible for awards.  The awards were created in 2004 by Gary Berman and Anna Simone . They were originally named the "Fugly Awards" and highlighted the ugliest buildings completed, but the name was then softened to the Puglies, and finally to the Pugs, with a Pug dog as the mascot. In 2008 the awards introduced the "Pug Cup," which will be carved each year with the winning building and displayed at City Hall.
