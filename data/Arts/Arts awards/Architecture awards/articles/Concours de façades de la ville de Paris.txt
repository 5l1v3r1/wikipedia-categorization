The concours de façades de la ville de Paris was an architecture competition organized by the city of Paris at the very end of the 19th century. The contest was held annually between 1898 and the late 1930s, with an interruption during World War I. It recognized several buildings completed during the year. The contest was set up after the creation of the rue Reaumur made in 1897. The city of Paris took inspiration from a similar contest held in Brussels (fr)  in the 1890s to promote the erection of original buildings on this street; initially restricted to the sole rue Réaumur, the contest was finally extended to the whole of Paris.
