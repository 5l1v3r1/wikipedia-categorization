The RSUA Silver Medal is awarded annually by the Royal Society of Ulster Architects to the final-year student of architecture at University of Ulster Belfast or Queen's University Belfast who, in the eyes of the assessors has produced the most successful major project. In the sense that it is awarded to a student on completion of a project, the medal is analogous to the RIBA President's Medal, but is not as prestigious. Indeed, although the winner of the RSUA Silver Medal is generally also nominated for the RIBA equivalent, no student has ever won both prizes.
