The Houens fonds diplom (literally Houens Foundation Award) is  Norway's most important award for architecture. It was established in 1893 by the  Anton Christian Houen (1823â€“94). A successful  merchant and businessman, Houen  established several  philanthropic legacies and funds in the field of culture and research.  Houens fonds diplom is awarded to buildings that are examples of "outstanding, independently completed works of architecture" in recognition of an architect's highest achievement. The award is made by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture on recommendations from the board of the Association of Norwegian Architects (Norske arkitekters landsforbund) in collaboration with the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design.
