The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC), also known since 2012 as Architecture Canada, is a Canadian association that represents over 4,800 Canadian architects, faculty, and graduates of Canadian schools of architecture. It acts as the voice for architecture and its practice in Canada and provides the national framework for the development and recognition of architectural excellence. The RAIC National Office is located in Ottawa, Ontario. RAIC was founded in 1907. It provided a country-level co-ordination among previously-existing provincial architectural groups.  Through its journal, the organization provided information to its members about building practices and design considerations in Canada.  In 1948, in anticipation of the confederation of Newfoundland with Canada. Architects there formed the Newfoundland Architects Association, which became a chapter of the RAIC.   After World War II, The RAIC made considerable efforts to develop connections and forums for collaboration between architects and members of related professions, including interior design, arts and crafts.  They also worked on developing standards of measurement in the building trades.   In 2000, a study of the organization's Journal showed that the publication had perpetuated gender-based stereotypes about the field of architecture.  In 2006, the RAIC signed on for the 2030 Â°Challenge, which urges the global architecture community to adopt targets to ensure building practices are carbon-neutral by 2030. The RAIC presents an annual festival of architecture for architects and members to network and earn continuing education credits; the 2017 festival was be held in Ottawa. The RAIC also administers a job board for members and the public. There are three classes of membership in the RAIC: Members (post-nominal letters MRAIC), fellows (FRAIC), and honorary members/fellows (Hon. MRAIC/FRAIC).
