The European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture - Mies van der Rohe Award is a Prize given biennially by the European Union and the Fundació Mies van der Rohe, Barcelona,  'to acknowledge and reward quality architectural production in Europe'. The Prize was created in 1987 as equal partnerships between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Fundació Mies van der Rohe. The award is open to all the works completed in Europe within the two-year period before the granting of the Prize. These works are submitted by independent experts, the national architecture associations and the advisory committee of the Prize and then evaluated by a Jury which is defined for each edition. The five finalist works are visited by the Jury who chooses a Prize Winner and an Emerging Architect Winner. As of 2016, a new category, the Young Talent Architecture Award (YTAA), highlights the final degree projects of recently graduated architects, landscape architects and urban designers.
