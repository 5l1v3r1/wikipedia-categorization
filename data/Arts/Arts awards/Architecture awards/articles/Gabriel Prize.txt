 The Gabriel Prize is an award given annually by the Western European Architectural Foundation, through a three-stage national competition, to one American candidate working in the field of architecture or landscape architecture. Results are announced in March of each year. Award winners spend three months in residence in France, focusing on a particular aspect of French architecture they have chosen to research. They spend much of their sabbatical traveling, sketching and measuring, and in the course of three months, produce three large renderings. The laureates work closely with the foundation's European representative, a Parisian architect who serves to assist their progress. The Prize was founded in 1991 by George Parker, Jr.  2017 - Barbara Worth Ratner   2016 - Marcela Delgado  2015 - Stephanie Arrienda Jazmines  2014 - Nicholas Quiring 2013 - Stephanie Bower 2012 - Daria Khapalova 2011 - Simon David  2010 - George J.
