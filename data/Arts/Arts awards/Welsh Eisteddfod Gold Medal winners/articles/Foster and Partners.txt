  Foster + Partners is a British international studio for architecture and integrated design, with headquarters in London. The practice is led by its founder and chairman, Norman Foster, and has constructed many high-profile glass-and-steel buildings. Established by Norman Foster as Foster Associates in 1967 shortly after leaving Team 4, the firm was renamed Sir Norman Foster and Partners Ltd in 1992 and shortened to Foster & Partners Ltd in 1999 to more accurately reflect the influence of the other lead architects.  In 2007 the private equity company 3i took a stake in the practice. This was bought back by the practice in June 2014 to become wholly owned by the 140 partners.  Major projects, by year of completion and ordered by type, are: The British Library of Political and Economic Science The futuristic interior roof of Hong Kong International Airport The Willis Faber and Dumas Headquarters in Ipswich was one of Foster's earliest commissions after founding Foster Associates. The tessellated glass roof of the British Museum's Great Court. The new Wembley Stadium in London: perhaps one of the most controversial projects  that Foster + Partners have been involved in. 30 St Mary Axe, one of London's most popular new buildings,  towers above its neighbours.
