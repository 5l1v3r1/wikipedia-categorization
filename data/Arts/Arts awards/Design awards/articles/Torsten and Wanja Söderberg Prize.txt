The Torsten and Wanja Söderberg Prize is awarded annually to "an active Nordic designer or craftsman". The prize is administered by the Röhsska Museum and is worth 1 million SEK. The money comes from the foundation established by the brothers Torsten and Ragnar Söderberg, founders of the Swedish iron and steel wholesale company Söderberg and Haak.
