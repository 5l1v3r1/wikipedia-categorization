The NCPEDP-Mphasis Universal Design Awards are given every year on the eve of Independence Day of India to honour individuals and organisations doing exemplary work towards the cause of accessibility and thus ensuring a life of equality and dignity for persons with disabilities.  In order to spread awareness on Universal Design and to popularise this concept, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), with the support of Mphasis, instituted these award in 2010.
