The Brunel Awards are given to railway companies, to encourage outstanding visual design in railway architecture, graphics, industrial design and art, technical infrastructure and environmental integration, and rolling stock. The name is assigned to them in honour of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, founder of the Great Western Railway, and designer of the giant ship SSÂ Great Eastern. The Brunel Awards were first awarded in 1985, during the celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the Great Western Railway. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom presented the inaugural awards, at a ceremony in Bristol, England. Beginning with the 2011 award ceremony, there have been five categories of award; the third category is new.
