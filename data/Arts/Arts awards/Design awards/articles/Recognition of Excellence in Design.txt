The Recognition of Excellence in Design Award (RED) was instituted in India in 2006 by the Royal Society of Design (United Kingdom) and the Architecture Plus Design (A+ D) journal of India. The RED honors designers of national repute each year through an award to the leading architect, industrial designer and interior designer of the country. This is decided by a jury of reputed professionals from the concerned design fields, and is restricted to  those under 65 years of age. The first year's winners were Architect  Christopher Charles Benninger, and Interior Designer Punkaj Patel. All are leaders in their respective professions, and their work is well published in the media and professional design journals.
