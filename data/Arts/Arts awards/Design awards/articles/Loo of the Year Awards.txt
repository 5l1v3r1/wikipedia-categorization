The Loo of the Year Awards are run by the British Toilet Association to celebrate the best public toilets in the United Kingdom, and promote high standards.  It receives sponsorship from a number of companies working in the field—Armitage Shanks, Albany Washroom Services, SCA Hygiene Products, Technical Concepts and the British Cleaning Council—along with the national tourism boards of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. First introduced in 1987, the Loo of the Year Awards competition has run annually, except for 1993. Any type of public facility (what the British Toilet Association calls an 'away from home' toilet) can be nominated for consideration. There are thirty-six different award categories in all. Eligible facilities can be located in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Anyone can submit a nomination—staff, customers, visitors, managers, owners or contractors—but owners or managers must authorize entries. After an unannounced inspection from an authorized Loo of the Year Awards Inspector, nominees are graded on a scale from one to five stars. Grades are awarded based on a number of criteria, and are judged on both male and female facilities, as well as any baby changing and accessible facilities provided. The criteria include cleanliness, decor, signage, accessibility and customer care.  Awards are given in a number of categories. A nominee receiving a five- or possibly a four-star grading will be considered for one of the following major National Awards in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: Other awards include: In addition, the overall UK winner (either an individual, in-house cleaning team or external contractor) is awarded the Cannon Hygiene UK Attendant Of The Year Trophy.  The winner of this category is presented with a Golden Loo Seat Trophy.
