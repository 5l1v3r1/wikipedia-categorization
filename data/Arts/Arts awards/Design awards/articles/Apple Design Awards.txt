The Apple Design Awards (also known as the ADA) is a special event hosted by Apple Inc. at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The event is meant to recognize the best and most innovative Macintosh and iOS software and hardware produced by independent developers, as well as the best and most creative uses of Apple's products. The ADAs, as they are commonly known, are awarded in a variety of categories which vary from year to year. The Apple Design Awards have been presented each year since 1996, though for the first two years of their existence they were known as the Human Interface Design Excellence (HIDE) Awards. Since 2003 the physical awards were designed with an Apple logo that glows when touched. The trophy is an aluminum cube, and each side is 3.9 inches (or 10 cm) long. The cube weighs 55.5 ounces (1575 grams) . These new awards were engineered and built by Sparkfactor Design.   App of the Year Awards 2016.
