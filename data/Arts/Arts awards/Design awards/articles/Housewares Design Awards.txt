The Housewares Design Awards is an annual U. S. product design award competition focused on the housewares industry. The competition was introduced in 2003 by HomeWorld Business, a leading housewares industry trade publication, to recognize design innovation as one of the major drivers for housewares industry growth.  The Housewares Design Awards attracts hundreds of product entries each year. These entries are evaluated by an independent panel of judges made up of renowned designers and retailer buyers, a process managed by the Housewares Design Awards LLC. Products are evaluated along multiple dimensions. Criteria include unique appearance, functionality, positioning, innovative technology or materials, safety, environmental benefits, emotional appeal, social impact and the ability to meet consumer needs. Twelve “Best in Category” Awards and three “Best of the Best” awards are presented at the gold, silver and bronze levels. The “Green House Design Awards,” which honor eco-friendly housewares products, are also given each year.
