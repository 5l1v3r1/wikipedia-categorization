The Prince Philip Designers Prize is an annual design recognition given by the Chartered Society of Designers awarded by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It is the longest running design award in the United Kingdom, having been started in 1959 as the Prize for Elegant Design.    The recognition is on the basis of a design career which has upheld the highest standards and broken new ground.  In 2011 The Duke of Edinburgh stepped down from the prize as he reduced his royal responsibilities in his 90th year. It was agreed in December 2015 that the Chartered Society of Designers should re-introduce and manage it as a global prize after the Design Council had ceased in 2011 after managing it for 52 years.  Many CSD members have received the award over the years including Sir Kenneth Grange CBE PPCSD RDI, David Gentleman and latterly Sir Quentin Blake CBE, FCSD, FRSL, RDI who was awarded the final prize in 2011. Prince Philip suggested and agreed various changes to the Prize that build on its heritage in order to reflect todayâ€™s design profession including opening the Prize to international nominations.
