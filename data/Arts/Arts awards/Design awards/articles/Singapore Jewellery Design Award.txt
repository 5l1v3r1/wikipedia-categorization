The Singapore Jewellery Design Award is a competition among art school students, initiated by the Singapore Jewellery association (SJA). The SJDA provides an opportunity for the winning designs to be manufactured into jewellery pieces to be marketed and sold. The contest is divided into three major categories. After a preliminary round, the top 30 designs proceed to the final round and compete for the winning position. Winning designs are showcased at the Singapore International Jewellery show.
