The European Design Awards, also known as the ED-Awards, are annual awards presented to European designers for outstanding work in the communication design field. The ED-Awards is a joint initiative of design magazines from across Europe and endorsed by  the International Council of Design. The ED-Awards are judged by a panel of representatives (journalists and design critics) from fifteen European design magazines, while the winning submissions are featured in the ED-Awards Catalogue. The ED-Awards is different than other design awards schemes in the way that the jury comprises not of peers (designers), but of design journalists and critics â€“ people who see and judge work for a living.  Further more, since the ED-Awards organisation is made up of design magazines, it provides an opportunity for everyone submitting work, to have it featured in a number of these media. A lot of stories and articles are being created through the submitted work every year.  The jury consists of fifteen representatives from high-profile European design magazines.  There are 35 award categories, in seven groups,  covering branding, packaging, exhibition design, typography, digital design, illustration and self-promotion, among others. There are also three special distinctions: Agency of the year, Best of show and Jury prize. The top accolade in the ED-Awards is every time, the distinction bestowed upon the most (creatively) successful studio of the continent.
