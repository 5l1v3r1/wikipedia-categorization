The Phillips Gold Medal is to the person who, in the opinion of the judges, has contributed the most to British postage stamp design in recent years. The award was established by the distinguished British philatelist Reginald M. Phillips. The medal is three inches wide and made of 22 carat gold. It is retained by the winner.  Originally awarded every five years, the medal now appears to be awarded on an irregular basis.
