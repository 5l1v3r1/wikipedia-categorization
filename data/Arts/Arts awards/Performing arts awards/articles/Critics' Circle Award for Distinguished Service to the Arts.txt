Each year since 1988 The Critics' Circle has presented an award for Distinguished Service to the Arts, voted for by all members of the Circle, embracing Dance, Drama, Film, Music, Visual Arts and Architecture. This performing arts Award takes the form of an engraved crystal rose bowl, presented at a celebratory luncheon.  Notes: The Critics' Circle, the U.K.â€™s only professional association of critics of drama, music, film, dance and visual arts, is celebrating its centenary in 2013 by awarding Services to the Arts honors for the first time in its history to five key cultural figures who have made a significant impact on the arts, as voted for by members of the five individual sections represented within the circle. Traditionally, the Critics' Circle has made a single award annually since 1988 with theatre director Sir Peter Hall being the first recipient.
