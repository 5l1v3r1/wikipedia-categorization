Elliott Hershel Lieb  (born July 31, 1932) is an American mathematical physicist and professor of mathematics and physics at Princeton University who specializes in statistical mechanics, condensed matter theory, and functional analysis. In particular, his scientific works pertain to: the quantum and classical many-body problem, the stability of matter, atomic structure, the theory of magnetism, and the Hubbard model. He is a prolific author in mathematics and physics with over 300 publications. He received his B.S. in physics from MIT (1953) and his Ph.D. in mathematical physics from the University of Birmingham in England (1956). Lieb was a (1956–1957) Fulbright Fellow at Kyoto University, Japan and for some time worked as the Staff Theoretical Physicist for IBM. He has been a professor at Princeton since 1975, following a leave from his professorship at MIT. Lieb has been awarded several prizes in mathematics and physics, including the 1978 Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics (1978), the Max Planck Medal of the German Physical Society (1992), the Boltzmann medal of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (1998), the Schock Prize (2001), and the Henri Poincaré Prize of the International Association of Mathematical Physics (2003). He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and has twice served (1982–1984 and 1997–1999) as the President of the International Association of Mathematical Physics. Lieb was awarded the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art in 2002.  In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society  and in 2013 a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.  He is married to fellow Princeton professor Christiane Fellbaum.
