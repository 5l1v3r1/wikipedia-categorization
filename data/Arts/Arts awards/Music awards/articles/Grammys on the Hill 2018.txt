The Recording Academy's 2018, Grammys on the Hill Awards was broadcast live on April 18, 2018, in celebration of the past 20 years of strong advocacy for all aspects of recorded music   from the famed Hamilton, in Washington, D.C. Little Big Town was honored for their own 20 years of performing professionally as an award winning music ensemble.    The annual celebration is billed as an event that "recognizes both musical artists and legislators who have worked to improve the share of royalties and other moneys that music generates in the age of digital downloads". One week later the GRAMMYs on the Hill was credited as a driving force in the passage of the Music Modernization Act, H.R. 5447.
