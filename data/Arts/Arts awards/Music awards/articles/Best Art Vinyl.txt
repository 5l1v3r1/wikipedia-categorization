Best Art Vinyl is an annual award that first began in 2005. It celebrates artists and designers of vinyl record cover art.  The nomination process begins in November and the winners are announced in January,  and are exhibited at venues across the United Kingdom and Europe.  The favourites are voted for by the public from a selection of nominations by judges within the world of art and music and are displayed using Art Vinyl's unique Play & Display Flip Frame.
