The Carnegie Prize is an international prize for artists, awarded by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  It comprises a $10,000 prize and the Medal of Honor, designed by Tiffany & Co. and cast by J.E. Caldwell & Co. The award was originally established in 1896 and after undergoing several transformations was reorganised in 1985 to award the prize in the context of a nominee's lifetime work.  It is presented as part of an exhibition of contemporary art, which since 1982 has been called the Carnegie International and held every 3 years. The prize should not be confused with the Carnegie Medal, which is awarded for children's literature or the Carnegie Prize awarded for art by the National Academy of Design in New York.
