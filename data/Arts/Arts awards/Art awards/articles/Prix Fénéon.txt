The Fénéon Prize (Prix Fénéon), established in 1949, is awarded annually to a French-language writer and a visual artist. The prize was established by Fanny Fénéon, the widow of French art critic Félix Fénéon. She bequeathed the proceeds from the sale of his art collection to the University of Paris, whose Vice Chancellor chairs the award jury.
