The prix Abd-el-Tif, or Abd-el-Tif prize 1907–1961, was a prize and bursary award for painter artists modelled on the Prix de Rome, and later Prix d'Indochine (1920–1938). Decreed on contest, it was created in 1907 under the impulse of Léonce Bénédite, curator of the Museum of Luxembourg and Claude Jonnart, general governor of Algeria, in order to make it possible to young talented artists to remain one year or two, sometimes more, with the expenses of the State in the Villa Abd-el-Tif in Algiers. The villa Abd-el-Tif was a villa established on the basis of the Villa Médicis in Rome, and later the Casa de Velázquez at Madrid, to provide a location for French artists to study Islamic art. The Company of the French Orientalist Painters was in charge of the attribution of this award.  This villa, contrary to the Villa Medici of Rome, had no director:  it was directly managed  by the residing artists . This institution contributed to the artistic radiation of Algeria.
