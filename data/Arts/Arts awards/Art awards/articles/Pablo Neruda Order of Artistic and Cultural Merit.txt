The Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit (Spanish: Orden al Mérito Artístico y Cultural Pablo Neruda) was created in 2004 by the National Council of Culture and the Arts of the government of Chile, as part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (12 July 1904).  It is granted by the Minister of Culture to those national and international figures who have stood out for contributions made in the field of art and culture. The Pablo Neruda Order of Merit was delivered for the first time on 5 July 2004 to the mayor of Barcelona, Joan Clos, and about 15 Ibero-American artists – among them, Miguel Bosé, Joan Manuel Serrat, Víctor Manuel, Ana Belén, Jorge Drexler, Julieta Venegas, and Antonio Ríos (es) – who participated in the Neruda en el corazón (es) musical tribute that took place at the Palau Sant Jordi, Barcelona.  Many national and international personalities have received this decoration since it was created.
