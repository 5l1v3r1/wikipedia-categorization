The Musgrave Medal is an annual awarded by the Institute of Jamaica in recognition of achievement in art, science, and literature.  Originally conceived in 1889 and named in memory of Sir Anthony Musgrave, the founder of the Institute and the former Governor of Jamaica who had died the previous year, the medal was the first to be awarded in the Western Hemisphere. The medals were initially awarded as prizes in a cultural competition. In 1941 the Gold Medal was initiated and awarded in recognition of a "distinguished eminence". The first recipient of the gold medal was artist Edna Manley in recognition of her work promoting art and literature. A Silver Medal, recognizing "outstanding merit", and Bronze Medal, for merit, are also awarded.   The medal was designed by British sculptor Alfred Toft. The first medal was awarded in 1897, as part of Jamaica's celebrations of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Until 1906 they were only given prizes in art and craft competitions organised by the Institute.  In 2011, eight Musgrave Medals were awarded, with a gold medal for Hedley Jones, designer and builder of Jamaica's first solid body electric guitar in 1940, and builder of audio equipment including some of Jamaica's early sound systems and much of the equipment in Studio One.
