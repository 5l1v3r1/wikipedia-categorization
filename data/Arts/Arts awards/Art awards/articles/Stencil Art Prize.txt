The Stencil Art Prize began in 2009  and aims to recognise and reward artists. The prize was formerly known as the Australian Stencil Art Prize until 2013  when it expanded to include international stencil artists and became known as the Stencil Art Prize. An exhibition of finalists and the winning artwork are held in Sydney each year, with the winning stencil artwork acquired by the Stencil Art Prize. Entrants must submit an image of a completed stencil painting to be eligible to enter. The winner receives a cash prize. Previous winners:
