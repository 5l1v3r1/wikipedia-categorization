The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers, known for short by the initials for the last part of its name, STM, is an international trade association organised and run for the benefit of scholarly, scientific, technical, medical and professional publishers. It was conceived as the STM Group at the Frankfurt Book Fair of 1969 following discussions at the 1968 meeting of the International Publishers Association. It obtained its current name and was registered in Amsterdam as a not for profit "stichting"[clarification needed] in 1994. The association currently has two offices, located in the Hague and in Oxford. As of 2015 it had over 100 members  who publish over 60% of the annually published journals literature and tens of thousands of monographs and references works. Since 2006 its Chief Executive Officer has been Michael Mabe.
