The National Campaign for the Arts (NCA) is a United Kingdom lobbying group campaigning for all the arts. Their website states "We campaign for more public investment in the arts because we believe that the arts are for everyone and make everyoneâ€™s lives better." The current Chair is the actor and director Samuel West. Other Board members include the visual artist Bob and Roberta Smith, the writer and broadcaster A. L. Kennedy and Artistic Director of the Holland Festival, Ruth Mackenzie CBE.  The NCA publish the Arts Index, a bi-annual "health check for the arts". 50p for Culture is a campaign which ranks Local Authorities by the amount of their investment in culture and encourages constituents to write to them in support or encouragement. Hearts for the Arts is an annual award that recognises excellence in Local Authority support for the arts. The NCA came into being in 1985 through the merger of the National Lobby for the Arts (NLA) and British Arts Voice (BRAVO). It was established as a membership organization, receiving no government funding. The NCA was initially funded by six organizations which represent professional artists: the Association of British Orchestras; British Actors' Equity Association; the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU); the Musicians' Union; the Society of West End Theatres and the Theatrical Management Association.  NCA is a charity and a company limited by guarantee, established to campaign with and on behalf of the public and the arts sector for more public funding and investment.
