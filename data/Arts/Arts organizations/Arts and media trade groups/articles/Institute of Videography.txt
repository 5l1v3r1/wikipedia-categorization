The Institute of Videography (IOV) is a UK-registered, not-for-profit trade association for professional videographers.  Its membership predominantly operates in the corporate video, wedding videography and special interest video (documentary) markets - but extends into every area of media production.  The IOV recognised the need to provide an association of like-minded professionals within the, then, developing videography market. The IOV and its list of membership benefits soon expanded, and the organisation adopted its present incorporated form and constitution in June 1991. Today, the IOV is owned by its members and managed by a board of elected Executive Members.
