The Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA) is a not-for-profit membership organization serving the independent publishing community through advocacy and education. With nearly 3,000 members, IBPA is the largest publishing trade association in the United States.  IBPA programs and publications include the Benjamin Franklin Awards,  Publishing University,   and the monthly Independent Magazine. IBPA was founded in 1983  as the Publishers Association of Southern California (PASCAL).  It later became the Publishers Marketing Association (PMA).  It adopted its present name in 2008.  The Benjamin Franklin Awards honor independent publishers and self-published authors for excellence in book editorial and design.  Prizes are given in a number of categories.  IBPA members, as well as librarians, reviewers, editors and bookstore owners choose the winners and provide feedback to the authors about their books.   IBPA's Publishing University is a two-day networking and educational event. Hosted annually, the program includes learning labs and a book-award ceremony.
