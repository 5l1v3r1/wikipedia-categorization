The Motion Picture Association (MPA) is the international counterpart of the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPA is an offshoot of the Motion Picture Association of America, which was started in 1922 as a trade organization for the American film industry. Its task was to curb criticism of American films of the era, and give a more favourable image of the film industry.  Following World War II, in 1945 its counterpart the Motion Picture Export Association of America was formed to restore the American film market, and fight the trade barriers and restrictions imposed on American films.  In 1994 its name was changed from the Motion Picture Export Association of America to the Motion Picture Association to more accurately reflect the global nature of audiovisual entertainment in today's international marketplace.  The Motion Picture Association and the Motion Picture Association International represent the interests of the six international producers and distributors of filmed entertainment. To do so, they promote and protect the intellectual property rights of these companies and conduct public awareness programs to highlight to movie fans around the world the importance of content protection. The organizations act on behalf of the members of the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPA and the MPA-I have worldwide operations which are directed from their head offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and overseen in the Asia Pacific by a team based in Singapore.  The MPA strives to protect the creative rights of the large corporate film makers. Its counterpart has come up with infamous slogans such as "Who Makes Movies?" and "You can click, but you can't hide."  Around the world the MPA helps with local law enforcement to combat "piracy".
