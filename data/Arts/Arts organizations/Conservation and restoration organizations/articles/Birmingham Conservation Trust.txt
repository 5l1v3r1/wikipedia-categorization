Birmingham Conservation Trust is a charity which saves and restores historic buildings in the city of Birmingham, England. In 2004 it completed the conservation and restoration of the last surviving court of Back to Back houses on Hurst Street in the city. These are now run by the National Trust. Birmingham Conservation Trust moved on to a short term project managing the protection of Perrott's Folly â€” a tower in the city which has close associations with J. R. R. Tolkien. Work has been taking place to ensure the tower does not collapse. Another project is Newman Brothers, a family-run factory in Birmingham's unique Jewellery Quarter.  The firm made some of the world's finest coffin furniture, including the fittings for the funerals of Winston Churchill, Joseph Chamberlain and Diana, Princess of Wales. The very last sets of cast brass gothic handles from this factory were used on the coffins of Cardinal Basil Hume and of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.
