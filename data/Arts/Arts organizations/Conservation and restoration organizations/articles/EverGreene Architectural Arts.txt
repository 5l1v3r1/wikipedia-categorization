The company operates as both an art studio and a contractor combining art, science and technology as designers and craftsmen work side-by-side. In 1976, with the advent of the Historic Preservation tax Incentives, interest in historic preservation grew in the United States. EverGreene, originally started as a firm that almost exclusively focused on decorative painting and murals, expanded in size and service offerings to assist clients and owners of historic structures including: courthouses, state capitols, churches, synagogues, theaters and commercial buildings. To execute large scale projects, EverGreene will often partner with architecture firms during the design and planning phases and with general contractors as a specialty contractor.
