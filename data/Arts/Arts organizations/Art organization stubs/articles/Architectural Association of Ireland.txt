The Architectural Association of Ireland is an organisation dedicated to architecture. It is not a professional accredited organisation but is open to all. In support of the profession, its activities and programs include a public lecture series, annual national architectural awards (since 1985), site visits, exhibitions, and publications. The Association produces a journal entitled "Building Material", as well as a book in the "New Irish Architecture" series based on its annual awards. The AAI was founded in 1896 "to promote and afford facilities for the study of architecture and the allied sciences and arts and to provide a medium of friendly communication between members and others interested in the progress of architecture." Membership in the AAI is open to architects, architecture students, and anyone interested in architecture.
