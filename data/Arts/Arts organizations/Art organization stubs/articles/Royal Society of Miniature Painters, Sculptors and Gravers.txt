  The aims of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers  are to esteem, protect and practice the traditional 16th Century art of miniature painting emphasising the infinite patience needed for its fine techniques. Its patron is Charles, Prince of Wales. The Society of Miniature Painters was founded in May 1896 by Alyn Williams, (1865-25th July, 1941), in which year it had its inaugural exhibition in the Modern Gallery, 175 New Bond Street, London, and is devoted exclusively to contemporary miniature paintings.  King Edward VII granted the society a Royal Charter on 30 May 1904, and it became the Royal Miniature Society or RMS. To highlight the Society's growing importance the President's Jewel was commissioned in 1920. This is a large, elaborate silver chain of office designed and made by Alfred Lyndhurst Pocock, (1881-1962), which is still worn by the current president at formal functions. In 1926 the Society's scope was extended to include sculptors and gravers and its name was changed by the Royal Command of King George V. The Society's Gold Memorial Bowl Award was established in 1985 and is one of the highest accolades for miniature art in the world. Since its foundation the Society has had eight different Presidents (Alyn Williams was president twice, 1896-1898, 1908-1941), including Sir William Blake Richmond (1842-1921) and Raymond Lister (1919-2001). The RMS's annual exhibition of around 650 works is held each October at the Mall Galleries in London. When the Society was founded the maximum size for a miniature was 12 by 10 inches - today the permitted size, including the frame, is 6 by 4.5 inches (15 x 11.5cm). Elizabeth R Meek, MBE, who held the post of president between 2004-2013 and is now the Society's Honorary President, describes working in miniature as the most demanding of all painting genre. She names some of the qualities required as: "Concentration, stillness of mind and body and a dogged perseverance for perfection - the perfect miniature needs to be devoid of errors." The Society's 122st Annual Exhibition will be held between 28 November and 9 December 2018 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London, SW1. There will be around 600 works on view, and while the traditional subject matter of portraiture continues unabated, there will be a very broad range of subject matter, including landscapes, still lifes and wildlife.                         4.
