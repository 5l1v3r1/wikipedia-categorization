  An Lanntair (Scottish Gaelic: [əˈl̪ˠãũn̪ˠt̪ɛɾʲ]) is an arts centre in the town of Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The centre is home to a cinema, and art gallery. Previously located in the Town Hall, in September 2005 An Lanntair moved to its current new building overlooking the harbour. This building features a 50-seater restaurant, art gallery, shop, and auditorium seating over two hundred. The auditorium houses the first cinema in Stornoway since 1995. An Lanntair is the principal venue for arts and entertainment events in Stornoway and regularly hosts performances by musicians as well as plays, talks, and films. It is a key venue for the annual Hebridean Celtic Festival, and has hosted events for the Royal National Mòd in 2005 and 2011. Its name is Gaelic for the lantern.
