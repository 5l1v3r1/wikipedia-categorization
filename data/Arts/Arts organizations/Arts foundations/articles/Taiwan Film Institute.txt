Plans for a national film archive were first proposed in 1967 by the Cultural Bureau of the Ministry of Education. Two years later, drafting of the Film Archive Establishment Act began. However, the Cultural Bureau was shut down in 1973, and the film archive project was placed on hold. Oversight of Taiwanese cinema was delegated to the Government Information Office (GIO). The Motion Picture Development Foundation, which had been established in 1975 with help from the GIO and the Taipei Film Business Association, announced in 1978 that a film library would be funded via the GIO. The Film Library of the Motion Picture Development Foundation opened on 19 January 1979. The film library later became responsible for hosting the Golden Horse Awards ceremony. It was renamed the National Film Archive in 1989, shortly before its founding director Hsu Li-kong left his post. Hsu's successor Ray Jing ended the archive's involvement with the Golden Horse Awards. Additionally, the name change brought with it a new mission. Jing began compiling old Taiwanese Hokkien films and other artifacts of the Taiwanese film industry, choosing to set aside the cultural education of the public. In 1991, the National Film Archive split from the Motion Picture Development Foundation, and was placed under the purview of the National Film Archive Foundation shortly thereafter. The foundation itself answered to the Department of Motion Picture Affairs, a division of the Government Information Office. The National Film Archive sought membership in the International Federation of Film Archives in 1992. Membership was granted in 1995, after the archive became the Chinese Taipei Film Archive.  On 28 July 2014, the Ministry of Culture replaced it with the Taiwan Film Institute.  The TFI was launched in a ceremony attended by culture minister Lung Ying-tai and New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu.  On 26 December 2016, the institute launched an online box office, an attempt to increase the transparency of the Taiwanese film industry.  In July 2017, it launched its film restoration laboratory.  The film institute also holds film preservation with other institute outside Taiwan.  It regularly holds movie screenings and exhibitions on films, as well as film compilation.       It also invites renowned move experts to teach at the institute.  The institute has also been promoting movies to elementary and secondary schools in Taiwan.  The organization is accessible within walking distance south of Shandao Temple Station of Taipei Metro.
