The Victor Pinchuk Foundation is a self-proclaimed 'independent philanthropic' organisation based in Ukraine which claims to 'support projects to modernise Ukraine and foster a new generation of leaders'. Its mission is to empower future generations to become the change makers of tomorrow. The foundation is active in the fields of health, education, culture, international affairs, human rights and local communities. It was founded by Ukrainian oligarch, Ukraine's second-richest man, businessman and self-proclaimed 'philanthropist' Victor Pinchuk in 2006.   The foundation's projects include "Cradles of Hope" (a network of neonatal centers in Ukraine), the "PinchukArtCentre" (the largest contemporary art centre in Eastern Europe), the largest private scholarship program in Ukraine "Zavtra.UA", the scholarship program for Ukrainian students studying abroad "WorldWideStudies", and the annual "Ukrainian Lunch" and "Philanthropic Roundtable" on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos.  The foundation supports and works with a variety of partners, including the network "Yalta European Strategy" created to promote Ukraine's European integration, the Clinton Global Initiative, the Kyiv School of Economics, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Israeli Presidential Conference "Facing Tomorrow", and the legal clinics/legal aid projects of the Renaissance Foundation.
