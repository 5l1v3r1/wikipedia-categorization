Modigliani Art Center (Centro d'Arte Modigliani) is an art center founded in 1979 based in Scandicci, a suburb of Florence, Italy in Tuscany. The cultural center develops visual arts and literature via shows and conferences about renowned artists, poets and writers. It also develops artists, poets and writers whose work is less well known or debuting publicly.   The center is named in honor of Amedeo Modigliani, an Italian modernist painter who lived and worked mostly in France. The membership is approximately 100 poets, painters and authors as well as cultural advocates and sympathizers. Most of the membership is residents of Florence, Scandicci and other Tuscan towns, with some from other Italian regions and some foreign international members. Some of the artists contribute to events and hold elections to nominate honorary members of various fields based on their talent and cultural  development of our activities. Modigliani Art Center conducts artistic and cultural activities. It sometimes program events with outside collaboration that involves the works by artists, poets and writers who are not also members of the art association.
