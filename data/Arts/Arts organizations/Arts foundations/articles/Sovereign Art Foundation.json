The Foundation was established in Hong Kong in 2004 and is well known for running seven successful art prizes in Asia and four in Europe.\n</p><p>Entry for the African prize is by expert nomination only and a world class panel of judges will select the best 20 entries as finalists. The 20 finalists will be exhibited at the Johannesburg Art Fair from 22\u201325 September and will then be sold with proceeds being evenly split between the finalists and charity.\n</p><p>The aims of the African art prize are to (i) raise public awareness of African art; (ii) provide much needed exposure, recognition and opportunity to African artists; and (iii) raise significant funding for charities in Africa.\n</p><p>The Sovereign Art Foundation has been very successful in discovering mid career artists who have quickly gone on to achieve record prices at auction so the opportunity to purchase these works presents a compelling case for investment whilst assisting a worthy charitable cause.\n</p><p>The prize will follow the same format as its Asian and European counterparts. Entry is by nomination only. The Sovereign Art Foundation will assemble a large panel of art experts from all over Africa who will be asked to nominate the best African artists and encourage them to submit images of their work for evaluation. Next a panel of renowned judges will select the best 20 works and these will be exhibited at the Johannesburg Art Fair.\n</p><p>During the exhibition the judging panel will evaluate the 20 finalists and decide the winner who will receive a cash prize of US$25,000.\n</p><p>There will also be a public vote prize. The public will be invited to choose their favourite piece by either voting at the exhibition or voting online through the website gallery. The artist who receives the most public votes will receive a prize of US$1,000.\n</p><p>The gala dinner will take place after the exhibition at a venue to be decided. The winning artists will be presented with their prizes at the dinner. The winning piece will become the property of the Foundation and will be loaned to patrons, sponsors, museums etc. and the remaining 19 finalists, including the public vote prize winner, will be auctioned with the proceeds being split evenly between the artist and The Foundation. All funds raised by during the evening will be applied without deduction to assist charities that help disadvantaged children using the arts as rehabilitation or therapy.

Entry is by nomination only. All entries are then judged by a renowned judging panel that has a strong authority in contemporary Asian art. This is the first part of a two part judging process where the 30 strongest pieces will be the art prize finalists. The finalists are usually exhibited in a prominent public place in Hong Kong. In 2010, the finalist exhibition was for the first time toured in Singapore and in Hong Kong. In 2011, the finalist exhibition will be toured in Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore and then finally in Hong Kong. (see: The Sovereign Asian Art Prize).  The second part of the judging process will take place live, at the exhibition in Hong Kong where the art prize winner will be announced. The 29 remaining pieces will then be auctioned off by Sotheby\u2019s at a charity dinner where 50% of the proceeds of each sale will go to the artist and the other 50% will go to the foundation. All proceeds made on the evening by the foundation will go directly towards its charitable aims (see above).\n</p><p>Additionally, the award also includes the \"Schoeni Prize\" which is named in memory of Manfred Schoeni who died in 2004.
