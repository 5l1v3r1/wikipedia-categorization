  FACT (Foundation for Art & Creative Technology) is a new media arts centre based on Wood Street in Liverpool, England. FACT hosts art projects and exhibitions as well as being a cinema.  After funding cuts in 2014 FACT laid off one quarter of its staff, replacing them with volunteers.  FACT was Liverpool's first purpose-built arts centre for more than 60 years. It was opened in February 2003 by its founding executive director Eddie Berg, having cost £10 million to build. The building is linked to Bold Street, one of Liverpool's main shopping areas, by a public square off Wood Street and Colquitt Street. After funding cuts in 2014 FACT laid off one quarter of its staff, replacing them with volunteers.  The cinema hosted a Question and Answer session with Quentin Tarantino in 2007 for the UK release of Death Proof.  In 2015 FACT hosted an art event in which Shia LaBeouf answered phone calls from the public.  On March 22, 2017, FACT became the location of LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner's He Will Not Divide Us project.  Designed by architectural firm Austin-Smith:Lord, the building is situated on Wood Street in the Ropewalks area of the city centre.  It contains three gallery spaces, four cinema screens and a multimedia suite and also comprises a cafe, a bar and a lounge area.
