 Arpa Foundation for Film, Music and Art (AFFMA) is a Los Angeles based non-profit organization, formed in 1995 for the purpose of promoting the arts and enhancing the cultural environment of our community by supporting artists who bridge the cultural divide, unifying diverse people and cultures through the arts.  Over the years, AFFMA has been supporting a spectrum of artists, including filmmakers, writers, photographers, dancers, designers, actors and musicians, through its signature annual event Arpa International Film Festival held in Hollywood, California since 1997.  Arpa Film Festival is one of the oldest independent film festivals in Hollywood providing a safe ground for international filmmakers with unique independent artistic vision.  AFFMA is expanding cultural diversity and social understanding by organizing networking events, concerts, art exhibits, book signings, fashion shows, and music performances as well.
