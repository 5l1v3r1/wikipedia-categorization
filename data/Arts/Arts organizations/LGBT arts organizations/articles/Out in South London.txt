  Out In South London is a weekly arts and culture LGBT radio show broadcast on Resonance 104.4FM every Tuesday at 6.30pm. The show was devised and is presented by comedian Rosie Wilby.  Out in South London was started by stand up comedian and musician, Rosie Wilby, as a monthly show on South City Radio in Peckham in December 2008. Rosie was inspired by shows like Out This Week on Radio 5 Live in the 1990s, where she once worked as a trainee reporter. The show transferred to Resonance 104.4FM in late 2009 as a weekly half hour show. The show was guest presented for two weeks in May 2012 by journalist and author Paul Burston who also appeared in the 2011 Christmas special. It is featured as an iTunes podcast under the category 'philosophy'. In 2013, the show went to a weekly full hour format, going out live each Tuesday between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. In March 2013 Out in South London was a 'community partner' of the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.  Elisabeth Mahoney in the Guardian described the show as "ambitiously wide-ranging" "a likeable listen" and "..a bright, strong show"
