 The Friends of Dorothy Society (commonly abbreviated "fods") is a bell ringing society for LGBT people and their friends. The society is based in the United Kingdom but has members throughout the world; particularly in the United States of America and Australia. The Society takes its name from the euphemism Friend of Dorothy, meaning gay man. The society started following a notice placed in The Ringing World (a weekly publication for bell ringers) in May 1991. The notice aimed to assemble a band to ring for the London Pride Festival that year. A number of people responded to the notice and the bells of St. Martin in the Fields, Trafalgar Square were rung for that year’s parade. The society holds a spring tour and an autumn tour each year. The first tour was to Bristol in October 1991. Since then, members of the society have toured many cities throughout the United Kingdom. The first international tour was held in May 2006 when members visited Washington DC.  The society’s membership is ever-increasing. Peals are rung several times each year. There are annual spring and autumn tours and the society rings for London Pride and Brighton Pride. Category:LGBT culture
