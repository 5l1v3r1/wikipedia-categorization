The Community Museum Laboratory (CML) was a student-run experimental art space in Indianapolis, Indiana dedicated to exploring connections between art and community that was open from 2006-2009.  It was a project of the Herron School of Art and Design  initiated by Eric Nordgulen who negotiated the free use of an empty building in the arts district Fountain Square with Sandor Development, a local real estate company.  They hosted participatory exhibitions that engaged the public through experiments in reciprocity, exchange in dialogue and were influenced by (while skeptical of) the tradition of Relational Aesthetics.
