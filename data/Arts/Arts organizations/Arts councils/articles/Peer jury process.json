{"parse":{"title":"Peer jury process","pageid":11602228,"revid":671180855,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>peer jury process</b> is often used in the arts to assess applications for grants, proposals for exhibitions made in response to an open call for submissions and art competitions. Like the practice of <a href=\"/wiki/Peer_review\" title=\"Peer review\">peer review</a> used in the academic sphere, a peer jury brings to an evaluation process expertise that an organization or agency awarding grants or sponsoring a competition might not itself have. \n</p><p>A peer jury in the arts context is generally composed of artists selected to be representative of those working in a relevant discipline or area. While jurors are expected to have <a href=\"/wiki/Independence\" title=\"Independence\">independence</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Anonymity\" title=\"Anonymity\">anonymity</a> is less of a concern than in academic <a href=\"/wiki/Peer_review\" title=\"Peer review\">peer review</a>, in part because the jury's task is not to catch errors or offer criticism but to only to select. For example, in Canada, agencies that award grants typically publish lists of jurors or make lists available on request. \n</p><p>In principle the peer jury process is an effective way for arts councils and other agencies to be responsive to and engaged with the constituencies they serve, and in touch with the latest developments in contemporary art. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Peer_jury_process&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Peer_review\" title=\"Peer review\">peer review</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2178\nCached time: 20180919232139\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:11602228-0!canonical and timestamp 20180919232139 and revision id 671180855\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Arts_councils"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Anonymity"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Independence"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Peer review"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Peer_jury_process","byteoffset":1120,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Peer jury process","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7160403"}]}}
