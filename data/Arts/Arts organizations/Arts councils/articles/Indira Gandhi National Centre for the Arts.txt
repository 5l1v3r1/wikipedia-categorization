  Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi (IGNCA) is a premier government-funded arts organization in India. It is an autonomous institution under the Union Ministry of Culture. It was established in the memory of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, with Kapila Vatsyayan as its founding director.  The IGNCA was launched on 19 November 1985 by Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi at a function where the symbolism of the components was clearly articulated at different levels. The elements - fire, water, earth, sky and vegetation - were brought together. Five rocks from five major rivers - Sindhu (Indus), Ganga, Kaveri, Mahanadi and the Narmada (where the most ancient ammonite fossils are found) were composed into sculptural forms. These remain at the site as reminders of the antiquity of Indian culture and the sacredness of her rivers and rocks. The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts Trust was constituted and registered at New Delhi on 24 March 1987. The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, established in memory of Indira Gandhi, is visualised as a centre encompassing the study and experience of all the artsâ€”each form with its own integrity, yet within a dimension of mutual interdependence, interrelated with nature, social structure and cosmology.
