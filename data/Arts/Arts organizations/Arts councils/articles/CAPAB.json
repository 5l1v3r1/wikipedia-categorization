In Cape Town the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB) was instituted in 1962 with the aim to promote the performing arts in the Cape Province and South Arica. The arts councils received sufficient government subsidies to fund various art forms as well as the operational requirements of the theatre facilities.

Founded in 1963, after the dissolving of the National Theatre Organisation, with Danie van Eeden*?? as its first director. (He was followed consecutively by G\u00e9 Korsten, George Loopuyt and Michael  Maas.)  Registered as a society not for gain, it was headed by a policy-making council chaired by the provincial administrator and representative of all interested parties, including the province, the city municipality of Cape Town, the department of national education,  the business sector as well as representatives of the various performing art forms. Their function was to provide artists and artisans with a secure career option, to develop and promote drama, ballet, music and opera by offering audiences in the province with regular professional productions. Its first productions were Becket (Anouilh) and Hedda Gabler (Ibsen, in Afrikaans) in the Hofmeyr Theatre in November 1963. Their first opera (The Bartered Bride by Smetana) was done on 8 February 1965 in the Alhambra Theatre.  Their first indigenous in play Afrikaans was *** in 196*, while the first indigenous English play was The Year of the Locust by James Ambrose Brown (1966).  Initially renting theatres in the various cities, CAPAB purchased the Opera House in Port Elizabeth in 1967, and refurbished it for use as a base for their work in the Eastern Cape. In 1971 they opened the Nico Malan Theatre Complex in Cape Town, The Opera House with a performance of the ballet Sylvia, and the Theatre with a controversial [Presidential] opening production, \"KONING LEAR\" [Uys Krige] - directed by Dieter Reible, [\"Christine\" - Barto Smit was also scheduled, but banned before rehearsals commenced due to subject matter].    Feydeau's \"Hond Se Gedagte\" [A Flea in her Ear'] also directed by Dieter Reible followed 'Lear'.\n</p>\n<pre>The opening of this theatre \"for whites only\" \u2013 despite the protests of artists, critics and many of the population \u2013 was to be one of the most troublesome issues for the council over the next twenty years, as it was actively boycotted by the Cape non-white population as well as their supporters. It was belatedly opened for all on 21 February 1975, but this had little effect on the boycott, which lasted for many more years. In 1972  a third venue, the Arena, was builtin a large rehearsal room, to house the work of CAPAB;'s experimental company [Aubrey berg's production of Hofmann's \"The Burgomaster\"]. The first head of drama was the long serving  Pieter Fourie, followed by Johan Esterhuizen in 19**, and later by***.  CAPAB also had a very successful youth company, founded to do educational work and  originally led by Robin Malan*? Followed over the years by i.a. Eileen Thorns, ** and Ivan Abrahams  and. .  the     CAPAB:Cape Provincial Arts Board. . Together with PACT and the Phoenix Players, they staged Athol Fugard\u2019s Boesman and Lena and People are Living There, both directed by Fugard and starring Yvonne Bryceland and Glyn Day in 1970. Peter Curtis and Pieter Fourie ran this drama company circa 1971. They staged their plays at the old Hofmeyr Theatre. They acquired their own theatre and opera house in 1971 in the form of the Nico Malan. The Nico\u2019s first performance in front of an integrated audience, the Academy Theatres\u2019 Who Saw Him Die took place on 21 February 1975. Their production of Dalene Matthee\u2019s Fiela se Kind starring Shaleen Surtie-Richards was staged at the Nico Malan in 1986. Basil Rubin in association with CAPAB staged William Luce\u2019s Zelda at the Adcock-Ingram in August 1987. Together with Volute Productions they staged Robert Hewett\u2019s Gulls which Keith Grenville directed in 1987. Together with the other three performing arts councils they staged The Great Walt for their Christmas production in 1987 and Singin\u2019 in the Rain for their Christmas production in 1988. They staged My Fair Lady in 1989/90. They presented Michael Drinn\u2019s The Phantom of the Opera in 1990. Together with  PACT, the <a href=\"/wiki/Johannesburg_Civic_Theatre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Johannesburg Civic Theatre\">Johannesburg Civic Theatre</a> Association and NAPAC they presented A Chorus Line in 1992. Together with NAPAC and PACOFS they presented Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! in 1993. **** (Tucker, 1997) CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (****-****).  Cape Town.  Chris Swart was the director (from 19** to 19**), Peter Curtis the artistic director of English drama(from 19** to 19**) and Pieter Fourie the artistic director of Afrikaans drama (from 19** to 19**).\n</pre>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
