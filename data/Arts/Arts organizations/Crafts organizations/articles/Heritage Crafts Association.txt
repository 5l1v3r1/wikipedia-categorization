The Heritage Crafts Association (HCA) is a registered United Kingdom charity set up to support and promote traditional crafts. The charity was launched at the Victoria & Albert Museum in March 2010,  with a membership programme for supporters.  HCA initiated a 30-minute adjournment debate on the state of traditional crafts in Westminster in June 2009.  In May 2017, in association with The Radcliffe Trust, the Association published 'The Radcliffe Red List of Endangered Crafts'.  This publication was also covered on Woman's Hour.  The President of the Heritage Crafts Association is HRH Prince of Wales and it is run by a board of trustees, including professional scribe Patricia Lovett (chair), Richard Hobbs (vice-chair) and Robin Wood (professional wood turner and co-founder of Spoonfest with Barn the Spoon).
