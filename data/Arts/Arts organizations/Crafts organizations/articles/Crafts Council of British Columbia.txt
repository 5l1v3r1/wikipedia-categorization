The Craft Council of British Columbia (CCBC) is a non-profit, charitable arts service organization working with fine craft professionals and local, provincial and national arts organizations to promote the development of excellence in crafts. Since 1972, CCBC has been making craft more significant in the cultural life of British Columbians and Canadians. Through CCBC's public gallery and retail shop on Granville Island, CCBC Shop & Gallery, exhibitions have showcased contemporary objects in ceramic, glass, fibre, metal and wood that honour innovation in art, craft and design.  The CCBC offers a number of programs and services designed to promote fine craft, educate the public on fine craft practises and trends, meet the needs of its membership, craftspeople/artisans, educators, students and the general public. The CCBC is the only craft-focused arts service organization in BC that fulfills an educational and public mandate along with regional and national objectives.  A list of programs currently offered at CCBC: The CCBC, formerly the Craft's Association of British Columbia was created in recognition of a growing craft community in British Columbia by interested members of the Visual Arts Committee of the Community Arts Council of Vancouver. The first CCBC office, resource centre and exhibition space was located in the Dominion Building at the corner of Hastings and Cambie Street, downtown Vancouver. The Council continues to foster the development of craftspeople and fine craft through a variety of programs at its present location, 1386 Cartwright Street on Granville Island.
