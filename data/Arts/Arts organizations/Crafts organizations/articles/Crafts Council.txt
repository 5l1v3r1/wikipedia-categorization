The Crafts Council is the national development agency for contemporary craft in the United Kingdom, and is funded by Arts Council England. In 1991, the Crafts Council moved to 44a Pentonville Road, London, where premises included a reference library, a shop, a café, an education workshop and a gallery space. In 2006, the Crafts Council decreased its on-site activity and closed the gallery, shop, education workshop and café in order for the Crafts Council to increase its regional activity via partnership working. In 2011, its 40th anniversary year, over 400,000 visitors saw its five temporary exhibitions, 27,000 people attended its craft fairs, and over 7,000 children and young people participated in its nationwide initiatives. The Crafts Council is supported by Arts Council England. The Crafts Council is also supported by a number of trusts and foundations and private patrons who support touring exhibitions, professional development schemes and participation and learning programmes. All meet the aims and objectives of charitable organisations supporting the arts. The Crafts Council is made up of a number of specialist teams, reflecting the various aspects of our work, and is overseen by a Senior Management Team, and ultimately a board of Trustees.
