Rising Production (formerly Vision Factory) is a Japanese talent agency. It largely works with musical talent, but has branched out in recent years to include actors and comedians. It was founded by Tetsuo Taira in 1984 under the name Rising Productions. However, the company changed its name to Freegate Promotions and now present, Vision Factory, after Taira was indicted and sent to prison for tax evasion in 2001.  The company came into prominence after the widespread successes of musical acts Namie Amuro, MAX, Speed and Da Pump in the mid to late 1990s.
