The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society produces religious literature primarily for use by Jehovah's Witnesses. The organization's international writing, artwork, translation, and printery workforce are all baptized Jehovah's Witnesses. Since 2001, the literature produced by the Watch Tower Society is said to have been "published by Jehovah's Witnesses". Prior to 1931, the Watch Tower Society produced literature for the Bible Student movement. Unbulleted publications are generally out of print and considered obsolete. Indented publications are superseded by more recent publications. The Watch Tower Society also acquired publishing rights for the following Bible translations: These publications are intended to convert interested individuals.   Secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism.

Audio recordings, including dialog, music, and sound effects, are produced at the Watch Tower Society headquarters and other branch offices. The recordings are presented at annual conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses, usually accompanied by members acting out the scenes with costumes and props. The recordings (audio and sign language) are later made available for home use by members. Since 2007, Witness conventions have featured 'sound dramas'—audio recordings of Bible passages read in a dramatic fashion, accompanied by music, sound effects, and extra dialog. The recordings are later made available for download from the official website.
