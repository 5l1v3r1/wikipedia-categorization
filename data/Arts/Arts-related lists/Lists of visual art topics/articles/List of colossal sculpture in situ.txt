This is a list of colossal sculptures that were carved in situ  (or "in place"), sometimes referred to as "living rock". This list includes two colossal stones that were intended to be moved. However, they were never broken free of the quarry in which they were carved, and therefore they would be considered carved in situ. Most of these were carved in ancient times. In most cases, especially in India, the sculptures were carved out of "soft" rock like basalt or volcanic tuff. However, in some cases they were carved out of harder rock like sandstone, or even granite in the case of the unfinished obelisk. The Egyptians may have been limited to using 10-pound dolerite balls to chip away at the granite.  Dynamite was used in the carving of Mount Rushmore, another of the few colossal sculptures that was carved out of granite.
