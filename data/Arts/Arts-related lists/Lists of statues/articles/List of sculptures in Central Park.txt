A total of 29 sculptures[note 1] have appeared since 1863 in New York City's 843-acre (3.41 km2) Central Park. Most have been donated by individuals or organizations, few by the city itself. While many early statues are of authors and poets along "Literary Walk" and American figures like Daniel Webster and "the Pilgrim", other early works were simply picturesque, like The Hunter and The Falconer; other notable statues include sled dog Balto, the so-called "Cleopatra's Needle"—an Egyptian obelisk—Alice of Wonderland, and most recently Duke Ellington. • Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at east 96/97th, the statue of Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen  was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park. In addition, temporary exhibitions of sculpture are mounted in the Doris Freedman Plaza, a concrete and cobblestone area located just outside the southeast entrance walkway to the park, behind the Sherman Monument.
