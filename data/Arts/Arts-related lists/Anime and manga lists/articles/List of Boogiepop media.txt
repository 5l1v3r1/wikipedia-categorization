This is a current listing of the media in Kouhei Kadono's Boogiepop series.  This metaseries currently consists of 15 light novels, a four volume light novel spin-off series, a live-action movie, an anime television series, two manga serials, two audio CDs, and other books. An oddity of the Boogiepop titles is that they are almost always made of more than one title, and often there is a mix of English and Japanese titles.  This list provides the English-release title, the Japanese title (and transliteration), with any further sub-titles below. These serialized novels take place within the Boogiepop universe: A month ago, a pillar of light pierced the sky.  Now, some people are beginning to show signs of highly evolved powers, and others are seeing the apparitions of people who should be dead.  Rumours circulate about Boogiepop being involved, but does this urban legend even exist, and does anybody really know what is going on?  Marking the 20th Anniversary of Kouhei Kadono's original novel debut, and announced at the Dengeki Bunko 25th Anniversary & New Work Unveiling Stage, a new series based on Kouhei Kadono and Kouji Ogata's Boogiepop and Others is set for release in January 2019.
