 This is a list of media from the Japanese science fiction series RahXephon. RahXephon began production as an anime television series in 2001. A manga version, a novelization, soundtracks and an audio drama were published during and after the original broadcast, which lasted from January to September 2002. The series was released on DVD in Japan during its original broadcast, and was subsequently translated and both broadcast and released on DVD in other countries. A television movie, a RahXephon video game, and an OVA episode were released a year later, in 2003. Characters, mecha and story from RahXephon were featured in a game in the Super Robot Wars series. Art books, guide books and additional novels were also released. This list includes video games and music, but not toys, hobby articles and other merchandise. The manga release started before the anime broadcast, so that the ending in one medium would not trail too far behind the other.  The first chapter, or "mission", appeared in the magazine Monthly Sunday Gene-X in the October 2001 issue  (released 19 September 2001); the final chapter was released two months after the airing of the last anime episode, in the December 2002 issue (released 19 November 2002).   The chapters were subsequently released in three compilation volumes which were translated and published internationally. These volumes contain the following chapters and extras. In addition, each publisher may have added certain notes and advertisements in the front and back of the volumes. Hiroshi Ohnogi, one of the screenwriters on the TV series, has written a novelization in five volumes. These are published in English by DrMaster. Two different illustrated guide books have been published. There are also two guide books which go more into details. There are also art books available. The RahXephon video game, Blue Sky Fantasia[b] (ラーゼフォン 蒼穹幻想曲, Rāzefon Soukyū Gensokyoku), was released for the PlayStation 2 by Bandai Japan on 7 August 2003; there is no English version. The game is mainly an adventure game with some action sequences. The player moves around in a 3D environment, learning about places and relationships, and moving the story toward one of forty different endings. In-game characters are voiced by their original Japanese voice actors and are animated while speaking. Cut scenes feature hand-drawn animation, some of which was made for the game. In the action sequences the player fights Dolems with the RahXephon; weapons and other RahXephon variants can be un-locked. The special Plusculus edition of the video game contains an extra booklet and a DVD with the RahXephon OVA episode. The RahXephon characters and mecha have appeared in the game Super Robot Wars MX (2004), mixed with those from other shows. RahXephon's story-line also had a major role in the game's overall mixed plot, as the series' climax was also the climax of the game. In the game, the RahXephon is a very powerful unit, with the power of a Super Robot but much of the agility of a Real Robot; although not quite as overwhelming as the Zeorymer, it is one of the more effective units. RahXephon characters and mecha re-appear in the game Super Robot Wars Scramble Commander the 2nd (2007).
