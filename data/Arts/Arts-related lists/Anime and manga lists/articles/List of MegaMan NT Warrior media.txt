The following is media and release information for the MegaMan NT Warrior anime and manga series, known in Japan as Rockman EXE (ロックマンエグゼ, Rokkuman Eguze). The former is composed of five anime series (EXE, Axess, Stream, Beast, Beast+) and one feature-length film. The anime series began on March 4, 2002 in Japan, and EXE and Axess were subsequently adapted in English, airing May 17, 2003. The film, Rockman EXE: Program of Light and Dark, aired in Japan on March 12, 2005. In Japan, every episode of the anime has been released across sixty-five DVDs usually containing three episodes per disc. In the United States, thirteen DVDs have been released covering the original 52 episodes of EXE. The first six volumes were also released in VHS form. Currently, there are no plans to release the English version of Axess on DVD. This soundtrack contains background music and a few theme songs from the first Area of the original EXE series. Although the soundtrack's title implies a second Sound Navigation may have been released, one was never announced, possibly due to poor sales. This album contains every opening and closing theme song from EXE through Beast as well as two bonus songs available in the first print of the album (indicated by the asterisk beside the track listing). However, most of the songs are in their broadcast TV-Sized lengths, presumably because full-length versions were never recorded.  The anime is composed of five series: EXE (56 episodes), Axess (51), Stream (51), Beast (25), Beast+ (26), and one feature-film. The anime series began on March 4, 2002 in Japan, and EXE and Axess were subsequently adapted in English, airing May 17, 2003. Currently, there are no plans for English adaptations of Stream, Beast, Beast+, or the movie.
