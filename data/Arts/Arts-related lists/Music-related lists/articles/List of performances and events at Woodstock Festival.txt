The Woodstock Music & Art Fair was a music festival held on a 600-acre (2.4 km²; 240 ha, 0.94 mi²) dairy farm in the rural town of Bethel, New York from August 15 to August 18, 1969. Thirty-two acts performed during the sometimes rainy weekend in front of nearly half a million concertgoers. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest moments in popular music history and was listed on Rolling Stone's "50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll".   The first day officially began at 5:07 p.m. with Richie Havens and featured folk artists. 32 acts performed during the sometimes rainy weekend in front of nearly half a million concertgoers. 5:07pm – 6:00pm 7:10pm – 7:20pm 7:30pm – 8:10pm[nb 1] 8:20pm – 9:15pm 9:20pm – 9:45pm with a three-song set, played through the rain 10:00pm – 10:35pm 10:50pm – 11:20pm 11:55pm – 12:25am 12:55am – 2:00am  [nb 2]   The day opened at 1:20 pm, and featured some of the event's biggest psychedelic and guitar rock headliners. 12:15pm – 12:45pm 1:00pm – 1:30pm 2:00pm – 2:45pm 3:30pm – 3:55pm 4:45pm – 5:30pm 6:00pm – 6:30pm 7:30pm – 8:30pm 9:00pm – 10:00pm 10:30pm – 12:05am[nb 3]  12:30am – 1:20am with The Kozmic Blues Band2:00am – 3:00am  3:30am – 4:20am 5:00am – 6:05am kicking off a 25-song set including Tommy 8:00am – 9:40am Joe Cocker was the first act on the last officially booked day (Sunday); he opened up the day's events at 2 PM. His set was preceded by at least two instrumentals by The Grease Band. 2:00pm – 3:25pm 6:30pm – 8:00pm 8:15pm – 9:15pm 10:00pm – 10:50pm 12:00am – 1:05am featuring his brother, Edgar Winter, on three songs. 1:30am – 2:30am 3:00am – 4:00am with separate acoustic and electric sets.  Chip Monck announced the act as "Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young", but the name Young was dropped from the movie and film soundtrack for the performance of "Suite Judy Blue Eyes". Neil Young skipped most of the acoustic set (the exceptions being his compositions "Mr. Soul" and "Wonderin'") and joined Crosby, Stills & Nash during the electric set, but refused to be filmed; by his own report, Young felt the filming was distracting both performers and audience from the music. Despite his refusal, footage does exist of him performing "Mr. Soul" and "Long Time Gone." The "Mr. Soul" performance can be found as an Easter Egg on his Archives 1963-1972 DVD box set, however because of his resistance to being filmed during much of the performance the camera remains focused on Stills. Young's "Sea of Madness," heard on the album, was drawn from the Fillmore East concert, one month after the festival.  The original recording was later restored on the six-CD boxed set Woodstock: 40 Years On [Back To Yasgur's Farm] 6:00am – 6:45am 7:30am - 8:00am 9:00am – 11:10amAfter being introduced as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix corrected the new group's name to "Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, for short it's nothin' but a band of gypsies." Later during the set he introduced them as "Sky Church."
