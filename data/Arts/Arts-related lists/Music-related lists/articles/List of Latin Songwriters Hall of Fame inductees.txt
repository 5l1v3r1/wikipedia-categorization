The Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame (LSHOF) was established in 2012 by Rudy Pérez and Desmond Child in the United States to "educate, preserve, honor and celebrate the legacy of the greatest Latin songwriters from all over the world and their music in every genre".  According to Child, the organization was created to recognize songwriters who are rarely acknowledged for their compositions.  He cited "Livin' la Vida Loca" by Ricky Martin as an example when searching the song's lyrics for the Internet with neither him nor Draco Rosa being credited for writing the song.  The organization's committee is made up of music professional from 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America, Europe, and the United States. Nominees for the LSHOF are chosen by the committees while inductees are voted by the public.  For a songwriter to be considered, they must have a composed a hit song at least twenty years old.  Both living and deceased songwriters are eligible to be inducted into the LSHOF.  The inductions were first held in 2013: Manuel Alejandro, José Ángel Espinoza, José Feliciano, Julio Iglesias, Armando Manzanero, Concha Valdés Miranda, and Roberto Cantoral were the first songwriters to be inducted. The latter was posthumously inducted.  Mexico is the country with the most songwriters inducted with twelve.
