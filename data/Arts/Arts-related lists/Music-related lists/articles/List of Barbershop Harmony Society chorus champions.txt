This page lists the Barbershop Harmony Society's international chorus champions by the year in which they won. Choruses are eligible to win any number of times but must sit out for two years after they win. The only non-U.S. choruses to win this championship were The Dukes Of Harmony (1977 & 1980) and the Toronto Northern Lights (2013), both from Canada.  The Dallas-based Vocal Majority has won this competition a record 13 times.
