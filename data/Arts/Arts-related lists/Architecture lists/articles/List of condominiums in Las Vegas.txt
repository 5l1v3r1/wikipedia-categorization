Since the 1990s, various condominium projects have been proposed for the Las Vegas Valley. Park Towers and Turnberry Place, two high-rise condominium properties located near the Las Vegas Strip, were completed in 2001; they subsequently inspired a condominium boom that started in 2003, when various developers began announcing projects that were planned throughout the Las Vegas Valley. Many projects were ultimately cancelled because of a rise in construction costs, as well as a lack of skilled construction workers and contractors who were qualified to build high-rises; both reasons were attributed to the large number of projects being announced. The following list includes notable condominium projects that were both completed and cancelled, as well as projects that are on hold. Regency Towers, built in 1974, was the first high-rise condominium property to open in the Las Vegas Valley,  with 226-units. The property was initially unsuccessful, selling only eight units before going into foreclosure. In the late 1990s, Las Vegas was the fastest-growing area in the United States.  As a result, five new high-rise condominium projects were being planned for the Las Vegas Valley in 1998, for a total of 12 new condominium towers. Among the five proposed projects was Turnberry Place and Park Towers.   High-rise condominiums became a popular trend in the Las Vegas Valley after the opening of Turnberry Place and Park Towers in 2001.    Numerous high-rise condominium projects were subsequently announced beginning in 2003.   Real estate experts predicted that only 20 to 50 percent of the announced projects would actually get built.  The condo-hotel concept was introduced in the Las Vegas Valley in September 2003, at MonteLago Village at Lake Las Vegas.  At the end of the year, plans were underway for the first high-rise condominium in downtown Las Vegas: Soho Lofts.  The condominium boom was sometimes referred to as the "Manhattanization of Las Vegas".        The term was first used in 1999, by Steve Bottfeld, the owner of a Las Vegas real estate consulting firm.   The term was popularized by Richard Lee – director of public relations for First American Title Company   – after he used it during a presentation.  Lee was a well-known local proponent of the high-rise condominium boom,  and spoke frequently about it at local conferences and seminars.  Lee had used the term as early as 2003;  it was later used as the title for Manhattanizing Las Vegas, a 2005 book by Paul Murad that chronicled the Las Vegas condominium boom.    A website called Manhattanization.com was also created to cover the local high-rise market.   By January 2005, 122 high-rise condominium buildings with a total of nearly 17,000 units had been announced. The tallest proposed project was the 73-story Summit, which also had the most expensive price listed for a unit: $35 million. The lowest price was $139,900 for units at the 51-story Las Vegas Central.  New condominium projects, when completed, were expected to create an increase in visitation to local casinos.  Since the start of the condominium boom in 2003, the Krystle Sands high-rise on the Las Vegas Strip was the first of the newly proposed condominium projects to be cancelled,    in March 2005.  As of December 2005, at least 70 condominium towers had been announced for the Las Vegas Valley during the previous 12 months. Multiple projects had been cancelled up to that point.  Many projects were cancelled because of rising construction costs, as well as a lack of skilled construction workers and contractors who were capable of building high-rise structures; both reasons were attributed to the large amount of high-rise condominium projects that were being planned.    While most of the cancelled condominium projects did not have difficulty selling, their respective developers could not build the projects at a suitable cost due to construction expenses rising 30 percent to 50 percent.  In February 2006, representatives from six projects announced the formation of the Las Vegas High Rise and Condominium Alliance, which would promote the mid-rise and high-rise condominium market in Las Vegas.  In April 2006, Murad – who was planning the 39-story Gateway Las Vegas condominium tower – stated that Las Vegas had entered its second phase of "Manhattanization", saying, "This first phase of Manhattanizing is over. Now we're entering the second phase. What happened in Las Vegas over the last few years is amazing, going from a couple of high rises to a hundred. That hasn't happened anywhere else in the world."  The Platinum and The Signature at MGM Grand, the first projects near the Las Vegas Strip to offer condo-hotel units, were completed in 2006.  By that point, after the cancellations of several high-rise condominium projects, banks had become more resistant to developers who were seeking construction financing for proposed projects. Two banks were heavily involved in Las Vegas' high-rise condominium market at that time: Corus Bank and Hypo Real Estate Corporation. Corus had $770 million of its loan portfolio allocated to Las Vegas condominium projects, while Hypo had approximately $850 million allocated to such projects.  During 2006, multiple condominium projects were under construction in downtown Las Vegas. Mayor Oscar Goodman, who was elected in 1999, had made it a priority to revitalize the downtown area.  Sky Las Vegas, finished in 2007,  was the first high-rise condominium to be completed on the Las Vegas Strip.  Sales of high-rise condominiums began to decrease in 2008.  The condo-hotel market, consisting of projects on and near the Las Vegas Strip, also suffered that year because of low sales; thousands of condo-hotel units had been cancelled up to that point.  By the end of 2008, only three additional developers had successfully completed condominium high-rises near the Las Vegas Strip: MGM Mirage (The Signature), Donald Trump (Trump International), and Andrew Fonfa (Allure Las Vegas).  In 2009, condominium and condo-hotel units on and near the Las Vegas Strip were still struggling to sell because of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.  As of August 2009, less than 25 percent of the proposed condominium projects had been built, as predicted by some analysts; developers of projects that were completed were having difficulty selling their units as a result of the 2008 recession.  Sales of high-rise condominiums increased seven percent in the third quarter of 2009, although condo-hotels continued to struggle.  Poor condominium sales continued into the following year.  In June 2010, there were 5,500 high-rise condominium units and 5,400 condo-hotel units in the Las Vegas Valley.  By that point, developers of several high-rise condominium properties had begun renting their vacant units, which were left unsold because of the poor economy.  Sales of high-rise condominiums had increased in 2011, with many units being sold at a reduced cost through bank sales, short sales, and foreclosures to investors, who would subsequently improve and flip the units. The largest increase occurred at properties on and near the Las Vegas Strip. However, sales of new condominiums were down, and the condo-hotel market also continued to suffer.  High-rise sales were expected to increase in 2015 as the market continued to recover.  By 2016, the construction industry in Las Vegas had been revived, although there were no plans for any new high-rise condominium projects.  Prices for existing high-rise condominiums had increased by that time. Demand for high-rise homes on the Las Vegas Strip was projected to increase because of the opening of the T-Mobile Arena, as well as the announcement of an NHL expansion franchise and discussions about a potential NFL team in Las Vegas.  Allure was announced in January 2005,  and began construction in September 2005.  Allure, located west of the Las Vegas Strip, was completed in December 2007, and was the tallest residential building within Las Vegas city limits at that time, standing 41 stories high with a total of 428 units. The tower was built at a cost of $150 million.  A second tower was cancelled because of poor sales in the first tower caused by the Great Recession, and because of an oversupply of condominium high-rises on the Las Vegas Strip.  Boca Raton consists of two seven-story buildings with a total of 378 units, located at 2405 West Serene Avenue, south of the Las Vegas Strip.   In January 2004, Las Vegas-based Palm Beach Resort Condominiums LLC purchased 15 acres (6.1 ha) of land at the southwest corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Serene Avenue, at a cost of $12.8 million. Unlike appoximately 80 other condominium projects, Palm Beach Resort received county approval, had the project designed, and began construction before taking reservations. Stewart Simpson, the senior vice president of development for the project, said at the start of construction, "Most of these projects, they have a concept, they option for a piece of land and go out and start explaining it. Instead of saying we have this dream and hope we can make it happen, we had a dream and we didn't tell anyone about it and did our homework."  The project was designed by Pierce Goodwin Alexander and Linville (PGAL).   Groundbreaking for the first phase began on November 17, 2004, with completion expected for February 2006. The $400 million project was planned to ultimately consist of four seven-story towers, with a total of 756 units. Prices were expected to start at $200,000. The project was also planned to include a two-story underground parking garage. Las Vegas-based Wright Engineering was the project engineer,  while UPA Resort Construction Group was the general contractor.   JPMorgan Chase provided a $134 million construction loan for the project.  Martin Harris Construction became the general contractor in 2005, and the project's opening was delayed several times because of construction.  By December 2005, the midrise project had sold 270 units in its first two buildings, which contained a total of 378 units. The February 2006 opening had been delayed by that point.   Following the completion of the underground parking garage, upward construction was underway as of January 2006, with the first 172 units scheduled to open in December 2006.  By May 2006, basketball player Paul Pierce had purchased a unit in the project.  Both buildings had been topped out by August 2006. The buildings used 16,000 cubic yards of concrete and 2,000 tons of steel, with 250,000 hours spent working on them up to that point. Completion of the first phase was scheduled for January 2007, and would include a 10,000 sq ft (930 m2) clubhouse.  Construction was nearing completion in late May 2007, and residents were expected to move in by June.  Approximately 70 people moved in during July 2007, and the 378-unit first phase was entirely finished in October, with 80 percent of the units sold. It was announced that construction for the second phase was 12 to 18 months away.  Approximately 160 units were sold in 2007, but sales decreased the following year due to the Great Recession. Unit purchases stopped entirely in 2009, and the other two buildings were cancelled due to the poor economy. JPMorgan Chase sued Boca Raton's developer in 2010, alleging default of the construction loan. In 2011, an investment group purchased Boca Raton. In December 2017, the group listed the remaining 210 unsold units for sale in a bulk offer.  Juhl is a mixed-use development project that includes 341 condominium units, some of which are located within a 15-story tower. Units range from 600 sq ft (56 m2) to nearly 2,000 sq ft (190 m2). Juhl is located at 353 East Bonneville Avenue in downtown Las Vegas.   The 2.4-acre (0.97 ha)  property was initially occupied by four houses. The Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency solicited proposals from approximately a dozen companies across the United States to develop the land. CityMark Development was chosen in 2004 develop the property.   CityMark purchased the property for $5 million,  and planned to build Juhl, a $167 million mixed-use and condo project. Juhl would include six towers, standing between six and 15 stories, with a total of 341 units. The project would include 24,000 sq ft (2,200 m2) of retail space, while parking would be located on the first five floors. The houses on the property were demolished, and by April 2006, $600,000 of underground work and the relocation of utilities had begun on the site. Turner Construction was the general contractor,  while Martinez-Cuitri was the architect.  Corus Bank provided $106 million for the project.  In August 2006, 600 cubic yards of concrete were delivered by more than 75 trucks for the foundation of the project.  In December 2006, approximately 60 percent of Juhl's units had been sold through binding purchase agreements. That month, construction crews poured the third and fourth floors of the residential and parking structures for the project. Approximately 115 construction workers were on the site at that time, with the number expected to increase to 200 to 225 within the following 15 to 18 months.  In July 2007, several businesses were being planned for the new project, including a bar, a coffee shop, and a jewelry store.  Three cranes were used during construction of the 15-story mid-rise building.  The 15-story tower was topped off in August 2007, with the first residents expected to move in by May 2008.  At that time, 70 percent of Juhl's units had been sold.  Juhl remained under construction in June 2008, with only 67 percent of its units sold.  Juhl's planned opening was delayed by more than a year.  In August 2011, Juhl still had 307 units left unsold.  ST Residential, at a cost of $14 million,  purchased the project after the failure of Corus in September 2009.   A bike store, The Town Bike, opened at Juhl in September 2013.  In 2013, ST Residential sold Juhl's 306 unsold units to KRE Capital, based in California; Dune Real Estate Partners, based in New York; and Northcap, based in Las Vegas. Juhl's unsold units were turned into rentals. On March 23, 2017, it was announced that Juhl's unsold units would be put on sale in late April 2017, while renewing some rental agreements to keep the building occupied.  The Mandarin Oriental hotel, located within MGM's mixed-use CityCenter complex on the Las Vegas Strip, includes 225 condominiums, and was opened in December 2009. Newport Lofts is a 23-story, 168-unit tower located at 200 Hoover Street in downtown Las Vegas.  The project was co-developed by Sam Cherry, who also developed Soho Lofts.  In August 2004, Cherry was planning Newport Lofts as a 17-story tower with 131 units, to be built at the northeast corner of Casino Center and Hoover Avenue.  The project was a joint venture between Cherry and Seegmiller Partners,  a company based in Newport Beach, California,  with Clark and West Seegmiller as its principals.  The property for the project had been purchased several years earlier by Clark Seegmiller.  In October 2004, the Las Vegas City Council approved Newport Lofts as a 22-story tower with 168 units.  Groundbreaking was to begin in late May 2005, with completion expected in fall 2006.  Reservations began in January 2005,  while groundbreaking began in early July 2005, with Breslin Builders as the project's general contractor. Completion was expected for 2007. That month, the project received $81 million in construction financing from George Smith Partners, based in Irving, California.  In March 2006, the elevator shaft and center staircase had been built up to the 12th floor, while shear walls were up to the eighth floor.  Construction was still underway in August 2007, although some new residents had already begun moving into the building by that time. More than 70 percent of the building's units had been sold up to that point.  Construction concluded at a cost of $115 million.  Corus Bank helped financed the project for $67.1 million.  West Seegmiller said Newport Lofts was designed with a Southern California theme, as its target demographic was California residents who desired to purchase a second home in Las Vegas.  In 2007, Newport Lofts won a Mayor's Urban Design Award.  In January 2008, an auction of 60 units was cancelled after Pyramis Global Advisors – a division of Fidelity Investments – took over management of the building.  Condo prices at Newport Lofts were decreased 30 percent later that year.  At the end of 2008, artist Brett Sperry opened the Brett Wesley Gallery inside his penthouse at Newport Lofts.   When Corus Bank failed in September 2009, the property was acquired by ST Residential. In April 2011, ST Residential announced that the last of Newport Lofts' units had been sold to buyers.  One Las Vegas is located at the intersection of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Windmill Lane. One Las Vegas was announced in February 2005, as a joint project between Amland Development and B.S.R. Group,  an international developer based in Israel.  Chet Nichols, executive vice president for Amland Development, was working with Wells Fargo, Wachovia and Hypo Real Estate Capital to devise a financial package to help build the project. Grading on the 20-acre property was expected to begin in late February 2005, with construction of the first two towers – standing 20 stories high – expected to begin in July 2005.  In February 2005, Amland won the legal rights to use the "One Las Vegas" name, which had also been chosen by Del American for their own condominium project.   Sales began on April 7, 2005.  The first phase, expected to cost $142 million, was under construction in April 2006, with excavation, grading, and underground utility work occurring on the property. J.E. Dunn Construction of Kansas City served as the general contractor. The first phase consisted of two condominium towers, scheduled for completion in December 2007. Approximately 50 percent of the first phase had been presold up to that point. A total of five towers – standing 18 to 21 stories – were ultimately planned for the property, with a final total of 890 condominium units. A 200-room boutique hotel and a 200-unit condo-hotel – both of which would be operated by the same company – were also planned at that time. By that point, Amland had gained financing from Corus Bank,  which fully financed the project for $142 million.  Units ranged in price from the $400,000s for an 850 sq ft (79 m2) one-bedroom unit to $1.8 million for a 2,850 sq ft (265 m2) penthouse.  Units initially started at $275,000 when the project was announced.  In October 2006, construction was underway on the two towers, which were expected to have a total of 359 units, with an ultimate total of 960 units when all five towers were completed.  The 182-unit first tower was topped off on January 19, 2007, with completion scheduled for late 2007. Construction on the second tower was up to the 16th floor. Approximately 400 construction workers were on the project.  The second tower was topped off in April 2007, and was expected to be completed in early 2008, with the first phase expected to cost $150 million.  Delays were attributed to excessive construction activity in Las Vegas, and to the fact that inspections of safety systems did not occur as initially scheduled. Certificates of occupancy were issued for the towers in June 2008. At the time, discussions were underway with two hotel companies for the 220-room boutique hotel.  In April 2009, One Las Vegas entered foreclosure because of low sales, and was taken over by Corus Bank, which planned to offer units at a 50 percent discount.   After Corus Bank failed in September 2009, Starwood Property Trust acquired the project a month later and began renting units because of poor sales; less than 75 of the 359 units had closed on their sales.   Upgrades totaling $2 million were completed in 2015.  Originally announced under the name of Versailles in March 1998.  The project was to consist of three 12-story towers with a total of 84 condominium units, to be constructed on 14.5 acres (5.9 ha) of land in the Las Vegas community of Summerlin. Construction was to begin in May 1998, with completion scheduled for 14 months later.   In July 2004, a new condominium project was announced for the property under the name of Queensridge Towers,  later changed to One Queensridge Place. Construction began in April 2005,  and concluded by September 2007,   at a cost of $400 million.  One Queensridge Place consists of two 18-story towers with 219 condominium units, and is located on part of a 20-acre (8.1 ha) property near the Suncoast Hotel and Casino and the Tivoli Village shopping mall.  Two additional towers – standing 14 and 18 stories high – had initially been announced as part of the Queensridge project, and had been approved for the remainder of the 20-acre property.  Panorama Towers was announced in September 2003,  and began construction the following year.  The first tower was opened in December 2006,  while a second tower was opened a year later.  Both towers stand 33 stories high,   and were built at an estimated cost of $300 million.  A third tower, standing 45 stories, was renamed as The Martin in 2011,  and received a $3 million renovation to increase sales.  The complex is located west of Interstate 15 and CityCenter. Park Towers is a two-tower, 20-story condominium property with 84 units, located east of the Las Vegas Strip. Park Towers was announced by developer Irwin Molasky in 1998,  and began construction the following year, with Steve Wynn as a co-developer.  The project was completed in 2001.  Regency Towers is located at 3111 Bel Air Drive, at the Las Vegas Country Club in Winchester, Nevada.  Regency Towers was built in 1974, and was the first high-rise condominium property to open in the Las Vegas Valley,  standing 28 stories  with 226 units.  Only eight of the units sold after opening, before the property went into foreclosure. Irwin Molasky, who was among the eight buyers, later purchased the entire structure and renovated it before ultimately selling the remaining units.  Regency Towers was designed by Las Vegas architect Homer A. Rissman, who also lived at the property for years.  In March 2001, approximately 80 residents were evacuated after the explosion of a meth lab operated by a resident inside one of the condominiums.   In March 2007, six weeks of filming began at Regency Towers for the second season of the television series HGTV Design Star. The season was shot inside the penthouse formerly owned by Molasky.   Notable tenants at Regency Towers have included George Carlin,  Don Miguel Ruiz,  Hank Greenspun and his wife,  Shaun King,  musician Larry Hart,  Norm Clarke,   casino executive Burton Cohen,   Russian-art collector Dr. Rupert Perrin,  Sandra Murphy,   and Anthony Spilotro.   Moe Dalitz owned a penthouse unit until his death there in 1989;   his unit, which included his furniture and books, was for sale in 2002 at a cost of $1.2 million. Also for sale at that time was Rodney Dangerfield's 1,856 sq ft (172.4 m2) unit, at a cost of $275,000.  Actress Debbie Reynolds, who purchased a 1,856 sq ft (172.4 m2) condominium unit on the 12th floor in 1974, put her unit up for sale in 2011, at a cost of $269,900.  La Toya Jackson owned a unit from 1996 until 2009, when it was foreclosed.   Sky Las Vegas is a 45-story tower with 409 condominium units that is located on the Las Vegas Strip.   Sky Las Vegas was announced in July 2004,   and was opened in May 2007,  becoming the first high-rise condominium project to be completed on the Las Vegas Strip.  Soho Lofts, named after the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo,  is a 16-story condominium tower with 112 units,  located within the city's arts district  at 900 South Las Vegas Boulevard in downtown Las Vegas.  The project was developed by Sam Cherry, who also developed Newport Lofts.  Cherry and his father-in-law,  Harris Rittoff, were planning Soho Lofts in December 2003. The project was to be built at a cost of $40 million to $50 million, on 0.69 acres (0.28 ha) of vacant property at the southwest corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Hoover Avenue. Soho Lofts was the first high-rise condominium project to be announced for the downtown area. Groundbreaking was scheduled for May 2004.  The project was to include 4,000 sq ft (370 m2) of ground-level retail space.  The property was purchased in January 2004, at a cost of $1.2 million.  The project's general contractor was Breslin Builders.  Digging for the building's support columns began in July 2004. Construction was expected to cost $60 million.  Crews were preparing to begin the structure's foundation work in October 2004.  Occupancy was initially expected for early December 2005.  Occupancy was later expected for February 2006,  although construction was ongoing in April 2006.  In May 2006, an automobile dealership – for Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Rolls-Royces – was being planned for the building's ground floor, while residents were expected to begin occupying the building later that month.  In December 2007, a lease was signed for the Dust Contemporary Fine Art gallery to occupy a 1,300 sq ft (120 m2) space inside Soho Lofts.  The gallery opened two months later.  The Globe Salon was the first business to occupy Soho Lofts' commercial space, beginning in July 2008; the rest of the space remained vacant because of the poor economy.  By 2009, the Naomi Arin Contemporary Art gallery was operating inside Soho Lofts.  In January 2011, a small grocery store, Resnicks Grocery, opened inside a 1,400 sq ft (130 m2) space inside Soho Lofts that was previously occupied by an art gallery.  A lounge, known as The Lady Silvia, opened inside Soho Lofts in July 2011.  The Amanda Harris Gallery opened inside Soho Lofts in January 2012.  The Contemporary Arts Center later operated from within one of Soho Loft's ground-level spaces.  The Ogden was initially opened as the Streamline Tower,  built on the 1-acre (0.40 ha) property of the demolished Golden Inn motel in downtown Las Vegas.  Streamline Tower opened in May 2008, with 275 condominium units in a 21-story tower, although sales suffered as a result of the weak local and national economy.  The units were converted into apartments in 2010,  and the property was renamed as The Ogden a year later. In 2014, The Ogden was converted back into condominiums.  The Platinum is a 17-story,  255-unit condo hotel built on 1.7 acres (0.69 ha) of land, previously occupied by a motel and located east of the Las Vegas Strip.  The project was developed by Platinum Condominium Development, LLC, a joint venture of Diversified Real Estate Concepts, Inc. and Marcus Hotels and Resorts.  Construction began in 2005,  and the project opened in October 2006.  The Signature is a condo hotel located near the MGM Grand Las Vegas resort. The project was jointly developed by MGM Mirage and Turnberry Associates, and opened in 2006, on the former land of MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park. In April 2002, businessmen Phil Ruffin and Donald Trump announced plans to build Trump Tower Las Vegas, a $300 million, 60-story condominium tower with 300 units. Construction had been expected to begin within seven months.  Groundbreaking took place in July 2005,  after the project had been revised to include a hotel.  The 64-floor tower was constructed behind the Las Vegas Strip's New Frontier Hotel and Casino, on 3 acres (1.2 ha) of property that had been used as part of the New Frontier's rear parking lot.  The project ultimately cost $500 million,   and opened in 2008,  with a total of 1,282 condominium units and hotel rooms. A nearly identical second tower had been planned,  but was postponed due to poor economic conditions.  Construction of the second tower had been expected to begin in late 2008.  Turnberry Place was announced in June 1998,   and consists of four 40-story condominium towers located east of the Las Vegas Strip. Turnberry Towers is a two-tower property near the Las Vegas Strip. The towers stand 45 stories and contain a total of 636 units. Vdara, opened in December 2008, is a condo hotel within CityCenter that includes 1,495 units. Veer Towers, located within CityCenter, consists of twin towers that stand 37 stories high and include 670 condominium units. The towers opened in July 2010. The St. Regis Residences at the Venetian Palazzo, Las Vegas is an unfinished condominium tower located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Palazzo and Venetian resorts.  Construction began in early 2007,   and the opening was eventually scheduled for March 2010.  The tower was to stand 50 stories,  with a total of 398 condominium units. The project was expected to cost $600 million,  but construction was indefinitely suspended in November 2008 because of the Great Recession.  In April 2014, the project was no longer expected to be finished as a condominium tower because of uncertainty in the high-end, high-rise residential market. Up to that point, several other options had been considered regarding the building's future use.  In 2004, the Atlanta-based Ambling Development Company held meetings with mayor Oscar Goodman, councilman Lawrence Weekly, and other city officials regarding a condominium project.   Ambling was planning a complex of three 28-story condominium towers with a total of 840 units, to be built at a cost of $330 million on 16.8 acres (6.8 ha) at the northwest corner of Alta Drive and South Martin Luther King Boulevard.   The land had previously been occupied by a gas station, which was later burned down during a riot.  Ambling invested $2 million to acquire the land, to open a Las Vegas office, and to perform initial design work. Months later, on December 15, 2004, the City Council voted unanimously to reject Ambling's project because of opposition from nearby residents, who believed that the tall modern-style glass buildings would not go well with the neighborhood's southwestern theme and its 600 single-story houses.    Residents also believed the new project would create traffic problems and overcrowd nearby schools. Weekly criticized city staff members, alleging that they misled Ambling to believe that their project was guaranteed to be approved by the City Council.     The manager of the city's Economic Development division, who had worked with Ambling on their project, resigned from his position two days after the vote.   In June 2005, Ambling was unanimously approved by the City Council for a smaller version of its initial project to be constructed on the same property. The new project was to consist of three nine-story buildings and one five-story building, with retail space and a total of 664 condominium units. The project was to be built in phases, with construction planned to begin at the end of 2005, and the first phase being potentially completed in 2007.  The project was ultimately cancelled due to further opposition from nearby residents. The land was subsequently sold in February 2006.  By December 2004, the newly created high-rise development division of Prudential Americana Group Realtors was planning Aqua Blue, a luxury condominium-hotel project. Aqua Blue was the division's flagship project, with gross sales expected to exceed $550 million.  The project was approved that year, and was to be constructed east of the Las Vegas Strip near the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane,  on 3.6 acres (1.5 ha) of property  that was occupied at the time by a Super 8 motel, located adjacent to the Ellis Island Casino & Brewery. The motel was to be demolished to make room for Aqua Blue, while Ellis Island would continue operations but would receive an exterior renovation to match the appearance of the new project.  Aqua Blue would have included a 12,000 sq ft (1,100 m2) casino that would be operated by Gary Ellis, who owned the Ellis Island. Ellis decided to become involved in the Aqua Blue after meeting with the project's developer, Michael Peterson, who had developed and owned condominiums and restaurants in Wisconsin and Chicago.  Aqua Blue was to stand 46 stories,  and would have included 825 units,  priced between $399,000 and $1,125,000.  The project's expected cost was $600 million.  Construction was expected to begin in fall 2005, and its opening was expected to occur by fall 2007.  In January 2005, retired basketball player Michael Jordan became involved in Aqua Blue.   Jordan was to open two restaurants at Aqua Blue: Michael Jordon's Steak House and Michael Jordon's 23 Sportcafe.  Jordan would also open the 65,000 sq ft (6,000 m2) Michael Jordan Athletic Center inside the new building.   In June 2005, Peterson began considering offers for the property. After three weeks, Peterson announced on June 29, 2005, that the project had been cancelled due to a large increase of proposed nearby condominium projects and a lack of buyers to sustain the increase. The property was sold to David Schwartz and his Chicago-based company, Waterton Associates, with plans to keep the Super 8 motel operational.   Champions of Las Vegas was to consist of a 21-story tower with 844 condominium units that would be priced at approximately $1 million each.  The project was being planned in 1995,  and by March 1998, it had received approval by the Clark County Commission. The project was to be located near the southern entrance to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. As of 1998, the project was scheduled for completion in 2006, because of the necessity to perform extensive infrastructure work on the property.  The Charlie Palmer Hotel was announced by chef Charlie Palmer in April 2006. The project was to include a 35-story boutique condo hotel with 400 to 500 rooms, and initially was to be built on the three-acre site of the Golden Palm Hotel, at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and Dean Martin Drive. The $400 million project was scheduled to break ground later in 2006, with completion expected for mid-2008.  The project's proposed location was later changed to Symphony Park in downtown Las Vegas,  with the condominium aspect removed.  In March 2005, the Seattle-based Northwest Resource Management Group filed plans with the city of Las Vegas for Cielo Vista, a 25-story condominium tower with 414 units, as well as 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m2) of commercial space on the first floor. Above the first floor would be six floors used for parking, and 18 floors for condominium units. The project was designed by Las Vegas-based MWT Ofra, and was scheduled for a vote by the Las Vegas Planning Commission and the City Council in May and June 2005, respectively.   Cielo Vista would have been the company's first Las Vegas project. The company had previously developed single-family residential homes in California, as well as an 11-story building in Seattle. Cielo Vista was to be built at the southeast corner of East Washington Avenue and Veterans Memorial Drive, west of Cashman Field and north of downtown Las Vegas, on a 2.8-acre site that the company purchased for $1.2 million on March 29, 2005.   A local expert believed that the project was in a bad location: an older part of Las Vegas with little development.  The area was also known for a high rate of crime and homelessness; Steve Hartley, a partner for Northwest Resource Management Group, said the company had previously developed a project in California that had similar demographics.  The low price of the land allowed the company to sell condominium units ranging from 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) to 2,000 sq ft (190 m2) at a starting price of $295,000, and exceeding $500,000. Condominium units in the project could be reserved for a refundable fee of $5,000, compared to a $25,000 fee that was being charged by some other high-rise condominium projects in the city. Construction was expected to begin in late 2005, as long as the project received approval from the city. Completion was expected by early 2007.   The project received unanimous approval from the Las Vegas Planning Commission in June 2005. At the time, 155 units had been reserved.  Three months after the announcement of Cielo Vista, Northwest Resource suspended sales and delayed the project because of rising construction costs, choosing instead to wait until it was further along in the construction cost process before beginning sales; 300 units had been reserved up to that point, and some buyers received a refund. As final construction costs were being determined in March 2006, Eric Radovich, Northwest Resource's managing director of public relations and marketing, said, "We're getting close to a number and we think it's real. We didn't feel we could tell people truthfully what the product was going to cost and whether we can afford to build it."  The project never materialized.  In January 2005, Diversified Real Estate Group and Downtown Redevelopment Group announced Club Renaissance,  a 60-story condominium tower with either 906 units  or 950 units.  Mayor Oscar Goodman noted the $150,000 starting price for condominiums in the project, saying, "I like the affordability of it."  Philippe Pageau-Goyette, the president of Diversified Real Estate Group, planned for Club Renaissance to be the least-expensive high-rise condominium in the Las Vegas Valley, and said 95 percent of the project's inhabitants would be local residents: "I don't want to go after luxury, I want to go after locals. As of right now, we have no competition in the locals affordable market. A lot of guys are doing luxury."  The project would include 20,000 sq ft (1,900 m2) of retail space, located on the first floor.  Other amenities on the lower floors were to include restaurants, a food market, child day care, and dry cleaners.  An additional 78,000 sq ft (7,200 m2) of office space would be located on the 13th and 14th floors, with condominium units beginning on floor 15. The top two floors, 58 and 59, were to include a private club and fitness center. The project was planned for the southeast corner of Casino Center Boulevard and Bonneville Street in downtown Las Vegas. Presale reservations were expected to begin in March 2005.  At the time of its announcement, the project was reported to cost $400 million to construct.  The cost was later reported as being $250 million.  The project received final approval in February 2005.  Several historic railroad cottages located on the property were expected to be relocated.   The tower, expected to be 702 feet high, was one of the taller high-rise projects to be approved for downtown Las Vegas.  Sales began in October 2005, at which point the starting price had increased into the $400,000 range because of rises in steel, concrete and labor costs. As of February 2006, the cottages remained on the site, with little progress on Club Renaissance. Gilles Pageau, a Canadian developer and the uncle of Philippe Pageau-Goyette, said he had invested $60 million of his money into the project and that he had been offered an additional $400 million from various banks to cover the construction costs. Pageau said at the time that the project would still be built.  In February 2007, Goodman gave the developers two weeks to demonstrate to the Las Vegas City Council that the project was nearing construction; otherwise, he said the approval for the project would be revoked. Leanord Mussina, a spokesman for the project, had told the City Council, "We're just a victim of construction costs. Financing has dried up to a large extent for Las Vegas. We're redesigning, trying to value engineer, to do something affordable. We're in negotiations with some large construction companies to joint venture at this point, because that's the only way to finance it." Mussina estimated that the project could take up to a year before construction started, to which Goodman responded, "I'm not interested in a year. I've been to three groundbreakings there so far and haven't seen ground broke." Approximately $8 million or $9 million had already been spent on the project up to that point.  The City Council ultimately granted the project a six-month extension. At the time, part of the property that was to be used for the project was in foreclosure.   In March 2007, the project was purchased out of foreclosure by Los Angeles architect Mark Vaghei and engineer Nabih Yousseff for nearly $3.5 million. The pair began redesigning the project to be smaller.  Club Renaissance ultimately did not materialize.  Located on the Las Vegas Strip and originally known as Fontainebleau Las Vegas. Construction began in 2007, and the resort was to include a casino, 2,871 hotel rooms, and 1,018 condominium units.  Construction on the $2.9 billion project ceased in 2009, the year of its planned opening. Investment firms Witkoff Group and New Valley LLC purchased the unfinished resort in 2017.  In 2018, Witkoff and Marriott International announced a partnership to open the renamed project as The Drew Las Vegas in 2020. The resort will include a casino and three hotels totaling nearly 4,000 rooms, with the condominium aspect removed from the project.  In November 2004, Jorge M. Pérez and The Related Companies were planning Icon, a twin-tower condominium project to be built on 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) of property,  located on the Las Vegas Strip at the northeast corner of Convention Center Drive.  The land was located east of a Ross department store,  and the project would be built behind the store.  Related purchased the vacant land in January 2004, at a cost of $15 million. The land had previously been owned by Luke Brugnara, who also owned the adjacent Silver City Casino.  Initially, Icon was to include two 47-story towers, standing 500 feet, with a total of 502 luxury condominiums, all facing the Las Vegas Strip.  Two-thirds of the project's units would include views on both sides of the buildings for views of the Las Vegas Strip and nearby mountains.  Unit prices would start at $500,000. The $30 million project was designed by Bernardo Fort Brescia of Arquitectonica,   which teamed up with interior designer Yabu Pushelberg for the project.  Construction on the first tower was to begin in 2005, with work on the second tower scheduled to begin after the first was completed.  By April 2005, the project had been redesigned after Lorenzo Doumani, developer of the adjacent Majestic Las Vegas, raised concerns about the Icon blocking views for tenants at the Majestic, among other issues. By that time, M.J. Dean had signed on as the general contractor for Icon, and the first tower was expected to take 18 to 24 months to construct. At that point, the towers were expected to be 48 stories high, with a total of 514 units.  The Clark County Commission approved Icon in April 2005, despite objections from Doumani, who then filed lawsuits against Related.    Later that month, a lawsuit was filed against Related by Sasson Hallier Properties LLC, developer of Panorama Towers. The two companies had previously negotiated a possible joint venture for the Panorama Towers project, and Sasson Hallier provided various database information – including contracts, financials, and marketing information – to Related as part of the negotiations. Ultimately, negotiations failed, and Sasson Hallier alleged that Related kept the database information to develop its Icon project.  In January 2006, Related announced the cancellation of Icon despite that buyers had signed contracts for most of the project's 514 units. Related stated, "In the several months needed to resolve lawsuits and finally be in a position to break ground, construction prices had increased so drastically that after pursuing every possible way to move forward, Related was unable to build Icon based on original pricing without seriously impacting the integrity of the development." A decrease in high-rise sales was also a factor in the cancellation.    In May 2006, a lawsuit was filed by buyers against Related, stating that the company had no right to cancel purchase agreements for Icon's units.  On April 1, 2004, reservations opened for floors 4 to 38 of a 45-story, 510-foot condominium-hotel tower known as Krystle Sands. The project was officially announced in May 2004 by F.W. "Freddie" Schinz, a Florida developer.   The Krystle Sands project was to replace the 105-room Algiers Hotel, located on a 3.6-acre site on the Las Vegas Strip, adjacent to the Turnberry Place complex and to the former site of the El Rancho Hotel and Casino. At the time of the announcement, 70 percent of the project's 600 units had been reserved.  Units would range from 852 sq ft (79.2 m2) to 1,329 sq ft (123.5 m2), and would range in price from $400,000 to more than $700,000. Although the tower was to be 45 stories high, it would skip the 13th floor.  The tower's penthouses, starting at $1 million,  would be located from floors 39 to 44, and would range from 2,400 sq ft (220 m2) to more than 3,000 sq ft (280 m2). Restaurants and retail were planned for the tower's first and second floors. The third floor was to consist of a recreation center and pool for condominium owners and renters. A rooftop restaurant was also planned. JMA Architecture Studios was the architect. Perini Construction Company was to be the general contractor. Krystle Sands was to cost $400 million,  and was to begin construction in October 2004,  with an opening in summer 2006.  Schinz paid more than $26.2 million for the land, and closed on the deal in July 2004.  The project was to be handled by Krystle Sands LLC, a limited liability company formed by Schinz in Florida. The company name was later changed to Krystle Towers LLC.  In March 2005, Schinz sold Krystle Towers LLC and the property for $97 million to Turnberry Associates, which owned the Turnberry Place complex and the former land of the El Rancho.     To avoid paying a real estate transfer tax, Turnberry purchased the Krystle Sands project in addition to the property on which it was to be built.  Turnberry announced the cancellation of Krystle Sands to buyers in a letter on March 25, 2005, stating that it was unable to receive construction financing to build the project.  Shortly after the cancellation was announced, some buyers of the project's condominium units filed five lawsuits against Schinz, Krystle Sands LLC, Krystle Towers LLC, and Fidelity National Title Agency of Nevada. One lawsuit sought class-action status. Each lawsuit alleged that Schinz never planned to build the tower and was in the process of seeking a buyer for the property while selling the project's 600 units, in an alleged attempt to make what would ultimately become a $70 million profit. Other claims in the lawsuits included allegations of fraud, deceptive trade practices and civil conspiracy. Plaintiffs sought at least $70 million in damages, as well as the return of escrow money to the buyers. One lawsuit alleged that Turnberry had made false statements regarding its reason for cancelling Krystle Sands, noting that four days earlier, Turnberry had announced that it received construction financing for a separate 636-unit tower at its Turnberry Place complex.  A class action lawsuit consisting of 150 buyers was underway by June 2006, alleging that Turnberry had an obligation to provide condominium units to buyers who signed purchase and sale agreements and placed 10 percent of the purchase price in escrow. Turnberry stated that all deposits made on Krystle Sands units had been returned and that the company had no intention of building the project. A lawyer representing the group alleged that Turnberry lied to buyers about being unable to obtain construction financing for Krystle Sands as part of an attempt to build the Fontainebleau resort on the property: "They had to figure a way to lie to buyers and not tell the truth that they're going to jettison the project to build Fountainbleu [sic]." The case was expected to go to trial in March 2007.  Announced in March 2005, as a joint project between Centra Properties and The Related Companies.  The $3 billion Las Ramblas project was planned as a 25-acre (10 ha) mixed-use complex that would have included 11 high-rise buildings, which would be used for hotel rooms and condominiums.   with a total of 4,400 units.  The complex, designed by Arquitectonica,  would also include a small casino and up to 500,000 sq ft (46,000 m2) of retail stores.   Las Ramblas was to replace the 996-unit Harbor Island apartments, as well as 14 four-plex buildings, all located east of the Las Vegas Strip on Harmon Avenue.  In August 2005, actor George Clooney and nightclub developer Rande Gerber announced that they would invest in the project.  Because of a declining market and rising construction costs, Las Ramblas was cancelled in 2006, and the property was subsequently sold to Edge Resorts, which planned to construct a boutique hotel district to accompany their proposed W resort, located on adjacent land.   Las Ramblas was to begin construction in September 2006, with its first phase scheduled to open in June 2007.  Las Vegas Plaza was planned as a multibillion-dollar resort on the site of the demolished New Frontier hotel and casino. The project was to include 2,600 condominium units. The project never materialized, and in 2014, the property was sold to Crown Resorts, which planned to build the Alon Las Vegas on the site. Liberty Tower was announced in June 2004,  as a 21-story building to be built on 0.68 acres (0.28 ha) at 1801 South Las Vegas Boulevard,  at the southern end of downtown Las Vegas.  The project would be located north of the Stratosphere tower  and near the Las Vegas Arts District,  on land that was purchased for $900,000.  The project was designed by JMA Architecture Studios and was to be developed by Harvard Securities of Australia. Groundbreaking was expected by November 2004, with completion occurring a year and a half later at a cost of $35 million.  In August 2004, the 21-story project was approved by the Las Vegas City Council to include 18 condominium units, 116 apartments, and 2,200 sq ft (200 m2) of ground-level retail space.   That month, it was announced that Australian developers Joseph Di Mauro and Victor Altomare would finance the project, which they also planned to do for The Summit.  By January 2005, the closed Holy Cow Casino and Brewery (the planned future site of The Summit) had been converted into a $1 million sales office for Liberty Tower. At that time, construction on the project was expected to begin in July 2005, with a cost of $100 million.  Construction of Liberty Tower never began. In December 2005, Altomare sold the property for $5.5 million to Stratorise South, a limited liability company based in Nevada.  That month, plans were announced for a $105 million condominium project called Monument to be built on the property. The project was to be 22 stories, with 236 units, and was to be developed by Constellation Property Group, an Australia-based company owned by Eugene Marchese, with financing by partner David Rifkind.  By August 2006, a new project known as Stratorise was being planned for the property. The project would stand 517 feet, and would include 45 stories. In September 2006, a hearing on the proposed project was delayed until November 1, 2006, at the request of the owner.   Majestic Las Vegas was announced in February 2004, and was to be built on the property occupied by the La Concha Motel on the Las Vegas Strip. Majestic Las Vegas initially was to consist of a 42-story tower,  although the project later went through several redesigns, before being cancelled in 2007.   In August 2004, Chris DelGuidice, who was developing Vegas Grand through his Del American company, announced plans for a second project to be known as One Las Vegas. The project would include a 565-foot 50-story condominium tower with 542 units, to be built at a cost of $500 million on 10 acres of land on Flamingo Road, east of the Palms Casino Resort.   DelGuidice negotiated for a year and a half to purchase the property.  Early design plans included a 400-foot waterfall, rooftop hot tubs, a dance floor, a gourmet grocer, restaurants, a 20,000 sq ft (1,900 m2) pool with cabanas, a 15,000 sq ft (1,400 m2) health spa on the 35th floor, valet and housekeeping services, 24-hour concierge, a pet park, and a business center. Sales were expected to begin in early 2005, with prices starting at $500,000 and exceeding $10 million.  Groundbreaking was reported to be a year away.  The following month, construction was scheduled to begin in summer 2005.  The project was to be financed by Lehman Brothers,  with a loan of up to $79.45 million.  Lehman Brothers also financed Vegas Grand.  Del American closed escrow on the property in January 2005, at a cost of $50 million.  In February 2005, Amland Development took legal action against Del American to continue using the name for its own condominium project, also known as One Las Vegas. Amland Development won the right to use the name.   In November 2005, Del American announced that the project would be named Vegas 888.  The sales office for Vegas 888 closed in July 2006, at which point the property was reportedly for sale.  Approximately $250 million worth of condominium units had been presold, with approximately $75 million spent on the project, most of which came from Lehman Brothers.  In August 2006, Del American announced intentions to instead build a mixed-use resort, hotel and casino on the property.  The new project remained un-built. In 2007, the property was foreclosed and acquired by Lehman Brothers. Christopher Beavor, a Las Vegas investor, purchased the property in October 2016, at a cost of $13.5 million. Beavor's initial, unfinalized plans included retail space, a five-story apartment complex, and a hotel, with construction expected to begin in six to seven months.  The Opus Las Vegas was approved in November 2004,  and was announced on March 25, 2005, at a conference that was related to high-rise development and was held at the Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas Strip.  The $550 million project would have consisted of two 50-story towers with 350 condominium units each,  for a total of 700.  The project, to be developed by The Congress Group of Boston, was planned for a 4.4 acres (1.8 ha) property that was presently occupied by the city's Scandia Family Fun Center,  located west of the Las Vegas Strip at 2900 Sirius Avenue.  Up to that point, The Congress Group had spent a year determining construction costs. Scandia and The Congress Group agreed to delay the initial escrow closing date of May 2005, so that final costs for the new project could be completed. As part of the agreement, the Scandia fun center would remain open through the summer, its busiest period, before its scheduled closing date on September 6, 2005.   At the time of the announcement, the property was in the process of being sold by Highrise Partners to The Congress Group for an undisclosed amount of money, with escrow expected to close in September 2005. Groundbreaking was expected to occur in the first quarter of 2006, with the first units available for occupancy in spring 2008. Opus Las Vegas would have featured 1,400 parking spaces spread across four levels, along with 20,000 sq ft (1,900 m2) of residential retail stores. A 3 acres (1.2 ha) pool would be located on the property's six-story deck. Floor plans would have ranged from 800 sq ft (74 m2) 4,200 sq ft (390 m2), and would have come in one-, two-, and three-bedroom designs, while the top two floors would be occupied by two-story penthouses.   Prices would have ranged from $200,000 to more than $4 million.  Developer Michael Jabara said the project would offer "a metropolitan lifestyle for people who really want it all, great views, easy access to nearby neighborhood amenities, but at the same time it's an urban project."  In June 2005, Scandia said their fun center would remain open as the property had not been sold.  On September 7, 2005,  Fisher Brothers purchased the property occupied by Scandia, as well as nearby land.  In December 2006, Station Casinos and Fisher Brothers announced a joint venture to develop a mixed-use project on up to 52 acres (21 ha) of land, including the property of the closed Scandia fun center,   which was demolished in 2007. As of July 2007, the mixed-use project was to be developed on nearly 90 acres (36 ha) of land, which had been zoned for several thousand high-rise condominium or hotel units, and would have connected to Station's nearby Palace Station resort.  Details about the new project's construction and costs were still undetermined at that time.  In 2011, a business named Dig This opened on the vacant property, allowing customers to take control of an excavator on the dirt lot.     A casino and hotel and condo resort with more than 1,800 units that was planned by Royal Palms Las Vegas, a subsidiary of Royal Palms Communities.   The project was to replace the Klondike Hotel and Casino at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip,   beside the Las Vegas welcome sign.  The resort was approved in October 2006,  but an investor pulled out of the project in August 2007, and the land was put up for sale in May 2008.  Pinnacle was to include 1,100 condominium units in two 36-story gold glass towers that would be adjoined by three sky bridges, which would contain units themselves.     Plans were announced for Pinnacle in March 2005. At that time, the mixed-use project would include two 40-story condominium towers, standing 410 feet, to be built on a 12-acre (4.9 ha) property at the southwest corner of West Tropicana Avenue and Cameron Avenue, across from The Orleans hotel-casino.  The land was occupied at that time by the Falconi Honda automobile dealership,  which closed in October 2004.  The property had been owned by Angelo Falconi since 1987.  The project was being planned by The Falcon Group, an automobile dealership firm; Elysium Enterprises, a local consulting firm; and Praxis Resources Inc., a development company based in Pittsburgh. Initial plans included retail, office, and restaurant space, and between 592 and 1,184 condominium units, which would range from 706 sq ft (65.6 m2) to 1,235 sq ft (114.7 m2), with prices between $295,000 and $1.2 million. Condominium buyers would be given the option of combining units into a single unit.  The search for a general contractor was underway by November 2005,  with Turner Construction ultimately being chosen.  In March 2006, Falcon chose Youngblood Wucherer Sparer Architects to design the project, for which the height had been reduced to 36 stories. The project's cost, at that time, was $850 million.  In June 2006, The Falcon Group began negotiations with Berkshire Capital Financial of New York for a $550 million loan, while Pinnacle's sales office was scheduled to open later that month.  Berkshire provided $50 million in mezzanine lending.  Groundbreaking was initially scheduled for fall 2006.  The Falconi Honda dealership was demolished in July 2007, to make room for the new project. Up to that time, Falcon Group had spent two years to plan the project and to obtain entitlements and zoning. At the time, the property for Pinnacle was valued at approximately $8 million per acre. By the time of demolition, Marnell Corrao Associates had been chosen as the new general contractor. Groundbreaking was scheduled for later in 2007, with the opening planned for spring 2010. Approximately 2,000 construction jobs would be created by the project, which would ultimately employee 500 people upon opening. At that time, condominium prices were from the $400,000 range to more than $1.4 million. Amenities were to include a 3-acre (1.2 ha) wet deck, a movie theater, a health and fitness center, restaurants, a spa, and an office and business center. Michael Bellon, managing partner for The Falcon Group, said, "We wanted to create something that single-handedly redefined the standard of Las Vegas condominium living."  Later in summer 2007, Marnell Corrao was replaced by Dick Pacific Construction, which also became a partner in the project.  In October 2007, after repeated delays, groundbreaking was announced to begin by mid-2008.  In January 2008, Green Cable LLC filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Pinnacle condominium buyers. Green Cable sued the development team for an alleged breach of contract, as construction had yet to begin after three years. The lawsuit stated that buyers initially purchased units with the belief that Pinnacle would be opened by August 2008, and sought at least $5 million in returned deposits, damages and attorney's fees. The lawsuit also alleged that the property site was contaminated with high benzene levels because of dropping ground water levels. Sam Schwartz, a principal for Green Cable, said, "Generally, we believe Pinnacle is an excellent project. At this point in time, however, due to the construction delays the project has endured, the buyers I represent, including myself, believe it is in the best interests of all the parties that we go our separate ways."  Pinnacle's sales gallery closed on February 22, 2008, and the project's cancellation was announced on March 3, 2008.  Announced in July 2005, as a joint venture between Station Casinos and developers Stephen Cloobeck and Steven Molasky. The project was to be built on the same property as the adjacent Red Rock resort,  and was known under the names "Red Rock Residences" and "The Residences at Red Rock".  The partnership dissolved in 2006, and the project was ultimately cancelled.   In 1995, Thomas Greenough relocated his bar and restaurant, Tommy Rocker's, to Dean Martin Drive, west of Interstate 15 and the Las Vegas Strip. In 2004, Greenough began receiving numerous offers from condominium developers for the one-acre lot that Tommy Rocker's occupied. Greenough, who was unable to work out a deal with potential developers that would incorporate Tommy Rocker's into any planned condominiums, later chose to build his own condominium on the property. In January 2006, Greenough received approval for a 46-story, 252-unit condominium tower, to be constructed on his property at a cost of $150 million.  The structure was to be named Rocker Tower.  The tower was expected to be the first in southern Nevada to feature a computerized automated parking structure, with the intention of saving space and decreasing pollution.  Greenough had toured Viennese parking garages as part of his research into automated-garage technology.  Greenough hoped that the building would be certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System.

The tower would have had a total of 900,000 sq ft (84,000 m2),  including 35,000 sq ft (3,300 m2) of commercial space for shops and restaurants.  Two additional towers and commercial space for the project were also planned for nearby land.   Groundbreaking was initially planned to begin in March 2005,  with completion expected by September 2006.  However, construction was delayed several times because of rising construction costs.

The tower was to begin construction in summer 2006,  at the north end of the Las Vegas Strip, on 2.17 acres (0.88 ha) of land that was occupied by the closed Holy Cow Casino and Brewery at the time.    Ivana Las Vegas had been scheduled for completion in December 2008,  but was cancelled in December 2005, due to rising construction costs.   Vegas Grand was announced by developer Del American in 2003,  and initially was to consist of 440 apartments and 440 condominiums.
