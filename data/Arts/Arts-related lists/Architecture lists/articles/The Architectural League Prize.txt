The Architectural League Prize (formerly known as The Young Architects Forum) is an annual, themed competition and series of lectures and exhibitions organized by the Architectural League of New York and its Young Architects and Designers Committee. "The Prize was established to recognize specific works of high quality and to encourage the exchange of ideas among young people who might otherwise not have a forum."
