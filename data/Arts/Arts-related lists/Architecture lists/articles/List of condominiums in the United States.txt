 A condominium or "condo" is a form of housing tenure and other real property where a specified part of a piece of real estate (usually of an apartment house) is individually owned. Use of land access to common facilities in the piece such as hallways, heating system, elevators, and exterior areas are executed under legal rights associated with the individual ownership. These rights are controlled by the association of owners that jointly represent ownership of the whole piece. The United States Census Bureau indexes information about condominiums and cooperative apartments, among other types of households, at its Survey of Market Absorption of Apartments.  As of October 2015, this compilation includes 95 metropolitan areas of the United States.  Some condominium buildings in the United States have been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In some cities in the United States, such as Lakewood, Ohio, city governments have attempted to invoke eminent domain upon residents to take over their property and enable private developers to build condominiums.  This may be done in an effort to generate more revenue by increasing property tax bases.  A housing cooperative, or co-op, is a legal entity, usually a corporation, which owns real estate, consisting of one or more residential buildings; it is one type of housing tenure. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that have many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as single family home ownership, condominiums and renting.
