Avant-garde (French pronunciation: ​[avɑ̃ ɡaʁd]) is French for "vanguard".  The term is commonly used in French, English, and German to refer to people or works that are experimental or innovative, particularly with respect to art and culture. Avant-garde represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the norm or the status quo, primarily in the cultural realm. The notion of the existence of the avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of modernism, as distinct from postmodernism. Postmodernism posits that the age of the constant pushing of boundaries is no longer with us and that avant-garde has little to no applicability in the age of Postmodern art.
