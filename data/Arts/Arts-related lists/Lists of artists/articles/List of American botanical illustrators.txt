This is a list of botanical illustrators and flower painters born in or citizens of the United States of America. It does not include European botanical illustrators active in America during the Colonial period; for information on these, see the main entry on botanical illustrators. Botanical illustrators paint or draw plants and sometimes their natural environment as well, forming a lineage where art and science meet. Some prefer to paint isolated specimen flowers while others prefer arrangements. Many botanical artists through the centuries have been active in collecting and cataloguing new species and/or in breeding plants. Some artists listed here worked primarily on botanical art, while others made it part of a wider artistic practice.
