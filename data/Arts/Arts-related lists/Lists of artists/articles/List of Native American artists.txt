This is a list of visual artists who are Native Americans in the United States. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 defines "Native American" as being enrolled in either federally recognized tribes or state recognized tribes or "an individual certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian Tribe."  This does not include non-Native American artists using Native American themes.  Additions to the list need to reference a recognized, documented source and specifically name tribal affiliation according to federal and state lists. Indigenous American artists outside the United States can be found at List of indigenous artists of the Americas. *
