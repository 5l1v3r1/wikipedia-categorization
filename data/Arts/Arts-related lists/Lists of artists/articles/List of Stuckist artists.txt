Stuckism is an international anti-conceptual art and pro-figurative painting art movement founded by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish in 1999.  The founding group in London had 13 members.  In 2000, Regan Tamanui started a group in Melbourne, Australia, and it was decided that other artists should be free to start their own groups also, named after their locality.  Stuckism has since grown into an international art movement  of 230 groups in 52 countries, as of April 2012.  This is a list of associated artists who, unless otherwise indicated, are painters.
