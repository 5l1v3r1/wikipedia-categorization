The National Medal of Arts is an award and title created by the United States Congress in 1984, for the purpose of honoring artists and patrons of the arts. A prestigious American honor, it is the highest honor specifically given for achievement in the arts conferred to an individual artist on behalf of the people. Honorees are selected by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and ceremoniously presented the award by the President of the United States.  The medal was designed for the NEA by sculptor Robert Graham. Because of the Trump administration's difficult relationship with the arts, no award has been given since 2015. In 1983, prior to the official establishment of the Medal, the following artists and patrons received a medal from President Reagan, arranged by the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities: In 1989, composer and conductor, Leonard Bernstein refused his award, allegedly due to how a federal grant to an art show on AIDS had been revoked.  In 1992, musical theatre composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim refused his award, on account of believing that the NEA had "become a victim of its own and others' political infighting and is rapidly being transformed into a conduit and a symbol of censorship and repression rather than encouragement and support."  In 1997, poet Adrienne Rich refused her award as a protest against “inconsistencies” between art and “the cynical politics” of the Clinton White House administration.
