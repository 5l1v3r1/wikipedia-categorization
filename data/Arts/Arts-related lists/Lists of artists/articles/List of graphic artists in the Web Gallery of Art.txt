The List of graphic artists in the Web Gallery of Art is a list of the named artists in the Web Gallery of Art (WGA) whose works there comprise drawings, woodcuts, etchings, engravings, mezzotints, lithographs, and watercolours. The online collection contains roughly 34,000 images by 4,000 artists, but only named artists with works labelled "graphics" in the database are listed alphabetically here. The artist's name is followed by a title of one of their graphics works and its location, which is hosted on the WGA website. For artists with more than one work in the WGA collection, or for works by unnamed or unattributed artists, see the Web Gallery of Art website or the corresponding Wikimedia Commons category. Of the 645 graphic artists in the WGA database, there are only 7 women, namely Sofonisba Anguissola, Marie-Jeanne Renard du Bos, Isabella Parasole, Diana Scultori, Elisabetta Sirani, Elisabeth Louise Vig√©e-LeBrun, and Teresa Berenice Vitelli. For the complete list of artists and their artworks in the WGA collection, the database can be downloaded as a compressed file from the website.
