The Federal Art Project (1935–43) of the Works Progress Administration was the largest of the New Deal art projects.  As many as 10,000 artists  were employed to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, Index of American Design documentation, theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts.  Artists were paid $23.60 a week; tax-supported patrons and institutions paid only for materials.  The Federal Art Project also operated community art centers throughout the country where artists worked and educated others.  Artists who worked only for comparable but distinctly separate New Deal art projects administered by the United States Department of the Treasury[a] are not listed.
