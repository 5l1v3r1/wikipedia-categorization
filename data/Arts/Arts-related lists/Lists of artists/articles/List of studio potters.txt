A studio potter is one who is a modern artist or artisan, who either works alone or in a small group, producing unique items of pottery in small quantities, typically with all stages of manufacture carried out by themselves.   Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware, cookware and non-functional wares such as sculpture.  Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium.
