Normally the back-stories of a few champions state about beings coming from another realm whether summoned or invited by summoners (such as a character based on <a href=\"/wiki/Anubis\" title=\"Anubis\">Anubis</a> named Nasus being pulled from his home planet into Runeterra), or by beings crossing inter-dimensional rifts to arrive in Runeterra (such as void creatures crossing a space anomaly from a lost city named Icathia).</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Legacy_of_Kain\" title=\"Legacy of Kain\">Legacy of Kain</a></i></li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Lego_Dimensions\" title=\"Lego Dimensions\">Lego Dimensions</a></i>, Lord Vortech torn rifts into all of the LEGO worlds (and drifted the all of the LEGO greats to planet Earth).</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Lost_Odyssey\" title=\"Lost Odyssey\">Lost Odyssey</a></i>, four <a href=\"/wiki/Immortality\" title=\"Immortality\">immortal</a> protagonists, and one immortal antagonist, are sent from a parallel universe in danger of collapse to observe the game universe's residents and return after a millennium (one year in the parallel universe).

In certain levels the player will appear before the release of the creature, and can then attempt to stop it. Every few levels, usually at the end of a chapter, the player would find himself in a surreal \"dream world\", in which his surroundings had little to no relation to the W'rkncacnter or even his original reality at all. It is suspected that these levels are not universes at all, but in fact a dreaming interlude before the player reaches his actual destination (this is debatable however since the player can be killed in these levels like any other). After the player succeeds in trapping the W'rkncacnter in a gigantic gravitational field, he is \"freed\" from the control of the artificial intelligences that had previously governed nearly every one of his objectives, and subsequently teleports to another reality, at which point the game ends. It is unknown what reality the player goes to next, but it is assumed that he is using his new freedom to explore various universes at his own leisure.</li>\n<li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Metroid_Prime_2:_Echoes\" title=\"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></i> features the planet Aether, which is struck by a meteor.

Most tribes, however, prefer to utilize other means of transportation and warfare \u2013 dinosaurs. As discovered by three modern-day scientists who are trapped in ParaWorld, dinosaurs never existed on our Earth, and all the bones found by archaeologists have somehow crossed over through the portals.
