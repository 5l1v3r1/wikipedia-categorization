The following is a list of the first known appearances of various superhero fictional characters and teams. A superhero (also known as a "super hero" or "super-hero") is a fictional character "of unprecedented physical prowess dedicated to acts of derring-do in the public interest."  Since the debut of Superman in 1938 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, stories of superheroes — ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas — have dominated American comic books and crossed over into other media. A female superhero is sometimes called a "superheroine." By most definitions, characters need not have actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although sometimes terms such as "costumed crimefighters"  are used to refer to those without such powers who have many other common traits of superheroes.

However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was reinvented as a crime-fighter with a disguise, secret lair, and gadgets, hallmarks of superheroes.  Despite its short run, it's widely seen as the earliest superhero fiction comic. Often cited as perhaps the earliest superhero akin to those to become popularized through American comic books.
