Marv meets a mysterious and very beautiful woman at Kadie's bar. The woman seduces Marv much to his surprise and delight, since he doesn't usually attract women due to scars from his many years as a street fighter. Marv wakes up after a one-night stand to discover Goldie, the woman he had just met and had sex with, has been killed in the night. When he hears sirens of the police drawing near (long before anyone but he and the killer could know what had happened) he realizes that he is being framed by someone with a lot of money and influence in Basin City.

It chronicles Dwight's attempts to rescue Ava Lord, his former fianc\u00e9e, from her husband and servant, who she says are <a href=\"/wiki/Sadism_and_Masochism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sadism and Masochism\">sadistically</a> torturing her.

That night, he receives a call from a woman named Ava, asking him to meet her at a seedy bar called Kadie's Club Pecos. Dwight is suspicious of her, as Ava broke his heart four years ago by running off with another richer man, but he agrees to meet her anyway. Marv is also there and greets Dwight. Ava arrives late (as she often used to) and tries to persuade Dwight to take her back, claiming that her life is \"a living Hell\"; Dwight refuses to listen. Just then, Manute, Ava's husband's valet, arrives and takes Ava away. Dwight goes home, but cannot sleep. He decides to check up on Ava and her new husband, Damien Lord.\n</p><p>He hops a fence and, using his photography equipment, scopes out the estate and, in particular, Ava, who is swimming in the nude. He is discovered and claims that he is simply a <a href=\"/wiki/Voyeurism\" title=\"Voyeurism\">Peeping Tom</a>. Manute, who seemingly doesn't recognize him from the bar, beats him brutally before throwing him from a car into the street. Dwight calls Agamemnon for a ride home and they stop several times for fast food.\n</p><p>As Dwight arrives home, he finds his <a href=\"/wiki/Ford_Mustang\" title=\"Ford Mustang\">Ford Mustang</a> returned and his door unlocked. In his bedroom is a nude Ava. Following a heated argument, they eventually reconcile and make love. Manute arrives and violently beats naked Dwight. Dwight is knocked out of his upper story apartment window to the street below, where he blacks out momentarily. He awakens to see Manute driving off with Ava.\n</p><p>Determined to rescue her, Dwight arrives at Kadie\u2019s, where Marv is in the middle of a squabble with some out-of-town punks. One of them pulls a gun on Marv, who knocks him flat; the rest quickly scatter. Dwight convinces Marv, over several drinks and whilst watching <a href=\"/wiki/Nancy_Callahan\" title=\"Nancy Callahan\">Nancy</a> dance, to help him storm Damien's estate. As they approach the mansion, Dwight insists Marv leave the punk's gun, which Marv has procured, in the car. Marv tackles the guards as a distraction and eventually takes on Manute, ripping his right eye out and beating him savagely.\n</p><p>With Manute and the guards occupied, Dwight makes his way to Damien. When he finds him in his office, he beats him to death. As Dwight begins to realize what he has done, Ava appears, and explains how Dwight was all a part of her plan to get Damien murdered so she could inherit his estate. She shoots Dwight six times, including once in the head. Dwight once again falls out of a window and is picked up by Marv. Upon Dwight's insistence, Marv drives him to Old Town, where Dwight has his old flame, Gail, help him. The girls of Old Town perform surgery on Dwight's multiple bullet wounds, then ask him to leave. He convinces Gail and Miho, a deadly assassin he saved three years prior, to let him stay, and they operate further on him.\n</p><p>Two detectives following up on Damien Lord's death, Mort and Bob, talk to Ava. She claims that Dwight was a <a href=\"/wiki/Stalking\" title=\"Stalking\">stalker</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Psychopath\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Psychopath\">psychopath</a> who killed Damien out of jealousy. They believe her story, and Mort starts sleeping with her. They interrogate Agamemnon, who tells how Dwight is an upright man who went clean after being a wild <a href=\"/wiki/Alcoholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alcoholic\">alcoholic</a> with a short temper in his younger days. When they speak with Dwight's <a href=\"/wiki/Landlord\" title=\"Landlord\">landlady</a>, she tells about letting Ava in and the resulting loud noises of the fight the night of Damien's murder. Bob doubts Ava considerably now, while Mort, who is still sleeping with her, becomes more on-edge towards his partner. This culminates with Mort killing Bob, then committing suicide. (On an unrelated note, during the scene in which Mort kills Bob, while they are driving in the car you can clearly see Wendy and Marv drive past them, presumably on their way to butcher <a href=\"/wiki/Roark_family\" title=\"Roark family\">Kevin</a>.)\n</p><p>Meanwhile, Dwight is recovering from his near-fatal wounds and calls Ava to inform her he's coming for her soon. Ava, with her late husband's financial assets, is joining her corporation with the mob boss Wallenquist. Unaffected by Ava's flirting, he warns her not to underestimate him again and tells her to tie up her loose ends with Dwight; he has someone arriving from Phoenix soon to meet her about that.\n</p><p>Dwight (with his new face), accompanied by Gail and Miho, poses as Wallenquist's man from Phoenix. Inside Ava's estate, however, Manute sees past the new face and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .25 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims shakily at Dwight as Ava grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute in his shoulder. Manute falls through a window and, upon landing, is stabbed in the arms by Miho, pinning him to the ground. Ava then tries to get Dwight to kill him, telling him that Manute had her under mind control to manipulate her and Damien and that it would be a cruel irony if he killed her now. Dwight finally sees through all the lies and kills Ava.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Babe_Wore_Red_and_Other_Stories\"><i>The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sin_City_yarns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>First published November 1994, <i>The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories</i> is a publication of short stories:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"And Behind Door Number Three...\" (4 pages long)</li>\n<li>\"The Customer Is Always Right\" (3 pages long)</li>\n<li>\"The Babe Wore Red\" (23 pages long) It reprints a serial run in <i>Previews</i>.</li></ul>\n<p>\"And Behind Door Number Three...\" is a short story about Gail and Wendy (who's now wearing Marv's necklace) setting a trap for a man they suspect is 'carving up' girls in Old Town.\n</p><p>The enigmatic \"Cowboy\" is captured by the allure of Wendy and subsequently shot and tied up by Gail. Although the Cowboy is willing to confess to the cops, the girls have other plans and invite Miho to finish the job.\n</p><p>\"The Customer Is Always Right\" served as the opening sequence for the film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sin_City_(film)\" title=\"Sin City (film)\">Sin City</a></i>, which featured <a href=\"/wiki/Josh_Hartnett\" title=\"Josh Hartnett\">Josh Hartnett</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Marley_Shelton\" title=\"Marley Shelton\">Marley Shelton</a>. The sequence served as the original <a href=\"/wiki/Proof_of_concept\" title=\"Proof of concept\">proof of concept</a> footage that director <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Rodriguez\" title=\"Robert Rodriguez\">Robert Rodriguez</a> filmed to convince Frank Miller to allow him to adapt <i>Sin City</i> to the silver screen.\n</p><p>The story involves an enigmatic tryst between two nameless characters; \"The Customer\" and \"The Salesman.\" They meet on the terrace of a high rise building, hinting that although they seem to be acting like strangers, they do indeed have some sort of past. It is unclear what their past involves even as they embrace in a passionate kiss.\n</p><p>A silenced gunshot stabs the night air to reveal that The Salesman has shot The Customer. The reader is led to believe that The Customer had fallen into a serious and difficult situation and, with no other feasible alternative, hired The Salesman to kill her. Later information given by Frank Miller on the commentary of the Recut &amp; Extended DVD Edition states that The Customer had an affair with a member of the mafia, and when she found out tried to break it off with him. The mafia member then swore to her that she would die in the most terrible way possible, and when it is least expected. The Customer, having connections, hires The Salesman (who is referred to as \"The Lady-Killer\") to kill her. In the comic The Salesman is the Colonel, as Miller has verified in the BLAM! section page 29 of the one-shot issue \"Sex &amp; Violence.\"\n</p><p>\"The Babe Wore Red\" centers around the character of Dwight and the murder of his friend Fargo. Dwight stumbles upon the hanging corpse of Fargo in his apartment and encounters Mr Shlubb, half of the recurring supporting duo, Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb (aka Fat Man and Little Boy).\n</p><p>He knocks out Shlubb and finds the titular character hiding in the shower. Under a barrage of sniper shots from Douglas Klump, Dwight and the Babe reach their car and speed off. Although they successfully elude the pair, Dwight refuses to let them off easy, choosing rather to head to The Farm to deal with them. In the meantime, the Babe introduces herself as a hooker named Mary, but Dwight can tell she's lying. He duels with both of them again and due to insistence from Mary decides to shoot them in the leg instead of killing them. He eventually receives a package from Fargo who had shipped it off before his untimely demise. Dwight reads up on the whole situation and realizes that Fargo was simply the scapegoat for illegal drug-related activities and had paid the ultimate price. He also receives a package from Mary. She was not a hooker, rather a nun that had flirted with temptation before ultimately deciding to dedicate her life to God.\n</p><p>The time frame for the story is given as during the time Marv spent on death row in \"The Hard Goodbye\", as noted when Dwight mentions that he had a friend on death row because of what happened at the Roark family farm.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Big_Fat_Kill\"><i>The Big Fat Kill</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sin_City_yarns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Big Fat Kill\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bfk2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/Bfk2.png/220px-Bfk2.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"342\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/Bfk2.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"257\" data-file-height=\"400\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bfk2.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Cover to <i>Sin City: The Big Fat Kill</i> #2.

Shellie is obviously scared, but is comforted by Dwight who has gotten a new face (see <i>A Dame To Kill For</i>). Dwight tells the barmaid to let the man and his ensuing entourage in, expressing confidence in his ability to 'handle them'. When the man outside threatens to break down her door, Shellie reluctantly opens it while Dwight hides in the bathroom.

It is a 26-page story featuring Marv. It has almost no dialogue; only one speech bubble appears in the entire story. The original issue had no functional cover, i.e. the story started on the top page, which had no title, author or publisher information. These were appended at the end of the issue.\n</p><p>Against a backdrop of heavy snow, Marv (a hulking, scarred figure in a trenchcoat) approaches a door in a dark alley. He intimidates the bouncer, Fatman, by simply glaring at him, and is let in. He proceeds down a flight of stairs, and is met by two men with machine pistols and a leather-clad woman, who is apparently their boss. Marv hands her a wad of bills and is shown to a steel door in the far wall. Through a small viewing slit, he can see a terrified little girl crouching in darkness in the room beyond. It is not stated, but is apparent that the child was being sold for sex. Marv draws two pistols and kills the pair of henchmen, then executes the woman, the only time he kills a woman in all of his Sin City appearances. He says to the little girl, \"Your momma's been asking after you, Kimberly. Let's get you home.\" Cuddling the girl gently in his arms, he walks off into the distance, as the snow obscures his receding form.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"That_Yellow_Bastard\"><i>That Yellow Bastard</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sin_City_yarns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: That Yellow Bastard\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/That_Yellow_Bastard\" title=\"That Yellow Bastard\">That Yellow Bastard</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Sin_City_-_That_Yellow_Bastard_(front_cover).png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Sin_City_-_That_Yellow_Bastard_%28front_cover%29.png/220px-Sin_City_-_That_Yellow_Bastard_%28front_cover%29.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"342\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Sin_City_-_That_Yellow_Bastard_%28front_cover%29.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"253\" data-file-height=\"393\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Sin_City_-_That_Yellow_Bastard_(front_cover).png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Cover to <i>That Yellow Bastard</i> #1.

These characters use a large vocabulary to make it appear that they are more intelligent than they truthfully are. However their wordy speeches are sprinkled with <a href=\"/wiki/Malapropism\" title=\"Malapropism\">malapropisms</a>. In this yarn, Shlubb's boots are in horrible shape, and he wishes to steal the shoes off a corpse, wrapped in a rug, that they're supposed to dump in the river.\n</p><p>Klump tells him that they're supposed to leave the body as it is. Shlubb disagrees and pulls the boots off, to discover that there are no feet in them, and a ticking sound rings through their ears. This was apparently a test, and the two buffoons get thrown several yards away as the explosion hits. It seems they failed the test miserably.\n</p><p>\"Blue Eyes\", the second story, begins as a man named Jim notices someone he assumes is a hitman following him. He runs into Kadie's, where he is confronted by an ex-flame named Delia. Marv is sitting next to them at the bar, and provides some comic relief. The hitman enters the bar, and Jim convinces Delia to leave with him. Marv then steals his drink, reasoning that it would have gone to waste otherwise.\n</p><p>Jim and Delia go back to his place and make love. She then attacks him, and explains that this is her test. She wants to become a <a href=\"/wiki/Hitman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitman\">hitwoman</a>, and she must first kill the only man she ever loved. After killing Jim, the Colonel appears - he was the 'hitman' who had been following Jim. He gives her an assignment, and she takes on the name 'Blue Eyes', which is what Jim used to call her.\n</p><p>Blue Eyes is shown to take place at the same time as <i>A Dame To Kill For</i>, as part of the story shows Gail telling Shelley what to tell the police about Dwight.  The story also has brief appearances by many characters, including Miho, Agammemnon and Manute.\n</p><p>\"Rats\" is the final story, it is about a disturbed war criminal who eats dog food.

He picks her up, and she tells him that she must have got struck by lightning. He offers to take her to the hospital, but she refuses. She asks if he is married, and he says that he is not. She takes him to the pits, and they make love. In the middle of it, he confesses that he is, in fact, married.\n</p><p>She starts choking him and calls him by the name of Eddie. She claims he has a trunk-load of stolen jewels he plans to sell in Sacred Oaks, violating an exclusivity agreement with the Wallenquist Organization. He explains that he is a used car salesman named Phil, and she understands. Eddie was supposed to be driving a similar Studebaker, and looked very similar. She sticks the heel of her shoe in his eye socket, killing him. She meets up with the Colonel and Gordo at the entrance to the pits. They check the trunk of Phil's car and find his wife with six bullets in her chest. They throw him in as well and Gordo pushes the car into the pits. Delia explains that she has a train to catch.\n</p><p>\"Wrong Track\" is the second story, which picks up soon after. Eddie is riding the train. His internal monologue explains that he had a flat tire. Delia hits on him, and they make love near the back of the train.\n</p><p>When they're done, she snaps his neck and throws him off the train. Leaving the rear of the train, the Colonel waits for her. \"Delia-- do you plan to make love to each and every one of them?\" he asks.

Marv regains consciousness on a highway overlooking the Projects, surrounded by dead young guys, unable to remember how he got there. He lights one of the dead guys' cigarettes and thinks back; since it is Saturday, he deduces he must have been at Kadie's watching Nancy dance.\n</p><p>Marv was rather depressed after seeing Nancy leave with Hartigan, as he had always had an unrequited crush on her, so the barkeep gives him a bottle to drown his sorrow with. He gets drunk and steps outside, only to find some preppy college kids trying to burn drunks and winos to death. He immediately kills one of them and chases the rest to The Projects, where along the way he destroys a police patrol car and hijacks another vehicle. At the Projects, it is clear that they are being watched, but Marv uses hand signals to identify himself and instruct his former neighbors to attack the kids, and they do so by firing arrows at them and providing Marv with a knife. After questioning the last surviving kid about him being called 'Bernini boy' (it was the name of the brand of coat he was wearing), he slits his throat. This done, he muses, \"And one fine coat it <i>is</i>. Somebody must've spent a <i>fortune</i> on it.
