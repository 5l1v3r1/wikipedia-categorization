This article is a list of winners of the Eisner Award, sorted by category.  No awards were presented in 1990 because the Eisner administration was transferred to San Diego Comic-Con during that year. In 2001, the judging panel chose to drop Best Comics-Related Periodical from the ballot;  the category was restored in 2002. Source:
