This page lists works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States. Categories of such works include co-editions of books and foreign releases of films. Unless otherwise noted, UK titles are also used in most other countries, with the exception that Canada generally uses US titles. Australia will sometimes utilize a third alternative title, but more often follows UK or US usage, these differences are included where known. Not listed are minor changes due to American and British English spelling differences; for example, the American film Rumor Has It... is titled Rumour Has It... in the UK, and, atypically, in Canada as well.
