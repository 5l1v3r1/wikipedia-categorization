This is a list of dances grouped by ethnicity, country, or region. These dances should also be listed on the general, noncategorized index list of specific dances. Note: in Armenian "par"  means "dance".                         The following is a list with the most notable dances. Names of many Greek dances may be found spelt either ending with -o or with -os. This is due to the fact that the word for "dance" in Greek is a masculine noun, while the dance itself can also be referred to by a neuter adjective used substantively. Thus one may find both "hasapiko" ("the butcher thing") and "hasapikos (horos)" - "the butcher (dance)."
