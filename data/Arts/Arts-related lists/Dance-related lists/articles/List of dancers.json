He is one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers, and one of the founders of American ballet. His work formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Apollo is Balanchine's oldest surviving ballet and his first great public ballet which Balanchine was to become renowned for. It premiered on June 12, 1928 by Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhart in Paris. Balanchine looked upon Apollo as the turning point of his life, \"in its sustained oneness of tone and feeling\". The story centers around Apollo, the god of the sun, who is visited by three muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance; Polyhymnia, muse of hymns; and Calliope, muse of poetry. Balanchine created ballet sequences for Ravel's opera <i>L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges</i> to Colette's libretto with what Ravel described as \"Russian dancers\", presumably from the Ballets Russes for the 1925 Monte Carlo premiere, although this is not listed as a Ballets Russes production.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sara_Baras\" title=\"Sara Baras\">Sara Baras</a> (born 1971) is a female <a href=\"/wiki/Flamenco\" title=\"Flamenco\">Flamenco</a> Dancer, born in the port of Cadiz.

Brown's music also left its mark on the rhythms of African popular music, such as afrobeat, j\u00f9j\u00fa and mbalax, and provided a template for go-go music. Brown began his professional music career in 1953 and rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s on the strength of his thrilling live performances and string of smash hits. During the early 1980s, Brown's music helped to shape the rhythms of early hip-hop music, with numerous groups looping or sampling his funk grooves and turning them into what became hip hop classics and the foundations of the music and dance genre. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Mashed_Potato\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mashed Potato\">Mashed Potato</a> into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides.
