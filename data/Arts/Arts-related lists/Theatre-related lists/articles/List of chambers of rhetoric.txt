A chamber of rhetoric was a civic society for the promotion of poetry, drama and eloquence. They also maintained literary contact between different towns, partly through competitions in which chambers from other places were invited to compete, producing a shared literary culture across different jurisdictions. Growing from medieval confraternities that performed mystery plays and miracle plays for feast days and civic festivals, they were widespread in the Low Countries during the Renaissance period, with some survivals and revivals in subsequent periods down to the present day. They were often named after flowers or patron saints. The following list, arranged by the town, city, liberty or lordship in which a chamber was active, is incomplete.
