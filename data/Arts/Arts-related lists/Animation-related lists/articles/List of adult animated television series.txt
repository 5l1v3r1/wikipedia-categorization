This is a list of adult animated television series (including web television series); that is, animated programs that are mainly targeted towards adults aged 18â€“34.  Mature animation is comparatively rare in North America and Europe, as animated series are culturally expected to be created for children.  This list does not include Japanese, Chinese, or Korean series, as mature animation is much more common in these regions.[original research?]
