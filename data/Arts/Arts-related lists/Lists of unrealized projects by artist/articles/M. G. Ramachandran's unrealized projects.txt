The following is a list of unproduced M. G. Ramachandran projects in alphabetical order. During his career, Indian actor-filmmaker M. G. Ramachandran had worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his acting commitments or direction. Some of these projects fell into development hell or were officially cancelled.     The film was written by A. K. Velan and was to be directed by Masthan. Ramachandran's brother Chakrapani produced this film, which got shelved after some progress, but Chakrapani later remade this film as Arasa Kattalai with Ramachandran returning.  The film was to be produced under the Pakshiraja banner, but failed to commence shoot.       The film was to have been a sequel to Ramachandran's Nadodi Mannan (1958), but never came to fruition.  The film was to be based on the life of Jesus. Shooting began, but ceased permanently after Ramachandran backed out.  In 1958, Ramachandran announced Ponniyin Selvan, a film adaptation of Kalki Krishnamurthy's novel of the same name. Ramachandran bought the film rights to the novel for ₹10,000 (equivalent to ₹680,000 or US$9,500 in 2017), and would produce, direct and star in the adaptation, which would feature an ensemble cast including Vyjayanthimala, Gemini Ganesan, Padmini, Savitri, B. Saroja Devi, M. N. Rajam, T. S. Balaiah, M. N. Nambiar, O. A. K. Thevar and Chittor V. Nagaiah. Before shooting could begin, Ramachandran met with an accident, and the wound took six months to heal; Ramachandran was unable to continue with the film despite renewing the rights four years later.     The film would have featured Ramachandran in dual roles, but was shelved after Venus Pictures announced a film with the same name starring Sivaji Ganesan.
