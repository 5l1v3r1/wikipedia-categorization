 Fifteen people   have won all four major annual American entertainment awards in a competitive, individual (non-group) category of the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT) Awards. Respectively, these awards honor outstanding achievements in television, recording, film, and theater.  Winning all four awards has been referred to as winning the "grand slam" of American show business.   The EGOT acronym was coined by actor Philip Michael Thomas in late 1984, when his role on the new hit show Miami Vice brought instant fame, gregariously stating a desire to complete his own EGOT-winning collection.    When coining the acronym, Thomas stated that it also means "energy, growth, opportunity and talent".  However, he also intended that the "E" should only stand for the Primetime Emmy Award, and not a Daytime Emmy nor any of the awards presented at the other types of Emmy ceremonies.  Nevertheless, two of 15 people listed as EGOT winners have "only" won the Daytime Emmy. To date, fifteen individuals have won all four awards in competitive categories. Notes: ^1 The artist also subsequently won one or more additional competitive awards. ^2 The artist also received one or more honorary or non-competitive awards. ^3 The artist also earned the Triple Crown of Acting, with singular (non-group/ensemble/company) acting wins in the Emmy, Oscar and Tony awards. ^4 The artist has won a Daytime Emmy Award, not a Primetime Emmy Award. ^5 The artist was awarded posthumously. ^6 The artist has subsequently achieved multiple EGOTs. ^7 Legend, Lloyd Webber, and Rice achieved their EGOTs simultaneously with their shared Emmy Award for producing Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert Six other artists – Liza Minnelli, James Earl Jones, Barbra Streisand, Alan Menken, Harry Belafonte and Quincy Jones – have also received all four awards, but at least one of the awards was non-competitive, i.e. special or honorary in nature (Streisand's Tony, both Jones' Oscars, Minnelli's Grammy, Menken's Emmy and Belafonte's Oscar).  The following are the six artists who also have won the four major awards but not exclusively in the main competitive categories. Richard Rodgers (1902–1979), a composer, received his fourth distinct award in 1962. Between 1945 and 1979, Rodgers received a total of 13 awards. Helen Hayes (1900–1993), an actress, received her fourth distinct award in 1977. Between 1932 and 1980, Hayes received a total of 7 awards. She was the first woman to win all four. Hayes was also the first person to win the Triple Crown of Acting, with singular (non-group/ensemble/company) acting wins in each of the Emmy, Oscar and Tony awards, winning her third in 1953. Counting only the first award of each type, she also has the distinction of the longest timespan (45 years) between her first and fourth award of any showbiz Grand Slam winner. Rita Moreno (born 1931), an actress, received her fourth distinct award in 1977. Between 1961 and 1978, Moreno received a total of five awards.  She is also the first Hispanic winner and the first winner to win a Grammy as their second award (both previous winners won Tonys as their second award). In addition, she became a Kennedy Center Honoree in 2015. John Gielgud (1904–2000), an actor, received his fourth distinct award in 1991. Between 1948 and 1991, Gielgud received a total of six awards. Gielgud was the first winner to win any award other than the Oscar as their first award (his first award was a Tony). At age 87 when he won his Emmy, he was also the oldest winner. Audrey Hepburn (1929–1993), an actress, received her fourth distinct award posthumously in 1994. Between 1953 and 1994, Hepburn received a total of six awards. She was the fifth person to complete the feat and the first to do so posthumously. She was also the first winner to win two of their awards in consecutive awards shows (the 1994 Grammys were the first Grammys since her posthumous win at the 1993 Emmys). She is one of the only two EGOT winners (the other being Jonathan Tunick) to not win multiple awards in any of the four award fields. Marvin Hamlisch (1944–2012), a composer, received his fourth distinct award in 1995. Between 1973 and 2001, Hamlisch received a total of 12 awards. Hamlisch has the most Oscars of any Grand Slam winners (three). In 1974 he became the first winner to have won a "General Field" Grammy – taking Song of the Year and Best New Artist. He was also the first Grand Slam winner to have won multiple legs of the feat for the same work – an Oscar and a Grammy for song "The Way We Were". Jonathan Tunick (born 1938), a composer, conductor, and music arranger, received his fourth distinct award in 1997. Between 1977 and 1997, Tunick received a total of four awards. Tunick is the first Grand Slam winner to have won an Emmy as their second award as well as the first to win the Tony as their fourth award. He is also the second person (after Audrey Hepburn) to not win any multiple awards in any of the four award fields. Mel Brooks (born 1926), a director, writer and actor, received his fourth distinct award in June 2001. Between 1968 and 2002, Brooks received a total of 11 awards.  Brooks was the first person to win the Emmy as the first award, and the first winner to have won his Oscar for screenwriting. When he appeared on January 30, 2015 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, Brooks called himself an EGOTAK, noting that he had also received awards from the American Film Institute and Kennedy Center. Mike Nichols (1931–2014), a director, actor and comedian, received his fourth distinct award in November 2001. Between 1961 and 2012, Nichols received a total of 15 awards. Nichols was the first slam winner to win the Grammy as their first award, the first winner to have won multiple awards (an Oscar, several Tonys, and two Emmys) for directing. When counting all awards won—not just the first of each type—Nichols has the longest timespan of awards among Grand Slam winners, at 51 years. Whoopi Goldberg (born 1955), an actress, comedian and talk-show host, received her fourth distinct award in 2002. Between 1985 and 2009, Goldberg received a total of 6 awards.  Goldberg is the first African American winner, the first to win the Oscar as their second award, and the first to win two of their awards in the same year (she won both her first Daytime Emmy and her Tony in 2002). Notes: Although she has not won a competitive Primetime Emmy award, she has been nominated several times. The fact that she does not have a competitive Primetime Emmy Award has led to debate over her inclusion in the "official list." In the 30 Rock episode "Dealbreakers Talk Show*#0001", Goldberg (playing herself) addresses this when questioned by character Tracy Jordan about her Daytime Emmy: "It still counts! Girl's gotta eat!" Scott Rudin (born 1958) received his fourth distinct award in 2012. Between 1984 and 2017, Rudin received a total of 18 awards making him the record holder for most awards won among the people who have won all four awards in competitive categories. Rudin is the first winner who is primarily a producer. Robert Lopez (born 1975), a songwriter, received his fourth distinct award in 2014. Between 2004 and 2018, Lopez received a total of 10 awards. Like fellow EGOT winner Whoopi Goldberg, his Emmy awards are Daytime Emmys (although he has been nominated for three competitive Primetime Emmy awards). Lopez is the first Filipino and Asian to achieve this feat. He is also the youngest winner to receive all four awards in competitive categories, as well as the fastest to complete his qualifying run of EGOT award wins (10 years), and has the shortest time to complete any run of EGOT wins (4 years).  He received his Grammy Award for The Book of Mormon in collaboration with fellow EGOT winner Scott Rudin (among others), making them the first pair of Grand Slam winners to have been co-winners of the same award. Lopez is also the first person to have won the Oscar last, which he won with his wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez.  He is also the first winner to also win the so-called "Double EGOT", winning each EGOT award twice.    John Legend (born 1978), a musician and producer, received his fourth distinct award in 2018. Between 2006 and 2018, Legend received a total of 13 awards. Legend has won the most Grammy awards, 10, of any EGOT recipient. In addition to being the first black man to achieve EGOT status , Legend is the second recipient, after Marvin Hamlisch, who is primarily a musician. Legend, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice all simultaneously became EGOT recipients on September 9, 2018 when they were collectively awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) for Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.  Andrew Lloyd Webber (born 1948), a musical theatre composer, songwriter and producer, received his fourth distinct award in 2018. Between 1980 and 2018, Lloyd Webber received a total of 13 awards.  Tim Rice (born 1944), a lyricist and producer, received his fourth distinct award in 2018. Between 1980 and 2018, Rice received a total of 12 awards, and shares some of his awards with his regular collaborator Andrew Lloyd Webber.  The following artists have also received all of the four major awards. However, in each case, one of these awards has been received only in an honorary or other non-competitive category. (Streisand has not received a competitive Tony, Minnelli has not received a competitive Grammy, Menken has not received a competitive Emmy and Belafonte and Jones have not received a competitive Oscar.) Barbra Streisand (born 1942), a singer and actress, received her fourth distinct award in 1970. Between 1963 and 2001, Streisand received a total of 18 awards. Having completed the showbiz Grand Slam at age 28, she is the youngest winner, and with just six years elapsing between her first award (a 1964 Grammy) and her final award (a 1970 Special Tony), Streisand also completed the Grand Slam in the shortest amount of time. She is also the only winner to have won an Oscar in both a music and an acting category. She is also the only winner to have won all of her competitive awards for her debut performances (her first musical album, feature film and television special, respectively). In addition, she also received the AFI Life Achievement Award, the Kennedy Center Honor,  the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the National Medal of Arts, the American Society of Cinematographers Board of Governors Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Liza Minnelli (born 1946), an actress and singer, received her fourth distinct award in 1990. Between 1965 and 2009, Minnelli received a total of 7 awards. James Earl Jones (born 1931), an actor, received his fourth distinct award in 2011. Between 1969 and 2011, Jones received a total of 7 awards. Alan Menken (born 1949), composer and songwriter, received his fourth distinct award in 2012. Between 1989 and 2012, Menken received a total of 21 awards. He has the most Oscar  wins (8) by a grand slam winner and is the second most prolific Oscar winner in the music categories after Alfred Newman. He is also notable for frequently having multiple songs from the same film nominated for major awards. Harry Belafonte (born 1927), an actor, received his fourth distinct award in 2014. Between 1954 and 2014, Belafonte received a total of 6 awards. Quincy Jones (born 1933), an American record producer, actor and composer, received his fourth distinct award in 2016. Between 1964 and 2016, Jones received a total of 31 awards — the highest number of awards of any grand slam winner. He also has the most Grammy wins (28) by a grand slam winner. The following people have each won three out of the four major entertainment awards in competitive categories.           In addition to the above winners, the following people have each won three out of the four major entertainment awards in either competitive categories or non-competitive special and honorary categories. The following people have not won all four awards in competitive categories, but have received at least one nomination for each of them: A PEGOT winner is someone who has won all four EGOT awards as well as a Pulitzer Prize PEGOT winners: People who have won a Pulitzer, and are only missing one EGOT award: Of these five, only Miranda and Sondheim are still alive.
