This table contains a list of the Citadel paint range used for painting Citadel Miniatures, produced by Games Workshop.  Citadel Miniatures are metal, resin, and plastic miniature gaming figures, accessories, and scenery for Games Workshop's range of tabletop wargames, such as their signature Warhammer Fantasy Battle, and Warhammer 40,000 games and The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game. The Hex color codes are for those displayed on the Games Workshop website.   The codes for the paints marked as "(Metal)" and for some in the "Technical" range are approximate.
