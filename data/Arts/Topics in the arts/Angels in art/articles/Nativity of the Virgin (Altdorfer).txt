The Nativity of the Virgin is a  painting by the  German Renaissance artist Albrecht Altdorfer, dating to c. 1520, which is currently housed in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich, Germany. The work uses a scenic composition typical of the Danube school of the time. The subject, the birth of Mary, is shown in a secondary location of the lower part of the painting. It includes St. Anne's bed, the midwives with the daughter and St. Joachim riding a stair with something in his hand.   The predominant part of the work is the church background, where angels fly to form a large circle: in the middle is a young angel with a thurible for the incense. The edifice, symbolizing the analogy between Mary and the Catholic church (a subject later abolished by the Protestant Reformation), is organized in a complicated and original fashion: the ambulatory and the  column galleries are Romanesque, the ogival windows are Gothic, the vaults and the shell-shaped niches are  in Renaissance style. This attention to architectural elements was typical of Altdorfer's work in the period he spent at the court of Maximilian I.
