The Man of Sorrows is a 1532 painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Maarten van Heemskerck in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent.   The subject depicts Christ after the crucifixion attended by angels, with wounds prominently displayed, wearing the crown of thorns and a loincloth.  The loincloth is claimed to be wrapped around an erection, visible to some art historians but not others.   Van Heemskerck is not the only Renaissance artist to depict Christ with an erection (ostentatio genitalium), which some scholars interpret as a symbol of his resurrection and continuing power.  Other versions of Christ crowned with thorns by Heemskerck are: Triptych Ecce Homo Christ Crowned with Thorns Christ as Man of Sorrows Christ in Agony
