Minerva Fighting Mars (Combat de Mars contre Minerve) is a 1771 painting by Jacques-Louis David, now in the Louvre. David produced the painting to compete for the Prix de Rome of 1771 - he and the seven other competitors were assigned the task of painting a new work in 10 weeks on a set subject, which that year was the Iliad. David lost that year to Joseph-Benoît Suvée, finally winning on his fourth attempt in 1774 with Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease.
