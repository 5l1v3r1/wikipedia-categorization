David takes on all the burdens of the group, and has been troubled by his past in which he was cowardly; he must prove himself to be a man.  Before being sucked into Everworld, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Senna Wales.  As such, he is most susceptible to the influence of Senna's powers. He shows his courage and bravery before <a href=\"/wiki/Zeus\" title=\"Zeus\">Zeus</a>, other gods, and Vikings. David fights with the Sword of <a href=\"/wiki/Galahad\" title=\"Galahad\">Galahad</a>, after witnessing Sir Galahad's death.  At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to help protect it, as well as to escape his mother's smoking and depression problems.  David narrates <i>#1: Search for Senna</i>, <i>#5: Discover the Destroyer</i>, and <i>#10: Understand the Unknown</i>.</li>\n<li><b>Christopher Hitchcock</b>: The reluctant clown of the group, Christopher often makes jokes specifically targeted towards the other members of the group (April (<a href=\"/wiki/Sexism\" title=\"Sexism\">sexism</a>), Jalil (<a href=\"/wiki/Racism\" title=\"Racism\">racism</a>), and David (<a href=\"/wiki/Antisemitism\" title=\"Antisemitism\">antisemitism</a>)).  He does this to keep the others at a distance, so they won't get to know him. Christopher is, in his own words, on the road to becoming an <a href=\"/wiki/Alcoholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alcoholic\">alcoholic</a> like his parents. However, he can be a jerk one minute, and a kind, caring person the next. Christopher gave up the offer to become an immortal because he failed to save the life of <a href=\"/wiki/Ganymede_(mythology)\" title=\"Ganymede (mythology)\">Ganymede</a>, Zeus' male lover; blaming his failure on latent homophobia causes Christopher to fall into an alcoholic depression and is the turning point for his character. Christopher also decreases in his prejudice jokes when Keith, who is part of a group of racists and anti-Semitics that plan to overthrow the government, tries to recruit him.  At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to avoid his parents' alcoholic nature, escape his younger brother's ridicule and abuse, and stay off the road to a possible alcoholic future.  Christopher narrates <i>#2: Land of Loss</i>, <i>#6: Fear the Fantastic</i>, and <i>#11: Mystify the Magician</i>.</li>\n<li><b>April O'Brien</b>: The heroine of the group, April is Senna's half-sister; their personalities, however, are directly opposite, and the two hate each other with a passion. April is a devout <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman Catholic Church\">Catholic</a>, somewhat <a href=\"/wiki/Feminism\" title=\"Feminism\">feminist</a>, and very beautiful with red hair and green eyes. She is in the <a href=\"/wiki/Drama\" title=\"Drama\">drama</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Club_(organization)\" title=\"Club (organization)\">club</a> at her real world school, and she is often singing songs from <i>Rent</i>. She is also said to be very popular at the main characters' high school.  April carries her own burdens in the group, and is often the voice of reason next to Jalil. She is a vegetarian.  She has the most reason to want to return to the Old World at the end of the series, due to how much she could possibly leave behind.  Ultimately, however, she opts to remain in Everworld due to her unbearable guilt and inability to face her father over her murder of Senna, knowing that it would never be acceptable in their home world, no matter how necessary it had been in Everworld.  April narrates <i>#3: Enter the Enchanted</i>, <i>#7: Gateway to the Gods</i>, and <i>#12: Entertain the End</i>.</li>\n<li><b>Jalil Sherman</b>: The scientist and sole African-American of the group, he wants to find the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Software\" title=\"Software\">software</a>\" on which Everworld runs and control it. In the real world, Jalil is <a href=\"/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\">obsessive-compulsive</a>, but in Everworld, he is unaffected. His disorder is a secret to the rest of the group for a majority of the series. Senna, however, knows of his condition and was able to temporarily cure it while the two were in the Old World, on the condition he would swear to serve her. He refused. Jalil always tries hard to search for a logical explanation for the many illogical phenomena in Everworld. He and April often butt heads when it comes to <a href=\"/wiki/Religion\" title=\"Religion\">religion</a>, but the two often fall on the same side in arguments within the group. At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld rather than return home to the Old World because he does not have to live with his disorder.  His name ironically means \"godlike.\"  Jalil narrates <i>#4: Realm of the Reaper</i> and <i>#8: Brave the Betrayal</i>.</li>\n<li><b>Senna Wales</b>: The witch who intertwines all the characters. Senna is David's girlfriend, Christopher's ex-girlfriend, and April's half-sister (they have the same father and different mothers) and has blond hair and gray eyes. Senna is the only main character with real magical power, and at times, uses the others for her own ends, whether through <a href=\"/wiki/Emotional_manipulation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emotional manipulation\">emotional manipulation</a> or magic. Her magical power is much stronger in Everworld than in the Old World. Her name was originally Senda (meaning \"gateway\" in Spanish), but after her mother left her she began to refer to herself based on her father's mispronunciation. Senna sometimes uses her powers on others for her own benefit, whether for protection or distraction, though usually in an effort to further her own plans.  Senna's ultimate goal is to overthrow the powers of Everworld and rule over it for her own.  She is ultimately foiled in her plan, however, when she is killed by April in the penultimate book.  Senna only narrates <i>#9: Inside the Illusion</i>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recurring_characters\">Recurring characters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Everworld&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Recurring characters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Loki\" title=\"Loki\">Loki</a></b>: The <a href=\"/wiki/Norsemen\" title=\"Norsemen\">Norse</a> god of destruction who brought David, Senna, Christopher, Jalil, and April into Everworld.

They could only be killed by the weapon of another god such as Thor's hammer Mjolnir or through severe injury. Even then, there is a chance they could heal. Real world weapons however do seem to harm gods. When the Sennites arrived with automatic weapons, they apparently killed Fenrir. Many of the gods had special powers related to their field and some were radically more powerful than others. Nearly all of them were portrayed as being cold and cruel in their attitude toward humans if not outright insane due to their power and long lives and would rather carry on their petty squabbles from ancient times.

They have large red eyes with blue pupils, two main arms as well as two smaller arms that have more dexterity and are on the sides of their faces. Their mouths are long and tapered. Juvenile Coo-Hatch are small and flighted with needle-like mouths. The juveniles are very fast fliers, covering a space of 20 feet in the length of a human blink.\n</p><p>The Coo-Hatch are also master metal forgers and can create blades sharp enough to cut through any known material; they use this skill to make small, accurate throwing blades and metal tools.

The Coo-Hatch had no knowledge of guns or explosives prior to the exchange. The Coo-Hatch used the textbook to develop primitive cannons. The Coo-Hatch then aided the Hetwans in almost taking over Mt. Olympus. Later, some of the tribes of the Coo-Hatch team up with the protagonists and develop cannons to use in an assault on the Hetwans (which supposedly takes place after the series end).\n</p><p>Their one true desire is to go back to their forges on their home world, which they cannot do without a gateway like Senna or her mother.

They do, however, wield devices similar to long straws (nicknamed \"Super-Soakers\" by the main characters), out of which they shoot a burning, venomous acid.  The Hetwan themselves seem to feel no fear of death or anything.  As repeatedly stated by them they exist merely to serve Ka Anor and are absolutely loyal to him.\n</p><p>The Hetwan live in a great city that resembles a giant needle sticking out of a pit (referred to by Chris as \"Junkie Dreamland\"), with an assortment of strange creatures from their home world.\n</p><p>The main characters often fight against the Hetwan. Because Ka Anor intends to eventually kill and consume all of Everworld's gods, most of the peoples of Everworld would be considered enemies of the Hetwan, although they generally seek to appease them out of fear of destruction.\n</p><p>Little is known about the Hetwans' life before Everworld, but like all alien species (those not from <a href=\"/wiki/Human\" title=\"Human\">human</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Mythology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mythology\">mythology</a>), they were brought there from another world (not \"our\" world) by their particular deity, the dread-god Ka Anor. They then began to conquer everything they came across, while collecting <a href=\"/wiki/Deity\" title=\"Deity\">gods</a> for their deity to consume. The Hetwan kingdom in Everworld alternates between perfectly hemispherical hills and gullies, giving a scooped-out appearance. The alien trees make strange musical sounds.  The Hetwan capital, where Ka Anor resides, is a massive tower (dubbed \"Junkie Dream Mountain\" for its needle-like appearance) in the middle of a lava and glass filled crater.  The only transportation across this gulf is by means of the \"Red Wings\", giant insects that can carry passengers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Knights\">Knights</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Everworld&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Knights\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The knights are classic men of <a href=\"/wiki/Chivalry\" title=\"Chivalry\">chivalry</a>. Self-described as \"creatures of myth and legend\", their main pastimes seem to be slaying <a href=\"/wiki/Dragons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dragons\">dragons</a>, rescuing young girls, and feasting. Despite witnessing April taking out several <a href=\"/wiki/Trolls\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, the knights still believe that women should act \"womanly\"\u2014no fighting, allowing themselves to be looked over and pampered. They are very brave and value honor highly. The knights met in the series were all surviving members of the Knights of the Round Table such as <a href=\"/wiki/Galahad\" title=\"Galahad\">Galahad</a>.  While they had not aged since entering Everworld they lack the immortality of many other beings.

The eunuchs guard the City of <a href=\"/wiki/Hel_(being)\" title=\"Hel (being)\">Hel</a> (known only as \"Her City\"), kidnapping men to inhabit it as Hel's personal harem.

Different colored tunics signify different jobs within Fairy Land; for example, a fairy wearing a dark blue tunic is part of the fairy version of the <a href=\"/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service\" title=\"Internal Revenue Service\">IRS</a> and goes around making notes on the various stands within the city, while a fairy in a black tunic is part of the police force.\n</p><p>Fairies in Everworld, also called \"<a href=\"/wiki/Leprechauns\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leprechauns\">leprechauns</a>\", are known for their cupidity---Fairy Land, which is very pristine and clean compared to other parts of Everworld, serves as a kind of economic center for the entire world.
