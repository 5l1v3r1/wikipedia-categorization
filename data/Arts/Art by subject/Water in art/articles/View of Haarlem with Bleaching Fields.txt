 View of Haarlem with Bleaching Fields (c. 1670–1675) is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch painter Jacob van Ruisdael. It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Kunsthaus Zürich. This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1911, who wrote; "92. The Haarlem Bleaching-Grounds. In the left foreground is a marshy pool surrounded with trees. A road leads from it up a hill towards the right background. In the middle distance is part of the bleaching-grounds ; large pieces of linen are spread out near cottages, and many persons are at work. In the distance is the town of Haarlem, dominated by the church of St. Bavo. The sky is filled with great masses of cloud which overshadow almost the whole landscape ; stray sunbeams illumine part of the town and the bleaching-grounds. Signed in full in the left-hand bottom corner ; canvas, 25 1/2 inches by 22 inches. Exhibited at Düsseldorf, 1886, No. 288. Sale. Count Sierstorpff, Berlin, April 19, 1887, No. 67.  This scene is very similar to other panorama paintings Ruisdael made in this period and these Haerlempjes often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape, such as Jacob Maris of the Hague School.
