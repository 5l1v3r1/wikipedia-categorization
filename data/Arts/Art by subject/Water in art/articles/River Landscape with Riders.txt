River Landscape with Riders is a c.1653â€“1657 painting by the Dutch artist Aelbert Cuyp, now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which bought it in 1965 from the Edmond de Rothschild collection in Exbury, Hampshire. As the title suggests, it shows two riders pausing by a river to let their horses drink. The mountainous landscape is based on those seen along the River Rhine between Nijmegen and Kleve, an area visited and drawn by the artist in 1652.
