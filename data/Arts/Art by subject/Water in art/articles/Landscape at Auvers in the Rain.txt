 Landscape at Auvers in the Rain is an oil on canvas by the Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in July, 1890, and completed just 3 days before his death, it depicts a landscape at Auvers-sur-Oise, where van Gogh spent the last years of his life. The depiction of the rain with dark, diagonal lines are considered[according to whom?] to be inspired by Japanese art.  This was one of Van Gogh's last paintings before his death.
