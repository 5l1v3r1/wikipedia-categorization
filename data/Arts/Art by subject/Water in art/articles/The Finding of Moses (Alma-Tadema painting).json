The style and decoration of her chair is informed by illustrations of Egyptian tomb paintings.

Two male attendants wave ostrich feather fans, while two female attendants carry Moses in his cradle alongside.  The cradle has been decorated with lotus flowers, tied on with a pink ribbon.  Another female attendant plays a stringed instrument.\n</p><p>The painting is composed like a frieze, with bright blues and purples of <a href=\"/wiki/Delphinium\" title=\"Delphinium\">delphiniums</a> in the foregrounds; the procession passing behind; a space for the river; and then, in the background, on the other bank of the river, teams of slaves can be seen labouring under their dark-skinned overseers, possibly working on the pyramids at <a href=\"/wiki/Giza\" title=\"Giza\">Giza</a> on the opposite bank.

King <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_VII\" title=\"Edward VII\">Edward VII</a> visited Alma-Tadema in his studio while the work was being completed. By the time it was finished, his wife wryly quipped that the infant Moses would now be \"two years old, and need no longer be carried\".\n</p><p>The painting was exhibited at the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Academy_summer_exhibition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Royal Academy summer exhibition\">Royal Academy summer exhibition</a> in 1905; the same year, Alma-Tadema became one of the first 18 members of the <a href=\"/wiki/Order_of_Merit\" title=\"Order of Merit\">Order of Merit</a>.  The work was received with warm but not enthusiastic praise.\n</p><p>Alma-Tadema's works fell dramatically out of favour after his death in 1912, but provided inspiration for the set designers of Biblical epics such as <a href=\"/wiki/D._W._Griffith\" title=\"D.

It was sold to F. W. Reeves of Wolverhampton, and then sold at a country auction in September 1950, and acquired by London dealer Newman.\n</p><p>In a widely reported, but probably apocryphal, story, the painting was reputedly sold to an English couple for a small sum.  They had no interest in the unfashionable painting, buying the work for the frame, by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Maw&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Thomas Maw (page does not exist)\">Thomas Maw</a>: after leaving the dealers, they removed the painting from its frame, and the artwork was found minutes later abandoned in an alley in <a href=\"/wiki/St_James%27s\" title=\"St James&#39;s\">St James's</a> near the gallery.   Bernard Hart, a director of Newman's at the time, wrote to <i>The Times</i> to dispute the story: in his account, more prosaically, the gallery failed to find a museum willing to take the picture, even as a gift, and it remained unsold when sent to Christie's by Newman's in December 1960.  It was \"bought in\" by the auction house, and eventually acquired to decorate the walls of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clock_House_Restaurant&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Clock House Restaurant (page does not exist)\">Clock House Restaurant</a> near <a href=\"/wiki/Welwyn\" title=\"Welwyn\">Welwyn</a> in Hertfordshire.\n</p><p>The painting was sold to the London art dealers in July 1967, and sold on to <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ira_Spanierman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ira Spanierman (page does not exist)\">Ira Spanierman</a> Galleries in New York shortly afterwards for $8,500; in turn, they sold it on to <a href=\"/wiki/Allen_Funt\" title=\"Allen Funt\">Allen Funt</a> for $25,000.  Funt was the producer of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Candid_Camera\" title=\"Candid Camera\">Candid Camera</a></i>, and a collector  of Alma-Tadema's at a time when his works remained deeply unfashionable.  The painting was included in an exhibition at the <a href=\"/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art\" title=\"Metropolitan Museum of Art\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York in March and April 1973, entitled \"Victorians in Togas\". After Funt experienced financial troubles, he sold the painting along with the rest of his collection at <a href=\"/wiki/Sotheby%27s\" title=\"Sotheby&#39;s\">Sotheby's</a> in London in November 1973, for around $72,000.  Reportedly, he kept the original frames and put in photos of the paintings that he had sold.\n</p><p>The painting was bought by a private collector, and then sold to another private collector at Christie's in New York in May 1995 for US$2,752,500, before being sold again at Sotheby's for US$35,922,500 (including <a href=\"/wiki/Buyer%27s_premium\" title=\"Buyer&#39;s premium\">buyer's premium</a>) in November 2010.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Finding_of_Moses_(Alma-Tadema_painting)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2011/01/01/from-riches-to-rags-to-riches/\">From \u2018Riches to Rags to Riches\u2019</a>, artnews.com, 1 January 2011</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=175836\">Sotheby's sale</a>, 25 May 1995</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/19th-century-european-art-n08673/lot.56.html\">Sotheby's sale</a>, 4 November 2010</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll12/id/2898\">Exhibition of Paintings by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema Opens at Metropolitan Museum</a>, press release, March 1973</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2239\nCached time: 20180912190202\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.088 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.115 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 141/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4144/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.040/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 2.06 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   86.922      1 -total\n 42.88%   37.273      1 Template:Convert\n 34.10%   29.640      1 Template:Refimprove\n 27.32%   23.748      1 Template:Ambox\n 22.84%   19.853      1 Template:Italic_title\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:46532367-0!canonical and timestamp 20180912190202 and revision id 842574861\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B7_%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%89_(%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A9)","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0637 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649 (\u0644\u0648\u062d\u0629)"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","hidden":"","*":"Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2018"},{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_additional_references"},{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","*":"1904_paintings"},{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","*":"Paintings_by_Lawrence_Alma-Tadema"},{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","*":"Paintings_depicting_Moses"},{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","*":"Paintings_of_children"},{"sortkey":"Finding of Moses","*":"Water_in_art"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles needing additional references from May 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Allen Funt"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Aswan Low Dam"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bible"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bithiah"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Book of Exodus"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"British Museum"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Buyer's premium"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Candid Camera"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cartouche"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cecil B.
