The American Society of Botanical Artists (ASBA) is the principal United States society for those who practice and appreciate contemporary botanical art. Since its founding by Diane Bouchier in 1994, ASBA has grown to nearly 1300 individual members and  more than 20 institutional members from around the world.  ASBA members include botanical artists at all levels from beginners to masters, instructors, collectors, curators, botanical gardens, museums, academic institutions, and libraries. The Society defines "botanical art" as ASBA publishes The Botanical Artist quarterly journal. The ASBA organizes an Annual International Juried Exhibition in conjunction with the Horticultural Society of New York.  At this annual exhibition, it awards the Diana Bouchier Artist Award for Excellence in Botanical Art, the James White Service Award for Dedication to Botanical Art, and the Botanical Illustrator Award for Excellence in Scientific Botanical Art.
