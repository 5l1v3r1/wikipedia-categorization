The two fontane dei mostri marini are located in the Santissima Annunziata plaza in Florence. The two fountains were placed in 1641 at the sides of the Santissima Annunziata plaza, having been commissioned in 1626. The statues were originally intended to compliment the Monument of the Four Moors in Livorno. To this end, artist Pietro Tacca began to work on them in 1627 with the help of two students: Bartolomeo Salvini and Francesco Maria Bandini. In 1641, following the death of Tucca, the fountains were placed in the Santissima Annunziata plaza on opposite sides of the Equestrian Monument of Ferdinando I. The fountains were restored over a period spanning from 1987 to 1988, and again between May and June 1996 by Giovanni Morigi under the direction of the Carlo Francini Office of Fine Arts of the City of Florence. Despite these efforts, the statues again began to show signs of material degradation and the fountains were eventually shut down. In 2013, money obtained by the Municipality of Public Land Concession for Special Initiatives was used to initiate a new restorative effort. These two fountains are considered masterpieces among Mannerist sculptures for their beauty and balance, using contemporary marine symbology (such as seashells, fish, legendary monsters, garlands of shellfish and algae, and masks) alongside traditional maritime themes and symbols. As emphasized, for example, by Giuseppe Richa in Notizie Istoriche delle chiese fiorentine (XVIII secolo), it was unconventional that sprays of water would not be directed upwards, but sometimes come out from mouths of the monsters directed downwards. Pietro Tacca's signature (PETRUS TACC F.) can be found on both fountains; this is most easily read with one's back to the basilica. Detail of the sea monster Detail of the tank Detail of the base
