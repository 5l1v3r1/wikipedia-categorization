The fountain is first mentioned in documents dating to the second half of the 15th century.   A drawing of the fountain appears on the map of Rome made by Pietro del Massaio in 1471,  along with a description of the legend of the fountain's origin. According to the legend,  which appears in the <i>Chronicle</i> of <a href=\"/wiki/Eusebius\" title=\"Eusebius\">Eusebius</a>,  translated and finished by <a href=\"/wiki/Saint_Jerome\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saint Jerome\">Saint Jerome</a> in the fifth century, on the night of the birth of Christ a fountain of oil appeared miraculously in front of the church, which as a result was given the name \"Santa Maria in fontibus.\"   The original fountain was supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct, the <a href=\"/wiki/Aqua_Traiana\" title=\"Aqua Traiana\">Aqua Traiana</a>.  When the aqueduct was ruined during the invasions of Rome,  water came from underground sources below the <a href=\"/wiki/Janiculum\" title=\"Janiculum\">Janiculum</a> hill.  The old fountain illustrated in the drawing of del Massaio had two vasques, one above the other, pouring water into the basin below.  <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The fountain was reconstructed between 1499 and 1500 on the command of Giovanni Lopez, the bishop of Perouse and Bishop of the parish of <a href=\"/wiki/Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere\" title=\"Santa Maria in Trastevere\">Santa Maria in Trastevere</a>,  who gave the commission to <a href=\"/wiki/Donato_Bramante\" title=\"Donato Bramante\">Donato Bramante</a>, the architect of <a href=\"/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica\" title=\"St. Peter&#39;s Basilica\">St. Peter's Basilica</a>.  Bramante removed the upper vasque and added four carved stone wolf heads, the emblem of the Lopez family. \n</p><p>The fountain was reconstructed again in 1604 by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi, the father of <a href=\"/wiki/Carlo_Rainaldi\" title=\"Carlo Rainaldi\">Carlo Rainaldi</a>,the architect of the two churches of <a href=\"/wiki/Piazza_del_Popolo\" title=\"Piazza del Popolo\">Piazza del Popolo</a>.  At that time the fountain was connected to the newly restored <a href=\"/wiki/Acqua_Felice\" title=\"Acqua Felice\">Acqua Felice</a> aqueduct.    In 1659 the fountain was connected to the <a href=\"/wiki/Acqua_Paola\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Acqua Paola\">Acqua Paola</a> aqueduct and remodeled again by <a href=\"/wiki/Bernini\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bernini\">Bernini</a>.  Bernini replaced the octagonal basin,  moved the fountain from its original place in front of the church to a new location in the center of the square, and added sculpted seashells around the basin.   At the end of the 17th century, the architect <a href=\"/wiki/Carlo_Fontana\" title=\"Carlo Fontana\">Carlo Fontana</a> replaced Bernini's seashells with his own sculpted seashells.  \n</p><p>The fountain was completely rebuilt in 1873, following the design of Bernini and Fontana, but using less expensive materials. In that occasion, the main pool was rebuilt with bardiglio marble and an imposing S.P.Q.R. sign has been placed on the external side of the shells.\nIt was rebuilt once again in 1930. The last maintenance has been made in 1984.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fountain_in_Piazza_Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Maurizia Tazartes, <i>Fontaines de Rome</i>, pg. 48 </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"> Maurizia Tazartes, pg. 48</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fountain_in_Piazza_Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Bibliography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Maurizia Tazartes, <i>Fontaines de Rome</i>, (French edition translated from Italian), Citadelles &amp; Mazenot, Paris, 2004</li>\n<li>Marilyn Symmes, Editor, Fountains - <i>Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present,</i> Thames and Hudson, in association with Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and the Smithsonian Institution, 1998.</li></ul>\n<p><span id=\"coordinates\" class=\"metadata coord-missing\"></span>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1255\nCached time: 20180912015520\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.028 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.038 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 141/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 836/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 219/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 585/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.003/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 523 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   20.506      1 -total\n 85.04%   17.438      1 Template:Reflist\n 14.57%    2.988      1 Template:Coord_missing\n  9.97%    2.045      2 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:25868951-0!canonical and timestamp 20180912015520 and revision id 849115836\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Italy_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_coordinates"},{"sortkey":"Piazza Santa Maria in Trasteve","*":"Fountains_in_Rome"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Rome_R._XIII_Trastevere"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Seashells_in_art"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Acqua Felice"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Acqua Paola"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Aqua Traiana"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bernini"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Carlo Fontana"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Carlo Rainaldi"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Donato Bramante"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Eusebius"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Gian Lorenzo Bernini"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Janiculum"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Piazza del Popolo"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rome"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Saint Jerome"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Santa Maria in Trastevere"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"St. Peter's Basilica"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Coord missing"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":["Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere_fountain.jpg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Fountain_in_Piazza_Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere","byteoffset":583,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Fountain_in_Piazza_Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere","byteoffset":3091,"anchor":"References"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Bibliography","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Fountain_in_Piazza_Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere","byteoffset":3121,"anchor":"Bibliography"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Fountain in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5474793"}]}}
