Jens Galschiot made a happening in Paris during COP21, where he and his employees were in polar bear costumes.  The happening was an effort to create a focus on human consumption of fossil fuel. Paris was in state of emergency at the time of the happening.  Jens Galschiot and his employees were therefore not allowed to wear masks. The polar bear army participated in many climate changes demonstrations.  According to Jens Galschiot the polar bear army will participate in a happening in New York City together with the president of the United Nations General Assembly Mogens Lykketoft.
