The artist leaves the viewer to determine whether the woman should be condemned or pitied.  The paintings reflected fears that public morality and family life were imperiled by the recent <a href=\"/wiki/Matrimonial_Causes_Act_1857\" title=\"Matrimonial Causes Act 1857\">Matrimonial Causes Act 1857</a>, which reformed the law of <a href=\"/wiki/Divorce\" title=\"Divorce\">divorce</a> by moving jurisdiction from the ecclesiastical courts to the civil court, and made divorce a realistic prospect for the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_class\" title=\"Middle class\">middle classes</a>.\n</p><p>The works \u2013 a visual <a href=\"/wiki/Morality_tale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Morality tale\">morality tale</a> based on a single moment \u2013 were influenced by <a href=\"/wiki/William_Holman_Hunt\" title=\"William Holman Hunt\">William Holman Hunt</a>'s 1853 painting <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Awakening_Conscience\" title=\"The Awakening Conscience\">The Awakening Conscience</a></i>. It is not certain how they acquired the title <i>Past and Present</i>, which is not known to have been used by the artist, and is first recorded in the auction catalogue for Egg's works after his death in 1863. It is surmised that it derives from a misreading of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Ruskin\" title=\"John Ruskin\">John Ruskin</a>'s <i>Academy Notes</i>, in which the untitled works are discussed below a review of a painting with that title.\n</p><p>At the original 1858 exhibition, the first painting \u2013 the discovery in the drawing-room \u2013 was hung flanked by the two other paintings, which depict parallel scenes several years later. When originally exhibited, the central painting was raised slightly above the flanking images.\n</p>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"><i><b>Past and Present</b></i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><i>No. 3 - Despair</i>\n</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><i>No. 1 - Misfortune</i>\n</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><i>No. 2 - Prayer</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Past and Present Number Three.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg/307px-Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg\" width=\"307\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg/461px-Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg/614px-Past_and_Present_Number_Three.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1032\" data-file-height=\"840\" /></a>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Past and Present Number One.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg/302px-Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg\" width=\"302\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg/453px-Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg/604px-Past_and_Present_Number_One.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1536\" data-file-height=\"1272\" /></a>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Past and Present Number Two.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg/294px-Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg\" width=\"294\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg/441px-Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg/588px-Past_and_Present_Number_Two.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"988\" data-file-height=\"840\" /></a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"><i>August the 4th - Have just heard that B&#8212; has been dead more than a fortnight, so his poor children have now lost both parents.<br />I hear <u>she</u> was seen on Friday last near the Strand, evidently without a place to lay her head.

The two lateral pictures represent the same moment of night a fortnight after his death. The same little cloud is under the moon. The two children see it from the chamber in which they are praying for their lost mother, and their mother, from behind a boat under a vault on the river shore.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each painting measures 63.5 centimetres (25.0&#160;in) by 76.2 centimetres (30.0&#160;in).  They were all donated to the <a href=\"/wiki/Tate_Gallery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tate Gallery\">Tate Gallery</a> in 1918 by Sir Alec and Lady Martin in memory of their daughter Nora, and are now usually given the rather prosaic titles <i>Past and Present, No. 1</i>, <i>Past and Present, No. 2</i> and <i>Past and Present, No. 3</i>, although occasionally they are titled <i>Misfortune</i>, <i>Prayer</i>, and <i>Despair</i>. The number order does not represent the way they were exhibited (the first scene was shown in the centre), but rather an implied conventional <a href=\"/wiki/A_Rake%27s_Progress\" title=\"A Rake&#39;s Progress\">Hogarthian progress</a> of social decline from middle-class prosperity through genteel poverty and, finally, to destitution.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Past_and_Present.2C_No._1\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_and_Present,_No._1\"><i>Past and Present, No. 1</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Past_and_Present_(paintings)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Past and Present, No. 1\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first painting shows the <a href=\"/wiki/Drawing-room\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Drawing-room\">drawing-room</a> of a middle-class Victorian home, with a large gilt mirror over a fireplace, and central round table.  It depicts the moment when the family's domestic bliss is broken, with many details echoing the sudden change in circumstances. A woman lies prostrate on the green carpet before her husband, fallen as if in a swoon, hands clasped together, with her gold serpent bracelet resembling manacles. He sits dumbfounded, clutching a letter which reveals her adultery, his left foot resting on a <a href=\"/wiki/Portrait_miniature\" title=\"Portrait miniature\">portrait miniature</a> of her lover. An apple has been cut into two pieces; one half remains beside the husband's glossy <a href=\"/wiki/Top_hat\" title=\"Top hat\">top hat</a> on the table, stabbed through its worm-ridden core by a small knife; the other half has fallen to the floor beside the wife. The family's two daughters are playing to the left of the painting, but their <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_cards\" title=\"House of cards\">house of cards</a>&#160;\u2013 built on top of a novel by <a href=\"/wiki/Balzac\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Balzac\">Balzac</a>, possibly also a tale of adultery&#160;\u2013 is tumbling to the floor. (The older girl was modelled by, <a href=\"/wiki/Jane_Ellen_Panton\" title=\"Jane Ellen Panton\">Jane</a> one of <a href=\"/wiki/William_Powell_Frith\" title=\"William Powell Frith\">William Powell Frith</a>'s daughters.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The rear wall of the room, decorated with a rich red wallpaper, also bears two portraits, one on either side of the fireplace and mirror: the wife's portrait hangs to the left, above the playing children but beneath a picture of the expulsion of <a href=\"/wiki/Adam_and_Eve\" title=\"Adam and Eve\">Adam and Eve</a> from the <a href=\"/wiki/Garden_of_Eden\" title=\"Garden of Eden\">Garden of Eden</a> (labelled \"<a href=\"/wiki/Fall_of_Man\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fall of Man\">The Fall</a>\"); the husband's to the right hangs beneath a shipwreck scene by <a href=\"/wiki/Clarkson_Stanfield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Clarkson Stanfield\">Clarkson Stanfield</a> (labelled \"Abandoned\"). The mirror shows the open door, through which the wife is soon to depart. The packed bag and umbrella by the door may underline her imminent departure, or could have been cast down by the husband when he arrived home.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Past_and_Present.2C_No._2\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_and_Present,_No._2\"><i>Past and Present, No. 2</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Past_and_Present_(paintings)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Past and Present, No. 2\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The second painting shows a night scene, several years later, in a dark and sparsely-furnished bedroom shortly after the death of the heartbroken husband. The children are older now: the younger one kneels in a white <a href=\"/wiki/Nightgown\" title=\"Nightgown\">nightgown</a>, weeping into the lap of the elder, who sits in a black <a href=\"/wiki/Mourning_dress\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mourning dress\">mourning dress</a>, looking out of a window at rooftops and a clouded moon. The same small portraits of the husband and the wife decorate the bedroom wall.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Past_and_Present.2C_No._3\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_and_Present,_No._3\"><i>Past and Present, No. 3</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Past_and_Present_(paintings)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Past and Present, No. 3\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The third painting is also a night scene. The details of the cloud and moon show it is the same evening as depicted in the second painting. The fallen wife is resting in the detritus-strewn shadows beneath the <a href=\"/wiki/Adelphi,_London\" title=\"Adelphi, London\">Adelphi Arches</a>, by the <a href=\"/wiki/River_Thames\" title=\"River Thames\">River Thames</a>. She clutches a bundle of rags from which protrude the emaciated legs of an infant, perhaps the fruit of her affair, either asleep or dead. Posters on the wall advertise two contemporary plays, <i>Victims</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Taylor\" title=\"Tom Taylor\">Tom Taylor</a> and <i>The Cure for Love</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Parry\" title=\"Tom Parry\">Tom Parry</a>, both tales of unhappy marriages, and also \"Pleasure excursions to Paris\", perhaps a reference to the novel by Balzac in the first picture. She looks up from her place in the gutter to the moon and stars above.\n</p><p>A similarly watery destination for fallen women was depicted in <a href=\"/wiki/Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti\" title=\"Dante Gabriel Rossetti\">Rossetti</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Found_(Rossetti)\" title=\"Found (Rossetti)\">Found</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/GF_Watts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GF Watts\">GF Watts</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Found_Drowned\" title=\"Found Drowned\">Found Drowned</a></i> and <a href=\"/wiki/Abraham_Solomon\" title=\"Abraham Solomon\">Abraham Solomon</a>'s <i>Drowned!
