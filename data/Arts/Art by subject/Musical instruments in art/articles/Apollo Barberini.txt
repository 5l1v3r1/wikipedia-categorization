The Apollo Barberini is a 1stâ€“2nd-century Roman sculpture of Apollo Citharoedus.  It is a probable copy of the sculpture of Apollo Citharoedus (possibly by Scopas and perhaps from the sanctuary of Apollo at Rhamnus, in Attica) that was the cult statue in the temple of Apollo Palatinus in Rome.   It is named after the Barberini who acquired it.  It is now held in the Munich Glyptothek (Inv. 211). Other items from the Barberini collections:
