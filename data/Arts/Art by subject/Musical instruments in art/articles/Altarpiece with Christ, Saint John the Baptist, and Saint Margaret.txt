The Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret is an autographed 1434 sculpture in carrara marble by the Italian artist Andrea da Giona, now in the collection of The Cloisters in New York City. It was commissioned by the Knights of Malta, a band of violent Christian sailors preoccupied with defending Spain from Muslim invasion.  The carving is in the late International Gothic style, as evidenced by its folds of draperies, lush folidates, and the heavily idealised facial types of the main saints.  Christ in Majesty is at the center, flanked by the Virgin Mary and the angel Gabriel, with other angels playing musical instruments. The four Evangelists are placed at each corner. Inscriptions below the central panel read "HOC OPUS FECIT MAGISTER AND[R]EAS DA GIONA MCCCCXXXIIII" (This work was made by Master Andrea from Giona 1434).
