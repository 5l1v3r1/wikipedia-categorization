Au Lapin Agile is a 1905 painting by Pablo Picasso. The harlequin is a self-portrait of the artist. The woman represents his  lover Germaine Pichot, formerly the obsession of Carlos Casagemas, a friend of Picasso who committed suicide in 1901 because of an unreturned love for Pichot.  In 1907 Pichot appeared as one of the models in Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.  Frédéric Gérard (depicted in the painting playing the guitar) commissioned the painting and exhibited it at its namesake Montmartre cabaret, the Au Lapin Agile, from 1905 to 1912.  On November 27, 1989, Walter H. Annenberg bought the painting at auction from the Joan Whitney Payson family for $40.7 million. He gave the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
