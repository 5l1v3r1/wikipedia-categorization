Perseus Freeing Andromeda is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Piero di Cosimo, c. executed in 1510 or 1513  It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy. The painting is mentioned in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari, who states that it was commissioned by Filippo Strozzi the Elder, and gifted by Giovanni Battista Strozzi to a member of Cosimo I de' Medici's personnel.  The work shows the mythological hero Perseus killing the monster who had entrapped Andromeda. Piero gave a great deal of attention to the background, perhaps inspired to the contemporary Flemish school:  details include   the two characters with a turban on the left, the very detailed painting of the water on the shore, and the fantastic musical instruments.
