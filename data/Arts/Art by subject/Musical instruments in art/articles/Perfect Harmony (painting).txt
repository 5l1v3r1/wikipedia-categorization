Perfect Harmony or Perfect Accord (French - L'Accord parfait) is a 1719 painting by Antoine Watteau, now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was the pendant to the same artist's The Surprise. It was initially owned by a friend of the artist, Nicolas HÃ©nin, but it and Surprise were sold separately by his heir around 1756.
