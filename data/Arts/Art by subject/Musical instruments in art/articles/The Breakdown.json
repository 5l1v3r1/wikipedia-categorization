It depicted a musician playing the <a href=\"/wiki/Saxophone\" title=\"Saxophone\">saxophone</a> while a naked woman dances. It was withdrawn from the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Academy_Summer_Exhibition\" title=\"Royal Academy Summer Exhibition\">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1926 after one week, and destroyed, but Souter preserved his preparatory drawings and made a second version in the 1960s.\n</p><p>In the painting, the woman has short <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_cut\" title=\"Bob cut\">shingled</a> hair; her eyes are closed, as if she is in a trance; and her discarded clothes and shoes lie on the ground, with just one green earring visible. The musician is in full <a href=\"/wiki/White_tie\" title=\"White tie\">white tie</a> evening dress with a <a href=\"/wiki/Top_hat\" title=\"Top hat\">top hat</a>; he sits on a cast down and broken classical statue of <a href=\"/wiki/Minerva\" title=\"Minerva\">Minerva</a>, the goddess of music.  The musician is black and the woman is white, playing on contemporaneous concerns about the popularity of (largely black) <a href=\"/wiki/Jazz_music\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jazz music\">jazz music</a> to the (largely white) British public, and the perceived threat posed by black men to white women.\n</p><p>Souter's stated intention was to \"illustrate the tendency nowadays for Jazz influence to permeate our daily lives\", and to \"suggest the fascination exercised by the primitive and savage upon the over-civilised\".  The title as a reference to a <a href=\"/wiki/African-American_dance\" title=\"African-American dance\">slave dance</a> called the \"break down\", and to the breakdown of traditions.\n</p><p>The painting was exhibited at the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Academy_Summer_Exhibition\" title=\"Royal Academy Summer Exhibition\">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1926, which opened on 3 May, the day before the start of the <a href=\"/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike\" title=\"1926 United Kingdom general strike\">1926 General Strike</a>.  The painting was viewed by King <a href=\"/wiki/George_V\" title=\"George V\">George V</a> and praised by the <a href=\"/wiki/President_of_the_Royal_Academy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"President of the Royal Academy\">President of the Royal Academy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Frank_Dicksee\" title=\"Frank Dicksee\">Frank Dicksee</a>, as \"a work of great promise by executed with a considerable degree of excellence\". However, it quickly became controversial. It was condemned in newspapers and periodicals from the UK \u2014 an early edition of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Melody_Maker\" title=\"Melody Maker\">Melody Maker</a></i> reported that \"'Breakdown' is \u2026 a picture entirely nude of the respect due to the chastity and morality of the younger generation \u2026 the best thing that could happen to it is to have it \u2026 burnt!\" \u2014 to the US \u2014 the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Boston_Evening_Transcript\" title=\"Boston Evening Transcript\">Boston Evening Transcript</a></i> criticised it under the headline \"A Racial Outrage\" \u2014 and South Africa, where the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Argus\" title=\"Cape Argus\">Cape Argus</a></i> called it a \"problem picture \u2026 Negro Supersedes Minerva\".  It was removed after only five days at the request of the <a href=\"/wiki/Colonial_Office\" title=\"Colonial Office\">Colonial Office</a> and replaced by a portrait of Lady <a href=\"/wiki/Diana_Manners\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Diana Manners\">Diana Manners</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/James_Jebusa_Shannon\" title=\"James Jebusa Shannon\">James Jebusa Shannon</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Evelyn_Waugh\" title=\"Evelyn Waugh\">Evelyn Waugh</a> attended the exhibition in its first week. The controversy over the painting may have inspired him to include a mixed-race relationship between the white Margot and black Chokey in his 1928 novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/Decline_and_Fall\" title=\"Decline and Fall\">Decline and Fall</a></i>.\n</p><p>Souter destroyed the painting, but kept his preparatory drawings. For decades it was only known from a photograph published in the exhibition catalogue, but Souter made a second version in the 1960s.
