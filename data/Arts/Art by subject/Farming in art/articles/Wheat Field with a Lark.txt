In 1887, while Vincent van Gogh was residing in Paris, he executed an oil painting commonly known as Wheat Field with a Lark. The center part shows a partially harvested field of wheat under a sky patterned with light clouds. A lark takes flight toward the upper left of the canvas. The painting measures 54 x 65.5 cm (approximately 21-1/4 x 25-3/4 inches) and is housed in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
