The Cotton Pickers, 1876 is an oil painting by Winslow Homer of two young African-American women in a cotton field. Stately, silent and with barely a flicker of sadness on their faces, the two black women in the painting are unmistakable in their disillusionment: they picked cotton before the war and they are still picking cotton afterward.  It is oil on canvas, 24 1/16 x 38 1/8 in. (61.12 x 96.84 cm).  The painting is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
