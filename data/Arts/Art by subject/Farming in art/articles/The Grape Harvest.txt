The Grape Harvest or Autumn (Spanish: La vendimia o El Otoño) is a 1786 oil on canvas painting by Francisco Goya which depicts a man in autumn-colored clothes with his wife and son. A peasant is presenting them with a sample of the year’s grape harvest.  The piece has been held by the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1870.
