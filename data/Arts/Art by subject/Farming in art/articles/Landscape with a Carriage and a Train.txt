Landscape with a Carriage and a Train is an oil painting by Vincent van Gogh that he painted in June 1890 when he lived in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.    Van Gogh spent the last few months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, a small town just north of Paris, after he left an asylum at Saint-RÃ©my in May 1890.  He made the painting in the week following his portraits of Dr. Gachet.  The viewpoint from above was a favourite perspective of his since his days sketching in the dunes of Scheveningen at The Hague with the aid of a perspective frame.  Van Gogh described the painting in a letter to his sister Wil:  The painting is in the collection of the  Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow.
