Sharon Lutheran Church and Cemetery is a historic Lutheran church and cemetery located near Ceres, Bland County, Virginia. The church was built in 1883, and is a one-story, frame church, four bays long, with round-arched, stained-glass windows and a gable roof.  It features a projecting square tower with a bell-cast pyramidal roof and cross finial on the entrance facade.  The adjacent cemetery was established in 1817, and includes a collection of rare Germanic gravestones which are stylistically related to those found in the outlying churches of the Wythe County German settlements.
