The Tomb of Philip the Bold is a  funerary monument commissioned by the Duke of Burgundy Philip the Bold (d. 1404) for his burial at Chartreuse de Champmol. The monument was primarily built by Claus Sluter,  with contributions by Jean de Marville and Claus de Werve. Jean Malouel, official painter to the duke, is responsible design aspets.  Today it is housed in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon. The tomb was influential; Jean duc de Berry commissioned a similar work for his own burial.  The monument is made from alabaster, marble stone, gild, and paint.  It shows Philip's sarcophagus effigy in repose with his hands upright and clasped in prayer. An angel with gilded wings holds a cushion for his head. He rests on a black marble slab, with a lion at his feet. Below him are 41 statuettes pleurants standing in pairs in Gothic niches, arranged in a mourning procession. It was badly destroyed during the French revolution, and restored in the 19th century.  Philip acquired the domain of Champmol, near Dijon, in 1378 to build the Chartreuse de Champmol, a Carthusian monastery, intended to house the tombs of his dynasty. He was buried in the choir of Chartreuse de Champmol on 16 June 1404, with his organs sent to the church of Saint Martin at Halle. In 1792, his body was re-interred at Dijon Cathedral. The following year his tomb was damaged by revolutionaries and looters. It was restored in the first half of the 19th century.
