Józef Brandt (1841 in Szczebrzeszyn – 1915 in Radom) was a Polish painter, best known for his paintings of battles. Brandt studied in Warsaw in the school of J.N. Leszczynski and at the Noblemen's Institute. In 1858 he left for Paris to study at the Ecole centrale Paris but was persuaded by Juliusz Kossak to abandon engineering in favor of painting.  He studied as a painter in Munich under Franz Adam and Karl Piloty and then opened his own studio. His paintings mostly study 17th-century military life, though he has also made some studies of Polish peasant life. Brandt's 19th century manor house in Orońsko together with surrounding park serves today as the Centre of Polish Sculpture.
