River Landscape with a Boar Hunt (Dutch - Rivierlandschap met everzwijnjacht) is a c.1600 painting by the Dutch artist Joos de Momper, now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The artist uses a high point of view as in Altdorfer's The Battle of Alexander at Issus (1528-1529) and Brueghel's The Hunters in the Snow (1565). Later he mostly used a lower point of view, establishing what would become a typical feature of 17th century Dutch and Flemish landscapes such as Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede.
