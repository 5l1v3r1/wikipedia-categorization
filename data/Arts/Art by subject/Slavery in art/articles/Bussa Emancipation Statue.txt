The Emancipation Statue is a public sculpture symbolising the "breaking of the chains" of slavery at Emancipation. It is located in Barbados, east of Bridgetown at centre of the J.T.C. Ramsay roundabout formed at the junction of the ABC Highway and Highway 5.  Many Barbadians refer to the statue as Bussa, the name of a slave who helped inspire a revolt against slavery in Barbados in 1816, though the statue is not actually sculpted to be Bussa. The statue, made of bronze, was created in 1985 by Bajan sculptor Karl Broodhagen 169 years after the rebellion. Lick an Lock-up Done Wid, Hurray fuh Jin-Jin [Queen Victoria]. De Queen come from England to set we free  Now Lick an Lock-up Done Wid, Hurray fuh Jin-Jin This was the chant of thousands of Barbadians when apprenticeship was abolished in 1838, signifying their freedom and happiness.
