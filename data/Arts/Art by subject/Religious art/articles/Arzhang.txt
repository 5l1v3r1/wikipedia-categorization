Western Eastern Syrian-Egyptic Samaritan Baptist sects Alexandrian Christian Gnosticism Abrahamic Persian Chinese Modern The Arzhang (Aržang, a Parthian word meaning "Worthy") was one of the holy books of Manichaeism. It was written and illustrated by its prophet, Mani, in Syriac. It was unique as a sacred text in that it contained numerous pictures designed to portray the events in the Manichaean description of the creation and history of the world, which were regarded as integral to the text.  In Islamic tradition Mani was regarded as an artist by profession. The book has been lost and its content is unknown. However, it is known that its illustrations were of appreciable quality, and copies were preserved in the Middle East as late as 1092 AD, when it is recorded that the library of Ghazni held a copy. In addition, Arzhang is the name of the daeva (demon) in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh who takes Kay Kāvus to Mazanderan, and whom Rostam defeats in his sixth trial.
