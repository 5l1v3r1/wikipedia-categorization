The Madonna and Child with Two Angels is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, dating to c. 1468-1469. It is now in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, in Naples.  The work was once attributed to Filippino Lippi, master of Botticelli. The composition essentially derives from Botticelli's master (and Filippino Lippi's father) Filippo Lippi.   The faces and other details suggest around the same period of the Fortitude and the other juvenile Madonnas of the Italian painter. The composition is similar to Verrocchio's Madonna of the Milk, probably dating to a year or two earlier.
