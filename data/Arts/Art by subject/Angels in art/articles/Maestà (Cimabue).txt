The Maestà is a painting by the Italian artist   Cimabue, painted around 1280 and housed in Musée du Louvre of Paris, France. It was acquired by the Louvre in 1813, as part of the Napoleonic spoiling of artworks in Italy, together with Giotto's Stigmata of St. Francis, also from San Francesco. The work is considered to be from around 1280, thus preceding the Santa Trinita Maestà. It is also stylistically earlier to that work, being painted without pseudo-perspective, and having the angels around the Virgin simply placed one above the other, rather than being spatially arranged. The throne is similar to the Maestà painted by Cimabue in the Basilica of San Francesco di Assisi (1288–1292). This work established a new canon for the Madonna with Child theme, which was subsequently used by other painters, such as Duccio di Buoninsegna in his Rucellai Maestà.
