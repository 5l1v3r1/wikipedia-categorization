The Adoration of the Magi  is an oil painting on wood panel by Netherlandish artist Hieronymus Bosch, executed around 1475. It is housed in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, US. A prominent feature of this painting is the strong perspective effect  and also the copious use of gold leaf which is not very typical for Bosch.  The pigments employed are red lake, azurite, lead-tin-yellow and ochres.  The precise authorship of this panel is and has been disputed, but in 2016 the Bosch Research and Conservation Project attributed it to Bosch based on evidence in the underdrawing.
