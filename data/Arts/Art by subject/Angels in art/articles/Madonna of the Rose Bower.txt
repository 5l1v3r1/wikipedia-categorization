Madonna of the Rose Bower (or Virgin in the Rose Bower) is a panel painting by the German artist Stefan Lochner, usually dated c 1440-42, although some art historians believe it contemporaneous with his later Dombild Altarpiece. It is usually seen as one of his finest and most closely detailed works.  The Virgin is presented as "Queen of Heaven", and is seated under a canopy with red curtains held apart by angels. She sits on a red cut velvet bolster, holding the Christ child in her lap.  Her crown and medallion are symbols of her virginity.  She wears a minutely detailed brooch, which contains a representation of a seated maiden holding a unicorn.  Christ holds an apple, while hovering and seated angels offer gifts or play music. Five kneel in the grass before her, with instruments including a portable organ, others bear fruit. The painting is heavily infused with symbols of innocence and purity, including the red and white roses.  Mary sits before a curved stone bench, around which grow lilies, daisies and strawberries, with an acanthus flower blooming to her left. Mary herself is presented on a monumental scale, underscoring her regal status.
