Agony in the Garden is a painting by the Italian artist Andrea Mantegna between 1458 and 1460. It is conserved at the National Gallery in London. Mantegna's brother-in-law, Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini, is considered to have been inspired by this painting for his own rendering of Agony in the Garden, painted between 1460 and 1465. Both paintings are conserved at the National Gallery in London.
