The Madonna and Child with an Angel is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli, c. 1465-1467. It is housed in Spedale degli Innocenti of Florence. The painting, one of Botticelli's earliest, reveals Botticelli's close artistic relationship with his teacher, Filippo Lippi, and is modelled on the latter's The Virgin and Child with Two Angels.  With the realistic depiction of his live infant models, Botticelli's Madonna may be the earliest known depiction of the neurological Babinski reflex.
