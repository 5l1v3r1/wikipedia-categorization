Madonna del Sacco (literally Madonna of the Bag) is an oil on panel painting by Perugino, dating to around 1495-1500. It shows the Madonna and Child with the infant John the Baptist and an angel. It is now in the Galleria Palatina in Florence. The figure of Mary is stylistically close to that in the Madonna and Child and the Certosa di Pavia Altarpiece, painted around the same time. She is modelled on Perugino's wife Chiara Fancelli.
