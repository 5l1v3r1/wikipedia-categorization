The Guardian of Paradise (German: Der WÃ¤chter des Paradieses) is an 1889 painting by the German artist Franz Stuck. It shows a glowing angel with bird-like wings and a flaming sword. It was Stuck's first large oil painting. It was entered into the 1889 art exhibition at the Glaspalast in Munich, where it won a gold medal and 6000 Mark. The painting became a breakthrough for Stuck and made him a recognised symbolist artist.  It is kept at the Museum Villa Stuck in Munich.
