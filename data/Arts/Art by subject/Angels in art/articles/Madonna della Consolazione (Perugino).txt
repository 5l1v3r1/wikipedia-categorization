Madonna della Consolazione (Our Lady of Consolation) is a c.1496-1498 oil on panel painting by Perugino, now in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria in Perugia. Produced at the same time as the artist's work on the Sala delle Udienze del Collegio del Cambio, it was completed in April 1498. It was painted for the 'Confraternita dei Disciplinati', also known as the Madonna della Consolazione Confraternity. The figure of Mary is stylistically similar to works for which the artist's wife Chiara Fancelli modelled. Behind her on both sides are kneeling Capuchin monks and above are two symmetrical praying angels, drawn from the same cartoon used by Perugino for his San Francesco al Prato Resurrection, Madonna in Glory with Saints, Gonfalone della Giustizia and other works. The deep landscape background with a town in the distance is typical of the artist. He re-used the composition for the Tezi Altarpiece.
