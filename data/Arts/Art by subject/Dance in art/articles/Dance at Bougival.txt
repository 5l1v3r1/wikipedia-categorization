Dance at Bougival (French: La Danse Ã  Bougival ) is an 1883 work by Pierre-Auguste Renoir currently in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.  It has been described as "one of the museum's most beloved works".  The work depicts two of Renoir's friends, Suzanne Valadon and Paul Lhote.   The setting is the French village of Bougival, about 15 km from the center of Paris. Many Impressionists including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, and Renoir painted scenes there. The painting has been described as one of Renoir's first reversions to a more classical style of painting he learned copying paintings in the Louvre while maintaining the bright palette of his fellow Impressionists.
