Blind Man's Bluff (Spanish: La gallina ciega) is one of the Rococo oil-on-linen cartoons produced by the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya for tapestries for the Royal Palace of El Pardo. The work shows boys and girls playing the popular pastime "blind man's buff" with one figure in the middle blindfolded and holding a large spoon while trying to entice others dancing around him in a circle. The children are dressed in the attire of Spanish aristocrats. Some wear velvet jackets and feather headdresses. The picture is an example of Goya's Rococo period, and is typically lively and with a soft color scheme of pink and yellow in the skirts of women and luminous background scenery. As with many of his tapestry cartoons, it captures a charming moment of life.
