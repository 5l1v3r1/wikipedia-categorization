 Dancing Through Life is a public art work by artist Schomer Lichtner. It is installed on the  Riverwalk in Pere Marquette Park in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The steel sculpture depicts a ballerina "poised prettily" on a cow.  The cow is painted green, purple, blue and yellow, with a black face, white triangular nose and red horns. The ballerina bends one knee to rest on the back of the cow and kicks her other leg overhead. She wears a red and white polka-dotted leotard, white tutu and red ballet slippers. Both arms extend aloft, and she holds a blue fan above her head in one hand. The entire composition incorporates folds and assemblage to create a sense of angularity and dynamism. Dancing Through Life occupies a prominent location at the southern entrance to Pere Marquette Park. Lichtner collaborated with the Riverwalk District BID to contribute to its RiverSculpture! program by placing the sculpture at this location.
