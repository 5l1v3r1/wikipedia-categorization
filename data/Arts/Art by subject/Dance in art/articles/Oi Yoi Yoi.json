Perhaps Hilton's best-known work, it is a free composition depicting a naked white woman.  The central figure is abstracted, with simple black outlines drawn in charcoal of a featureless face, breasts and pubic triangle, and upraised arms.  All four limbs are cut off at the edges of the frame.  The white body contrasts with bold segments of background colour in yellow and red, blue and black.  The work is inscribed on the back \"Oi, yoi, yoi/Hilton/Dec 63\".\n</p><p>According to Hilton, the painting was inspired by a drunken argument with his second wife, <a href=\"/wiki/Rose_Hilton\" title=\"Rose Hilton\">Rose Hilton</a>, who was dancing on a verandah, nude, shouting \"oi yoi yoi\", an expression of frustration or exasperation.  According to his wife, the argument took place in France in the summer of 1962, before they were married.  Hilton has rejected the suggestion that he took conscious inspiration from paintings of dancers and bathers by <a href=\"/wiki/C%C3%A9zanne\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"C\u00e9zanne\">C\u00e9zanne</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Matisse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Matisse\">Matisse</a>, but admitted they were \"probably subconsciously\" important.\n</p><p>The painting was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the <a href=\"/wiki/Venice_Biennale\" title=\"Venice Biennale\">Venice Biennale</a> in 1964.  It was also exhibited in a retrospective exhibition of Hilton's work at the <a href=\"/wiki/Serpentine_Gallery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serpentine Gallery\">Serpentine Gallery</a> in 1974, along with a second version of the same subject, <i>Dancing Woman</i>, which has as similar central figure but more muted background colours limited to blue, black and yellow.  <i>Oi Yoi Yoi</i> was purchased from the artist by the <a href=\"/wiki/Tate_Gallery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tate Gallery\">Tate Gallery</a> in 1974 through <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Waddington_Galleries&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Waddington Galleries (page does not exist)\">Waddington Galleries</a>, and is displayed at <a href=\"/wiki/Tate_Britain\" title=\"Tate Britain\">Tate Britain</a> in London.  <i>Dancing Woman</i> was purchased by the <a href=\"/wiki/Scottish_National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art\" title=\"Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art\">Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art</a> in Edinburgh in 1981.  Both works measure 60 inches (150&#160;cm) by 50 inches (130&#160;cm).\n</p><p>The paintings have similarities with the <a href=\"/wiki/Dancing_Beijing\" title=\"Dancing Beijing\">Dancing Beijing</a> logo for the <a href=\"/wiki/2008_Beijing_Olympic_Games\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"2008 Beijing Olympic Games\">2008 Beijing Olympic Games</a>, designed by <a href=\"/wiki/Guo_Chunning\" title=\"Guo Chunning\">Guo Chunning</a>, which was inspired by the Chinese character <a href=\"/wiki/%E4%BA%AC_(disambiguation)\" class=\"mw-redirect mw-disambig\" title=\"\u4eac (disambiguation)\">\u4eac</a> (j\u012bng, meaning \"capital\"), and also resembles a dancing figure with arms raised, or a runner crossing a finishing line.  Hilton also may have taken inspiration from a Chinese character.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oi_Yoi_Yoi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hilton-oi-yoi-yoi-t01855\"><i>Oi Yoi Yoi</i></a> Tate Gallery</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hilton-oi-yoi-yoi-t01855/text-catalogue-entry\"><i>Oi Yoi Yoi</i>, Catalogue entry</a>, Tate Gallery</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://davidjcollard.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/oi-yoi-yoi.html\"><i>Oi Yoi Yoi</i></a>, David Collard blog, 21 April 2013</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/etours/dance/12\"><i>Dancing Woman</i></a>, National Galleries of Scotland</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/roger-hilton-swinging-out-into-the-void-kettles-yard-cambridge-909510.html\">Roger Hilton: Swinging Out Into The Void, Kettle's Yard, Cambridge</a>, <i>The Independent</i>, 27 August 2008</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2182\nCached time: 20180914052738\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.062 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 43/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 92/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.021/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.86 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   47.679      1 -total\n 56.46%   26.918      2 Template:Convert\n 43.22%   20.609      1 Template:Italic_title\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:39627842-0!canonical and timestamp 20180914052738 and revision id 799335521\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"1963_paintings"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Modern_paintings"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Collection_of_the_Tate_galleries"},{"sortkey":"","*":"British_paintings"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Dance_in_art"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"2008 Beijing Olympic Games"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"C\u00e9zanne"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dancing Beijing"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Guo Chunning"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Matisse"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Roger Hilton"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rose Hilton"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Serpentine Gallery"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tate Britain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tate Gallery"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Venice Biennale"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"\u4eac (disambiguation)"},{"ns":0,"*":"Waddington Galleries"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Italic title"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Convert"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Convert"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Convert/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Convert/text"}],"images":["Hilton,_Oi_Yoi_Yoi.jpg"],"externallinks":["http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hilton-oi-yoi-yoi-t01855","http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hilton-oi-yoi-yoi-t01855/text-catalogue-entry","http://davidjcollard.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/oi-yoi-yoi.html","http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/etours/dance/12","https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/roger-hilton-swinging-out-into-the-void-kettles-yard-cambridge-909510.html"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Oi_Yoi_Yoi","byteoffset":2256,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"<i>Oi Yoi Yoi</i>","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"displaytitle","*":"<i>Oi Yoi Yoi</i>"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17017634"}]}}
