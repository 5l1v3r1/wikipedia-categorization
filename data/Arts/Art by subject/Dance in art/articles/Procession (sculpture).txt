Procession (September 1982) is an outdoor sculpture by Dallas Cole and Scott Wylie, the latter of whom designed the bricks and tiles, installed outside the west entrance of the Hilton Hotel's Conference Center. Additional contributions were made by Jill Perry and Joanne Haines.   It depicts five Egyptian figures, including two dancers, two water bearers, and one person surrounded by five birds and a turtle; the intricate background includes grapes and leaves, with wavy tiles possibly representing the flow of water. The mural measures 10 feet (3.0 m), 4 inches (10 cm) x 30 feet (9.1 m), 6 inches (15 cm). One plaque set into the work reads, SEPTEMBER, 1982 / DALLAS COLE / SCOTT WYLIE / JILL PERRY / JOANNE HAINES. An indoor plaque nearby reads, PROCESSION / DALLAS WILLIAMS COLE / 1982.  The sculpture was surveyed and deemed "treatment needed" by the Smithsonian Institution's "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" program in October 1993. It was administered by the Cultural Services Division of the City of Eugene's Recreation and Cultural Services Department at that time.
