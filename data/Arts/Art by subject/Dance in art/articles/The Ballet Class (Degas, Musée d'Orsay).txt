The Ballet Class (French: La Classe de danse) is a painting by Edgar Degas, which was painted between 1871 and 1874.  It is in the collection of the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris, France.  It was commissioned by Jean-Baptiste Faure.  Degas temporarily abandoned work on this painting, and delivered a work of a similar name to Faure.  The painting depicts dancers at the end of a lesson under ballet master Jules Perrot.  Perrot and Degas were friends, and Degas painted the Dance class in the Paris Operah house a year after it burnt down.
