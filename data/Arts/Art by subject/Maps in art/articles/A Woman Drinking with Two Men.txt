A Woman Drinking with Two Men is a 1658 painting by Pieter de Hooch, an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is part of the collection of the National Gallery, London. This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote;  "183. GIRL WITH TWO CAVALIERS (or, Interior of a Dutch House). Sm. 49. ; de G. 37.   At a table by a broad double window, to the left of a room with wooden rafters and a pavement or black and white tiles, sit two gentlemen. One, at the farther side of the table, faces the spectator ; he wears a hat, and with smiling face holds a pipe in each hand in the attitude of a fiddler. The other, seated before the table in profile to the left, holds his plumed hat on his knee, with his right hand above it. He looks at a girl, with her back to the spectator, who stands close to the window. She holds up a glass of wine in her right hand, as if she were about to give it to the cavalier with the pipes. A servant-girl comes from the right with a pan of burning peat. Behind her is a chimney-piece with two pilasters, above which hangs a large figure-piece. Between the chimney-piece and the window to the left is a map. Signed " P. D. H. " ; canvas, 29 inches by 25 inches. Mentioned by Waagen (i. 403) in the collection of Sir Robert Peel ; and by Ch. Blanc, Le Tresor de la Curiosité (ii. 220).  Sales: Now in the National Gallery in London, No. 834 in the 1906 catalogue."
