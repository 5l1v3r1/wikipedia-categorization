Le Rêve Transformé (in English, The Transformed Dream) is a 1913 painting by the Italian metaphysical painter Giorgio De Chirico. This work contains the classic De Chirico's images of an empty urban scene at late evening with a ghostly train on the horizon. In this case in the foreground is an arrangement of bananas, pineapples and a Greek sculpture.
