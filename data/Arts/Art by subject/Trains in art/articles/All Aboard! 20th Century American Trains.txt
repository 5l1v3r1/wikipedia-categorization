In August 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a set of 33Â¢ postage stamps entitled All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains to "pay tribute to American industry and design, and specifically to the heritage of our railroads." Artist Ted Rose  created five watercolor images depicting the following celebrated American named passenger trains from the 1930s and 1940s:   Descriptive text regarding each of the trains was listed on the gummed side of each stamp.   At the same time, the USPS offered for sale a booklet of "20 U.S. Postal Service Ready-To-Mail Stamped Postal Cards" which contained four sets of the five paintings.
