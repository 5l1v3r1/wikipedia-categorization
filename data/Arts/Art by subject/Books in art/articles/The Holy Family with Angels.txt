In the foreground of Joseph's carpenter's workshop, the Virgin Mary sits on a low chair, holding a large open book on her left arm. She rests her left foot on a foot-warmer and leans over to the left to draw the green curtain of the cradle in which the Child lies asleep under a red fur-lined coverlet. Mary wears a deep red gown and dark blue skirt, and a white kerchief and cap. Behind her in half-shadow, Joseph, in a brown working-dress, is shaping a yoke with his axe.

Rembrandt portrays the Holy Family as a typical family of Amsterdam in his day. In the foreground Jesus is asleep in the same style of wicker crib that can be seen in period paintings of mothers with babies by Pieter de Hooch. Mary looks up from her book to take a peek at the sleeping child under the crib curtain (Dutch: klamboe). In the background Joseph is working on making a yoke.The yoke refers both to the coming of the Lord according to Isaiah  ("For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian"), as well as the words of Jesus according to Matthew the Apostle ("Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light").
