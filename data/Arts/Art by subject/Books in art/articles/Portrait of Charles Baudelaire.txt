Portrait of Charles Baudelaire is a portrait of the poet Charles Baudelaire by Gustave Courbet. The artist himself dated it to 1840, but it seems to have mostly been painted around 1847, a year in which the poet and the painter met frequently. It was shown in the Courbet Pavilion at the 1855 Exposition Universelle and was bought four years later by the publisher Auguste Poulet-Malassis, who then nominally sold it to Charles Asselineau on 15 June 1862 to prevent it being seized. Alfred Bruyas acquired it for 3000 francs and in 1876 gave it to the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier, where it still hangs.
