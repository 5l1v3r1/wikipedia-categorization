St. Mark is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1625. It was purchased from the art dealer Colnaghi, London in September 2013 for the Pushkin Museum and donated to that museum in November that year, where it still hangs. The painting shows St. Mark leaning on a pile of books with a lion at his elbow.  This painting was documented in the 18th-century but was rediscovered in the 1970s, when it was identified by Claus Grimm as one of four lost paintings by Hals of the evangelists.  At the time the painting had a collar painted over the beard and robe and was attributed to Luca Giordano.  In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Seymour Slive included a photo of the before picture to show why the painting had been lost for so many years.
