Alma Mater is a bronze sculpture of the goddess Athena by Daniel Chester French which is located on the steps leading to the Low Memorial Library on the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City. Using Audrey Munson as a model,   French designed the statue in 1901 and installed it in September, 1903.  It was donated in memory of alumnus Robert Goelet of the Class of 1860 by his wife, Harriette W. Goelet.  Alma Mater has become a symbol of the university. An owl, a symbol of knowledge and learning,  is hidden in the folds of Alma Mater's cloak near her left leg   and college superstition has it that the first member of the incoming class to find the owl will become class valedictorian. The legend at another time was that any Columbia student who found the owl on his first try would marry a girl from Barnard. When the statue was originally installed it was gilded in gold.    Over time, the original gilding wore off and the few remaining flakes were removed in 1950.    In 1962, the University made the decision to have the gilding reapplied; however, the new gilding was removed after protests.  In the early morning hours of May 17, 1970, a bomb was planted on the statue. The resulting explosion caused significant damage to Alma Mater's throne.  The damage remained until 1978, when the statue was removed from Columbia.  The throne was recast and the sculpture was cleaned, refinished with a new patina, and returned to the Low steps.
