Familok is a type of house for many families, designed for workers of the heavy industry, mainly coal miners, built at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in the cities and towns of Poland. "Familok" is a Silesian way of pronouncing the original German name, Familien-Block (lit. family apartment house). In several towns they are protected by conservationists and renovated due to the historical significance. The protected familoks include the ones in Nikiszowiec of Katowice, Kolonia Zgorzelec in Bytom, Ruda Śląska, cities situated in Poland, and Bohumín situated in Karviná District, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic, on the border with Poland.
