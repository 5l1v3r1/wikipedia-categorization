O Norte - Oficina de Criação is a creative studio based in Recife, Brazil. The studio was founded by Lula Marcodes, Chico Rocha, and Bruno Lima in 1998. They are particularly well known for their interdisciplinary approach to architecture. Their influence stems as much, if not more, from their contributions to the theory and criticism of architecture as from their built works. These are sometimes in the form of written work, but more often are in the form of paintings, installation art, or video art. The studio is a center for architecture, visual arts, and video production.  Its free-form philosophy opens its doors to groups and organizations such as Grupo Såo Bento Pequeno de Capoeira Angola (GSBP), the Indigenous Association of Xukuru People, Habitat for Humanity, and other university related activities that contribute to the artistic, cultural, and social fabric of Brazil.
