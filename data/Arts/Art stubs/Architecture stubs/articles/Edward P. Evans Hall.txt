The Edward P. Evans Hall is the main building of the Yale School of Management at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S. Designed by Foster and Partners, it was named for alumnus Edward P. Evans, and completed in 2013. The building was completed in 2013.  Construction costs reportedly totalled $189 million,  $50 million of which was donated by alumnus Edward P. Evans.   The four-story building with an enclosed courtyard includes classrooms, offices, and student and meeting spaces.   The building was dedicated in January 2014.  Evans, who became its namesake, died before its completion.  The building was designed by Foster and Partners.  In ARCHITECT: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects, the official magazine of the American Institute of Architects, Thomas de Monchaux noted "each area between the elliptical classrooms and curved glazing features lively gatherings on banana-shaped furnishings—evoking something between a conversation pit and an airport gate".  In the Architects' Journal, Ellis Woodman wrote that "Evans Hall's language of full-height, circular, hollow-section columns ranged in front of an expanse of glazing hardly represents a departure for the practice".  Both Woodman and de Monchaux compared the building to the Carré d'Art in Nîmes, France, also designed by Forster and Partners.
