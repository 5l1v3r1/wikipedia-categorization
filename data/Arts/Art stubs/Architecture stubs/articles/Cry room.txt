A cry room or crying room is a space designed for people to take babies or small children for privacy or to reduce the disturbance of others. They are usually found in churches, theatres, and cinemas.   In some venues, they are called "infant care rooms".  Cry rooms are often designed with soundproofing properties to dampen the sounds made within. Many are equipped with a speaker system to allow the occupants to continue to listen to the main presentation, be it a church service or performance in a theatre.  Some churches have cry rooms for when a child becomes "out of control, disruptive enough to distract people, or makes it hard for others to hear or contemplate".  Cry rooms are used in theatres and cinemas to allow a child to be taken out of the main auditorium while still allowing the accompanying adult to watch the performance.
