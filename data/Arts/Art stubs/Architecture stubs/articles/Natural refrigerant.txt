Natural refrigerants are substances that are viable, environmentally sustainable, natural substitute refrigerants, used in refrigeration systems (including refrigerators, HVAC, and air conditioning). They are alternatives to hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based refrigerants. Unlike other refrigerants, they are not synthetic chemicals that are not ever found in nature. HFC, HCFC, CFC classes of chemicals are all potent greenhouse gases.  HCFC and CFC classes of chemicals are damaging to the ozone layer, with CFCs being a primary culprit.  Natural refrigerants, though they may exist in nature, are not in themselves harmless or nontoxic.
