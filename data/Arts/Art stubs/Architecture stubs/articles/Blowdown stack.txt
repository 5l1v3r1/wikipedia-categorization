A blowdown stack is a chimney or vertical stack that is used to vent the pressure of components of a chemical, refinery or other process if there is a process problem or emergency. A blowdown stack can be used to complement a flare stack or as an alternative.  The purpose is to prevent 'loss of containment' of volatile liquids and gases. The failure of the blowdown stack to contain hydrocarbons vented from a raffinate splitter led to the catastrophic Texas City Refinery explosion in 2005.
