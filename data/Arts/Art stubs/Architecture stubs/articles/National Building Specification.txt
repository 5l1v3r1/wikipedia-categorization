NBS is a UK-based system of construction specification used by architects and other building professionals to describe the materials, standards and workmanship of a construction project.  It was launched in 1973 and is now used by over 5000 offices.  The NBS is owned by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) via its RIBA Enterprises subsidiary.   A specification often forms part of the tender documentation along with architectural drawings for a contractor to price and then forms part of the contract documentation for the builder to construct the building. Since 1988 the NBS has been structured on the Common Arrangement of Work Sections.  In 2012, the NBS launched the National BIM Library, featuring a range of generic and proprietary construction elements suitable for building information modeling.
