The Alvar Aalto Medal was established in 1967 by the Museum of Finnish Architecture, the Finnish Association of Architects (SAFA) and the Finnish Architectural Society. The Medal has been awarded intermittently since 1967 when the medal was created in honour of Alvar Aalto.   The award is given in recognition of a significant contribution to creative architecture. The award was given earlier at the Alvar Aalto Symposium, held every three years in Jyväskylä, Aalto’s home town. Recently the ceremony has been organized on Aalto's birthday, February 3rd, today the Finnish national Day of Architecture.  The Alvar Aalto Medal is awarded again in 2017 and the medallist will be announced on 12 September 2017 .
