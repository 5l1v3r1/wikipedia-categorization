A beach house is a house on or near a beach, sometimes used as a vacation or second home for people who commute to the house on weekends or during vacation periods. Beach houses are often designed to weather the type of climate they are built in and the building materials and construction methods used in beach housing vary widely around the world.  Beach houses require special paint to protect them from the salt water. If a property is built on sand, it needs foundation with special requirements.   Beach houses are often associated with beach gardens with a special planting and a particular type of leisure use. One of the most famous twentieth century beach gardens was constructed by Derek Jarman at Dungeness, England. It celebrated local materials, native plants and the openness of the site. Other beach gardens have tried to create an isolated microclimate. Swimming pools are popular in beach gardens.  American architect Andrew Geller designed sculptural beach houses in the coastal regions of New England during the 1950s and 1960s.  Popular places for beach houses in the United States includes the Jersey Shore, Long Island, California, Florida and coastal areas of New England, such as Cape Cod, Narragansett, and the Portsmouth area.
