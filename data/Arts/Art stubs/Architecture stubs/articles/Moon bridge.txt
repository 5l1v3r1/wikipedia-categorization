A moon bridge is a highly-rounded arched pedestrian bridge associated with gardens in China and Japan.  The moon bridge originated in China and was later introduced to Japan.    This type of bridge was originally designed to allow pedestrians to cross canals while allowing the passage of barges beneath. When constructed using the climbing ascent and descent this had the further advantage of not using space from the adjoining fields for approaches.  In formal garden design a moon bridge is placed so that it is reflected in still water. The high arch and its reflection form a circle, symbolizing the moon. A wooden moon bridge in the Japanese tea garden at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. A full circle forms due to the shape and reflection of Hongji Bridge at Nanxun, Zhejiang.
