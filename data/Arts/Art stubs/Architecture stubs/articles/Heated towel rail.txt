A towel dryer or a heated towel rail is a feature designed to heat towels before using them. For many years, European hotels have used them as combined towel- dryers/racks.  Towel dryers can be made from different metals such as steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. In some types, brass or copper is used. The finish can be in chrome plating, polished steel, or lacquer. Dryers can be heated electrically (heating cartridge or heating cable), or by circulating hot water (connected to the central heating). Often, a combination of the methods is used. In these cases, the dryer is heated by hot water in wintertime, and by electricity in the summer.  A towel dryer, with high output, can also serve as a radiator in a small bathroom.  Dryers come in a variety of appearances, including: ladder types, turnable types, and others.
