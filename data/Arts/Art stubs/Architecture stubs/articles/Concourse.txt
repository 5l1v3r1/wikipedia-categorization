A concourse is a place where pathways or roads meet, such as in a hotel, a convention center, a railway station, an airport terminal, a hall, or other space. The term is not limited to places where there are literally pathways or roadways or train tracks joining.  An alternate meaning now is "an open space or hall (as in a railway terminal) where crowds gather."   In this meaning as a place where crowds gather, while many persons in any crowd no doubt have followed different paths in their lives to get to the place, there need not be notable specific roadways leading to the place. Examples of concourses include: Earnley Concourse, West Sussex, 2009  Asda supermarket concourse, Llandudno, 2007 Concourse outside City Hall, London. Concourse outside Wembley Arena, 2008 Leeds City bus station concourse, 2007 Leeds railway station concourse, 2009 Liverpool Street concourse, 2009 Los Angeles International Airport Terminal 4 concourse, 2006 London Paddington station concourse, The Lawn, 2009 St Pancras shopping concourse during Christmas, 2011 St Pancras entrance concourse, 2009 Waterloo Station former Eurostar check-in concourse, 2009 Braehead car park concourse, 2008 More recently, "concourse" is often used to refer to a situation where people come together in online presence, even if they don't come together in real physical life.
