A cresset is a metal cup or basket, often mounted to or suspended from a pole, containing oil, pitch, a rope steeped in rosin or something flammable. They are burned as a light or beacon. Cressets mounted on the walls of Renaissance palaces in Italy were the first form of street lighting.  The term can also refer to a lamp where the wick burns in a cup or cavity, which can be of ceramic or stone.
