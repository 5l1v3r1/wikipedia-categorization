The Blagen Block is an historic building in Portland, Oregon's Old Town Chinatown neighborhood, in the United States.  The four-story building was designed by Warren H. Williams and completed in 1888. In 1970, the city's Historic Landmarks Commission designated the Blagen Block as a Portland Historic Landmark.  In 1975, it was listed as a "primary landmark" in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination of the Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District, the building's designation subsequently "translated" to "contributing property" under post-1970s NRHP terminology.  Since 2014, Airbnb has had offices in the building,  opening its office in December of that year.
