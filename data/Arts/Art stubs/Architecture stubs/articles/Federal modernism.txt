Federal modernism is an architectural style which emerged in 1949 after the US General Services Administration (GSA) was created in response to the organizational needs of the US federal government during its time of post-war expansion. "The most gigantic business on earth,"  was established to consolidate the governmentâ€™s building management and general procurement functions. GSA responded to the building needs coming out of the Depression-era and wartime expansion after World War II. The decades of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s stand out as a period of extensive federal government growth, with the number of Federal employees, the Federal budget, and GSA's building-related budget increasing dramatically. Between 1960 and 1976, GSA undertook more than 700 building projects across the United States. These included office buildings, courthouses, post offices, museums, and border stations, located in cities and towns of all sizes.
