The Architecture Foundation is Britain's first independent architecture centre.  Established in 1991, it aims to examine contemporary issues in architectural theory and practice. The Architecture Foundation has organised public exhibitions,  architectural initiatives, competitions  and debates.   Before moving to its previous Carmody Groarke-designed headquarters in Southwark,  the organisation ran the Yard Gallery in Clerkenwell as a temporary space experimenting in different ways of exhibiting and communicating architecture. The Southwark headquarters also operated a project space under the same auspices, again hosting a variety of exhibitions, installations and talks. It left the Southwark space in 2014 due to financial problems.   Under previous director Sarah Ichioka  it gave itself a greater international remit, manifesting itself in 2009 through a series of exchange programmes.  In 2015 it is co-located with London Metropolitan University and has a new director in Ellis Woodman.   Since 2016 The Architecture Foundation is based at Royal College of Art in Kensington.  Since November 2013, the architect Simon Allford, co-founder and director of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, has been chair of the board of trustees.
