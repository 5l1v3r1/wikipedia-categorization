Andaruni (Persian: اندرونی‎ "inside") is a term used in Iranian architecture. In traditional Persian residential architecture, the andaruni, is in contrast to the biruni, and is a part of the House in which the private quarters are established. This is specifically where the women of the house are free to move about without being seen by an outsider (na mahram). The only men allowed in the Andaruni are those directly related to the lord of the house (his sons) and the lord himself, which may include boys under the age of puberty, and guests allowed in under special circumstances. The court (usually in the talar) of the house would usually be situated in the Andaruni.
