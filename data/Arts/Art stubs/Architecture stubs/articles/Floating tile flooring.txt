Floating tile flooring, also called modular tile flooring, includes a range of porcelain and ceramic tile products that can be installed without adhesive or mortar.  Generally, the tile is rectified to precise dimensions, and fused to an interlocking base.  Some products require use of a flexible grout and others have an integrated grout strip.  The advantages include speed of installation, ease of use, reusability, and low cost relative to using traditional tile installation methods.
