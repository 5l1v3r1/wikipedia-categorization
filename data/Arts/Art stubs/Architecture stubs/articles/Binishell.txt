Binishells are reinforced concrete thin-shell structures that are lifted and shaped by  air pressure. They were invented in the 1960s by Dr. Dante Bini who built 1,600 of them in 23 countries. The original Binishells are circular in plan and are reinforced via a system of springs and rebars. Uses range from schools, housing, tourist villages, sports arenas, storage, silos and discothèques. More recently the system is being re-launched by Dante Bini's son Nicoló Bini, AIA. Improvements to the original system include greater architectural flexibility, compliance to international building codes, simplification of the construction process and integration of latest material and passive heating/cooling technologies.
