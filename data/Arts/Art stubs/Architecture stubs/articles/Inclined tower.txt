An inclined tower is a tower that was intentionally built at an incline. The world's most popular inclined tower, although it was not originally projected, designed, or supposed to be inclined, is the Torre di Pisa, in Pisa, Italy. The world's tallest  inclined tower is the tower of Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec, which stands at 165 metres (541 ft).  The Puerta de Europa in Madrid is a matching pair of inclined towers. An inclined tower is used to hold the roof of Schwarzwald-Baar-Center, a mall in Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany. Sometimes transmission towers of powerlines running over steep mountains are built as inclined towers. Many of such electricity pylons can be found at Hoover Dam and in Switzerland. Inclined towers are also used at some aerial tramways as support pillars, and at bridge towers as in the case of Hong Kong–Shenzhen Western Corridor.
