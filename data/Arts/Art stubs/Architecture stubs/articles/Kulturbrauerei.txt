The Berlin Kulturbrauerei (literally "Culture Brewery") is a 25,000 square metres (270,000 sq ft) building complex in Berlin, Germany. Originally built and operated as a brewery, its courtyards and unique architecture have been protected as a monument since 1974 and it is one of the few well-preserved examples of industrial architecture in Berlin dating from the end of the 19th century. It is supported by the Treuhandliegenschaftsgesellschaft (TLG) and operated commercially as a cultural centre in the Kollwitz neighborhood of the Prenzlauer Berg district (Borough of Pankow). It provides cinemas, theatres, clubs and function rooms. It is situated close to the Eberswalder Straße U-Bahn station. Today, regular events, concerts and festivals take place at Kulturbrauerei.
