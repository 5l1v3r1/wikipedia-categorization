 Home: A Short History of An Idea is a book published in 1986 by Canadian architect, professor and writer Witold Rybczynski. Home won the 1986 Governor General's Award for non-fiction. The book is an extended essay on the evolution of domestic living and culture; Rybczynski recounts the history of the material and cultural influences (such as intimacy and privacy, domesticity, ease) as well as ideas about light, air, and efficiency, all of which he claims to have helped shape the idea of comfort.
