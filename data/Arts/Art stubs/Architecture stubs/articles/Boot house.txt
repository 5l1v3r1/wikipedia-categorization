Boot houses were houses built in the United Kingdom after World War I to accommodate the housing boom following the war.  They were named after Henry Boot, whose construction company (Henry Boot Limited), produced an estimated 50,000 houses between the end of World War I and the start of World War II.   Due to a shortage of bricks, boot houses were built using precast reinforced clinker-concrete columns.  Structural tests in the 1980s revealed significant deterioration in the concrete as a result of carbonatation. The Housing Act 1985 provided government grants for homeowners of such "defective" houses.
