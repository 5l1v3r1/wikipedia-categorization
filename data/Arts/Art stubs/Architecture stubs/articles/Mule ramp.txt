A mule ramp, or horse ramp, is a very gently sloping ramp that can be negotiated by pack animals. Originally, mule ramps were used in steep terrain in the open countryside. They usually have steps. Mule ramps were later constructed within large buildings, either as spiral, curved or straight ramps which sometimes had regular level platforms. These are found in churches, castles and other buildings. Later, the very similar equestrian staircases were built as showpieces in palaces, for riders to climb to the upper floors on horseback.
