Grayhall is a historic mansion in Beverly Hills, California, U.S.  The house was built as a hunting lodge for Harry D. Lombard in 1909.  The second owner, Silsby Spalding, added a ballroom to the house in 1919; Silsby went on to serve as the first mayor of Beverly Hills from 1926 to 1929.   In 1919, actor Douglas Fairbanks leased the house and built a tunnel to Pickfair, the house next door that he shared with actress Mary Pickford.   The tunnel was subsequently sealed.  Subsequent owners included actor George Hamilton and financier Bernard Cornfeld.   The house belonged to Mark R. Hughes, the founder, chairman and CEO of Herbalife, from 1992 to 2000.
