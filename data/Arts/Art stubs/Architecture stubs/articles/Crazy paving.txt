Crazy paving is a means of hard-surfacing used outdoors, most frequently in gardens. Paving stones of irregular size and shape are laid in a haphazard manner sometimes with mortar filling the gaps between. The method originated in ancient Rome.  The term may also refer to a pattern seen on computed tomography of the chest, involving lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling.
