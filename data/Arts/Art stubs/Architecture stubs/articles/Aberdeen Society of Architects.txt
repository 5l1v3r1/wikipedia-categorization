  The Aberdeen Society of Architects (ASA) is a chapter of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and represents some 200 Chartered Architects in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray.  ASA's main objective is to promote the interests of architects and architecture within its area. ASA was founded in 1898 and its first president was James Souttar. The logo represents Aberdeen's Kings College Chapel, with its steeple in the form of an imperial crown. It is the only remaining building of the original college.
