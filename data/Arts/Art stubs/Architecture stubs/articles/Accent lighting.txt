Accent lighting focuses light on a particular area or object.  It is often used to highlight art or other artifacts.  Common types of accent lights include wall sconces, floodlights, recessed lights, torch√®re lamps, or track lighting. The brighter light from the accent lamp creates visual interest to a room. Accent lights may also be used to shine light on a stairway, or as in movie theaters, light a walkway. Some accent lights aren't made to shine on a particular object, but are themselves a piece of art with a self-contained light source. Often made with Tiffany glass,  these serve as a piece of functional decor for a home.  Accent lights can also be used outdoors as guides for pathways or to spotlight garden art.
