The Nun's Island gas station was a modernist-style filling station designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1969, one of four buildings by Mies in Nuns' Island, an island in the city of Montreal. It is no longer a working gas station after being converted to a community centre.   It was the first gas station on the island, and the first designed by Mies, who had worked in collaboration with local architect Paul H. Lapointe on the project. The station was commissioned by Imperial Oil.  The borough of Verdun transformed the building into a community arts centre, La Station.  Eric Gauthier was the lead architect on the project, which saw the two glass pavilions rebuilt to their original 3,000- and 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) sizes.  La Station is a community centre for teens and people over 50 years of age. The two main buildings are called  the salle blanche (English: white room) and salle noire (English: black room), after their floor colours. The original glass-enclosed attendant's booth serves as a display case of Mies' and the building's history, with the former fuel dispensers marked by ventilation shafts. The centre uses geothermal energy.  Coordinates: 45°27′36″N 73°32′41″W﻿ / ﻿45.4601°N 73.5446°W﻿ / 45.4601; -73.5446
