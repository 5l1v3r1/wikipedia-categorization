In architecture, an inverted pyramid is a structure in the shape of an upside-down pyramid. The Hanoi Museum and Hong Kong Coliseum are buildings which have an inverted pyramidal shape. The La Pyramide Inversée in Paris is a skylight of this shape. The Tokyo Big Sight's conference tower consists of four inverted pyramids mounted on support bases. The Tempe Municipal Building's inverted pyramidal shape helps in keeping the building cool in summer and warm in winter.  The same applies to Slovak Radio Building in Bratislava, Slovakia.
