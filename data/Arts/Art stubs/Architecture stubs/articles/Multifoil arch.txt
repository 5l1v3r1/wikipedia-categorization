A Multifoil arch is a style of arch that was an architectural element in the Moorish architecture of al-Andalus.   The multifoil arch design was influenced by Islamic art and architecture. Examples are found in the maqsuras and arcades of the Moorish Umayyad Caliphate's mosques, which are located in present-day Spain.  The term is French, "foil" means "leaf." A specific number of foils may be indicated by a prefix: e.g. trefoil for three, quatrefoil for four, etc., or simply multifoil for many.
