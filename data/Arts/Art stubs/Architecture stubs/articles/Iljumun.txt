Iljumun is the first gate at the entrance to many Korean Buddhist temples. Called the "One-Pillar Gate", because when viewed from the side the gate appears to be supported by a single pillar. This symbolizes the one true path of enlightenment which supports the world.   It is the boundary between the Buddhist temple and a human's worldly life.  The gate symbolizes purification and one must leave all of their worldly desires before entering the temple.  The oneness is also a metaphor for non-duality (unity) in spirit and heart.  An image of an iljumun appears on the obverse of the Korean Service Medal.
