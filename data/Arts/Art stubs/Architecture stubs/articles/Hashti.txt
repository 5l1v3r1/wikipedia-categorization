Hashti or Dlan-e-voroudi, in most traditional houses in Iran, is the space one behind the sar-dar (doorway). Hashtis are designed in many different shapes, including octagonal, hexagonal, square and rectangular. In more luxurious homes the hashti has more ornamentation and a seating area.    After the hashti, a series of curved and narrow spaces called "rahro" follow, which usually lead to the home's courtyard. In a mosque, the hashti is designed so as to guide the visitor through purification before prayer.
