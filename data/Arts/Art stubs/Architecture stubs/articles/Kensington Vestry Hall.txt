The Kensington Vestry Hall is a historic building on Kensington High Street in Kensington, London, U.K.. It houses Bank Melli Iran. The Kensington Vestry Hall was built by Thomas Corby  in 1852.   It was designed by architect James Broadbridge.   Its construction was met with dismay by ratepayers, who complained about the outlandish railings.  They were finally removed in 1880.  From 1889 to 1960, the building housed the Kensington Central Library.  It was dedicated by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll in November 1889.  It has been listed as Grade II by English Heritage since April 15, 1969.  By 1998, it was "the only substantial remnant" of what the street looked like during the Victorian era.  It is now home to Bank Melli Iran.
