The Hôtel de Ville is a historic building in Arras, Pas-de-Calais, northern France. It was built in the sixteenth century, and completed in 1517.  It was restored in the nineteenth century, and re-dedicated on August 26, 1867 by Emperor Napoleon III.  It was then almost  completely destroyed in World War 1  and rebuilt during the 1920s, using some modern materials where practicable.  This can most obviously be seen inside the tower, where the main supporting structure is concrete. It has been listed as an official national monument since 1921.
