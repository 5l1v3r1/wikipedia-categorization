Kanazawa Umimirai Library is a public library located in Kanazawa city, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. This is a contemporary building by the Japanese architects Kazumi Kudo and Hiroshi Horiba, completed in 2011.  Its surface creates a decorative grid made of some 6000 small circular blocks of glass which puncture the concrete surface of the building in a triangular array.  The firm that designed the library, Coelacanth K&H, describe the building as a "simple space"  of 45m by 45m and 12m high. It was completed in March 2011. The floor area is 5,641.9 square metres; the building's area is 2,311.9 square metres. The "single quiet and tranquil room ... resembles a forest, filled with soft light and a feeling of openness reminiscent of the outdoors".  Hiroshi Horiba and Kazumi Kudo won a Japan Institute of Architects Prize for the library in 2013.  Coordinates: 36°35′39″N 136°36′15″E﻿ / ﻿36.5943°N 136.6043°E﻿ / 36.5943; 136.6043
