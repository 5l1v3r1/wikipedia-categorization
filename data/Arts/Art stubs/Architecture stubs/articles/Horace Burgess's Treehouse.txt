Horace Burgess's treehouse (also known as the Minister's Treehouse) is a treehouse and church in Crossville, Tennessee. Construction began in 1993, mostly by Burgess who says he had a visionary commandment from God to build a treehouse, and has continued since. Today it is a popular local attraction which has been unofficially called the largest tree house in the world. It was closed by the state in 2012 for fire code violations. Horace Burgess, a local Minister, was praying in 1993 when he claims God told him, "If you build a tree house, I'll see that you never run out of material."  Inspired by the vision, Burgess began building the treehouse. As of 2013,  the 97-foot-tall tree house and church is supported by a still-living 80-foot-tall white oak tree with a 12-foot diameter base, and relies on six other oak trees for support.  When not in service, the church doubles as a basketball court.  The treehouse is located on Beehive Lane in Crossville, Tennessee.  It has become a popular tourist attraction.  In August 2012, the structure was closed to public access by the state since it had become a public attraction but did not follow fire safety codes.   Although there is no Guinness World Records category for largest treehouse, it is often referred to unofficially as the world's largest.
