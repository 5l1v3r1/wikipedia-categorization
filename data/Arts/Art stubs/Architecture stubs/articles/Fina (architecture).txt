The fina in Mediterranean architecture is a physical space used in urban design, corresponding to the approximately 1-meter-wide public space alongside buildings. It is used to describe the placement of design items within traditional architectural elements. It also mandates public rules of behaviour for the neighbours concerning the usage and maintenance of finas in their buildings. The sabat is a structure built between the opposite buildings on both sides of a narrow street. It must provide a passageway to respect the right of way, and the supporting pillars of the resulting arch must be within the fina.
