Cotesworth is a historic mansion in North Carrollton, Mississippi, USA. The mansion is located on Old Grenada Road in North Carrollton, Carroll County, Mississippi. The mansion was built as an inn in the 1840s.   In 1847, it was acquired by local lawyer  and future United States Senator James Zachariah George, who turned it into a Greek Revival mansion.  He named it after Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.  Two decades after the American Civil War of 1861-1865, in 1887, Senator George built "a free-standing hexagonal library" on the grounds.  The mansion stayed in Senator George's family until 2013, when Katharine Saunders Williams, his great-great-granddaughter, donated it to establish the Cotesworth Culture and Heritage Center.  It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 9, 1978.
