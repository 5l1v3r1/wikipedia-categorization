Eight freestanding gates called Al-Mawazin are located at the top of the staircases leading to the platform of the Dome of the Rock. Each gate consists of open arches supported by 2 to 4 columns, set between two pilasters. One of the reasons mentioned for these doors is that the beauty of the Dome of the Rock should not appear right away, marking a separation between the city and the sacred place.  Gates1. Jaffa 2.
