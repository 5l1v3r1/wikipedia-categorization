The Craftsman was a magazine founded and edited by the American furniture designer Gustav Stickley. It published architectural designs that were influential in creating the American Craftsman  style. It was a relatively short-lived publication, launching its first issue in October 1901 and its last in December 1916. The following year, it was merged with Art World. Stickley's own home in Syracuse, New York, became the first Craftsman home.  Views of its interior and plans were published in The Craftsman in 1903.  The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. A reprint of the 1903 article in The Craftsman forms part of the NRHP nomination document.
