  BASIX or Building Sustainability Index is a scheme introduced by the government of New South Wales, Australia in 2004  to regulate the energy efficiency of residential buildings. It offers an online assessment tool for rating the expected performance of any residential development in terms of water efficiency, thermal comfort and energy usage. It aims to reduce water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to pre-BASIX (2004) buildings. Developers have complained about additional costs for apartment buildings.   Monitoring of occupied BASIX single dwellings conducted by Sydney Water confirmed that the actual water savings were 40.6% in 2008 and 37.6% in 2009.
