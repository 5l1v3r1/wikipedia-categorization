The  cuco is a type of construction made with the dry stone technique, in  Valencia. At the Valencian autonomous community (Comunidad Valenciana) they are located geographically in the regions of the valley of Ayora-Cofrentes, La Costera and La Canal de Navarr√©s. The latter being the one that concentrates the greatest number of these constructions, highlighting quantitatively the entire municipality of Enguera.   They use the raw materials found in their environment, rarely used manufactured materials. Two types of stone are used, the limestone that is used in the body of the construction, the one that holds the cover and the cover stone (tap:  white marls), lighter, on the deck.The typology of the constructions is very varied. The constructions of round plant predominate, although also those of quadrangular plant are frequent. In occasion the cuco adapts to the relief of the land and adopts an irregular plant. The covering systems are all the same. A false dome is built by approaching courses. The covering of the access spans is made with large slabs as a lintel. testimonially other typologies are documented as two slabs supported on both sides of the span, the approach of courses or the adovelado (with dovelas) arch (built with irregular slabs arranged radially. Inside the cucos you can find complementary structures: fireplace, cupboard, manger, etc. They are usually free buildings, although sometimes they are attached to the roadways (terraces); or they can have a quadrangular annex space. They are constructions destined to the refuge and temporary stays of the agriculturists. Its occupation used to be seasonal, coinciding with the moments of greater work in the agricultural parcels. Its use is different from that in other areas of the Valencian Community where it is linked to livestock.
