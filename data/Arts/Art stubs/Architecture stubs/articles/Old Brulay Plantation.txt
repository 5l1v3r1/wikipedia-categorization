The Old Brulay Plantation is a Southern plantation with a historic mansion  located in Brownsville, Texas, USA. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 10, 1975.  The plantation was established circa 1870 by George Paul Brulay, a French immigrant.  It was first a cotton plantation, followed by a sugar plantation.  Because it was established after the American Civil War of 1861-1865, the plantation never hired black slaves.  When tariffs on Cuban sugar were removed c. 1910, the plantation closed down.  It was acquired by immigrants from Japan prior to World War I.  The plantation was purchased by the Nye family in 1931.  By 2016, it still belonged to the same family.
