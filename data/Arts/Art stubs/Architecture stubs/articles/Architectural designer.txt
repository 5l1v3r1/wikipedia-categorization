An architectural designer is a person that is involved in the design of buildings or urban landscapes.  Architectural designers have skills similar to those of architects.  However, they may not hold the same degree qualification and are generally not recognised by a statutory body.  Depending on the jurisdiction, limitations may exist in projects in the work that an architectural designer is permitted to perform without direct supervision from a registered architect. Often, architectural designers who have not registered as architects are referred to as architectural draftspersons or designers as this term is not protected by statute in most countries.  However, in many countries around the world, the term architectural designer and the derivatives of architecture are legally reserved for registered architects.  A measuring technician analyses aerial pictures of rooftops and uses sophisticated software to create 2D and 3D computer drawings of residential and commercial buildings.
