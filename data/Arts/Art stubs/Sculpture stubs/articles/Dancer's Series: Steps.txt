Dancer's Series: Steps is an outdoor 1979 bronze sculpture series by artists Jack Mackie and Charles Greening, installed on the sidewalks of a nine-block stretch of Broadway between Pine and Roy streets in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.   The installation features eight dance patterns, some of which are "imaginary", inlaid in the sidewalk: Lindy, Mambo, Obeebo, Busstop, Foxtrot, Rumba, Tango, and Waltz.  The installation designed and copyrighted in 1979 and dedicated in 1982. It was surveyed and deemed "well maintained" by the Smithsonian Institution's "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" program in April 1995.
