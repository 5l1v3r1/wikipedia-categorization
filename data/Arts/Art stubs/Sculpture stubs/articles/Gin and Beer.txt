Gin and Beer are two wooden statues on display at the Tower of London. They reside in the White Tower and represent the two most important alcoholic beverages of the time. The beverages are mentioned together in the Rudyard Kipling poem Gunga Din: "You may talk o' gin and beer When you're quartered safe out 'ere,"
