The piece stands at 20 feet high and features three shapes that appear to be swirling that are balanced on top of a curled shaft. The shaft sits on a base that is circular. Equipoise 14 sits in front of an office building on the northside of the city. It was installed in 1992 and dedicated in September of that year.   This sculpture is one of an edition of six.
