Inspired by the classic Roman/Egyptian obelisk form, Dauphin County Veteran's Memorial Obelisk was originally erected in the middle of a park located at the North Second and State Streets intersection of downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania from 1866 to 1876 as a tribute to Dauphin County’s Civil War soldiers. It stands 110 feet (33.5 meters) high, weighs over 600 tons, and was cut from stone taken from the banks of the nearby Susquehanna River. A stone plaque is inscribed: "To the soldiers of Dauphin County who gave their lives for the life of the Union in the suppression of the rebellion 1861-1865. Erected by their fellow citizens." The surrounding park was gradually subdivided and developed through the years. After years of exposure, the monument became damaged by passing vehicles and eroded by the weather. A decision was made to refurbish it and relocate it. After a thorough cleaning, the monument was moved to its present location in 1960 at Third and Division streets, near William Penn High School and Italian Lake, in the Uptown section of Harrisburg.
