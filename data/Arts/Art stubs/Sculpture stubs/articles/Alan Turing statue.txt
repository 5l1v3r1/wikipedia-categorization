The Alan Turing statue, created in slate by Stephen Kettle in 2007, is located at Bletchley Park in England as part of an exhibition on Alan Turing.   It was commissioned by the American businessman and philanthropist Sidney Frank (1919â€“2006).  The slate for the sculpture was selected from North Wales because the sculptor learned that Turing used to holiday there as a child and adult.  The slate originated from Llechwedd, near Blaenau Ffestiniog. Turing is depicted seated and looking at a German Enigma machine. He is dressed in a jacket, but there is some deliberate untidiness in his clothing. In 2007, it was commented that the statue acknowledges Turing as a codebreaker but not as a gay icon.  The statue became part of a new exhibition at Bletchley Park on Alan Turing in 2012, the centenary year of Turing's birth.  Sir John Dermot Turing, nephew of Alan Turing, attended the opening of the exhibition and posed with the statue.
