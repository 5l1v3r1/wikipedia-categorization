1.26 is a public art sculpture commission designed by artist Janet Echelman for Denver's inaugural Biennial of the Americas celebration in July 2010. The sculpture's name is a reference the 2010 Chile earthquake which may have resulted in a 1.26 microsecond shortening of the days on Earth.  The sculpture's shape was inspired by NOAA's graphic simulation of the tsunami caused by the earthquake. The sculpture was hung outside the Denver Art Museum between the museum and the Civic Center Park's Greek Amphitheater. The work is installed in Montreal, as of 2016.
