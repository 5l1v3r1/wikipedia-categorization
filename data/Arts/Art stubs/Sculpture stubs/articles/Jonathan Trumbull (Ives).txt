Jonathan Trumbull is an 1872 marble sculpture of Jonathan Trumbull by Chauncey Ives, installed in the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.  It is one of two statues donated by the state of Connecticut.  The sculpture was unveiled by Senator William Alfred Buckingham of Connecticut on March 8, 1872.  The statue is one of two that Ives placed in the collection,  the other being Roger Sherman, also from Connecticut, the state that Ives was born in. Sculptor and critic Lorado Taft in his book The History of American Sculpture is not kind to either Ives of his creations, writes, “Connecticut, with misplaced loyalty to an aspiring son, gave him the commission for the two figures which represent the state in the National Hal of Statuary.  The result may be seen in the two marble images labelled “Trumbull” and “Sherman” which were introduced into that very promiscuous gathering in 1872. Description of these curious works would be unprofitable. They fit in nicely with the majority of their companions, but of all the dead men there they seem the most conscious of being dead.”  Wayne Craven, in the next survey of American sculpture, Sculpture in America adds that both statues were “represented in colonial attire, and were accordingly turned into costume pieces by the sculptor, who was better at rendering ruffles and buttons than at modeling the male figure.”
