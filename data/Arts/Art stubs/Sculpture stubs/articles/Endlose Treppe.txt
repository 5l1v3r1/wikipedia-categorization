The Endlose Treppe (meaning "Endless Steps" in German) is a sculpture made by the Swiss artist Max Bill in 1991 for the philosopher Ernst Bloch. It is made of North American granite.  It stands near the Wilhelm-Hack-Museum in the city-center of Ludwigshafen am Rhein. According to the artist, the 19 winding steps of granite, which stand nearly 10 meters, are supposed to represent Ernst Bloch's "principle of hope".
