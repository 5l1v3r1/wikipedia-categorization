The Bullion Stone is a late carved Pictish stone, which is unusual in containing a figure; it dates to c. 900-950.  It was discovered in 1933 during the construction of a road in Angus, Scotland, and is now located in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. The image on the stone is unique amongst Pictish stones discovered thus far. It depicts a bald, bearded man on a weary horse, carrying a shield and drinking from a very large drinking horn with a bird's head terminal,  a parallel that has been noted to the Torrs Horns, also in the museum, of nearly 1,000 years earlier.
