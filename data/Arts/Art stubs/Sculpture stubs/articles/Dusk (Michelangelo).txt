Dusk is a marble sculpture by Michelangelo, datable to 1524-34. It is a pair with Dawn on the tomb of Lorenzo II de' Medici in the Medici Chapel in San Lorenzo in Florence. Its creation started simultaneously with the resuming of the works at the New Sacristy of Florence, during 1524, after Clement VII's election to the papal throne. The sculpture's termination date remains unknown; however, the works were interrupted during the Siege of Florence and resumed in 1531.
