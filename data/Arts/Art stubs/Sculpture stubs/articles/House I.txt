House I is a sculpture by Roy Lichtenstein.  It is located at the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden.   The house uses optical illusion to play with perspective. To appreciate the full effect, walk at a steady rate along the arc of the sidewalk that runs in front of and nearly perpendicular to the sculpture, with your head turned to one side, facing the sculpture. The house will appear to be spinning in space, like the "Wizard of Oz" house.  It was constructed of painted aluminum, modeled in 1996 and constructed in 1999. Among his last works, it was a part of the House series. House II was shown at the Venice Biennale in 1997,  and House III was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
