Edmund Kirby Smith is a bronze sculpture commemorating the United States Army officer of the same name by C. Adrian Pillars, installed in the United States Capitol Visitor Center as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. The statue was gifted by the state of Florida in 1922.  Smith, who died in 1893, was the last surviving full General of either the CSA or GAR.  After he died his family changed their name to Kirby-Smith to help “distinguish him from the other Civil War “General Smiths” (approx. 35).”  William J. Sears quoted a resolution from the Confederate Congress regarding him at the statue’s unveiling in Congress that praised Kirby Smith’s “…justice, his firmness and moderation, his integrity and conscientious regard for law, his unaffected kindness to the people, the protection of their rights and the redress of their wrongs, and has thus won the confidence of Congress.”  On March 19, 2018, Governor Rick Scott signed legislation replacing the statue with one of African-American educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune.  The statue was to have been moved to the Lake County Historical Museum, in Tavares, Florida,  but there has been significant local opposition.
