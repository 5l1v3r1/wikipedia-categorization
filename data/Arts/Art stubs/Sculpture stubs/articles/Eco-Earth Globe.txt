Eco-Earth Globe, sometimes referred to simply as Eco Earth,   is an outdoor sculpture depicting a globe, located in Riverfront Park in Salem, Oregon, in the United States. The globe, completed in 2003, was converted from an acid storage ball with a 26-foot (7.9Â m) diameter that previously belonged to Boise Cascade, a pulp and paper company. The community art project, conceived by Mayor Roger Gertenrich, was funded by community members.  According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, the sculpture "was an opportunity for students, and talented volunteers from Salem's art community to collaborate and create hundreds of ceramic icons that represent and teach about different cultures".  Mary P. D. Heintzman, a local art teacher and artist, served as the project's art director.
