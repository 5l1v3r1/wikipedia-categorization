Cybele is an outdoor bronze sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, installed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston's Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden, in the U.S. state of Texas. Auguste Rodin's Cybele was modeled c. 1890, enlarged in 1904, and cast in 1982 as edition 3/8.  It is on loan from Iris Cantor and the Cantor Foundation on behalf of B. Gerald Cantor.   The statue depicts the seated "voluptuous" goddess of the same name.    It is one of three Rodin sculptures in the garden; the other two are The Spirit of Eternal Repose (1898–1899) and The Walking Man (1877–1878).
