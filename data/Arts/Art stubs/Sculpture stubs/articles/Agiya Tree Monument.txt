The Agiya Tree Monument or Agia Tree Monument is on the site once occupied by the Agiya tree (Egun: Asisoe Tin) close to the Badagry Town Hall.  The Agiya tree was a 160 feet (49 m) tree with a circumference of 30 feet (9.1 m).  Significantly remarkable for being the tree under which Christianity was first preached in Nigeria by Thomas Birch Freeman and Henry Townsend on September 24, 1842,   the tree lived for over 300 years until it was uprooted by a storm on June 20, 1959.  In place of the tree, an obelisk was erected in 2012 in celebration of 170 years of Christianity in Nigeria.
