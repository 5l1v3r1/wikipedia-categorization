Christopher Columbus is an outdoor 1992 bronze sculpture depicting Christopher Columbus by Joe Incrapera, installed in Houston's Bell Park, in the U.S. state of Texas.  The sculpture was vandalized with red paint in August 2017. John D. Harden, Margaret Kadifa, Mike Morris, and Brooke A. Lewis of the Houston Chronicle noted that the vandalism occurred around the same time that protesters demanded the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials in Houston, and the same day that the city's statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was vandalized with white paint.
