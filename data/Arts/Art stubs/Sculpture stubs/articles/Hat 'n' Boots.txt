Hat 'n' Boots is a roadside attraction and landmark in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.  Built in 1954 as part of a Western-themed gas station, it is billed as the largest hat and cowboy boots in America.  To preserve this landmark, the City of Seattle moved the Hat 'n' Boots to the new Oxbow Park in December 2003. Hat 'n' Boots appeared in the films National Lampoon's Vacation (during the opening credits) and Hype!
