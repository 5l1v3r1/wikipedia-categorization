Along These Lines is an outdoor 2015 stainless steel sculpture and paving medallion by Anne Storrs, installed at the Rhineâ€“Lafayette Pedestrian Overpass landings at the MAX Orange Line's  Southeast 17th Avenue and Rhine Street MAX Station in southeast Portland, Oregon's Brooklyn neighborhood, in the United States. According to TriMet, the pieces were inspired by the "similarity of trees and root systems to the branching pattern of train tracks". The stainless steel rings that circle around both pieces display poetry by Cleveland High School student Monica Arnone and Paulann Petersen, Oregon Poet Laureate Emerita.
