Frans Michael Franzén is an outdoor sculpture located in the city centre in Oulu, Finland. It is the eldest public monument in Oulu.  Bronze bust of Oulu-born poet Frans Michael Franzén was made by Finnish sculptor Erland Stenberg, while he was working in Paris in 1878-1879. Unveiling of the sculpture in 1881 was a major social event in Oulu.  The Church Square on which the bust was erected was later converted to park and named Franzén Park.
