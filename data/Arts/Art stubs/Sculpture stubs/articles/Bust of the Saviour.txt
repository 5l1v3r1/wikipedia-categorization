The Bust of the Saviour (Salvator Mundi) is the last sculpture created by baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, executed in 1679, when the artist was 80 years old. He left the sculpture in his will to his friend and patron Queen Christina of Sweden. Considered lost and "rediscovered" in 2011,  it is currently held in the basilica of di San Sebastiano fuori le mura a Roma.  However, there is some dispute over the authorship of the bust. The art historian Tomaso Montanari believes this version is not by Bernini, pointing instead to the version in the  Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, USA
