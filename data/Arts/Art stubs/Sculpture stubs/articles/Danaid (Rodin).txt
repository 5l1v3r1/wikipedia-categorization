Danaid is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin, based on the account in the Metamorphoses of Hypermnestra, eldest of the Danaids. It was originally conceived as part of his The Gates of Hell but was not included in the final version of that work. It is based on Andromeda, also from Gates. Originally produced in 1890 in marble, bronze casts of Danaid began to be produced in 1891 and are in collections in France as well as the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City.
