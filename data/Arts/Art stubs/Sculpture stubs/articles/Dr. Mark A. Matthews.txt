The cast bronze sculpture is approximately 3.5 feet (1.1 m) tall. It rests on a stone pedestal and base that measures approximately  85 inches (220 cm) tall. An inscription on the front of the best, near the base, reads: REV.DR / MARK.A.MATTHEWS. The bronze plaque on the back of the base reads: ALONZO VICTOR LEWIS / -SCULPTOR-. The front of the base displays the text: TO / THE MEMORY / OF / REV. / MARK A. MATTHEWS / D.D,LL.D / PREACHER OF THE / WORD OF GOD / AND FRIEND / OF MAN / ERECTED BY / HIS FELLOW CITIZENS / 1942.  The memorial was designed in 1941 and dedicated the following year. It was surveyed and deemed "treatment urgent" by the Smithsonian Institution's "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" program in October 1994.
