George Fullard ARA (15 September 1923 â€“ 25 December 1973) was an English sculptor.  Born in Sheffield on 15 September 1923 Fullard served with the 17th/21st Lancers during World War II and was severely wounded at the Battle of Cassino. He studied at the Sheffield College of Arts and Crafts, and the Royal College of Art. By 1958 John Berger, the art critic of the New Statesman, regarded him as Britain's best young contemporary sculptor.  He began to exhibit abroad and win prizes: for example, "Running Woman", which can be seen in the grounds of Upper Chapel in Sheffield city centre,  won a "John Moores" in 1957.  He died on 25 December 1973.
