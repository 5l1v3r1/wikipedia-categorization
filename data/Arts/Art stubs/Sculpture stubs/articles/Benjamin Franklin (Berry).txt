Benjamin Franklin is an outdoor 1942 sculpture depicting the Founding Father of the same name by George Berry, installed outside Franklin High School, in Portland, Oregon's South Tabor neighborhood, in the United States. The sculpture was one of two Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects benefitting Franklin between 1939 and 1942; the other was the construction of the school's athletic field. The statue was funded by Franklin alumni and students, who raised $15,000 to commission an artist from the Federal Art Project, one of WPA's five independent branches. George Berry and his team of assistants created a 40-ton sandstone statue of Franklin, which was erected at the school's north entrance, overlooking the athletic field, in 1942. Including its pedestal, the work measures 15-foot (4.6Â m) tall. The pedestal includes built-in benches and the inscription, "One today is worth two tomorrows."  In 2016, the statue was removed temporary and replaced as part of a major renovation project.
