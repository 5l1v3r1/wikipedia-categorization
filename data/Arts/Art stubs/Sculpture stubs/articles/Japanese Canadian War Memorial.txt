The Japanese Canadian War Memorial is located at Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia.   The light in the Japanese Canadian War Memorial was switched off in 1941 after the attack of Pearl Harbor. In response to the perceived threat, Japanese residents were forced into internment camps. It was only in April 1949 that the all restrictions were lifted from Japanese Canadians. The memorial's light was eventually re-lit on August 2, 1985.
