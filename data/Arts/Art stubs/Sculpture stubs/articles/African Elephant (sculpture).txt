African Elephant is an outdoor 1982 life-size Cor-ten steel sculpture depicting an African elephant by Robert Fowler (with assistance from John Long and Phil Schalekamp). The statue was originally installed at the Houston Zoo's main entrance, but was relocated in 2000, and underwent restoration work at the time.
