American Doughboy Bringing Home Victory, also known as Armistice  and Spirit of the American Doughboy,  is an outdoor 1932 bronze sculpture and war memorial by Alonzo Victor Lewis, originally installed outside Seattle Center's Veterans Hall, and later relocated to Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park, in the U.S. state of Washington. It was originally commissioned in 1921 in plaster and was called American Doughboy Bringing Home the Bacon.  In 1932, funds for a permanent memorial led to the dedication of a bronze cast with "certain changes in appearance from the original". The sculpture was surveyed and deemed "treatment urgent" by the Smithsonian Institution's "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" program in August 1994.  In 1998, the statue was relocated to Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park.
