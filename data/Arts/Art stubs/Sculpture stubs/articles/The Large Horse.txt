The Large Horse (French: Le Grand cheval) is a 1914-31 bronze sculpture by French artist Raymond Duchamp-Villon, installed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston's (MFAH) Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden in Houston, Texas, in the United States. Raymond Duchamp-Villon's Le cheval was designed in 1914. An enlargement from the original plaster made by Duchamp-Villon  to 1 meter, was performed under the supervision of the artists brother Jacques Villon in 1930-1931.  The Large Horse measures 59 x 60 1/4 x 37 3/4 inches. The sculpture was purchased by the museum with funds from its Board of Trustees.  Houston Press called the work "semi-abstract with some cubistic elements but that, more important, roars with its own energy. It reeks of perfection, of a difficult artistic goal not only met but exceeded, and is fascinating and witty. It's clear that we are seeing the talent of genius."
