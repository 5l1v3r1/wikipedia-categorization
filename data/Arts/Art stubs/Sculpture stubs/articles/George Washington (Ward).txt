George Washington is a large bronze sculpture of George Washington by John Quincy Adams Ward, located on the front steps of Federal Hall National Memorial, on Wall Street in New York City. The statue was unveiled in 1883 to commemorate Washington's first inauguration in 1789.  At the time, Federal Hall, which served as the capitol building of the United States, stood on the site, and Washington took the oath of office on the balcony of that building, approximately where the statue now stands.
