The Juno Ludovisi (also called Hera Ludovisi) is a colossal Roman marble head of the 1st century CE from an acrolithic statue of an idealized and youthful  Antonia Minor as the goddess Juno.   Added to the Ludovisi collection formed by Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, it is now in the Palazzo Altemps, Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome. Casts of it are to be seen at the University of Cambridge Classics Dept Casts Gallery.,  Bryn Mawr  and the Goethehaus in Weimar, Germany   and the University of Tartu Art Museum in Estonia.
