Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is an outdoor 2007 bronze sculpture of Martin Luther King Jr. by American artist Ed Dwight,  installed at Hermann Park's McGovern Centennial Gardens in Houston, Texas, in the United States.  The sculpture was vandalized with white paint in August 2017. John D. Harden, Margaret Kadifa, Mike Morris, and Brooke A. Lewis of the Houston Chronicle noted that the vandalism occurred around the same time that protesters demanded the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials in Houston, and the same day that the city's statue of Christopher Columbus was vandalized with red paint.
