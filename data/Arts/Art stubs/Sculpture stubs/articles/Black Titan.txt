Black Titan, is a public artwork by American artist John Spaulding, located on the grounds of the Indianapolis Art Center, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The sculpture is a cast bronze bust of a black man in his early twenties. His features are dramatic - bulging eyes, a large nose, and large ears. His hair is short and cropped. The bust sits upon a concrete base (approx. 37 × 40½ × 54 inches).  The sculpture's concrete base has an inscription reading: By/John/Spaulding.  The Indianapolis Art Center owns the piece which is part of the center's ARTSPARK. The ARTSPARK was designed by Michael Graves with the intention of melding art creation with outdoor gallery space.   The Indianapolis Art Center began in 1934 as the Indianapolis Art League. It moved to the Broad Ripple Village neighborhood north of downtown Indianapolis in 1976. In 1994 the name was changed to the Indianapolis Art Center in order to demonstrate the organization's philosophy of inclusion.   Broad Ripple is one of six areas designated as cultural districts in Indianapolis. The neighborhood is known for being socially and ethnically diverse and supportive of art and culture.
