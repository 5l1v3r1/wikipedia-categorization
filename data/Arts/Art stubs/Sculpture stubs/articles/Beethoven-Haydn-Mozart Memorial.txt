The Beethoven-Haydn-Mozart Memorial (German: Komponistendenkmal) is an outdoor 1904 memorial to the classical composers Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, designed by Rudolf and Wolfgang Siemering and located in Tiergarten, Berlin, Germany.  The monument was commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II. The monument suffered considerable damage during WWII and wasn't fully restored until 2007. After two years of restoration works, the Beethoven-Haydn-Mozart Denkmal was re-erected that year, providing the revitalized monument that can be seen today.
