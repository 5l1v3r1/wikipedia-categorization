The Anglia knight is a sterling silver trophy that was originally commissioned by William III of the Netherlands in 1850 for the Falcon Club, a society that met once per year to compete in horse races, falconry and other sports.  The trophy weighs over 700 troy ounces (22 kg, 48 lbs) and is modelled on the statue of Richard I outside the Palace of Westminster, but was intended to represent the Black Prince. Arguably its most famous use was as the logo of Anglia Television, the ITV station for the East of England, from launch in 1959 until 1988. Shortly before the station's launch, its chairman, Lord Townshend, had spotted the trophy at the Bond Street jewellers, Asprey & Co., and purchased it almost on impulse; Asprey's subsequently added the "Anglia" pennon to the lance.  After 1988, it made brief re-appearances in 1999 and 2009 to celebrate Anglia's 40th and 50th anniversaries respectively. The trophy is currently displayed at ITV Anglia reception in Norwich.
