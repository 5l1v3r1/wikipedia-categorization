The Fountain of Faith is a monumental sculptural group by Carl Milles in Falls Church, Virginia. It is located in National Memorial Park, a large roadside cemetery which also displays a colossal cast of Milles' Sunsinger.  It was inaugurated in 1952 after 12 years of Milles' work.  Each of the fountain's life-size figures evokes a specific individual whom Milles knew before their death.
