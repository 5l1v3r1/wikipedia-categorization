The Idol of Pomos, is a prehistoric sculpture from the Cypriot village of Pomos.  It dates back to the Chalcolithic period, circa the 30th century BC.  The sculpture is on display in the Cyprus Archeological Museum in Lefkosia (Nicosia). The sculpture represents a woman with her arms spread and was probably used as a fertility symbol. Many similar sculptures have been found on Cyprus.  Smaller versions were worn as amulets around the neck, just as this idol wears (a small copy of) itself. In 2008 Cyprus adopted the Euro. The Idol, a representation of Cypriot prehistoric art, was chosen to be displayed on the Cypriot euro coins of 1 and 2 euro.
