The Great God Pan is an outdoor bronze sculpture of Pan by American artist George Grey Barnard currently installed on the grounds of Columbia University.  The work was originally commissioned by one of Barnard's most important patrons, Alfred Corning Clark, for the interior courtyard of The Dakota, an apartment building on Manhattan's Upper West Side. However, it was never installed there. Upon completion, Alfred Corning Clark donated the sculpture instead to Central Park. After Alfred Corning Clark's death, a permanent site for the sculpture could not be determined with Central Park. It was included in several exhibitions, including the Paris Exposition of 1900, Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.  His son, Edward Severin Clark, acting on behalf of his estate, ultimately donated the work to Columbia University.  Charles Follen McKim installed the sculpture as a functional fountain in the northeast corner of the campus in 1907. It is now located across from Lewisohn Hall.
