Abraham Lincoln is an outdoor bronze sculpture of Abraham Lincoln by Henry Kirke Brown, located at Union Square in Manhattan, New York. Cast in 1870 and dedicated on September 16 of that year, the statue was originally installed at the southwest corner of Union Square, where the sculpture of Mahatma Gandhi stands today.  In 1875, a stone and bronze rail fence was constructed around the statue of Lincoln; the fence included an inscription of text from his second inaugural address, “…with malice toward none; charity toward all.”  During the 1930 redesign of Union Square Park, the statue was moved to its current location, but the fence remained. The statue is in axial alignment with the Independence Flagstaff and George Washington. It was conserved in 1992.
