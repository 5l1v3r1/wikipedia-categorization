The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue is a project of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, to publish a comprehensive catalogue of the paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts in the gallery's collection.  The project was established in the early 1980s and the first volume was on early Netherlandish art published in 1986. When complete it will comprise approximately thirty volumes documenting more than 5000 works of art. Prints and drawings were excluded from the project as being too many in number.  The second volume, prepared by Jonathan Brown and Richard G. Mann, covered Spanish paintings of the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries and was published in 1990.
