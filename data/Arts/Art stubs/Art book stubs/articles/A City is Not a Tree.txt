A City is Not a Tree is a widely cited   1965 essay (later published as a book) by the architect and design theorist Christopher Alexander, first published in the journal Architectural Forum, and re-published many times since.   In 2015 the essay was published as a book including new exegesis commentaries on the original essay from other architects, engineers and physicists.   A City is Not a Tree has been widely described as a landmark text, and the Resource for Urban Design Information calls it "one of the classic references in the literature of the built environment and related fields".
