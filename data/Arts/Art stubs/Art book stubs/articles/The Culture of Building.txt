The Culture of Building (Oxford University Press) is a 2006 book by Howard Davis, a professor of architecture at the University of Oregon. It describes how buildings throughout the ages and varied settings are products of a building culture - the "coordinated system of knowledge, rules, procedures, and habit that surrounds the building process in a given place and time".  Davis suggests that this culture is a cross-global phenomenon in which thousands of buildings are produced through shared and predictable methods of working.
