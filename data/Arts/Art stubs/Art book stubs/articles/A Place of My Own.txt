A Place of My Own: The Education of an Amateur Builder was Michael Pollan's second book, after Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (1991). In 2008 it was re-released and re-titled as A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams. The book begins by outlining how Michael reached the decision to build a "writers house", and to build it himself. The second chapter covers the site selection process. The next chapter follows the design process, including references to Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language. The following four chapters: Footing, Framing, The Roof and Windows deal with the construction process. The final chapter covers finishing works and moving in. The book is not a how-to book for first time builder. It is a general overview of the building process, the experiences involved and the motivations of the author. Official Reviews
