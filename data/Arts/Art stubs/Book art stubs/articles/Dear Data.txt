Dear Data is a collection of postcards containing data recorded from the everyday lives of information designers Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Penguin Press on September 1, 2016[better source needed] and in North America by Princeton Architectural Press on September 6, 2016.[better source needed]  It won two 2015 Information is Beautiful Awards, the Most Beautiful Award as well as Gold in the Dataviz Project category.  It was also a finalist for the Innovation By Design Awards 2016 and nominated for the Design Museum Beazley Designs of the Year 2016.  Prior to this year-long collaboration, the co-authors had only met twice. The premise of this project was to test firsthand how well one could get to know someone through reading their data. Postcards were exchanged between them on a weekly basis with the data being represented through a drawing on one side and a detailed key or legend on the other. A few of the topics include: A Week of Negative Thoughts, A Week of A Workspace, and A Week of New Things.  The book is now part of the permanent collection at MoMa.
