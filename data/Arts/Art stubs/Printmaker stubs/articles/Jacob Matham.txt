Jacob Matham (15 October 1571 â€“ 20 January 1631), of Haarlem, was a famous engraver and pen-draftsman. He was the stepson and pupil of painter and draftsman Hendrik Goltzius,  and brother-in-law to engraver Simon van Poelenburgh, having married his sister, Marijtgen.    He made several engravings after the paintings of Peter Paul Rubens from 1611-1615,  and also a series after the work of Pieter Aertsen.   In 1613, engraver Jan van de Velde was apprenticed to him.   He was the father of Jan, Theodor and Adriaen Matham, the latter of whom was a notable engraver in his own right.
