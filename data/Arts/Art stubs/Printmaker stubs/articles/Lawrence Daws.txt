  Lawrence Daws (born 1927) is an Australian painter and printmaker, who works in the media of oil, watercolour, drawing, screenprints, etchings and monotypes. In the 1980s he started making computer prints, and was possibly the first established Australian painter to use this medium. His subjects are often landscapes, including [[desert]]s, of Tasmanian forests and the tropical rainforests of Queensland. Daws grew up on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia, and from 1970 until 2010, lived by the Glasshouse Mountains at Beerwah on the edge of a Queensland rainforest, where many of his best-known works were created.  In the 1960s lived and exhibited in London in solo shows and with other Australians, including Brett Whiteley.  From 1977 he was a Trustee of the Queensland Art Gallery  and was responsible for acquiring some major paintings for the gallery, including a major painting by Victor Pasmore. A biography of Daws was published in 1982, written by Neville Weston.  Griffith University, Brisbane, and University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland have awarded honorary doctorates to Daws.
