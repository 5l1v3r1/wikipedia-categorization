The Kellogg Brothers were a family of lithographers and printmakers in Hartford, Connecticut from about 1830 to the end of the 19th century.  The brothers were Jarvis Griggs Kellogg (1805-1873), Daniel Wright Kellogg (1807-1874), Edmund Burke Kellogg (1809-1872), and Elijah Chapman Kellogg (1811-1881).  They operated in a series of partnerships, between themselves and with others, the firms having a variety of names that involved "Kellogg". They issued decorative prints that became popular for domestic use in American homes; they were second to the New York firm of Currier & Ives in their commercial success.
