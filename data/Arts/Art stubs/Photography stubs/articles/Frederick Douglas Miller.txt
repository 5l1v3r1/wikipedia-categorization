Frederick Douglas Miller (6 December 1874 â€“ 7 June 1961) was an English photographer, usually known as F. Douglas Miller. Born on December 6, 1874, in the small village of Brede, East Sussex, north of Hastings.  He was the son of Matilda Goldsmith and Frederick Miller, who married at Eastbourne on March 4, 1874. Matilda Goldsmith had been born at Newenden in Kent in May 1848, and Fred Miller at Hailsham in February 1850. Matilda's father was William Goldsmith, a farm labourer, and Fred Miller was a professional photographer, as was his father, Edward Miller, according to their marriage certificate records. His parents settled in Haywards Heath in 1880, and before the end of the century Miller had set up "The Mid-Sussex Photographic Studio" in Haywards Heath, offering photographs "in any size and newest styling" and services including "copying and enlarging". He also photographed outdoor events such as "garden parties". In 1903 he started to publish and sell picture postcards, and the business grew and became successful.  He married Kate Elizabeth Peerless in 1905. Miller ran the studio until he sold the business to Ebenezer William Pannell in February 1916, and moved to Worthing with his wife, where they lived for the rest of their lives. His wife died on 19 March 1959, and Miller died in Southlands Hospital in Shoreham-by-Sea on 7 June 1961.
