The Samyang Optics / Rokinon AF 50mm F1.4 FE is a standard full-frame prime lens for the Sony E-mount. It was announced by Samyang Optics on May 3, 2016.  Though designed for Sony's full frame E-mount cameras, the lens can be used on Sony's APS-C E-mount camera bodies, with an equivalent full-frame field-of-view of 75mm. The lens itself is made of a thin aluminum shell over plastic internals and includes a detachable petal-style lens hood. This lens is in direct composition with Sony's own 50mm F1.4 prime lens, featuring similar specs and image quality.
