The Samsung NX series is a series of APS-C mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras with Samsung NX lens mounts from Samsung Electronics, introduced in 2010. The APS-C image sensors have a 1.54× crop factor. Optical image stabilization is featured on some of the lenses, indicated by an "OIS" marking. Automatic focusing on NX lenses is handled by a dedicated electric motor built into the lens. With an diameter of 42mm the lens mount has a comparatively large flange focal distance of 25.5 mm –  the 35 mm full-frame format Leica M mount is only 2 mm larger (despite this, M mount lenses cannot be mounted on NX camera with preserving infinity focus. As of February 2015, there are 15 Samsung lenses available.  As of February 2015, the NX-mount is supported by at least one additional manufacturer: Samyang Optics, which only delivers lenses without autofocus / image stabilization. An official announcement from Samsung has never emerged, detailing the current status of the NX brand. It is widely known that Samsung pulled their camera business out of all major markets.  This leads to speculation that NX has been abandoned by Samsung. No future development is anticipated.
