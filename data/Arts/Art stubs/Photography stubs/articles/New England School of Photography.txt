The New England School of Photography is an arts school based in Massachusetts. NESOP has approximately 150 full-time students in its two-year Professional Photography Program.  The Professional Photography Program offers two start dates each year—in October and February.  NESOP is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC). The school also runs (evening) workshops seasonally throughout the year, which begin in January, March, June and September. The workshops are offered in a variety of disciplines for all skill levels. NESOP was founded in 1968 by Academy-Award nominated cinematographer John H. Carruthers to fill the need for professional photographic training in the Boston area. The school was originally located at 739 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts. The first students began class in September 1969 and graduated in May 1971. In August 1972, NESOP was moved to its present location at 537 Commonwealth Avenue, Kenmore Square, Boston, Massachusetts and grown to occupy approximately 14,000 square feet (1,300 m2), including space at 650 Beacon Street, Kenmore Square, Boston, Massachusetts. NESOP started with general photographic curriculum in 1968 and responding to the needs of the marketplace now offers eight Majors in commercial and artistic areas as well as ten Minor areas of study. In August 1991, William R. Carruthers took as President of NESOP and in December 2006 he assumed ownership due to his father's (John H. Carruthers) passing.
