The M.Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 is a Micro Four Thirds System lens by Olympus Corporation. It is sold as a standalone item, and also as part of a kit along with bodies for all cameras in the Olympus PEN series (the discontinued E-P1 and the current E-P2, E-PL1, E-PL2, E-P3, E-PL3, E-PM1, E-PM2 and E-PL5).
