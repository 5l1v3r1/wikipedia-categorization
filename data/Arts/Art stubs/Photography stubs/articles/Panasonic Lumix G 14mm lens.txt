The Panasonic Lumix G 14mm f/2.5  lens is a pancake-style prime lens for Micro Four Thirds system cameras.  In the Micro Four Thirds format, it is moderately wide.  As of its late-2010 release, it is claimed by Panasonic to be the lightest interchangeable digital-camera lens.  It is the prime-lens option available with the Panasonic GF2 and GF3, and available separately. Focusing is claimed to be suitable for video ("MSC"- movie and stills compatible), with a fast, quiet autofocus motor.  The lens is "focus by wire"- the focusing ring sends commands, while the actual actuation is via a motor, even for manual focus.  Focusing is internal- the front lens element does not rotate, allowing the consistent use of polarized filters. The 46mm thread lets a Micro Four Thirds user share filters between it, the Panasonic 20mm, Panasonic Leica 25mm, Panasonic Leica 45mm lenses, and the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2. The lens has received good reviews.       Reviewers liked the sharpness despite a very small size (perhaps even too small),   and "silent, high speed" focusing.   Criticism includes occasional vignetting, and some chromatic aberration.  Some reviewers criticized software correction for distortion.
