On realising that there were no offline activities for the vast nature and wildlife community in the whole of Asia, the photographer-duo took it upon themselves to create a festival where photographers could showcase their work, stay informed on global happenings, meet fellow photographers, and discuss important topics. Bringing people from different disciplines together, the first edition of the Nature inFocus festival was launched in March 2014.\n</p><p>In 2015, Nature inFocus started working towards another first for India \u2014 nature and wildlife photography awards. Begun in 2015, the NiF Photography Awards is a six-category award ceremony that has a bracket dedicated solely to conservation-related issues. With participants from across the globe, today, to receive a NiF photography award is considered prestigious.\n</p><p>With amazing content pouring in from the festival and the awards, NiF\u2019s next step was to create a space that would help archive this material for the larger public experience. In the month of November 2016, NiF launched its <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.natureinfocus.in/\">online portal</a>, a photo-led exploration into India\u2019s wilderness, a definitive and democratic platform for sharing stories and photography, enabling relevant knowledge sharing and curation of everything to do with nature. A truly community-driven platform powered by its contributors.\n</p><p>In 2017, Nature inFocus created the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://hive.natureinfocus.in/\">NiF Hive</a>, a platform that allows you to create your online portfolio about nature photography. You can upload, share and curate your photographs under different categories, tagging and documenting your work in a strategic, relevant way. The Hive becomes your calling card, the repository of your best work in the wild.\n</p><p>In 2018, the fifth edition of the NiF Festival took place in Bangalore with a brand new film festival and a curated photography exhibition - <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://hive.natureinfocus.in/the-wild-nation/\">The Wild Nation</a>, displaying 100 images from across the country, to celebrate the richness of India's vast and diverse wilderness.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Founders\">Founders</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nature_InFocus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Founders\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rohit_Varma\">Rohit Varma</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nature_InFocus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Rohit Varma\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Rohit Varma is one of those few individuals who chose to pursue passion rather than their professional career.  \n</p><p>His love for everything nature &amp; wildlife shouldn't surprise anyone given that he was born &amp; raised in Balaghat, a small town bordering Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, where natural beauty is in abundance.  \n</p><p>After successfully managing multiple roles over 15 years in companies like AMD, SanDisk, CyberMedia, Rohit decided to hang up his corporate boots and decided to pursue his passion for photography &amp; wildlife. \n</p><p>His work has been published in national &amp; international media. He shares his work under creative commons. He believes that wildlife photographs can not only drive people closer to nature, they also make them experience, appreciate and conserve. His Tedx Bangalore talk on \u201cHalf a flush to save the tiger\u201d was truly thought provoking and highlighted environmental issues in a unique fashion. &#160;\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kalyan_Varma\"><a href=\"/wiki/Kalyan_Varma\" title=\"Kalyan Varma\">Kalyan Varma</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nature_InFocus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Kalyan Varma\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Kalyan Varma is an award winning wildlife photographer, filmmaker, naturalist and explorer specializing in environment, science and ecology in India.
