The gliding mirror is Hasselblad's solution to the problems experienced when using telephoto lenses on select 500 and 200 series SLR cameras. The mirror is able to glide backwards about 8mm before folding upwards, which allows it to clear the rear element of certain telephoto lenses while still providing 100% viewfinder coverage.
