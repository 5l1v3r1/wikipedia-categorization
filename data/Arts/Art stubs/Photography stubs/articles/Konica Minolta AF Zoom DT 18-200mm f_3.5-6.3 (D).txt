 Originally produced as Konica Minolta AF Zoom DT 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 (D) by Konica Minolta in 2005, and currently produced by Sony, the Sony α DT 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 (SAL-18200) is compatible with cameras using the Minolta A-mount and Sony A-mount lens mounts. The DT designation means this lens is designed to be used with a camera with an APS-C size sensor. When the 1.5× crop factor is considered, the lens has an effective equivalent 27–300mm focal length. The lens is derived from the Tamron AF 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 XR Di II LD Aspherical [IF] (models A14M/A14S).
