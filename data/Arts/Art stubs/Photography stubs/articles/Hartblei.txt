Hartblei is an international manufacturer of optical equipment for photography based in Kiev and Munich. They are primarily known for producing tilt-shift lenses (Super-Rotator).   In 2006 Hartblei started a collaboration with Carl Zeiss AG, adapting Zeiss lens designs for tilt-shift use. Using the unique Super-Rotator design, Hartblei tilt-shift lenses are capable of tilting in any axis,  making it more flexible than other lenses such as the Canon TS-E 90mm lens. Hartblei Super-Rotator lenses are 360Â° tilt-shift lenses. Some current versions of the Super-Rotator feature German-made Zeiss optics.
