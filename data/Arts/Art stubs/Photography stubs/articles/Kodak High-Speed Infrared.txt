Kodak High-Speed Infrared film, also known as Kodak HIE, was a popular black-and-white infrared photographic film from Kodak. The film is sensitive to the visible light spectrum (with decreased green sensitivity), infrared radiation up to 900nm in wavelength, and some ultraviolet radiation as well. The prominent blooming or "glow" often seen in the highlights of infrared photographs is an artifact of HIE and not of infrared light itself (nor even of all IR-sensitive films). This is because although conventional photographic films have an anti-halation layer that absorbs scattered light, HIE lacks this backing. Kodak HIE must only be loaded and unloaded in total darkness.[footnotes 1] HIE features a polyester film base that is very stable but susceptible to scratches, and therefore requires extra care during development, processing and scanning. As of November 2, 2007, "Kodak is preannouncing the discontinuance" of HIE Infrared 35 mm film stating the reasons that, "Demand for these products has been declining significantly in recent years, and it is no longer practical to continue to manufacture given the low volume, the age of the product formulations and the complexity of the processes involved."   At the time of this notice, HIE Infrared 135-36 was available at a street price of around $12 a roll at US mail order outlets. Despite the discontinuance of HIE, other newer infrared sensitive emulsions from Efke, Rollei, and Ilford are still available, but have differing sensitivity and specifications from the long-established HIE. With the discontinuance of HIE, Efke's IR820 film has become the only IR film on the market with good sensitivity beyond 750 nm.
