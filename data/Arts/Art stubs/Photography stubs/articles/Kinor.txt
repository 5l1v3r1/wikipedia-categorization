The Kinor company of Russia (Kinor-Cinema) is a manufacturer of High Definition cinematography equipment and a former manufacturer of 35-millimeter and 16-millimeter movie cameras, most notably the 16CX-1m and 16cx-2m 16mm cameras. Using a German lens manufacturing process, the resulting product was of a high grade with low mechanical noise and cartridge loading film. The 16mm Kinor 1M has a turret-type lens mounting and a variable shutter. The 2M and the rare 3M models are supplied with a 10-100 zoom lens, which has front- and rear-mountable filters. The usual kit consists of four magazines, three 100-foot, and one 400-foot. Synchronized sound is achieved using a sync-pulse known as a pilot tone, and the motor generates an accurate 25 frames per second to attain this. Variable frame rates require a relatively cheap modification form third-party developers, or the factory-produced variable drive unit. This is very quickly and simply replaced. It is common to see this type of modification coupled with the addition of true crystal-sync. The camerasâ€™ use in the West is gaining popularity  as filmmakers grow accustomed to Russian manufacturing quality. Compared with the Krasnogorsk series of Russian cameras, the build quality is of a higher standard , although these too are  well-designed units. Their price compared with the benchmark Arri series film cameras is drastically cheaper; this is partly the reason new filmmakers are finding themselves the owners  of these very practical film cameras. The 35-millimeter Kinors are self-blimped and have been used to make films worldwide.
