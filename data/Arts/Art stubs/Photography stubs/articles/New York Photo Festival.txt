The New York Photo Festival was founded in January 2007 by Frank Evers and Daniel Power    in an effort to establish a U.S. photo festival dedicated to the "future of contemporary photography" and to the exposure of new works. It takes place every year in mid-May over a period of four days in Dumbo, Brooklyn. The inaugural event took place on May 14â€“18, 2008 and was attended by 15,000 people. It was curated by Martin Parr, Lesley A. Martin, Tim Barber and Kathy Ryan.
