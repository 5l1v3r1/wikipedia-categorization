SFX is a black-and-white film from Ilford Photo with extended sensitivity into the near-infrared at 740Â nm. It can be used as a panchromatic film on its own, or with different red/infrared filters to give varying levels of the effect seen in infrared photography; i.e. dark skies and bright plant foliage. Ilford makes a 'deep red' filter specifically for this film, but others can be used as well. SFX was discontinued when Ilford went into receivership in 2004 as it is a niche product.  On 2007-01-26, Ilford announced it would relaunch the film  and it was relaunched in March 2007. The film will be produced on what Ilford calls a 'manufacture on demand' (MOD) basis because of its low demand. With this relaunch, the Ilford product line-up is restored to its pre-receivership state.
