Nikon Z-mount (stylised as â„¤) is an interchangeable lens mount developed by Nikon for its forthcoming full-frame mirrorless digital cameras. Nikon full-frame cameras have used the Nikon F-mount since 1959. The first camera to use the Z mount, the Nikon Z 7, is to be released in September 2018. The FTZ lens adapter will allow many F-mount lenses to be used on Z-mount cameras.  Nikon Z-mount has a larger lens mount diameter (55 mm) compared with other comparable lens mounts, being much larger than the F-mount (44 mm), and Sony E (46.1 mm), and slightly larger than Canon EF (54 mm). The introduction of the Z-mount also saw the re-introduction of the Noct brand, used to describe a forthcoming fast 58 mm f/0.95 S Noct lens.
