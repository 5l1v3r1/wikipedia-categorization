 Originally produced by Minolta, and currently produced by Sony, the AF 75-300mm F4.5-5.6, is a telephoto zoom photographic lens compatible with cameras using the Minolta AF and Sony Î± lens mounts. The first generation body is made of metal. There is a focus limiter switch to speed up focusing.  The lens and the Minolta AF 70-210mm f/4 lens are colloquially known as the "big beercan" and "beercan" by Minolta camera users because their lens shape and size closely match the proportions of a typical aluminum beer can. The optical construction is changed. The metal body is replaced by a plastic body. Consequently, the lens is much lighter. The second generation has a focus hold button. Starting from the third generation, this lens is produced in black or silver color. The new (D) type supports ADI (Advanced Distance Integration) flash metering function. After Sony purchased the Minolta Camera Division, this lens was re-released under the Sony brand. The Sony lens retains most of the Minolta design but comes with a new look.
