The Panasonic Leica D Vario-Elmar 14-150mm F3.5-5.6 Asph Mega OIS is an interchangeable camera lens announced by Panasonic on March 7, 2007.  Photozone described it as "sharp and contrasty" and "far more harmonious than any other similar lenses [we] tested to date" with "virtually silent" autofocus, but remarked that it has very high lateral chromatic aberration at the extremes of the zoom range, high barrel distortion at the wide end, image stabilisation that at 2 stops is less effective than other brands, and genre-typical air pumping whose effects could have been mitigated with a weather-sealed design.
