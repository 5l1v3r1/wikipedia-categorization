A lith print is a photographic printing process that uses standard black-and-white photographic paper with lithographic developer (often heavily diluted standard developer) to produce a print with dark shadows and soft, bright highlights.  The effect has been described as "creamy highlights and hard shadows [...] an appearance not unlike a charcoal drawing".  Tones, colors, and subtle hues different from standard black-and-white print can be achieved.
