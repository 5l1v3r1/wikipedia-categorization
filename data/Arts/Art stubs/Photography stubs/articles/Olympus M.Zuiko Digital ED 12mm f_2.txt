The Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2 is a Micro Four Thirds System Prime lens by Olympus Corporation.  In the Micro Four Thirds format, it is a wide- or ultra-wide lens. The lens is focus-by-wire, using the autofocus motor even for manual focus.  The motor is quiet, suitable for  video use ("MSC"- movie and stills compatible).  Unlike other focus-by-wire systems, the lens offers two manual focus modes. In the traditional focus-by-wire mode, the focus mechanism operates the same way as other Micro Four Thirds lenses. The focus ring can be moved to engage a "snap focus" mode, which displays a distance scale for zone focusing, and provides a feel similar to mechanical focus systems. The "snap focus" mode makes this the first auto-focus capable Micro Four Thirds lens with a distance scale. The front element does not rotate, allowing the consistent use of polarized filters; a 46mm filter thread lets users share filters with many of Panasonic's lenses. Early reviews are positive, with good sharpness and build quality.
