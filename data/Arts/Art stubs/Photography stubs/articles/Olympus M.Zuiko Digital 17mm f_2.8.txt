The M.Zuiko Digital 17Â mm f/2.8 is a wide-angle, pancake-style prime lens by Olympus Corporation, for the Micro Four Thirds System.  It is sold in a kit with the Olympus PEN E-P1 camera body and available separately. The optical scheme has 7 lenses in four groups; two of these lenses are aspherical. Different reviews and tests valued the total optical quality as moderate to good, but far from superior. Still, the compactness and total performance make some good reputation for this kit lens. This lens is one of the few not billed by Olympus as Movie and Still Compatible ("MSC"), due to noise generated by its focus motor.
