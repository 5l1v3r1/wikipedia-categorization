 Neopan is a family of black-and-white films from Japanese manufacturer Fujifilm. Two emulsions are in production in 2018, Neopan 100 Acros and Neopan 400CN both in 135 and 120 formats. In March 2018, reports emerged from Japanese dealer bulletin that Neopan 100 Acros would be discontinued in October 2018.  Acros is a brandname for an ISO 100 speed professional ortho-panchromatic black-and-white photographic film for portraits, landscape, architectural subjects and product photography. It uses fuji color film technology to give high sharpness and fine grain. The film is particularly suited for night and long exposure photography due to its reciprocity characteristics: it does not require adjustments for exposures shorter than 120 seconds, and only requires a Â½ stop of compensation for exposures between 120 and 1000 seconds.   The film was produced in 135, 120 and Sheet film formats.   Sheet film (4x5" & 8x10") was discontinued in October 2017 with stock expected to last to May 18.  Discontinuation of the remaining 135 and 120 formats was announced in April 2018 with effect from October 2018   together with all Fujifilm black and white photopapers. However 120 format was already widely sold out by June 2018. Neopan 100 SS was an easy to use 100 ISO medium speed, fine grain, ortho-panchromatic film with a wide exposure latitude. Sold in Asian and selected markets, parallel import elsewhere. It was produced for 35mm cameras and discontinued in 2011  Neopan 400 Professional ('Presto' in Japan) was a high speed, black and white negative film with an ISO speed of 400 for action and press photography. It was produced for 35mm and medium format cameras and discontinued in 2013.   Neopan 1600 Professional ('Super Presto' in Japan) was an ultra high speed panchromatic film with E.I. 1600 for sports, journalism, stage shows and low light situations. It offers the same development time as Neopan 400 to enable the films to be processed together. It was produced for 35mm cameras and discontinued in 2009. Neopan 400CN is a ISO 400 General purpose C-41 process chromogenic B&W film on a triacetate base. Ilford were Fujis partners for this film which has therefore similar characteristics to Ilford XP2 plus. Formats: 135, 120.
