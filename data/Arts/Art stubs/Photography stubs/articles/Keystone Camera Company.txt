The Keystone Camera Company was an American manufacturer of consumer photographic equipment.  Notable products were Movie cameras, 126 and 110 cameras with built-in electronic flash (the "Everflash" series). In the 1930s, the firm built low cost 16mm cameras that are still in use today. The firm considered that labeling its products as Made in USA was an important part of its appeal.   The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 1991.  One popular version of their movie camera line was the Capri K27, with 3 lenses and 9 settings for cloudy to sunny day conditions. This was a light, easy to use movie camera, and is considered a rare collectable today. The firm was originally located in Boston, MA and moved to Clifton, NJ when purchased by Berkey Photo in 1968. In 1970 they began to manufacture the Everflash series of cameras in Clifton that accepted Kodak's new 126 cartridge film, and several years later Everflash cameras that handled the then new Kodak 110 cartridge film. Keystone's claim to fame was their built in electronic flash rather than having to use a flash bulb or flash cube, which was popular then on many other cameras. Poor internal management structure led to many quality problems in the early 1970s and serious losses. Keystone later added its instant picture Everflash camera using Polaroid film again stressing the Everflash feature rather than Polaroid's use of the Flash Bar. From 1970 to 1977, Berkey accounted for 8.2% Of the sales in the camera market in the United States, reaching a peak of 10.2% In 1976. In 1978, Berkey sold its camera division and thus abandoned this market.
