The Photography Centre of Athens was an independent disinterested association which aimed to promote artistic photography in Greece. It was founded in 1979 by five Greek photographers Yiorgos Depollas, Costis Antoniadis, Nikos Panayotopoulos, Stefanos Paschos, and John Demos. Because there was almost no place devoted to photography, the founders decided to create a gallery the primary goal of informing the friends of photography and the general public.
