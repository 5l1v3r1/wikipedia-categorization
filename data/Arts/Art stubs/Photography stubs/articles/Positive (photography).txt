A positive is a film or paper record of a scene that represents the color and luminance of objects in that scene with the same colors and luminances (as near as the medium will allow). Color transparencies are an example of positive photography: the range of colors presented in the medium is limited by the tonal range of the original image (dark and light areas correspond). It is opposed to a negative where colors and luminances are reversed: this is due to the chemical or electrical processes involved in recording the scene. Positives can be turned into negatives by appropriate chemical or electronic processes. Often, with the use of digital imaging, computers can automatically complete this process.  image area : light transfer from image area & non image area are opaque .<positive> -ve making : image area are opaque and non image transparent .<negative>
