Bruce Lee was a 1994 six-issue comic book miniseries published by Malibu Comics and written by Mike Baron and illustrated by Val Mayerik. It focused on a "fictional" Bruce Lee character striving his way through gangs and rival dojo owners, while building a movie career. Malibu included a Mortal Kombat short story in the first and fifth issues.  Writer Mike Baron previously wrote three comic books for NOW comics of the Green Hornet about Lee's Kato in the 1966 TV show. Val Mayerik drew the second Kato miniseries. Mike Baron states inspiration for the comic came from the 1970s Marvel Comics series Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu.
