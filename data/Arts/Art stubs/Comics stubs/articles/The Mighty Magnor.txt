The Mighty Magnor is a six-issue 1993 superhero comic book series published by Malibu Comics. The series, a satirical take on the superhero genre, was created by the same team as Groo: artist/co-writer Sergio Aragon√©s, co-writer Mark Evanier, colorist Tom Luth, and letterer Stan Sakai. In addition to spoofing the superhero concept, it also spoofed things such as police chiefs seeing crises as a chance to use military-style siege machines to "show off the pride of big city police".
