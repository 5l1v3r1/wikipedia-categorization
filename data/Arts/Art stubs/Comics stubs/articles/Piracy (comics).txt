Piracy is an EC Comics title published in the early 1950s. The bi-monthly comic book, published by Bill Gaines and edited by Al Feldstein, began with an issue cover-dated October–November, 1954. It ran for seven issues, ending with the October–November, 1955 issue. Front covers were by Wally Wood, Reed Crandall, Bernard Krigstein and George Evans. The stories of adventure on the high seas were illustrated by Wood, Crandall, Krigstein, Jack Davis, Al Williamson, Graham Ingels and Angelo Torres. Piracy was reprinted (in black and white) as part of publisher Russ Cochran's The Complete EC Library.  Between March and September 1998, Cochran (in association with Gemstone Publishing) reprinted all seven individual issues.  This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a pair of softcover EC Annuals.
