Eclipse Monthly was a full color comics anthology title published in 1983–1984 by Eclipse Comics. An attempt by Eclipse to revive the comics anthologies of the Golden Age of Comic Books, Eclipse Monthly was the successor to Eclipse's black-and-white anthology Eclipse, the Magazine, which was published from May 1981 to January 1983. Eclipse Monthly  featured many characters — including Steve Ditko's Static and B. C. Boyer's The Masked Man — that had been part of Eclipse, the Magazine and were later featured in their own series or collections.
