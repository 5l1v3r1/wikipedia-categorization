My Date Comics was a short lived series of comics that ran from July 1947 to January 1948. The title was the first in the "romance humor" genre.  It was a collaboration between Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. They mainly concerned Swifty Chase, a lovestruck athlete who competed with rival Snubby Skeemer for the hand of Sunny Daye. The most colourful character was House-Date Harry, a lanky teen who preferred to entertain his dates in their homes and not go out.
