Strange Fantasy is a 36-page, 10 cent, bi-monthly, anthology horror comics title published by Ajax-Farrell in the early 1950s.  Its initial issue cover dates October 1952 and its last issue October/November 1954, for a total of 13 issues.  Comic book jungle girl Rulah (called Kolah in the book)  makes an appearance in issue 3 and a bondage cover graces issue 13.  Artists on the title include writer Bruce Hamilton and penciller, inker, and cover artist Steve Ditko. Strange Fantasy was formerly Rocketman (with one issue) and picked up where Rocketman ceased publication. Strange Fantasy is then numbered 2-14 rather than 1-13. The title left newsstands in 1954, the victim of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. Copies in Near Mint condition command prices in the hundreds of dollars.
