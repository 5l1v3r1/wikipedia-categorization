Atlas is a three-issue comic book series by cartoonist Dylan Horrocks.  Published by Drawn and Quarterly, the series ran from 2001â€“2006. The series features characters first introduced in Horrocks' previous series, Pickle. There was a four-year hiatus between issues #1 and #2, caused by Horrocks' work as the writer of DC Comics' Batgirl comic.
