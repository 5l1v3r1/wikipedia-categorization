The Silent Invasion was a black and white comic book that was published by Renegade Press between 1986 and 1988. It was written by Larry Hancock and drawn by Michael Cherkas.  The story was set in the early 1950s and combined McCarthy-era Cold War-type paranoia with flying saucers and alien abductions. It followed the adventures of Matt Sinkage, newspaper reporter and main character as he tries to solve the conspiracy and the powerful people trying to stop him.
