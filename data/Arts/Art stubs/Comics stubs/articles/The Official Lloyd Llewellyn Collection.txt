#$@&!: The Official Lloyd Llewellyn Collection is Daniel Clowes's first anthology of comics. This paperback volume collects thirteen stories from the seven black-and-white Lloyd Llewellyn comics that Fantagraphics published from 1986-1988. As quoted on the back cover, The Village Voice said that “Lloyd’s adventures swing and bop like a tiki orgy hosted by little green hipsters from outer space.”
