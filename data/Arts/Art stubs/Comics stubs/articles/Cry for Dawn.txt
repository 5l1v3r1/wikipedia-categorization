Cry for Dawn was an American 9-issue horror anthology comic book. The book was primarily written by Joseph Michael Linsner and Joseph Monks with artwork by Joseph Michael Linsner.   The series featured guest artist and writers in some issues, but the work was largely performed by Linsner and Monks.  It was published by Cry for Dawn Productions from 1989â€“1992 and introduced the character of Dawn, the goddess of birth and rebirth. Although Dawn served as an emcee in the Cry for Dawn issues, she would later have many titles dedicated to her journeys through heaven and hell across multiple spin-off titles for Sirius Entertainment, Image Comics, and Linsner.com.  Cry for Dawn was a mature-readers-only title that hit during the peak of 1990s independent comic rise in the US market.  Due to the artwork by Linsner and the cutting-edge subject matter that the series dealt with, the titled developed a cult following that has continued in the decades following the publication.
