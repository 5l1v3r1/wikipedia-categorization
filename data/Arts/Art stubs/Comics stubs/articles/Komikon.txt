 Komikon (with komik as the Tagalized form for comic, and convention) is an annual comic book fan convention in the Philippines founded by Artist's Den to be the first convention solely dedicated for comic book enthusiasts. The first convention was held at the U.P. Bahay ng Alumni, UP Diliman, Quezon City, on October 22, 2005. Since then, Filipino fans have gathered annually to meet with the country's local talents and exchange common interest in the comic book genre. The artists who have graced the convention are Gerry Alanguilan, Leinil Yu, Carlo Pagulayan, Edgar Tadeo, Pol Medina, Jr., Carlo Vergara, Carlo J. Caparas amongst other. Since 2005, Komikon provides avenue for independent publishers to showcase their books in the market, and opportunities for aspiring artists through its various art contests and portfolio reviews conducted by David Campiti of Glasshouse Graphics. The event also exhibits some artworks of known Filipino comic book luminaries such as Nick Manabat, Alfredo Alcala, Alex Ni√±o, Nestor Redondo, and Tony DeZuniga. On October 21, 2006 Komikon held its very first Komikon Awards to give recognition to the artists in the local komiks industry. Local comics on display
