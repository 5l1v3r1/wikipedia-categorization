Most issues were written by Jack Herman, although some were written by Herman, Vokes and Rankin.  It was originally published by its creators as Crystal Comics (Crystal Publications), then by Apple Comics.   Initially the Eagle series ran for 23 issues, ending in 1989; the last 7 issues were published by Apple Comics. The series achieved a cult following.  It was revived in 2016 by publisher American Mythology Productions and again features art by Vokes and writing by Herman.   Eagle chronicled the adventures of detective and vigilante Richard Eagle, a mystic and martial arts adept who wields a sword.   Eagle resides in Crystal City  on a futuristic Earth, inhabited by humans and non-humans (presumably extraterrestrials).
