Sad Sad Sack World (also known as Sad Sad Sack) was an American comic book series, published by Harvey Comics. The series ran from October 1964 to December 1973; in all, 46 issues were released.  The series featured characters from the Sad Sack comic series, created by George Baker. The series was a "giant-size" Harvey comic for most of its run. Issues 1 (October 1964) to 31 (June 1971) were 68 pages; issues 32 (September 1971) to 39 (October 1972) were 52 pages. The title was a standard-size comic (32-36 pages) for the remainder of its run.  Sad Sad Sack World was a quarterly publication for most of its run. The series became a bi-monthly by mid-1972.  Sad Sad Sack World was canceled in late 1973 by Harvey, during a purge of their non-Richie Rich titles. Other Sad Sack titles (Sad Sack Navy, Sad Sack with Sarge and Sadie, Sad Sack U.S.A.) were also canceled that year.
