Chopper is a horror comic book mini-series written by Martin Shapiro, illustrated by Juan Ferreyra (who was later replaced by Cliff Richards from issue #3 onward), and published by Asylum Press in 2011.   The series is a modern-day reimagining of the headless horseman from "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" that takes place in Daytona Beach, Florida during Bike Week. In the story, a police officer's rebellious teenage daughter takes a strange new ecstasy-like drug at a party that causes her to see ghosts – and one of them is a headless Hell’s Angel on a motorcycle who collects the souls of sinners in the afterlife and he wants her tainted soul. Chopper has elements of the movies A Nightmare on Elm Street and Candyman. Instead of being killed in your dreams, you’re vulnerable while you’re high on the supernatural drug. As part of an ambitious transmedia launch strategy, a prequel to the main Chopper storyline was produced as a web TV series  starring actors Tyler Mane (Halloween, X-Men) and Andrew Bryniarski (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Batman Returns).   A film adaptation of the comic book is in the works. The screenplay was written by Martin Shapiro.
