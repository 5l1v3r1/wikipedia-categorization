Neat Stuff is an American alternative comic book series created by Peter Bagge and published by Fantagraphics. It ran from 1985 to 1989 for fifteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology.  Described by Dez Skinn in Comix: The Underground Revolution as the work which "threw Peter Bagge into the limelight",   Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradley characters' story in Hate.  Neat Stuff's contents were collected in four books: The Bradleys, Studs Kirby, Junior and Other Losers, and Stupid Comics. Fantagraphics reprinted all fifteen issues in 2016 in a two-volume hardcover collection.
