Hip Hop Family Tree is a series of comic books written and illustrated by Ed Piskor, which documents the early history of hip hop culture.  The first collection was a 2014 New York Times Graphic Books Best Seller (#7)  and was listed in The Washington Post Top 10 graphic novels of 2013.  Originating online with Boing Boing, the series was published in print form by Fantagraphics Books.  Piskor's artistic style in Hip Hop Family Tree — including his use of Ben-Day Dots  — hearkens back to the comic book styles prevalent during the period being retold.  Robert Crumb is openly referenced as an inspiration to Piskor,  who cites Crumb's "Heroes of Blues, Jazz & Country" trading cards as an influence. Crumb and Piskor are similar in their commemorations of key artists and musical figures, and the informative narration of their chosen genre's historical evolution.  Hip Hop Family Tree began on Boing Boing in January 2012 as a one-page "semi-regular ongoing feature,"  and ran, mostly weekly, until December 2015. Fantagraphics released the first "Treasury" collection, Hip Hop Family Tree Vol. 1: 1970s-1981, in 2013, and the second collection, covering the years 1981–1983, in 2014. That year the publisher also released a "Gift Box Set," collecting the first two treasury editions. In August 2015, Fantagraphics released the third collection, covering the years 1983–1984, while also beginning a monthly magazine-format limited series. That series ran 12 issues, through July 2016. Fantagraphics published volume 4 of the Treasury collection in July 2016. That year the publisher also released a "Gift Box Set," collecting volumes 3 and 4 of the Treasury editions.
