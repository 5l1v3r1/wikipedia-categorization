There is a 13-page Mad magazine parody, various photo funnies (fumetti) and many comics from the "Funny Pages" section of the magazine, including artwork by Charles Rodrigues, Vaughn Bod√©, Shary Flenniken, Jeff Jones, Gahan Wilson, M. K. Brown, Randy Enos, Bobby London, Ed Subitzky. Stan Mack and Joe Orlando.
