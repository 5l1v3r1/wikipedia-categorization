Peepshow is the title of a 1992 comic book collection and an ongoing autobiographical comic book by American cartoonist Joe Matt, both published by Drawn and Quarterly.  The book collects strips published in various publications from before the Peepshow series started. The story is divided into three story arcs: In 2004, it was reported that HBO was developing an animated series based on The Poor Bastard that would be produced by Matt and David X. Cohen.  This project was abandoned in 2005.
