Archie's TV Laugh-Out was a comic book published by Archie Comics from 1969 to 1986. Sabrina the Teenage Witch appears in all 106 issues, and this title served as a transition for her from Archie's Mad House to her own title. In addition to Sabrina, the title features regular appearances by the "Archie gang" and Josie and the Pussycats.  The title was intended to showcase characters from Archie Comics's animated TV shows, which included The Archie Show (and its successors), Josie and the Pussycats and Sabrina the Teenaged Witch.
