Charlton Bullseye was the title of a short-lived Charlton Comics showcase comic book series published from June 1981 through December 1982. Several new stories using Charlton's "Action Heroes" appeared, before they were sold to DC Comics in 1983. After the cancellation of Charlton Bullseye, stories intended for the title were published in Scary Tales #36â€“40, which explains the superhero story "Mr. Jigsaw" in issue #38 and "Dragon Force" in issue #40. Several other unpublished stories for the title were published by AC Comics.  According to the 1980 press release for the series, an artist showed up at the Charlton offices and offered to work for them for free in hopes of accumulating enough credits to get a job with one of the two leading comics publishers. Charlton Bullseye was based around this concept; contributors to the series were paid only in contributor copies, all original art was returned to the artists after publication, and contributors would hold the copyrights to any original characters they introduced.  In 1985, a final attempt at a revival was spearheaded by new editor T.C. Ford with a direct-market only version of Charlton Bullseye Special, which featured work by then newcomers Amanda Conner, T.C. Ford, and Chris Pridgen. United Comics, T.C. Ford's publishing house, will reprint this edition as Shockwave #1 in 2016.
