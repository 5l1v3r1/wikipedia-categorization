The Private Eye, which lasts 10 issues, is self-published by its creators digitally through their website, Panel Syndicate, in DRM-free formats. Readers are allowed to determine how much they want to pay per issue.  To date Panel Syndicate has published comics in English, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese and French.  The Private Eye and Panel Syndicate have received critical acclaim and media attention for its role as one of the first DRM-free, pay what you want comics.
