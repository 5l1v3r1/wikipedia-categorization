Manfra are French bande dessinées that draw inspiration from Japanese manga.   They are also known as franga, manga français and global manga (the later a more general term that includes other Western manga-inspired comics).   Most Manfra, such as Radiant, Dreamland, Wakfu, Debaser, etc. have a format similar to that of manga, but can be read left-to-right, such as with Wakfu, or right-to-left, such as with Radiant. Most if not all of the works that are generally designated as Manfra have an art style inpired by manga. Some Manfra, such as La Rose Ecarlate, have an art style inspired from manga while still being read left-to-right and having a hardcover bande dessinee format. Their stories sometimes reference those of manga as well.
