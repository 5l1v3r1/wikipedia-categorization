Prêmio Angelo Agostini (Angelo Agostini Award) is the most traditional comic book award in Brazil. It was created in 1985 by the Associação dos Quadrinhistas e Caricaturistas do Estado de São Paulo (AQC-ESP), which still organizes the event today. The award's name pays homage to Angelo Agostini, considered the pioneer artist of Brazilian comics.   In its first year, the Prêmio Angelo Agostini had only the category "Mestre do quadrinho nacional" ("Master of national comics"), aiming to highlight Brazilian comic professionals that worked with comics for at least 25 years. In the following year, the organizers began to expand its categories with awards for pencillers, writers and new releases.   Currently, the award has nine categories, among which stands out the Jayme Cortez Trophy, named after the Luso-Brazilian comics artist Jayme Cortez, which is destined to reward great contributions to Brazilian comics, and can be granted to artists, entities, events or organizations.   The winners of Prêmio Angelo Agostini are chosen by open voting organized by AQC-ESP based on Brazilian comic production in the year prior to the awards ceremony.
