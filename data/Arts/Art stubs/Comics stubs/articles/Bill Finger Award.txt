The Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing is an American award for excellence in comic book writing.  The awards committee, chaired by Mark Evanier, is charged each year with selecting two recipients, one living and one deceased. The award, along with the Eisner Awards, is presented in July of each year at the annual San Diego Comic-Con. It was established by Bill Finger's colleague and fellow writer Jerry Robinson. Evanier in 2003 said the premise of the award was "to recognize writers for a body of work that has not received its rightful reward and/or recognition. That was what Jerry Robinson intended as his way of remembering his friend, Bill Finger. Bill is still kind of the industry poster boy for writers not receiving proper reward or recognition."
