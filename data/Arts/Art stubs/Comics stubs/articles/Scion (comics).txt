Scion was an American comic book published by CrossGen Entertainment from July 2000 to April 2004. It was cancelled due to the bankruptcy of Crossgen Comics Inc in 2004. The story of Scion mainly concerns Ethan, youngest prince of the Heron Dynasty. He is accompanied by Skink, a member of the Lower Races and his best friend. While the Heron and Raven Dynasties have been at war for hundreds of years, there exists at the beginning of the tale a relative peace between the two Kingdoms. This peace doesn't last. Ethan is later joined by Ashleigh, the princess of the Raven dynasty, and a bounty hunter named Exeter, who is a genetically modified humanoid. The main antagonist is Prince Bron of the Raven Dynasty, the older brother of Ashleigh. Bron is determined to kill Ethan and Ashleigh. The group experience many events, most notably a war between the Heron and Raven kingdoms, the establishment of a free nation for the lower races and an invasion by an army of mechanical robots. Skink is secretly an agent of greater powers, being  a fragment of Danik. Bron's advisor Mai Shen is really a member of The First. The final issue ends with Ethan and his father caught in the epicenter of a nuclear explosion.  An added short narrative scene, taking place hundreds of years in the future, assures readers that Ethan does escape the blast. Scion ran for 43 issues (from July 2000 till April 2004).  CrossGen also published four trade paperback books collecting the first half of the series. Two more trade paperbacks (The Far Kingdom and The Royal Wedding) were announced but never released due to CrossGen's bankruptcy. The publishing company Checkers has subsequently re-released the first 4 volumes, along with the fifth, and sixth.
