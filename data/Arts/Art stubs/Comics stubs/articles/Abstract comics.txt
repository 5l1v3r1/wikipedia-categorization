Abstract comics are comics that combine concepts of visual abstraction with the traditional continuity of the comic strip. A collection of abstract comics was brought together in the book Abstract Comics: The Anthology edited by Andrei Molotiu. The Danish publisher Fahrenheit published Nautilus by Molotiu and Reykjavik by Henrik Rehr, both abstract graphic novels, in 2009. Creators of abstract comics included in Molotiu's anthology include Robert Crumb, Andrei Molotiu, Patrick McDonnell, Mark Badger, Henrik Rehr, Benoit Joly and Gary Panter.
