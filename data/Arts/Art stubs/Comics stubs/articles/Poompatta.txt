Poompatta (Malayalam: പൂമ്പാറ്റ  butterfly) is a Malayalam children's magazine started publishing in 1964.  It was initially owned by P. A. Warrier and later by Pai and Pai Company. N M Mohan (1978–82) and R. Gopalakrishnan (1982-1986) were edited this magazine.  Before the rise of the Balarama magazine, it was the market leader among the Malayalam comic magazines. Now the magazine is published from Thrissur by Sooryaprabha Publications, Thrissur. Poompatta is considered as "one of the pioneering children’s magazines in Malayalam".  It used to feature the cartoon "Undaappikkal" - which very closely resemble the minions from Despicable Me though it was published many years before the movie. Other notable graphic novels titled " Pankathanthram Kathakal", "Kaloolu", "Kishkku","Professor uncle"  were regularly published in the magazine.
