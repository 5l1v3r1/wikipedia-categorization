Big Umbrella is a defunct comic-book imprint which was formed by indie comic creators Rafael Navarro, Javier Hernandez, Michael Aushenker, Ted Seko, and Rhode Montijo.   It wasn't considered an imprint as along the lines of a DC or Marvel imprint but more along the lines of a loosely formed coalition of independent publishers and friends. The imprint disbanded sometime in 2003 due to problems in the market-place. According to creator Javier Hernandez: Despite the break-up, the creators remain friends and often collaborate on their independent works.
