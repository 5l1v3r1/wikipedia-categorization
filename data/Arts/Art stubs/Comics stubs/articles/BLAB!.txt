Blab! is a comics anthology edited by Monte Beauchamp. Though its primary focus is comics, it regularly features articles with non-comics illustration and graphic design. The first two issues (1986-87) were published by Beauchamp's own imprint, Monte Comix. Kitchen Sink Press took over with issue #3 in 1988, through #8, also publishing 2nd editions of #1 and 2 along the way. Issues #9–18 were published annually by Fantagraphics Books in a 120-page, 10" x 10" square format featuring both black-and-white and color art. In 2003, Chronicle Books published the book collection New & Used Blab!. As the title suggests, one half of the book consists of selections from previous issues while the other half (bound dos-à-dos style) features new works by frequent contributors. Several solo books by individual Blab! contributors have been published with the subtitle "A Blab! Storybook." 2007's issue #18 was the final edition of Blab!; in 2010, Last Gasp published the first issue of the hardcover Blab World, which replaces Blab!
