Archie and Me was a comic book title published by Archie comics from 1964 to 1987. Most issues and covers focused on the interaction of Archie Andrews and the school principal, Mr. Weatherbee.  This suggests that Mr. Weatherbee is the "Me" mentioned in the title, whereas the "Me" in Reggie and Me and Betty and Me appeared to refer to Archie Andrews himself.
