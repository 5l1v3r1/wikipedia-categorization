The Pogo Plane is a fictional vehicle appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Pogo Plane first appeared in Fantastic Four #3 (March, 1962). The Fantastic Four's Pogo Plane, so-called because of its tail-down landing/take-off attitude, was the first significant air-breathing engine design of Reed Richards. Employing new turbine blade configurations and a new titanium-alloy process, Richards increased overall engine performance to a very high thrust-to-weight ratio. It is loosely based on the never mass-produced Convair XFY Pogo. The Frightful Four destroyed the first Pogo Plane when they trapped the Fantastic Four on a Pacific atoll and delivered them their first defeat.
