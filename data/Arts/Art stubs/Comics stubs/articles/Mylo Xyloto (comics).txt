Mylo Xyloto is a comic book series created by the music group Coldplay and filmmaker Mark Osborne. It ties into (and tells the story of) the Coldplay album Mylo Xyloto.   On 10 July 2012 the Coldplay website announced a six-part Mylo Xyloto comic, with the first issue to be released at that week's Comic-Con.  Published by Bongo Comics,  the story followed the tale of Mylo, a 'Silencer', who, in the words of co-writer Mark Osborne (filmmaker), is a part of a "war against sound and colour". Together with Osborne, Dylan Haggerty also writes the comic (starting in the second issue) with art by Alejandro Fuentes.  In the world of Silencia, a species known as the Irdoks rule over the Silencians in a dystopian police state. They have a military police force recruited from Silencians known as the Silencers, which are taught to enforce the Irdok's rule of law, which is known as Chromatic and Acoustic Level Management (CALM). The Irdoks defend their policy of CALM by talking about a "Great War of Colour" which brought about a species known as the Eaters which the Irdoks protect the Silencians from. To make up for the lack of colour and sound in their world, the Silencians use a tool known as the Hypnofeed, which constantly feeds them with visual and (ostensibly) audio stimulation. Major Minus, however, has a problem involving continued rebellion by a section of the populace known as the Sparkers, who create Sparks (which are colourful musical graffiti) in an effort to wake the populace up from the Hypnofeed. To promote the release of the comics, the "Hurts Like Heaven" music video was also Issue #0 of the Mylo Xyloto comic.
