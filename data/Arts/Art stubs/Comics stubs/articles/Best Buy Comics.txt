Best Buy Comics is a one-shot comic book by Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky (Later Crumb), published by Apex Novelties in 1979. All the stories in the book except one were first published by CoEvolution Quarterly.  Best Buy Comics tackles more "serious" subjects than typical Crumb or others underground comix.  Subjects include the aerospace program, the eventual fate of humanity, attitudes toward life, death, nuclear war, and historical fiction set at the dawn of the Jazz Age. Best Buy Comics was the last title published by Apex Novelties. It was republished in 1988 by Last Gasp.
