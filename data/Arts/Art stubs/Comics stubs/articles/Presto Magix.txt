Presto Magix was a brand of art-type activity sets popular during the 1970s and 1980s. The sets were published by the American Publishing Company of Waterford, Connecticut.  They were originally made by the Papermate Division of Gillette from 1975-1978.  The transfers were printed in Italy. Presto Magix were usually a comic book formatted set which was sold at stores like Kmart as well as supermarkets in England, Puerto Rico, Canada and the United States. It contained a sheet of rub-on dry transfer decals and a background, on which players could place the decals at any place or position on the background the user wished.  The decal was applied to the background by scribbling on the paper over the decal with a pencil or similar object. Larger, boxed sets were also available. Many popular television shows, movies and entertainers of the era such as Jabberjaw, Yogi Bear, The Flintstones, Dynomutt, Scooby-Doo, Masters of the Universe, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Dukes of Hazzard, Star Wars, G.I. Joe, The Incredible Hulk  and many others, as well as Michael Jackson were featured on Presto Magix sets. The WWE, then known as WWF, also licensed Presto Magix. Hamburger restaurant chain Wimpy sold Presto Magix Star Wars sheets during the late 1970s.
