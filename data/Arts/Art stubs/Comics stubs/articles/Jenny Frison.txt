Jenny Frison is a comic book cover artist. Her interest in comics began with a Wonder Woman storybook she enjoyed as a young girl. She majored in illustration at Northern Illinois University before attending The Kubert School of Art.   During school, she decided she wanted to focus on cover art and quit before her third year to teach herself.  She met writer Tim Seeley, who asked her to draw a cover for Hack/Slash after he looked at her website.  The two became friends, and they now share a work space at Four Star Studios in Chicago, Illinois.   Her artistic process starts with a pencil sketch followed by a tonal drawing on gray paper. She colors the image in Photoshop.  She was nominated for "Best Cover Artist" in the 2013 and 2015 Harvey Awards.
