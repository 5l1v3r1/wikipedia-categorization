Sítio do Picapau Amarelo was a Brazilian comic book series based on the eponymous novel series Sítio do Picapau Amarelo by Monteiro Lobato. It was originally released in 1977 on the success of the TV show produced by Rede Globo, comic books were published by the publisher RGE who would later become Editora Globo. It continued to be sold until 1979 when the character Emília now has her own comic replacing the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, but the comic only lasted a year being sold, and in 1981 the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo returned to be published. The comic being published remained until 1984, years before the TV series is no longer in production. Only in 2006 turned comic books to be published, this time with the seal of Editora Globo spent besides being based so far by recent TV series produced in 2001 also by Rede Globo. The main reason for his return was due to exit of Monica's Gang to publisher, making them would cover space with other comics like O Menino Maluquinho and Cocoricó. It is derived from other comics as the comic of villain Cuca,  the return of the comic Emilia, among others. However, as none of them gave good yields all ended up being canceled in early 2008 not going to have any more comic in publisher.
