The first Hotwire story was published in 2005 in the A1 Bojeffries Terror Tome anthology.  This was followed by the first 4-issue limited series Hotwire: Requiem for the Dead in early 2009.  A second limited series Hotwire: Deep Cut was published by Radical Comics in late 2009. Concepts were created by Warren Ellis, with the script and art being provided by Steve Pugh.   The comic book series takes place in a science-fictional future. In it, the main character, Detective Alice Hotwire, sets out to save the world from “ectoplasmic catastrophe” that was caused by a security failure at the Maximum Security Necropolis. The break-in at the Necropolis causes “blue light ghosts” to become evil. Alice’s work is not appreciated by her fellow police colleagues. Therefore, Alice needs to overcome the villains and her lack of support to return the status quo.
