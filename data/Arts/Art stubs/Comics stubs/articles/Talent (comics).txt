Talent is a comic book series written by Christopher Golden and Tom Sniegoski, drawn by Paul Azaceta, published by Boom! Studios.  A college professor, Nicholas Dane is the only survivor of flight 654, a plane that crashes into the sea and kills the crew and 148 other passengers. Unable to account for how he was able to survive underwater for 12 hours, he is suspected of involvement in the incident. Fleeing as a fugitive, Dane finds that he now possesses the talents of the other passengers and crew and must evade members of a shadowy conspiracy out to get him. The series has been collected as a trade paperback: The film has been optioned by Universal Studios via producers Marc E. Platt, Ross Richie and Andrew Crosby (the latter two being BOOM! Studios' cofounders). The screenplay will be adapted by Zack Whedon, brother to Joss Whedon. No director has been attached yet.
