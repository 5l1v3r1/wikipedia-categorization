 Cubist Still Life with Lemons (sometimes Still Life with Lemons) is a 1975 painting by Roy Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein had a period of experimentation with still life painting from 1974 to 1976. Measuring 228.6 cm × 172.7 cm (90 in × 68 in), Still Life with Lemons represented a take on still life from the Cubist perspective, with Lichtenstein using many favorite Cubist motifs: "...pitcher, bowl of fruit, and faux wood grain - with some of his own, such as sections of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue, portions of an entablature, and a pattern of diagonal stripes."  The work has an element of three-dimensionality due to its overlapping planes and reflection, although this still life series was meant to look flat.   According to Jack Cowart, "...The scale of Lichtenstein's [Cubist still life] work is antithetical to the primarily intimate and more closely related nature of real Cubism."
