Feature Comics was a comic book anthology title published in the United States by Quality Comics from 1939 until 1950, that featured short stories in the superhero and humor genres. The series was a continuation of Feature Funnies, a reprint collection of newspaper comic strips that was published by Harry "A" Chesler between 1937 and 1939, for twenty issues. Feature Comics continued the numbering with issue #21, and ran until #144. Other notable characters that appeared in Feature Comics include Phantom Lady, as well as many strips serving as backups, including Boody Rogers' "Babe" and "Dudley", "Rube Goldberg's Side Show," Louis Cazeneuve's "Yank and Doodle," and the sports strip "Ned Brant." (Like the Clock and "Jane Arden," the "Ned Brant" feature also moved over to Crack Comics after issue #31, making room for new Feature Comics features.)
