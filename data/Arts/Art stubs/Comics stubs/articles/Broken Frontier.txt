Broken Frontier is a web-magazine  which publishes news, interviews, and essays about the American comic book industry. It was founded by Editor-in-Chief Frederik Hautain in 2002. In 2017 the site came under the ownership of long-term contributor and Editor-in-Chief Andy Oliver. In 2006, Broken Frontier was purchased by the multimedia entertainment company and comics publisher Platinum Studios  as part of an initiative to increase Platinum's Web presence. Broken Frontier was a fully owned subsidiary of Platinum at this time, but was given the autonomy to continue operating as before. However, in July 2007, Platinum terminated its association with Broken Frontier,   leaving the site independently owned once again. In 2010, Broken Frontier launched The Frontiersman,   a companion to the Broken Frontier website.
