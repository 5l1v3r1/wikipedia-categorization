Goldie Vance is a comic book series created by Eisner award winning writer Hope Larson and artist Brittney Williams. It was a monthly ongoing series from 2016 to 2017, then switched to a series of original graphic novels in 2018. The series centers on Marigold "Goldie" Vance, the 16-year-old daughter of the manager of a Miami resort, whose dream is to become the resort's in-house detective.  The first issue centers around Goldie searching a necklace reported missing by guest Dieter Lugwig, uncovering a plot to escape Russian agents and sell NASA a brand new formula for rocket fuel. In the second issue, Goldie and Cheryl encounter a woman in an astronaut suit washed up on a beach. Cheryl and the woman vanish shortly thereafter, and Goldie tracks their trail leading to a mysterious rogue astronaut training program. Sugar Maple, Goldie's longtime rival, recruits her to find out who is sabotaging her prize race car before the big race she'll be competing in. Simpson Street for Fox will produce a movie based on the comic. Rashida Jones will write and direct the movie, while Kerry Washington will produce it.
