Journey: The Adventures of Wolverine MacAlistaire was an independent comic book created by William Messner-Loebs about Michigan frontier life in the 19th century. An ensemble piece, it tells the story of the Fort Miami settlement and the characters, both real and fictional, that occupy it.  Among these is the title character, Joshua "Wolverine" MacAlistaire. Journey was published first, as a back-up feature in Cerebus #48, and #49, by Deni Loubert under the banner of Aardvark-Vanaheim, and then as a title unto its own, starting with Issue #1 in Mar./Apr. 1983. The 13th issue featured a crossover with Jim Valentino's normalman. After fourteen issues, the series moved to Fantagraphics.  There were twenty-seven issues in all. There was a Journey story in Fantagraphics' Anything Goes! #5 (Oct. 1987). A sequel to the original series, Journey: Wardrums (Fantagraphics, 1987 â€“ 1990), was billed as a six-issue mini-series, but only two issues were published.  A new Journey story was included in the one-shot Many Happy Returns (published by About Comics) in 2008. In July 2008, IDW Publishing released a trade paperback collecting the first 16 issues. In 2009, a second volume was released, containing the next ten issues.
