Rose City Comic Con (RCCC) is an annual comic book and pop culture convention that takes place in Portland, Oregon each September. The first convention in 2012 was held at the DoubleTree hotel near the Lloyd Center. The second annual event, held in 2013, was co-produced, co-funded and co-organized by Emerald City Comic-Con,  the largest comic book convention in the Pacific Northwest that saw significant expansion in the years prior. This transition moved RCCC to the Oregon Convention Center and took up halls A1, B, and C, totaling more than 120,000 square feet, and saw a 405% increase in attendance. Since 2013, Emerald City Comic-Con and Rose City Comic-Con have been a Pacific Northwest partnership stationed in its two biggest cities: Seattle and Portland.
