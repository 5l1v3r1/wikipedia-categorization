The Prowler was a comic created by Timothy Truman and John K. Snyder III for Eclipse Comics.  Two four-issue color miniseries, a black and white one-shot and a one-shot crossover with Airboy were published in 1987-1988. The comic concerned a manipulative elderly hero, in the manner of The Shadow, and his much younger sidekick/protégé.
