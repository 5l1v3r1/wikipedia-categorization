Fantabaires is a comics convention in Buenos Aires that started in 1996.  Unlike salons in Europe, which are typically organized by major publishers, this convention was organized by a local comic shop and a couple local comic magazines. At the first convention, creators formed the Asociaci√≥n de Historietistas Independientes (Association of Independent Comic Creators).
