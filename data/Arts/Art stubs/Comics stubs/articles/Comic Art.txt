Comic Art is a magazine, edited by Todd Hignite, which surveys newspaper comic strips, magazine cartoon panels and comic book art, both historical and contemporary.  Comic Art was established in 2002.  The first seven issues featured articles on Art Spiegelman, Daniel Clowes, Harvey Kurtzman, Crockett Johnson and Frank King. According to critic Tom Spurgeon, "Comic Art is a comics publication that... has chosen to investigate the good and interesting no matter when it's been done."  Daniel Zimmer is the publication's graphic design and art director. It is not connected with the original fanzine Comic Art, which was published (beginning in 1960) by Maggie and Don Thompson. In 2003 the magazine was nominated for both the Eisner Awards and Harvey Awards. Since August 2006, Comic Art has been published annually in book form by Buenaventura Press. In 2006, Yale University Press published a collection of Hignite's "In The Studio" columns in an expanded 320-page hardback, In the Studio: Visits with Contemporary Cartoonists, ISBNÂ 0-300-11016-2.
