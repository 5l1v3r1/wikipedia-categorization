Dinowars: The Jurassic War of the Worlds is a comic book from Antarctic Press. It centers on Earth today beset by dinosaurs that escaped into space to avoid the ice age and have now returned to claim the world as their own, mirroring the original The War of the Worlds. The comic is written and illustrated by Eisner-nominated artist Rod Espinosa. "Prepare for World War D! We thought the dinosaurs were all gone. We were dead wrong. 65 million years ago, a species of evolved dinosaurs left our Earth, and now they're back! It's the Jurassic War of the Worlds as these Neosaurs commence a massive invasion to reclaim their planet and make Mankind extinct!"
