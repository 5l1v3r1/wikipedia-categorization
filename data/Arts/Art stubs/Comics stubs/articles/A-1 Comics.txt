A-1 Comics is a Golden Age comics publication that began in 1944 and ended in 1955, lasting 139 issues.  Only the first 17 issues carried the title "A-1" on the cover.  Issues 18 and up used the feature as the book title with different numbering.  A-1 and its numbering continued to be used in the indicia.  The series was used by owner Vincent Sullivan's Magazine Enterprises to try out a number of potential characters and titles, as well as reprinting newspaper strips such as Texas Slim, Kerry Drake and Teena.  Several original A-1 titles succeeded and were given their own titles, including Tim Holt and The Ghost Rider.  Issues were devoted to Thun'da, Cave Girl, and Strongman.  Title that didn't do well included Dick Powell Adventurer, Fibber McGee and Molly, and Jimmy Durante Comics.  The final issue was devoted to Bob Powell's Strongman.  A-1 Comics was published at an irregular frequency.  Issues would carry their own unique numbering, series titles, and frequencies in addition to the A-1 title and numbering.  Some would continue titles and numbering from series that Magazine Enterprises had previously canceled.
