Super Conventions, also known as Supercon (legal name Super Festivals, LLC), is a privately owned company based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that organizes comic book and anime conventions in the southeastern United States.    Events currently include Florida Supercon in Fort Lauderdale, Raleigh Supercon in Raleigh, North Carolina and the inaugural Louisville Supercon in Louisville Kentucky.       The first Supercon was organized by founder Mike Broder in late 2006 at the Ramada Hollywood Beach Resort in Hollywood, Florida, called Florida Supercon.   He was looking to bring a large scale convention to south Florida.  Another event, Anime Supercon, took place in Fort Lauderdale five months later.  Estimated attendances at each event averaged around 2,000 people.    As success grew, other conventions were added throughout the Fort Lauderdale and Miami metro areas.  An attempt was made in November 2008 to hold a longstanding Supercon outside of Florida, in Atlanta, Georgia, but it was not as prosperous as the Florida events.  Another try didn't take place until July 2017 with Raleigh Supercon in North Carolina, replacing the promotional Wizard World Raleigh Comic Con which eventually moved to nearby Winston-Salem after the 2015 event.  Raleigh Supercon 2017 drew in an estimated 30,000 people for the weekend.    Super Conventions later acquired the former Derby City Comic Con in Louisville, Kentucky, which has been re-branded as Louisville Supercon.  Its inaugural event will take place in November 2018.  Two other recent conventions, Animate! Florida (formerly known as Animate! Miami) and Paradise City Comic Con (formerly known as Magic City Comic Con), were discontinued in 2018 so Super Conventions could concentrate on their three Supercon events.   Both of those had taken place in Miami.
