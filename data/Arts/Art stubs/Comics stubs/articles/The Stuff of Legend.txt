A band of toys goes on a journey into the Dark realm to rescue a young boy, who is their owner, from the infamous Bogeyman. In the Dark Realm, which is inside the boy's closet, they change. They become life sized, with functional weapons and, in the teddy bear's case, teeth. As they venture into the Dark, they battle the Bogeyman's forces, composed mostly of bitter, lost toys, fallen under the fearful powers of their Dark master. The comics collected into trade paperbacks: In 2010, Wilson was nominated for the Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award for his work on The Stuff of Legend.   According to Deadline, in 2012 Walt Disney Pictures made a pitch deal to make a film version of the graphic novel with Pete Candeland to direct and Shawn Christensen writing the script; however, Shawn became unavailable and is no longer involved.  In his absence, "Saw" writers, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan have been selected to adapt the series to a live-action film.
