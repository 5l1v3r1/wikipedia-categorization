Dhaka Pop Culture Expo was a convention for fans of comic books, film, TV, anime and video games, held in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka. The first event was held on Friday and Saturday 30–31 August 2013 at Baridhara DOHS Convention Center, Dhaka; it was attended by over 2,000 participants. The 2014 expo is scheduled for 24–25 June 2014 at the National Shooting Federation Hall in Dhaka. The third edition took place 31 July and 1 August 2015.   Comic-cons and pop expos are popular in the US, UK, Australia, and Japan. For years Bangladeshi fans wished for such events in Bangladesh. Their wishes finally came true - Dhaka Comicon, then Dhaka Pop Culture Expo, then Unmad-JCC Comic Con. It was the first fan convention in Bangladesh ever held inside a convention center.
