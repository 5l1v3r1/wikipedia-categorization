The Ganzfeld is an art magazine  created by three New York City artists in 2000; Dan Nadel, Patrick Smith (of Vectorpark.com) and Tim Hodler (a Details editor), who were art graduates of Washington University in St. Louis. It is similar to the Meathaus anthology, created by artists who attended the New York School of Visual Arts.  After the first issue, Smith and Hodler left the publication due to creative differences and were replaced by Peter Buchanan-Smith, art director for The New York Times. The Ganzfeld combines art and art criticism, much of it related to comic books and cartoonists. Contributors include Chris Ware, Lauren Weinstein, Ren√©e French, Ron Rege, Jr., Sasha Hirschfeld, Peter Blegvad, Blexbolex and Brian Ralph. Buchanan-Smith left in 2005; Nadel is now the sole editor of the anthology, which has ceased publication as of issue seven.
