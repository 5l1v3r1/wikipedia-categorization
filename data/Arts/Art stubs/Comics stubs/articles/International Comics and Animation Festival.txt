The International Comics and Animation Festival (ICAF) is an academic conference and international comic convention held every autumn in Washington, D.C.. It was founded in 1995 by Georgetown University's Department of French. Beginning in 1997, it has been held in conjunction many times with the Small Press Expo (SPX).  Both ICAF and SPX were cancelled in 2001 due to creators' travel difficulties related to the September 11, 2001 attacks.
