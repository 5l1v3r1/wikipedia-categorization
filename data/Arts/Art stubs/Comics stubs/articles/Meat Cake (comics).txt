Meat Cake is a comic book series written and drawn by Dame Darcy. Originally published by Caliber Press, Meat Cake was published by Fantagraphics in the United States from 1993 to 2008.  Meat Cake has been described as "neo-Victorian,"  with each issue containing a collection of stories featuring a cast of oddball characters. All the same, Meat Cake was characterized by one critic as extremely personal: "the aesthetic that made Meatcake so distinctive wasn't cultivated; it was who [Dame Darcy] was, and how she was."  One issue of Meat Cake was published in 1992 by Caliber Press.  In 1993 Fantagraphics picked up Meat Cake as an ongoing series, starting over the numbering with issue #1. Early issues were produced approximately every 6 months, but by issue #8, only one issue was published per year, until issue #17 (2008). No new issues of Meat Cake have appeared since.
