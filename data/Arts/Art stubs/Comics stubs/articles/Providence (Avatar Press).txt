The series is set in 1919 and centres on Robert Black, a gay writer,  initially working in New York as a reporter for the New York Herald. Black takes a leave of absence from his journalism career, with the intention of writing a Great American Novel using "the “Outsiders”, perhaps “occult Outsiders”—whom he is on the trail of across New England—as a metaphor for social outsiders".  Alan Moore heavily researched the series - in a six-month period he acquired "nearly every book of [Lovecraft] criticism that’s been written".  The series is being collected into individual volumes: The series has met with critical acclaim, holding an average score of 9.3 out of 10 at review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup.
