Hans Seyffer, also known as Hans Seyfer or Hans of Heilbronn (c.1460â€“1509), was a stone sculptor and wood carver of the late Gothic style. Seyffer was born in Sinsheim.  Little else is known about his life.  He lived and worked at a dramatic turn of an era (from late Gothic to Renaissance) together with other masters (e.g. Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoss and Hans Brueggemann).  He created many well-known works of art in Heilbronn and Stuttgart (both in Germany).  He died in Heilbronn.
