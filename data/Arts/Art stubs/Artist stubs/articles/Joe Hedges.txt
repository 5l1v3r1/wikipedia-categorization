Joe Hedges (born September 6, 1980) is an American rock singer, songwriter, musician, and visual artist. Hedges spent his high school years in Middletown Ohio.  Hedges is possibly best known as the lead vocalist and main songwriter for the American alternative rock music group July for Kings. As of 2016, he has released four studio albums with the band: Swim (2002), Nostalgia (2004), Monochrome (2009), and Middletown (2015). He is also well known for his solo career. Straying from the alternative rock route that he had known so well with July for Kings, he incorporates a more electronica and pop rock sound to his solo music. He has released two studio albums: Curvature (2007) and Alchemy (2010).  He has also released one compilation album: Lexington Demos (2008). In addition to his music career, Hedges is a visual artist having shown paintings, photographs, and collages at galleries in the Cincinnati area including the Middletown Arts Center, Kennedy Heights Art Center, Northern Kentucky University, and the Artisans Enterprise Center.
