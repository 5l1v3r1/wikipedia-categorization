Jenny Kendler is an American artist, activist and naturalist whose work deals with "re-storying" human beings' relationship with the natural world through projects on ecological loss, climate change, facing extinction and welcoming 'otherness' in the natural world. Since 2014 she has been the first Artist-in-Residence with the Natural Resources Defense Council.   Her notable projects include Music For Elephants,  Tell it to the Birds ', Sculpture---> Garden, One Hour of Birds  and Milkweed Dispersal Balloons.  She is also part of a cross-disciplinary team awarded a major grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Humanities Without Walls initiative to present her public art and community-engagement project Garden for a Changing Climate in 2018.  Kendler received a Bachelor of Fine Arts (summa cum laude) from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2002  and a Master of Fine Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006.  Kendler’s work often takes the form of large-scale, often interactive, outdoor works or community co-created projects in 'unconventional' locations such as a Costa Rican tropical forest, an Arizona desert, a series of Chicago neighborhoods or in the fern room at the Lincoln Park Conservatory.  She also presents exhibitions, projects and workshops at cultural venues including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery,  the Pulitzer Arts Foundation,  the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago,  the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art,  the DePaul Art Museum,  the Kochi-Muziris Biennale,  the Chicago Biennial at the Elmhurst Art Museum,  the Terrain Biennial  and Exit Art—with upcoming projects at the Arts Club of Chicago and at Storm King Art Center for their 2018 exhibition on climate change.
