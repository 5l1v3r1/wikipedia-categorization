Shane Campbell was born in 1978 in San Diego. He has been living and working in Brooklyn, New York since graduating from the Yale MFA program in 2007.  His first solo exhibition took place at Artissima in Turin, Italy and is recently represented by the Bortolami Gallery, New York in 2009.  Parades are of ongoing interest for Campbell, who depicts this familiar setting with its customary details and characters including clowns, policemen, balloons and crowds. This concern began while he was a student, where he made paintings of half-time parades at university sporting events. Over the past few years, his parades have expanded into more general, less specific landscapes that could be of any American town or city. The works depict various aspects of a single parade, from isolated details to full views.   2005	 California State University Long Beach, California 2007  Yale School of Art, MFA 2009 Acacia Grant 2007 Ralph Mayer Prize, Yale School of Art 2005  Joy of Life Award, CSULB 2004  Fine Arts Affiliate Award, CSULB 2009  Via Farini, Milan, Italy 2010		 2009 2008		 2007	 2005 	 2004 		 2002
