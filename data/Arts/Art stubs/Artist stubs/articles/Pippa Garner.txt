 Pippa Garner (born 1942), formerly known as Philip Garner, is an artist and author known for making parody forms of consumer products as well as custom bicycles and automobiles. Notable publications written by Garner include The Better Living Catalog  and Utopia—or Bust! Products for the Perfect World.  Garner began her career in the 1970s in Los Angeles as a performance artist. A Chevrolet modified by Pippa was featured in Esquire Magazine in 1975 and noticed by the San Francisco art collective Ant Farm, and she subsequently began a collaboration with Chip Lord.  In the 1980s, Pippa began her transition to a different gender as part of what she considered an "art project to create disorientation in my position in society, and sort of balk any possibility of ever falling into a stereotype again."  As Philip Garner, she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, the Merv Griffin Show and other talk shows showcasing her satirical consumer product "inventions", and her art has appeared in Car & Driver, Rolling Stone, Arts & Architecture and Vogue, among other publications.  Pippa Garner participated in Trappings, an artwork by Two Girls Working: Tiffany Ludwig and Renee Piechocki.  During her interview for the project, she described her transition from male to female as a form of artistic expression.  Her Trappings interview is available here.  Pippa has also appeared on the show "Monster Garage" as a guest artist in a few episodes.   Better Living Catalog Utopia—or Bust! Products for the Perfect World Garner's Gizmos & Gadgets
