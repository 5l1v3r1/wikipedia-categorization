Bernard Evans Ward (1857  – August 3, 1933  ) was a British painter who emigrated to the United States.  Born in London, Ward was a renowned painter of the Victorian era who won a gold medal for some of his works exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists.  Bernard E. Ward founded, together with A. A. Calderon (1847-1911), London´s St John's Wood Art School. After a lawsuit had cost him his fortune,  he emigrated to the United States, where he lived in 1913 near Cleveland, Ohio,  where his daughter was a reporter for a London newspaper, possibly the Illustrated London News. Ward quickly made himself a name as a portraitist in his new hometown.  In the early 1920s, the family lived for some time in Florida,  before returning to Akron, Ohio, where Bernard Evans Ward died at the age of 76 in his granddaughter's house.  His works were exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, the Royal Scottish Academy, the Royal Academy of Arts and the Royal Society of British Artists.
