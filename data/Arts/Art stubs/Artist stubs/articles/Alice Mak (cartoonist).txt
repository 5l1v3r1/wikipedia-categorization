Alice Mak (Chinese: 麥家碧) is an artist and cartoonist. She is one of the two creators of the cartoon characters McMug and McDull. The animated films My Life as McDull and McDull, Prince de la Bun have received numerous awards. McDull, The Alumni, was released in early 2006. In 2005, the Circle K convenience store, together with Bliss (the company that owns the copyright to the McDull and McMug series), launched a marketing campaign named "McMug Spell-it-out" (Chinese:麥嘜任你串 Lit. Spell it out with McMug). For any purchase in Circle-K exceeding HK$20, the customer gets a badge with a picture of McMug (or its friends) and a silly motto sheet. The complete set of these badges features the 26 English letters A–Z, plus additional “secret” designs featuring a heart (with Goosie), an exclamation mark (with Darby), a question mark (with Fai), and an ampersand (with May and June).
