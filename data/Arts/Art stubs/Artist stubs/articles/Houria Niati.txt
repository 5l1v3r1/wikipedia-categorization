 Houria Niati (born 1948 in Khemis Miliana, Algeria) is an Algerian, contemporary artist living in London.  Niati specializes in mixed media installations that criticize Western representations of Non-Western cultures and peoples.  Her installations notably have live performances most commonly traditional Algerian music such as Raï, as a key visual representation of Niati's homeland and culture.  Salah M. Hassan further details her performances, "She uses synthesizers, sound recordings, and special light effects to create a theatrical atmosphere and a vibrant magical environment of sound, body movement, and color."  The installations and exhibitions join together paintings, sculptures, drawings, photos, soundtracks, and performances.  Niati grew up in French-occupied Algeria, where over one million Algerians were killed for resisting occupation.  When Niati was twelve years old, she demonstrated against French colonialism with her anti-colonial graffiti, which landed her in jail.  Niati's experiences with the French occupation and eventual revolution of her people greatly influenced her art later in life.  Niati moved to London in the late 1970s, where she observed Western art that depicted Algerian people, especially women, in a fictionalized and exotic way.  This influenced her own depictions of post-colonial cultures, nations, and people.  She attended Camden Arts Centre and Croydon College of Art.  Niati, Houria (1999). "Diverse Bodies of Experiences".
