Lisa Sigal (born 1962, Philadelphia) is a contemporary artist who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Lisa Sigal's work lies at the intersection of painting, sculpture and architecture. Her constructions insinuate themselves into the fabric of the built environment. She will take a Sheetrock wall, cut into it, pull back sections, poke a sightline through to a false or a found wall on which she has exposed or composed a painted surface. The core of her work questions the formal and philosophical stability of structure. Recent and upcoming solo and group exhibitions include: Prospect.3: Notes for Now, New Orleans (2014â€“15); Riverbed, LAX Art, Los Angeles (2013);  Building, Dwelling, Thinking, NOMA Gallery, San Francisco (2010);  Museum as Hub: Six Degrees, New Museum, New York (2008);  The 2008 Whitney Biennial, New York;  Tent Paintings, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, New York (2007); The Orpheus Selection, PS1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City (2007); Make It Now, SculptureCenter, Long Island City, (2005); and A House of Many Mansions, Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut (2005).  Sigal is the co-founder and co-curator, with Nova Benway, of Open Sessions, a program for artists run by The Drawing Center.
