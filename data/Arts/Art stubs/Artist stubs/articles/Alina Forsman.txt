Alina Forsman (1845-1899) was a Finnish sculptor. She is referred to as the first female sculptor in Finland.   Forsman was born in 1845 and died in 1899.  Alina Forsman reportedly had a "burning interest" for the art of sculpture, which was controversial for a woman at the time, as sculpturing, demanding physical labor, was regarded as a masculine subject.  She debuted as a sculptor in 1871. She studied art in Germany and Rome in 1873-75 and in Copenhagen in 1875-78. She can be regarded as the first female Finnish sculptor rather than Eveliina Särkelä (1847-1939), active just shortly after her, who is normally referred to a such; however, Forsman mainly worked abroad rather than in her native Finland.  From 1887 onward, she lived permanently in Germany; first in Berlin, and later in Wiemar.
