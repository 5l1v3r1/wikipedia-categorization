Miksa Róth  (December 26, 1865 – June 14, 1944) was a Hungarian mosaicist and stain glass artist responsible for making mosaic and stained glass prominent art forms in Hungarian art.   In part, Róth was inspired by the work of Pre-Raphealite artists Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris.  Róth apprenticed at his father, Zsigmond Róth's leaded stain glass studio. Starting a business in 1885, he would make commissions for a number of buildings, largely in Budapest, including the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Buda Castle.  Róth also received a number of commissions outside the country as well, for example the National Theatre of Mexico.
