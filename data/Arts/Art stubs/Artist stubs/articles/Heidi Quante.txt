 Heidi Quante is an interdisciplinary artist who has been designing environmental and human rights public engagement initiatives since 2003. Her passion is to devise new art forms that engage the public in the pressing social and environmental issues of our time.    Her artwork is divided into two practices. One is personal, documenting her emotional and physical interactions with the changing environment. The other is interactive, consisting of large scale participatory artworks.
