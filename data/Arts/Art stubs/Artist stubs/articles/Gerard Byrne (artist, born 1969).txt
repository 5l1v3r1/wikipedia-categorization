Gerard Byrne (born 1969) is an Irish artist. He works primarily in film, video and photography in large-scale installations which reconstruct imagery found in magazine published in the 1970s through the 1980s. He is a graduate of National College of Art & Design in Dublin, New School for Social Research in New York and a participant in the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York. Byrne represented Ireland at the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007. Byrne's work utilizes lens-based media in carefully reconstructed images of “particular historically charged conversations originally published in popular magazines from the 1960s -1980s, with the intention of testing the cultural present of the gallery space against the present evoked in a magazine article from the recent past.”   Byrne has exhibited internationally at ICA Boston, Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, Kunstmuseum, Basel, Sweden, The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery, Toronto, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, the 3rd Tate Triennial, Tate Britain, London, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Manifesta 4, Frankfurt, PS.1 Art Center, New York and 8th Istanbul Biennale, Istanbul and the Renaissance Society in 2011.
