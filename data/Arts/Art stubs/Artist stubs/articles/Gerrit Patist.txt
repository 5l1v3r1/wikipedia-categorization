Gerrit Patist (1947 - De Bilt, 2005) was a Dutch sculptor and ceramist.  Patist has produced many works of art, mostly sculptures and ceramics, but he also worked with brush and ink. He was always looking for material for sculptures or ceramics, which has brought him to the strangest places in Europe where he could find the right stone for his ideas. The trips and the experiences are felt in the stone, or seen in his paintings. Gerrit Patist has so worked on his last day in his studio to images. He died at the age of 57 from leukemia.
