Kees Stoop (born 19 March 1929) is a Dutch painter, drawer and etcher. Born in Werkendam, he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and the Higher Institute for Fine Arts in Antwerp in the 1950s where Prof. Jos Hendrickx influenced the young artist greatly. Further inspiration was found in the works of Constant Permeke and Gustave De Smet.  He has been living and working in Holten since the 1960s where he is residing to this day.  Despite being known to work in isolation and hardly ever exhibiting, his work has received relative national recognition.
