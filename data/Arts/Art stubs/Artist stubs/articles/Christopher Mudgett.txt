 Christopher Joseph Mudgett (born December 14, 1982) is an American artist known for his bold yet simplistic monochromatic artworks; primarily oil paintings, drawings & sculptures.  He lives and works in the historic Whitley Heights district of Los Angeles, soaking in the abundant inspiration of his surroundings, and using his intricate works to trace a meaningful dialogue with humanity as a whole.  Since childhood, Mudgett has always shown a strong interest in art. At the age of nine he visited the Barnes Collection in Dallas, where he had a first taste of what was possible in painting. His first meeting with the great masters like Van Gogh, Cézanne and Picasso opened his eyes to the possibility of what art can do, not only for the human spirit, but also as a way of transforming abstract ideas into something that can to be universally shared and understood. However, his journey into the visual arts world does not begin until 2011, after 15 years of music career, when he felt he needed a more immediate and direct form of self-expression to satisfy his creative impulses.  A stylistic descendent of the cubist movement, Mudgett adds a nostalgic, reflective fingerprint to the genre. Oftentimes, rendering his subjects with a single, continuous line, he uses the fluidity of shapes to explore the genuine naïveté of his subjects. Since 2012, Mudgett has exhibited his work in numerous galleries and art fairs across the country. Most recently LA Art Show & Art Basel Miami.  Christopher Mudgett's artwork is currently held in private collections around the world, including North & Central America, Great Britain, Singapore, Denmark, Spain, Germany, France & China.
