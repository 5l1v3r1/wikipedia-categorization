Yang Kyung-soo  (born 1983) is a South Korean artist. Yang's single-frame webtoons which capture the unique hierarchy of the typical Korean workplace and uploaded regularly on his Instagram have gained a popular following among Korean office workers. The pictures are receiving thousands of "likes" and comments on social media, with people remarking how relatable and vicariously satisfying the scenes are. "The whole point of my pictures is to say what you can't in real life. I think that's why people like them," he said. Though he started sketching the webtoons for fun, he now feels a sense of purpose if his work could contribute to a healthier workplace in Korea.   After graduating from Chugye University for the Arts where he majored in Western art, Yang has pursued many creative ventures, such as beauty accessories, interior design and mural painting, among others. Despite the lack of office experience he inspired by his friends stories for his webtoon series. Though Yang started sketching the webtoons for fun now he feels a sense of purpose in what he is doing.    This 32-year-old man said the office culture in Korea is a mixture of Confucianism and military hierarchy because all South Korean men must join the military service. In his comic, Yang gives the character of his office worker the power of saying things that in reality can not afford his colleagues. The popularity of this comic is one sign that the office culture in Korea is getting more liberal. Although his parents are also artists and his income depends on the commission but they disagree with Yang's chosen path.   His works of modern Buddhist art "Eight Scenes of Buddha's Life" are currently on display at Amsterdam's Museum Volkenkunde until January 2017.
