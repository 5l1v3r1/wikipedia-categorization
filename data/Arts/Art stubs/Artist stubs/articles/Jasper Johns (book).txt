Jasper Johns is a non-fiction coffee table book written by Michael Crichton about the artist Jasper Johns. It was originally published in 1977 by Harry N. Abrams Inc in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art,  and a second revised edition (ISBN 0810935155) was published in 1994. The psychiatrist Janet Ross owned a copy of the painting Numbers by Jasper Johns in The Terminal Man, another book by Crichton. The technophobic antagonist of the story found it odd that a person would paint numbers as they were inorganic.  Michael Crichton himself had a superb art collection, including several important works by Jasper Johns. Most of them were sold at an auction Christie’s in 2010.
