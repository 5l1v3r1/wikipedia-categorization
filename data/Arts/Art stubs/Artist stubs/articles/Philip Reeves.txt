Philip Reeves RSA PRSW RGI RE (7 July 1931 - 14 March 2017) was an English artist, collage-maker and printmaker who lived for much of his life in Scotland.  His parents were Bert Reeves and Lillian Langford, and he had a twin brother. Reeves studied at the Cheltenham School of Art (1947 - 1949) and at the Royal College of Art, London (1951-1954). Reeves became a lecturer at Glasgow School of Art in 1954 and was Head of Printmaking from 1970 to 1991. He founded the Edinburgh Printmakers Workshop in 1961 and was a founder member of Glasgow Print Studio in 1972.  He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1951, an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1971, was the President of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolours from 1998 to 2005 . Reeves was instrumental in developing the printmaking department at Glasgow School of Art. As printmaking took on a more central role within contemporary art during the 1960s and 1970s, Reeves developed his own work and experimented with print techniques as well as moving into collage. Inspiration for his work came from rural or coastal areas - the West Highland Way or cliffs in the North of Scotland, as much as urban scenes and cityscapes.
