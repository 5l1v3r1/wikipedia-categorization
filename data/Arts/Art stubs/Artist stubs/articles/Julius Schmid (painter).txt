Julius Schmid (1854â€“1935) was a Viennese painter known for his painting of Franz Schubert, Schubertiade (also known as Schubertaband). He fell into obscurity in the 20th century.  Schmid was born in Vienna, and studied at the local Academy of Fine Arts for seven years. He won the Prix de Rome in 1878, which allowed him to study there for two years, after which he decided to travel around Italy to improve his craft. He was taught briefly by Hans Makart, who also taught Gustav Klimt.
