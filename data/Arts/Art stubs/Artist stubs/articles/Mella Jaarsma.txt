Mella Jaarsma (born Emmeloord, 1960) is an artist who hails from the Netherlands but now resides in Indonesia.  Jaarsma's work comments on social and political issues within Indonesian society, mainly: discrimination, racialism, minorities and identity. Her most well known work are body-covering shelters made out of unexpected materials.  For example, frog skins, squirrels, bats, snakes and chickens are employed to create a wearable piece. The garment symbolises protection, and visually represents fear or a need for a 'security blanket'. Her work also alludes to the isolation of human beings and the need for a filtered approach to the world.  Jaarsma has achieved international recognition, having been presented in international art events and galleries including: Singapore Art Museum, Third Asia Pacific Triennal, Queensland Art Gallery, Limerick City Gallery of Art, Gwangju Biennale, Yokohama Triennale, Katonah Museum of Art, National Gallery of Indonesia and The Royal Academy of Arts. In 1988, with her partner, Nindityo Adipurnomo she founded the Cemeti Art House in Yogyakarta. Cemeti Art House organises exhibitions, projects and residencies.
