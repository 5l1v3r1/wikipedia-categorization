Martine Fougeron is a French photographer based in New York.   Fougeron relocated to the United States as a child with her family, but spent her high school years in a boarding school in France, thereafter transitioning back and forth between France and the United States until relocating for work to New York in 1996.  She took up photography in 2002 in part to spend more time with her children and within a few years embarked upon a multi-year project of photographing her sons and their friends in their formative years. The resultant series was displayed at the Gallery at Herm√®s in 2013, before its release in 2014 as the collection Teen Tribe, a World with Two Sons.    In 2016, a selection of the series was featured in the collection Family Photography Now, along with eight other photographers.  The photographs have been widely exhibited.  In 2011, Fougeron began working on a series of images documenting life in South Bronx. Titled The South Bronx Trades, the series was exhibited at the Bronx Museum in 2014.
