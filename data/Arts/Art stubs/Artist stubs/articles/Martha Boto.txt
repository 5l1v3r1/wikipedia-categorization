Martha Boto (27 December 1925 – 13 October 2004) was an Argentinian artist.   Boto was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and studied drawing and painting at Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes in 1944.   She moved to Paris in 1959 with her husband and collaborator Gregorio Vardanega, where she lived until her death in 2004.  She is considered to be a pioneer of kinetic and programmed art.  Boto's earliest work was primarily geometric abstractions, and she had several solo exhibitions in the 1950s.   By 1956, she joined the Concrete art group "Arte Nuevo" and began to experiment with materials such as plexiglass, light, and mirrors.  She was among the first artists in Buenos Aires to use movement as a component in her sculptures.  In 1957, she started the group Artistas No Figurativos de la Argentina alongside Gregorio Vardanega.  After Boto moved to Paris, Denise René promoted her work   and she also showed pieces at the first Biennale de Paris.  Boto began to incorporate more industrial materials, such as electric motors,  into her sculptures at this time.
