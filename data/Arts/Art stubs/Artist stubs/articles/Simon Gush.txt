Simon Gush (born 1981) is an artist and film maker. He lives in Johannesburg, South Africa.  His artworks and essay films explore images of labor, work ethic, work rhythms that have shaped Johannesburg.   In 2014 Gush produced the exhibition Red about the 1990 labour unrest at the Mercedes Benz plant in East London, South Africa.  The exhibition included a disassembled reconstruction of the red Mercedes built for Nelson Mandela, an installation of speculative reconstructions of strike uniforms by Mokotjo Mohulo, and beds used by strikers.   Central to the exhibition was the documentary film Red, made in collaboration with James Cairns.
