Judie Bamber was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1961. She received her BFA from California Institute of the Arts in 1983.  Judie Bamber creates representational paintings and drawings based on photographic sources ranging from images of female genitalia to seascapes.   Her early work included still lifes in which objects, painted to scale, floated in front of monochromatic color fields.   In 2002, Bamber began a series of seascapes, making initial plain-air watercolor sketches that she then used for oil paintings. From 2005-2014, she worked on the project  Are You My Mother?, consisting of small-scale representational watercolors and graphite drawings, based on posed erotic and fashion like Polaroids her father took of her mother in the 1960s.
