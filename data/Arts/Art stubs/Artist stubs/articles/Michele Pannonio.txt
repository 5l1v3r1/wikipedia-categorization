Michele Pannonio, in Hungarian language Pannóniai Mihály, also known Michele Ongaro o Michele Dai Ungheria (born before 1415 – Ferrara, before 1464) was a Hungarian-Italian painter, active in Ferrara, Italy.  He is documented as the painter of the Muse Thalia for the Studiolo di Belfiore, now  present in the Museum of Fine Arts of Budapest. The Pinacoteca Nazionale di Ferrara has two works by Pannonio, a San Ludovico da Tolosa and a San Bernardino da Siena. Both were formerly in the chiesa di Spirito Santo of Ferrara.
