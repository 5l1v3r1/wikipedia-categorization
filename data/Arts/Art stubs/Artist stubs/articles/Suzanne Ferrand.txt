Suzanne Ferrand (1902-?) was a French artist. She illustrated two World War I posters. One was titled (in French), "Grow Wheat, It is Gold for France." It prominently features wheat, a sickle, and the French flag.  The second poster released in 1918, was titled (in French), "Save Your Wine For Our Soldiers." On the poster is a wine jug, a vine of grapes, and a cup filled with wine.
