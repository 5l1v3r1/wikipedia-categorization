Hélène Perdriat (1894–1969) was a painter and illustrator born in La Rochelle, France. Perdriat began painting at the age of twenty-one when she contracted what was believed to be a life threatening illness, and spent much of her recovery creating portraits of herself, her friends, and her family.  Following her recovery, she married Thorvald Hellesen, a Norwegian artist. The couple took a trip to Oslo where she exhibited her paintings which were well received.  Perdriat continued to exhibit in London, Berlin, New York,  Chicago, and Paris despite receiving no formal training. She was known for having a distinct and personally poetic style. Her work is included in many prominent collections, including the Katherine Dreier Collection.  She also worked as set designer for the Ballets suédois , for example with the set for Marchand d'Oiseux 1923.
