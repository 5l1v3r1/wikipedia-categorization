  Alex Mawimbi, formerly known as Ato Malinda,    is a multidisciplinary performance artist born in Kenya and based in Rotterdam.  Alex Mawimbi was born Ato Malinda in 1981  in Kenya. She received a Master of Fine Arts degree from Transart Institute in New York.  Her work explores the facets of African identity and authenticity in mediums including performance, drawing and painting, installation, ceramics, and video. She also focuses on gender and female sexuality, especially the stories of LGBTQ communities, and Western museum monolithic representation of Africa.  At the 2010 SUD triennial in Douala, Cameroon, Mawimbi performed a piece on the myth of the water goddess Mami Wata. The goddess, whose myth originates just prior to the rise of colonialism, is said to simultaneously give bountiful wealth to and take the lives of her lovers. Mawimbi presents Mami Wata in the form of water energy rather than as a mermaid, and performed the myth in the mangroves of the Douala's Wouri River. The performance was both observed and recorded.  In 2016, she was an awardee at the National Museum of African Art's first African Art Awards   and highlighted by The Wall Street Journal as an emerging artist.  She is based in Rotterdam.
