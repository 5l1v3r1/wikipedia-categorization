James Francis Graves Gladney (1907â€“1976) was an illustrator known for his cover paintings for Street & Smith pulp magazines, especially The Shadow.   He was a keen big game hunter and trap shooter and so, being a marksman, he served as a gunnery instructor in World War 2.  Posted to the 82nd Airborne Division, he made airborne landings during the Normandy invasion and Operation Market Garden.    He was, at his death, professor of fine arts at Washington University in St. Louis.   The original oil painting of his January 1941 cover for The Shadow was exhibited at the university's Olin Business School.   This was from his main period of activity for The Shadow, producing all the covers from April 1939 to the end of 1941.
