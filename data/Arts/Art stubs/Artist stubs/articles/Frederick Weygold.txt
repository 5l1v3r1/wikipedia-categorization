Frederick Weygold (born June 13, 1870 in Saint Charles, Missouri; died August 13, 1941 in Louisville, Kentucky) was an American painter, photographer and ethnographer, who has researched the life and culture of the North American Indians mainly examples of various Sioux tribes and artistically presented as scientific. He was learning art and languages in Germany before he moved in Louisville in 1908. In Europe Weygold became interested in American Indians, learning the Lakota language and Native American culture. This experience was of great help to him later to advise to European museum directors.  In 1909, Weygold went to the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations in South Dakota, where he obtained Native American artifacts for the Museum of Ethnology in Hamburg. He also made a lot of photographs to reflect Native American life and culture. In his photographs he also reserved the first evidence of the Plains Indian sign language. Later he was able to use his ethnographic experience to illustrate two books by the Dakota author Charles Eastman and two others by James Willard Schultz for a German publisher. Weygold gathered a personal collection of Native American artifacts and he later presented it to the Speed Art Museum, which now approves to be the main part of the museum’s collection.    During a long period, Native American artifacts were far more popular in Europe — where Weygold did much of his work — than in the United States.
