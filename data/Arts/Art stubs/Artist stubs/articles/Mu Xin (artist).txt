Mu Xin (Chinese: 木心; born Sun Pu 孫璞 in 1927, died 2011) was a Chinese painter, poet and writer. His works drew on both Chinese and Western traditions. Purged and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he was exonerated in 1979, and moved to New York in 1982. In 2007 he returned to his city of birth, Wuzhen, where he died. Mu Xin studied at the Shanghai Fine Arts Academy. Over 500 paintings, mainly of landscapes, that he created were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. 33 ink and gouache landscapes are known to have survived.  In 2001, an exhibition of his painting was held at Yale University Art Gallery before touring to the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, and Asia Society Museum in New York.    In 2015, the Mu Xin Museum opened in Wuzhen.   In 2018, Mu Xin's painting featured in the new BBC Civilisations series.    20 volumes of Mu Xin's unpublished writing were confiscated at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. During solitary confinement between 1970 and 1973, he wrote 66 pages of Prison Notes.    In New York he began writing again. More than 30 volumes of his poetry and prose essay since appeared in print on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.    In 2011, the first English translation of Mu Xin's short stories, An Empty Room, was released in the United States.  In 2017, the first English translation of Mu Xin’s poetry, Toward Bravery, was published in Britain.
