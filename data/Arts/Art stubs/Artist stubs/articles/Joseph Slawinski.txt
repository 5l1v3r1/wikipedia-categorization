Joseph Slawinski (d. 1983) was a scrafitto artist and sculptor who painted murals  at Assumption Roman Catholic Church, the Stella Niagara Mother House Chapel, Daemon College, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Fatima in Lewiston New York. The Polish Arts Club raised money to move and restore an 18 x 12 foot mural on the exterior wall of a building at Graycliff in Derby, NY to the Buffalo State College campus.   The mural depicts St. Joseph Calasanctius,  founder of the Piarist Priests who owned Graycliff for a number of years.
