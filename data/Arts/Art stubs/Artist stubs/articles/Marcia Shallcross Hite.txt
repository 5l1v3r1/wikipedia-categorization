Marcia Shallcross Hite (1877 - July 13, 1946) was an American watercolor artist. Marcia S. Hite began painting around age 40 after participating in psychological experiments which revealed her strong memory for images. She was largely self-taught, with Fayette Barnum as a mentor.  Her watercolor "The Jockey" was awarded first prize at the fourth annual exhibition of the Louisville Art Association. Her composition "The Ohio River Towboat" won first prize in the 1930 exhibition of the Southern States Art League.  She had one-man shows in Dudensing Galleries (1930) and Frank K. M. Rehn Galleries (1940).  The Hite Art Institute in Louisville, Kentucky is named for her and her husband, Allen Rose Hite.
