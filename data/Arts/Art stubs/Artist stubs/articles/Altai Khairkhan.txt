Altai Khairkhan (Mongolian: Алтай Хайрхан) is an overtone singing ensemble from Mongolia founded in 2002 by Childeegiin Palamjav, Sambuugiin Pürevjav and Ejeegiin Toivgoo. The members are from Uvs aimag, situated in the west of Mongolia near the Altai Mountains. Thus, the songs are often a praise to the mountains, rivers and animals of western Mongolia. The band performs either songs of their own composition or Mongolian traditional songs using morin khuur, topshur and a range of overtone singing techniques called Khöömii (Mongolian: Хөөмий).
