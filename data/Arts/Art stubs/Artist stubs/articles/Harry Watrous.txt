Harry Willson Watrous (1857â€“1940) was an American artist, native of San Francisco. His painting cover stylized figural works, academic portraits, and night scenes. He joined the National Academy of Design in 1895, serving as its secretary from 1898 to 1920. He later became president of the academy from 1933 to 1934.  He spent five years in Paris where he studied since 1881 at the Julian Academy and in Bonnat's atelier. He was influenced by Jean Leon Gerome and William Bouguereau and especially influenced by Jean Louis Meissonier.  Around 1905, Watrous' eyesight began to fail, and he changed his main subject from tiny genre scenes to idealized female figures.  His wife was artist and novelist Elizabeth S. Nichols.
