Peter Hartwig (Hoogezand, May 19, 1963) is a Dutch painter. Hartwig studied at the Academie Minerva in Groningen, Netherlands. He mainly works with oil-on-canvas in a figurative style with impressionistic paint strokes. His work is based on direct observations, memories and elements from the fantasy world. His figures are often included in the geometric plane division as equivalent elements. Hartwig's work can be found, for example, in the Drents Museum and in large collections such as ING Group.  In addition to oil paint, Hartwig also works with screen printing techniques.
