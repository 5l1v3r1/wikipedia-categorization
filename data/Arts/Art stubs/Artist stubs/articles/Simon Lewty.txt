Simon Lewty (born 1941) is an English artist. He was born in Sutton Coldfield in 1941.  He attended Mid-Warwickshire School of Art, now Warwickshire College (1957–1960), Hornsey College of Art (1961–1963).  He worked as a lecturer at the Mid-Warwickshire College of Further Education, (Warwickshire College), (1964–1981), before living and working in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire and in Swanage, Dorset. Lewty uses many different layers in his work and mixes text with picture.  Some of his work is based on a map of Warwickshire - where he used to live - and he draws pictures symbolizing his memories of the place. The Self as a Stranger (2010) is a monograph on the work of Simon Lewty, Black Dog Publishing, London.
