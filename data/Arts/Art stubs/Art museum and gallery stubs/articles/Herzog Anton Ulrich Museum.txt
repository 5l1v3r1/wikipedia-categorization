The Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum (HAUM) is an art museum in the German city of Braunschweig, Lower Saxony.  Founded in 1754, the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum is one of the oldest museums in Europe.  It houses an important collection of Western old master paintings, and is especially strong in Northern European art since the Renaissance, including works by Cranach (a very strong collection), Holbein, Dürer, Van Dyck, Rubens, and Rembrandt. Rarities include a single work each by Vermeer, Giorgione and Rosso Fiorentino.  The museum is based on the Schloss Salzdahlum art collection of Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1633–1714), after whom it is named. In old catalogs, the term Bilder-Galerie zu Salzthalen refers to this collection. The print room, with over 100,000 prints and 10,000 drawings, is of international importance. There are also rotating exhibitions of art from all over the world. Among manuscript items is the journal of Matthaeus Schwarz, an accountant very interested in fashion who documented his outfits throughout his adult life at a time when it was thought that people not of the highest rank dressed drably, the first known fashion book.  The present museum building was opened in 1887. Its architect, Oskar Sommer, planned the building in Italian Renaissance style. In 2010 an extension building was added to the museum. The historical building was closed for renovation for seven years afterwards.  The museum reopened on 23 October 2016. The museum's collection of medieval objects is housed at Dankwarderode Castle.
