The Luan Gallery is an publicly owned art gallery in Athlone, Westmeath, Ireland. The gallery opened in 2012, and the building consists of the older part, a former public library built in 1897 as a temperance hall, combined with a newer wing, designed by Keith Williams. The building was named Best Cultural Building of 2013 by the RIAI,  and received a Civic Trust Award in 2014.  The gallery takes its name from Luan son of Lugair son of Lugaid, a mythical chief who gives his name to the town.
