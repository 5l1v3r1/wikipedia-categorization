The Musée Picasso, formerly the Château Grimaldi at Antibes, is built upon the foundations of the ancient Greek town of Antipolis. Antibes is a resort town in the Alpes-Maritimes department in southeastern France, on the Mediterranean Sea. In 1608 it became a stronghold of the Grimaldi family and has borne their name ever since. In 1702 it became the town hall of Antibes. From 1925 the chateau was known as the Grimaldi Museum. In 1946 it was the home for six months of the artist Pablo Picasso. Today the museum is known as the Picasso Museum, the first museum in the world to be dedicated to the artist. Picasso himself donated works to the museum, most notably his paintings The Goat and La Joie de Vivre.  In 1990 Jacqueline Picasso bequeathed many works by Picasso to the museum. These included 4 paintings, 10 drawings, 2 ceramics and 6 etchings. These are displayed at the Château in addition to the 3 works on paper, 60 etchings and 6 carpets by Pablo Picasso which the museum collected between 1952 and 2001.  Today the collection totals 245 works by Picasso. Coordinates: 43°34′51″N 7°7′42″E﻿ / ﻿43.58083°N 7.12833°E﻿ / 43.58083; 7.12833
