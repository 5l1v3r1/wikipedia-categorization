The Art Collection of the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia is a private collection of artworks, mainly from the region, and acquired by the financial institution (however now owned by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia as the bank was dissolved) . The collection is divided among two locations in the city of Perugia: the Palazzo Graziani and the Palazzo Baldeschi. The Palazzo Graziani (1554â€“1569) was designed by Jacopo Barozzi, (il Vignola). The building is also notable for its sumptuous main salon, the Sala della Presidenza, which was decorated at the end of the 19th century with large canvases and frescoes painted by Annibale Brugnoli, recalling both events of the Risorgimento and the history of Perugia. The Palazzo Baldeschi al Corso (16th century, named after the noble family descended from Baldus de Ubaldis) was obtained by the foundation on November 28, 2002.
