ARKEN Museum of Modern Art (Danish: ARKEN Museum for Moderne Kunst) is a private non-for-profit charity, state authorized, contemporary art museum in Ishøj near Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The museum was conceived and created by Copenhagen County. The museum is located in the suburb-city Ishøj, close to the bay of Køge (Køge bugt), 20 kilometres south of Copenhagen. ARKEN was designed by the Danish architect Søren Robert Lund, in a distinctive architectural form. It was opened on 15 March 1996 by her majesty of Denmark, Queen Margrethe. The museum re-opened in January 2008 after major refurbishing, which included an expansion providing an additional 50% of gallery-space. The ARKEN museum features modern works by Danish, Scandinavian and international painters. The museum also has amassed a collection of around 400 post-war contemporary art pieces. These include works by artist such as Damien Hirst, Olafur Eliasson, Sherin Neshat Shirin Neshat, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Danish / Norwegian duo Ingar Dragset and Michael Elmgreen. Each year ARKEN awards the  'ARKENs kunstpris' prize of 100,000 Danish kroner to a contemporary artist. Coordinates: 55°36′22″N 12°23′15″E﻿ / ﻿55.60611°N 12.38750°E﻿ / 55.60611; 12.38750
