The MacLaren Art Centre is an art gallery and museum, located in Barrie, Ontario, Canada.  It houses many important Canadian works of art.[which?] It is named in honour of Maurice MacLaren, who bequeathed his Victorian home, Maple Hill, to the Barrie Gallery Project in 1989. The MacLaren Art Centre later moved to the former City of Barrie library, a Carnegie building, and added to it; the new gallery opened in September 2001. The award-winning building was designed by Siamak Hariri of Hariri Pontarini Architects.  The first piece in the gallery's collection is the Spirit Catcher, a sculpture by Ron Baird, first displayed at Expo '86 in Vancouver, and donated by the Peacock Foundation.
