Scheringa Museum of Realist Art (until 2005, Frisia Museum) was a museum in Spanbroek, North Holland, the Netherlands that housed around five hundred works of the 20th-century art mainly realist art and contemporary. It opened in February 1997 and closed in 2009. After the DSB Bank went bankrupt, the collection was retained by ABN AMRO as a guarantee, and this forced the closure of the museum. Later, the collection passed to the Deutsche Bank, which decided to sell it to an undisclosed individual for 14 million Euro. The plans were stopped in 2011 by a court in Amsterdam, which decided that the price was too low.  In March 2012, the Dutch part of the collection was bought by Hans Melchers.
