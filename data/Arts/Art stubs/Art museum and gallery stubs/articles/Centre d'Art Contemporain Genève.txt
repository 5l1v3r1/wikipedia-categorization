The Centre d'Art Contemporain Genève (Centre) is a contemporary art exhibition centre (a Kunsthalle) in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Adelina von Fürstenberg in 1974.  The Centre was the first contemporary art institution in Suisse Romande (i.e. in French speaking Switzerland).  As a Kunsthalle, it does not have a collection, but organizes temporary exhibitions and projects with regional and international artists. The Centre d'Art Contemporain Genève gained international renown with exhibitions by artists such as Joseph Beuys, Martin Boyce, Olaf Breuning, Maurizio Cattelan, Roberto Cuoghi, Gilbert & George, Nan Goldin, Dan Graham, Joan Jonas, On Kawara, William Kentridge, Robert Overby, Pipilotti Rist, Ugo Rondinone, Sterling Ruby, Thomas Scheibitz, Shirana Shahbazi, Cindy Sherman, Josh Smith, Andy Warhol, Lawrence Weiner, Christopher Wool. In 2010, the Centre took on the mission of the Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine (CIC), established in Geneva in 1985.  CIC was established to organize events and exhibitions of images using new technologies such as video, multimedia, and the Internet, as well as more traditional photography and film (Biennale de l'Image en Mouvement).
