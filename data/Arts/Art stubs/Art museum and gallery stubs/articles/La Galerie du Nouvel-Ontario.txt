La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario is an art gallery in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Originally launched in 1974 by artists associated with the Cooperative des artistes du Nouvel-Ontario, the gallery was first established as part of La Slague, a local Franco-Ontarian community centre. It later moved to the Centre des jeunes, a Franco-Ontarian youth centre, after La Slague ceased operations. In 1995, the gallery was incorporated as a separate organization. The gallery focuses primarily on contemporary art by Franco-Ontarian artists. Coordinates: 46°29′20″N 80°59′39″W﻿ / ﻿46.48902°N 80.99428°W﻿ / 46.48902; -80.99428
