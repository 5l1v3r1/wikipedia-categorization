Didrichsen Art Museum (Finnish: Didrichsenin taidemuseo, Swedish: Didrichsens konstmuseum) is an art museum in Helsinki, Finland.  The art museum was founded by Marie-Louise and Gunnar Didrichsen, who asked Finnish architect Viljo Revell to build the first of two phases in 1958 and again in 1965.  Revell also request the complex to have a sculpture, Archer, added by Henry Moore in 1967; Moore and Revell worked together in the design of Toronto City Hall, which also features the Archer sculpture.  The modernist buildings are built to the contours of the land and surrounded by trees. The museum is located on the island of Kuusisaari. The founders have since died and are buried within the compound of the museum.  Coordinates: 60°11′7″N 24°51′23″E﻿ / ﻿60.18528°N 24.85639°E﻿ / 60.18528; 24.85639
