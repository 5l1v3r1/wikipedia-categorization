A pop-up exhibition is a temporary art event, less formal than a gallery or museum but more formal than private artistic showing of work.  The idea began in 2007 in New York City where space for exhibiting artistic work is very limited.  Although the idea originated from New York City, pop-up exhibitions occur all around the world. A recent example is Banksy's Dismaland, which ran from August to September 2015.
