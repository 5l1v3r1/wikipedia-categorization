Göteborgs Konsthall is a center for contemporary art in Gothenburg (Göteborg), Sweden, showing both Swedish and international art. It is placed in a classicistic building from 1923 at Götaplatsen in the center of the city. Today Göteborgs Konsthall investigates the various forms of contemporary art and presents around five exhibitions a year. Göteborgs Konsthall was built as an art exhibition hall for the jubilee fair of Gothenburg in 1923. After the jubilee fair the Gothenburg art association took over the direction until 1968 when the direction was handed over to the city and Göteborgs Konsthall became a part of Gothenburg Museum of Art. In 1995 the city decided to close down Göteborgs Konsthall due to financial difficulties. After protests the exhibition space was reopened in 1996 and stayed open until 2000. In 2001 the konsthall reopened under the direction of Helena Persson as an own institution funded by the city of Gothenburg. After that Lene Crone Jensen took over as director in 2005. After her resignation in 2010 Mikael Nanfeldt is the director of Göteborgs Konsthall. Göteborgs Konsthall has been a partner for the Göteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art in various forms.
