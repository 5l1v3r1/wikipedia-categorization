The Newport Street Gallery is an art gallery in London, England which displays works selected from the personal art collection of Damien Hirst. It runs the length of Newport Street in Vauxhall.  Hirst announced plans for the gallery in March 2012,  and it opened in October 2015.  It includes a shop, a restaurant, and offices for Hirst's company.  The building is a former theatre carpentry and scenery production workshop, redesigned by Caruso St John. The design was praised for its "virtuosity", and in October 2016 it won the RIBA Stirling Prize.  The collection includes five pieces by Francis Bacon.
