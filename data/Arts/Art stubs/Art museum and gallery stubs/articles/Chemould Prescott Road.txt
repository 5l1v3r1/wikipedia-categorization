  Chemould Prescott Road was founded (as Gallery Chemould) by Kekoo Gandhy and Khorshed Gandhy in 1963,  and is one of the oldest commercial art galleries in India. Always based in Mumbai (Bombay), in 2007 the gallery moved from its original home on the first floor of the Jehangir Art Gallery to spacious new premises on Prescott Road.  Chemould has been instrumental in establishing the reputations of many now well-known Indian modern artists. MF Husain, Tyeb Mehta, and SH Raza, who emerged on the first wave of India's modernist and contemporary art movements, first exhibited with Chemould. Chemould also hosted the first solo exhibition of the late Bhupen Khakhar. Ram Kumar, Nalini Malani, Atul Dodiya, Anju Dodiya, Jitish Kallat, Reena Saini Kallat, KH Ara, Bal Chhabda, Krishen Khanna, Jehangir Sabavala, Gaitonde, KK Hebbar, Vivan Sundaram, and Jivya Soma Mashe all exhibited with Chemould.
