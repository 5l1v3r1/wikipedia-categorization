The Ghetto Biennale is an international contemporary arts exhibition, held every two years in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  The two informal neighborhoods known as Lakou Cheri and Ghetto Leanne in the Grand Rue sector of downtown Port-au-Prince act as a primary site for the Ghetto Biennale in the month of December.   In 2009, the first Ghetto Biennale was founded and curated primarily by Andre Eug√®ne, a member of the local group of sculptors known as the Atis Rezistans  and Leah Gordon.
