The Govett-Brewster Art Gallery is a contemporary art museum at New Plymouth, Taranaki, New Zealand.  The gallery receives core funding from the New Plymouth District Council. Govett-Brewster is recognised internationally for contemporary art.  The gallery opened on 22 February 1970, in what was then the unused Regent cinema building. The gallery trust was established with funds gifted by Monica Brewster (née Govett, 1886–1973).  The Len Lye Centre is a gallery adjacent to the Govett-Brewster, built to display the works of Len Lye. It was designed by Andrew Patterson of Pattersons Associates, New Zealand. It is home to the archives and studio collection of the Len Lye Foundation.  Born in Christchurch in 1901 and largely self-educated, Len Lye was driven by a lifelong passion for motion, energy and the possibility of composing them as a form of art. Lye's interests took him far from New Zealand; after sojourns in the South Pacific, Lye moved to London and then New York, where he became known as an intensely creative film-maker and kinetic sculptor. The Len Lye Centre was opened on 25 July 2015. This is the first gallery in New Zealand to be dedicated to a single artist.  The Govett-Brewster Art Gallery has received many awards.
