The Fleurieu Art Prize is held in South Australia and takes its name from the Fleurieu Peninsula, the area that surrounds the venues where the original exhibitions were held. At one time the main landscape prize of $65,000 was the richest landscape prize in the world.   The competition was established in 1998 by artist David Dridan, vigneron Greg Trott and businessman Tony Parkinson with the support of major wineries from the area. In the period 1998â€“2017 it has been awarded nine times. It has also been run in conjunction with other art prizes.  Over the years the prize has taken a variety of forms and has had several name changes, including the Fleurieu Biennale. In 2016, the prize enties were shown at the Anne & Gordon Samstag Museum of Art in Adelaide, and the Fleurieu Food + Wine Art Prize (FF+WAP) was revived as a community run exhibition in McLaren Vale.   In 2018 the competition was named the Fleurieu Biennale Art Prize and will be shown in McLaren Vale and Goolwa. Entries from Australian visual artists over 18 are open to both 2D and 3D works, responding to the theme A Sense of Place. The AU$25,000 non-acquisitive prize will be announced on 16 June 2018 and be awarded to one of the finalists being shown at Stump Hill Gallery and the Fleurieu Arthouse Gallery in McLaren Vale, and at Signal Point Gallery in Goolwa, South Australia.
