The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design (Norwegian: Nasjonalmuseet for kunst, arkitektur og design) in Oslo is the national museum of art of Norway. It was established on 1 July 2003 through a merger of the Norwegian Museum of Architecture, the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the National Gallery of Norway, and the National Touring Exhibitions.  Its directors have been Sune Nordgren (2003–2006), Anne Kjellberg (acting, 2006–2007), Allis Helleland (2007–2008), Ingar Pettersen (acting, 2008–2009), Audun Eckhoff (2009–2017) and Karin Hindsbo (2017–present). Chairmen of the board have been Christian Bjelland (2002–2008), Svein Aaser (2008–2017) and Linda Bernander Silseth (2017–present).  Among its collection is one of the versions of The Scream by Edvard Munch. A major reconstruction is planned for the National Museum.  In 2020 this will integrate The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design into one building. This will be placed in the location of the old Oslo West Station train station at Bjørvika. The building will open in 2020, with an exhibition area 13,000 m². Architect is Kleihues + Schuwerk Gesellschaftvon Architekten mbH. Ramboll is technical advisor and builder's enigineer on the project. The building has been widely derided by critics, who have said it resembles a prison and described it as the "national prison."
