The Kunsthalle Mannheim is a museum of modern and contemporary art, established in 1909 and located in Mannheim, Germany. Since then it has housed the city's art collections as well as temporary exhibitions - and up to 1927 those of the local Mannheimer Kunstverein as well as its administration. The Kunsthalle’s own collection comprises around 1,500 works by artists including Paul Cézanne and Wassily Kandinsky.  The extension building shows a major collection of works by Anselm Kiefer, 38 pieces on long-term loan from the businessman Hans Grothe.  Designed by Hermann Billing, the building was erected as a temporary structure to serve an "International Art Exhibition" of 1907, commemorating the 300th anniversary of the foundation of the city. Originally meant to be torn down after this exhibition, the building was later transformed into a municipal art gallery. Designed by the Hamburg-based architects Gerkan, Marg and Partners, a new 13,000 square feet (1,200 square metres) space with seven exhibition halls and a 22m-high glass-roofed atrium opened in 2018. The concrete, glass and steel structure is enveloped in a bronze mesh.  Since 2008, art historian Ulrike Lorenz has been serving as director of Kunsthalle Mannheim.
