The Artchive is a virtual art gallery website.  It was established in the late 1990s and is considered a "top art resource".  The Artchive website displays historic artworks with a convenient viewer that allows the size of the image to be set easily as required. It provides a leading online teaching resource for art  at a university level.  The resource includes over 2,000 images from over 200 artists.  Posters of displayed artworks are available. The originator of the Artchive was Mark Harden.  He originally contributed to WebMuseum from 1995 before establishing the Artchive. A conceptual redesign of the Artchive (not actually done at the site) was done by Ian David Kirk.
