The Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba is an art museum in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. The Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba was founded as the "Brandon Art Club" in 1907. The Brandon Art Club provided an array of classes in drawing, painting and art history, and regularly exhibited work by its members. In 1959, a permanent space for studios and exhibition was established and renamed the Brandon Allied Arts Council. In 1989, after a lengthy capital campaign, a permanent building to house an art gallery/studio was renovated on Princess Street and re-christened the Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba. In 2000, the Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba was moved to the recently vacated Eaton's building attached to the Town Centre Mall. The 23,000 square foot space was renovated with municipal, provincial, federal, and private sector funds to accommodate a 4300 sq. ft. environmentally controlled exhibition space, a community access gallery and 6 discipline-specific learning/production studios.
