  The Hong Kong Museum of Art (Chinese: 香港藝術館) is the main art museum of Hong Kong. It is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. A branch museum, the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware, is situated in the Hong Kong Park. The Hong Kong Museum of Art closed in 2015 for an extensive, multi-year renovation. It is scheduled to reopen in 2019.  The museum changes its displays regularly. The exhibitions in the museum are mainly of paintings, calligraphy and sculpture from Hong Kong, China and other parts of the world. It has cooperated with other museums as well. The museum was established as the City Hall Museum and Art Gallery in the City Hall in Central by the Urban Council in 1962.  This was split into the Hong Kong Museum of History and the Hong Kong Museum of Art in July 1975. The Museum of History moved to Kowloon Park in 1983.  Before leaving City Hall in 1991, the art museum occupied the 8th (rear portion), 9th, 10th, and 11th storeys of the High Block.  These floors now house a public library. In 1991, it was moved to the present premises at 10 Salisbury Road, near the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and the Hong Kong Space Museum, in Tsim Sha Tsui. The museum closed on 3 August 2015 for a $400 million expansion and renovation. It will remain closed for approximately three years.    The museum is within walking distance of both East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Tsim Sha Tsui Station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR). It is even nearer the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier, which offers services to Wan Chai and Central. Coordinates: 22°17′36.77″N 114°10′19.29″E﻿ / ﻿22.2935472°N 114.1720250°E﻿ / 22.2935472; 114.1720250
