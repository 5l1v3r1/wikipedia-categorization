The Museo Rufino Tamayo is an art museum in the city of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, in southern Mexico.  The museum contains collections of pre-Columbian art once owned by artist Rufino Tamayo.  It is housed in a building constructed in 1979 by the architects Teodoro González de León and Abraham Zabludovsky.  The displays are arranged according to aesthetic themes. One of the chief purposes of Tamayo and the museum was to collect the historic pieces, and to protect them from entering the illegal artifact traders market. Tamayo left the museum to his native state of Oaxaca, for his fellow Mexicans awarenes of their rich cultural heritage.
