Galerie Walter Klinkhoff (1949 - 2013) was a Canadian art gallery in Montreal, Quebec, which specialized in the purchase and sale of Canadian Art from 1850 on.  Founded in 1949 by Walter and Gertrude Klinkhoff, the gallery dealt directly with some of the most important Canadian artists including A.Y.
