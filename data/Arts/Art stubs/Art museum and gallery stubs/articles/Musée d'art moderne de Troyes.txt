The Musée d'art moderne de Troyes is one of the two main museums in the French city of Troyes - the other is the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Troyes. It is located in the city's former 16th- and 17th-century episcopal palace. It was opened in 1982 by president François Mitterrand following Pierre and Denise Lévy's 1976 donation of several modern artworks to their home-town of Troyes.
