The museum was originally the private residence and art gallery of the banker and collector Ernest Thiel (1859–1947) who acquired art made by his contemporaries among Scandinavian artists, such as Bruno Liljefors, Anders Zorn, Eugène Jansson and Edvard Munch. The house, built in 1904–1907, was designed by the architect Ferdinand Boberg. By 1922, Thiel had lost his fortune, the gallery was acquired by the state in 1924 and opened to public in 1926.
