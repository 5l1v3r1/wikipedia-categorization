The Zorn Collections, or Zornsamlingarna, is a Swedish state museum, located in  Mora, dedicated to preserving the works by painter Anders Zorn. Anders Zorn was one of Sweden's internationally best known artists. His fame abroad was founded mainly on his portraiture, with his ability to capture the character and personality of the depicted person. His nude studies are also very famous, as are his genre pictures which mostly depict working people and in which his swift and elegant impressionistic technique found its fullest scope. The Zorn Collections administers Anders and Emma Zorn's donation to the Swedish State. The Zorn Collections consists of four museums: Zorngården, Zorn Museum, Zorn's Gammelgård & Textilkammare and Zorn's Gopsmor.
