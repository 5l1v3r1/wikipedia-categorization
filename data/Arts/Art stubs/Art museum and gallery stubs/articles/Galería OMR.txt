Galería OMR is a contemporary art gallery located in Mexico City. Galería OMR was founded in 1983 by its principals Patricia Ortiz Monasterio and Jaime Riestra. The gallery is located in the Roma district which is now recognized as the leading art scene area in Mexico City. The gallery represents emerging and established contemporary artists, and it is the exclusive representative of the estates of Adolfo Riestra and Luis Ortiz Monasterio,  and Alberto Gironella.  Since its beginning, Galería OMR has been a major influence on the arts in Mexico, showing avant-garde artists that have now become some of the referential points of the Mexican art scene. Among the fairs in which the gallery participates are Zona MACO (Mexico),  Art Basel (Switzerland), Art Brussels (Belgium) and Art Basel Miami (USA). In 2009, OMR opened a project space in the anex building called el52, with the purpose of generating a new platform for a younger demographic of artists and a new basis for the gallery structure.
