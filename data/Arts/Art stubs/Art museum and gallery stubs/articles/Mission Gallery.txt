Mission Gallery is an art gallery in Swansea, Wales. The gallery hosts contemporary art, painting, installation, photography and craft. Formerly St Nicholas Church for seamen, Mission Gallery was designed by Benjamin Bucknall and built in 1886. The building became an art gallery in 1977, named Swansea Arts Workshop Gallery.

Since the dissolution of the Association of Artists and Designers in Wales in 1992, Mission Gallery and Swansea Studios are now separate organisations, with Mission Gallery receiving grant funding from the Arts Council of Wales.
