The Art Collection of the Foundation of Reggio Emilia Saving Bank â€“ Pietro Manodori or (collezione d'arte della Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Reggio Emilia Pietro Manodori) is a small, but publicly exhibited collection of artists mainly from the region, specially concentrating in works from the 17th century, the Baroque period when the local artist community, along with the Bolognese school of painters, had gained prominence. Collecting by this financial house began in earnest in the mid-1990s. The collection was collected by Cassa di Risparmio di Reggio Emilia, which was absorbed into UniCredit. However, the art collection was owned by the former owner of the bank instead, the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Reggio Emilia Pietro Manodori (Fondazione Manodori in short).
