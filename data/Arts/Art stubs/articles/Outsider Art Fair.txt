The Outsider Art Fair was founded in New York in 1993 by Sandy Smith as a means to showcase the work of outsider artists.   Currently owned by Andrew Edlin, the New York edition traditionally takes place in January during New York Winter Antiques Week and there is also a Paris edition. Plans for a Basel edition were announced and subsequently postponed in 2018.
