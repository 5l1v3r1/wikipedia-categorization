The Gold Coast Art Prize is an annual acquisitive exhibition run by the Gold Coast City Art Gallery in the city of the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. One of Australia's oldest art prizes, it began in 1968 as the Gold Coast Art Prize but was known as the Conrad Jupiters Art Prize from 1990 to 2006 and as the Stan and Maureen Duke Gold Coast Prize from 2007 to 2011. It has since reverted to its original name.
