Mineral painting also known as Stereochromy is a mural painting technique that uses a water glass based paint. The original technique was called Stereochromy where pigments were applied to plaster or stone and sealed with water glass to preserve and enhance the colors.   The name was first used about 1825 by Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs and Schlotthaurer,  but then improved in the 1880's by Adolf Wilhelm Keim and renamed as mineral painting   or Keim's process.
