RSVP cycles is a system of creative methodology for collaboration. It was developed by  Lawrence Halprin.   and Anna Halprin. Lawrence Halprin presented the system in a 1969 book The RSVP Cycles: Creative Processes in the Human Environment (Halprin 1970) [page needed] Halprin 1970, pp. 2–3  The name is an initialism referring to its four components:  Within each stage there is a micro-cycle, which includes all the other elements (e.g. scoring the resources, resourcing the performance, performing the score etc.). There is no set order in which stages should be completed, and one can jump from any element to any other element as long as there is consensus.
