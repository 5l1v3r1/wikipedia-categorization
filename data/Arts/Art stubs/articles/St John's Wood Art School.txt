The St John's Wood Art School (a.k.a. The Wood) was an art school in St John's Wood, north London, England. The Art School was established in 1878.  It was founded by A. A. Calderon (1847-1911) and Bernard Evans Ward, two art teachers in London. Lewis Baumer, Cadogan Cowper, and Byam Shaw were early students. Later students included John Armstrong, Michael Ayrton, Enid Bell, Frank Beresford,  Kenneth Martin, John Minton, Olive Mudie-Cooke, Ursula Wood, Herbert James Draper,  Flora Lion, Gluck and Christopher R. W. Nevinson. Teachers included Vanessa Bell, John Piper, and John Skeaping. The School subsequently became the Anglo-French Art Centre, which was founded in 1946 by Alfred Rozelaar Green, who studied in Paris at the Académie Julian and Atelier Gromaire.  The Centre closed in 1951.  Coordinates: 51°31′50″N 0°10′27″W﻿ / ﻿51.5305°N 0.1743°W﻿ / 51.5305; -0.1743
