Botsina (also, buzina, botzina, and botsitsa)    means lantern, lamp, torch, or spark in Aramaic.  Many times the reference, in Jewish sources, is to that which enlightens spiritually. It has also been described as an "orgasm in the process of the divine".  Pinchas Giller, in Reading the Zohar: the sacred text of the Kabbalah (Oxford University Press, 2001), devotes a section to the phrase, calling it "the boldest image of the Hormanuta literature".   John Tindall Harris and William Robert Brown wrote in The writings of the Apostle John: with notes, critical and expository (1889) that "our lord used words that could not fail to be understood by the people, for among the Jews any one distinguished for light and erudition was termed in Aramaic ... bostina, a lamp or torch (Ber. Rab. 95.4).  Chrystosom observes, He called John a torch or lamp, signifying that he had not light of himself but by the grace of the Spirit."   Yehuda Liebes, in Studies in Jewish myth and Jewish messianism (SUNY Press, 1993), wrote that "ambiguities of meaning are typical in the Zohar, and the word bostina (spark) illustrates this well".  Many[who?] people have been referred to as Botsina Kadisha ("[The] Holy Lantern") but foremost Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, the author of the Zohar (the prime of Jewish esoteric works) is referred to as Botsina Kadisha. The Arizal, Rabbi Itzhak Luria, the most famous Kabbalist of modern times is referred to as Botsina Kadisha in the books of his disciple Rabbi Chaim Vital. He lived about 500 years ago in Tzfat, Israel. The alter Rebbe of the Chabad movement is referred to as Botsina Kadisha as is seen in the opening of the his book Likutei Torah. He lived a few hundred years ago and he is the author of the famous Chabad book called The Tanya or Sefer Beinonim.
