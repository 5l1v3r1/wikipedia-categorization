Low key as a term used in describing paintings or photographs is related to but not the same as low-key lighting in cinema or photography.  A photographic image, painting or movie can be defined as "low-key" if its dominant values are black, dark brown or dark blue.   Some authors describe the term "low key" as the so-called Rembrandian light  while others describe how to obtain such photographs or paintings.
