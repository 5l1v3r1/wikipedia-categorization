Study for Crouching Nude is a 1952 painting by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon. It was painted in the Spring of 1952, and shows a perched figure whose form was likely derived from Muybridge's Man Performing a Standing Jump. The painting was first displayed – in place of Study for Portrait (1949) – at Recent Trends in Realist Painting (organized by Robert Melville and David Sylvester) at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, from July to August 1952.
