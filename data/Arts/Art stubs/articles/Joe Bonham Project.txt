The Joe Bonham Project is named after the fictional limbless, faceless protagonist of Johnny Got His Gun, written by Dalton Trumbo in 1939 as an anti-war novel.  Its purpose is to show the real face of war and the aftermath of war to the public with art that portrays the realities and human consequences of combat. Founded by war artist Michael D. Fay,  the organisation holds exhibitions to introduce the public to artistic representations of war and the aftermath of war.   The project distances itself from politics, preferring instead to be seen as apolitical "Witness Art".
