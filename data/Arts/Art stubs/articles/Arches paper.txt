Arches paper is a brand of air-dried paper that is used by printers and watercolorists. It has a warm white colour and is produced in hot-pressed, cold-pressed, and rough varieties. Arches paper is made in the village of Arches in the Vosges, France. The history of Arches starts in 1492 when the Arches site completed the amalgamation of the paper-making facilities around the village of Arches, south of Epinal.  The Moulins d'Arches turned to the production of high quality paper for writing and art publication. The mill thus produced paper for incunables (the name given to the first printed books), such as the Chronique de Gutenberg by DÃ¼rer. Also printed on Arches paper was the "Description of Egypt" commissioned by Napoleon I upon his return from his Egyptian campaign. The work was used by the royalty from 1809 to 1828. The product range comprises the following papers:
