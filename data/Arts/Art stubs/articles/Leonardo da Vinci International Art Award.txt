The Leonardo da Vinci Award was established in 1975 by the Rotary Club of Florence as an annual international prize named after Leonardo da Vinci, to be presented to young people involved in the study of the sciences, technology, literature and the arts. Among the disciplines recognised and rewarded so far have been painting, sculpture, music, geology, architecture, medicine and nuclear physics. The 21st Leonardo da Vinci Prize was recently presented to the brilliant young pianist Johan Schmidt. The prize giving event has been hosted by other European Rotary Clubs in cities such as Tours, Vienna, Athens, Madrid, WÃ¼rzburg, Brussels and Amsterdam.  This event was last held in London in 1987, when the prize was awarded to the internationally recognised percussionist Evelyn Glennie. In 1996 1/2 the Rotary Club of London will again be responsible for hosting the prize-giving ceremony.
