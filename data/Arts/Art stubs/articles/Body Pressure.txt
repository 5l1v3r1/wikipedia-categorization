Body Pressure is a 1974 performance piece by American artist Bruce Nauman. The performer is instructed to press their body against a wall in various positions; Nauman says that it "may become a very erotic exercise".  The piece was re-interpreted and performed by Marina AbramoviÄ‡ as part of her Seven Easy Pieces in 2005.
