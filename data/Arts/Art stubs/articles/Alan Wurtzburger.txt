Alan Wurtzburger (1900â€”1963) was a collector of art and ethnographic objects and an important benefactor to the Baltimore Museum of Art. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Alan Wurtzburger and his wife, Janet, contributed four collections of art to the Baltimore Museum of Art. The first of these collections was cataloged in the Wurtzburger Collection of African Sculpture in 1954.  This was followed by the Wurtzburger Collection of Oceanic Art in 1956 and the Wurtzburger Collection of Pre-Columbian Art, 1958.   The final large contribution made by the Wurtzburgers was a collection of modern sculpture, formerly housed at their estate, Timberlane, that can now be found in one of the two sculpture gardens adjacent to the museum. Within the Wurtzburger garden are works of art by Henry Moore, Sir Jacob Epstein, and Auguste Rodin.
