A graphic kit is a set of decals for an automobile, motorcycle, model car, or other toy, used to customize the item. One type of graphic kit currently in use is for automobile tires. These are called tire lettering kits. They come in a variety of colors, sizes, and styles. Large auto manufacturing brands also often have graphic kits, with Toyo tire kits being one of the most popular in the United States in 2018.
