The China International Gallery Exposition (aka CIGE, Zhongguo guoji hualang bolanhui) is an annual art exhibition held in China which showcases modern art and design. First held in April 2004 at the International Science and Technology Centre in Beijing,   the CIGE had doubled in size by the following year   and is now in its tenth iteration,[needs update] which was held at the China National Convention Centre in April 2013.  In 2007 a spin-off festival, Art Beijing, emerged as a separate event.
