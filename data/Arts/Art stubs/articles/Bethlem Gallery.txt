The Bethlem Gallery is an art gallery in Beckenham, Bromley, England. It was established in 1997 to support and exhibit artists who are current or former patients of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.  The gallery is housed in an Art Deco building shared with the Bethlem Museum of the Mind,  with exhibits about the history of Bethlem Royal Hospital. The gallery has a small artist-led team to manage and facilitate it. This team support and encourage artists who may feel excluded from artistic endeavour otherwise.  The gallery provides facilities for collaboration, experimentation, and skills exchange. Pills are ok, counselling is ok and it will get you back on the streets, but what keeps your mind alive is what you learn here. That’s what it’s about – keeping your spirit alive.  – Lee, Bethlem artist.  For long term patients, the art studio is a place to spend time away from the ward. Available resources facilitate sculpture, painting, drawing, printmaking and screen printing, among others.
