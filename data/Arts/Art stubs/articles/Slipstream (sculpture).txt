Slipstream is a 2014 sculpture created by Richard Wilson for London Heathrow Terminal 2 – The Queen's Terminal|London Heathrow Terminal 2]]. The idea for a large art intervention in the new terminal was imagined, project-managed and curated by Mark Davy Founder of cultural and placemaking agency Futurecity for client Heathrow. It is currently the longest piece of permanent art and the largest privately funded sculpture in Europe.  The winning proposal was selected from a shortlist of 5 international artists. The sculpture is over 70 metres (230 ft) long and weighs 77 tonnes (76 long tons; 85 short tons).  Structural engineers Price & Myers and specialist fabricators Commercial Systems International (CSI) were tasked with making the sculpture.  Wilson’s intention is "to transpose the thrill of the air‐show to the architectural environment of the international air terminal".  Reconstruction of Terminal 2 started in 2010, and it was officially reopened on 4 June 2014. Coordinates: 51°28′11″N 0°26′59″W﻿ / ﻿51.4697°N 0.4497°W﻿ / 51.4697; -0.4497
