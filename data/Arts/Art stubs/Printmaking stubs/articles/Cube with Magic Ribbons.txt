Cube with Magic Ribbons is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in 1957. It depicts two interlocking bands wrapped around the frame of a cube. The cube framework by itself is perfectly possible but the interlocking of the "magical" bands within it is impossible. This print is significant for being the first Escher drawing to use a true impossible object.
