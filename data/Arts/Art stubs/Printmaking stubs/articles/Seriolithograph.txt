The term seriolithograph is used by Park West Gallery, a major publisher of graphic editions. The term is used to distinguish a form of hybrid fine art printing technique. Seriolithographs are a combination of lithography (offset, stochastic, photo-mechanical or continuous tone) with serigraphy, a fine art stencil printing technique.  Although the term is used by Park West Gallery most commonly, Park West is not the only gallery that publishes or represents these types of hybrid prints. Fine art prints of this type are published by numerous artists and publishers worldwide, and are widely accepted and collected.
