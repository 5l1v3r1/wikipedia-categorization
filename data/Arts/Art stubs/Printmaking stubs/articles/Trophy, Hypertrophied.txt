Trophy, Hypertrophied (1919) is a work of art by the German dadaist/surrealist Max Ernst. This is one of Ernstâ€™s earliest known works. It was created through a photomechanical process called line-block printing, rarely used in printmaking, to which drawing was added. It depicts a complex mechanical apparatus with celestial shapes as gears. Ernst created a similar piece the same year titled Farewell My Beautiful Land of Mary Laurencen. Help! Help!
