Lustre print is a photograph or artwork with a finish between glossy and matte. Some companies use the term semi-glossy. Lustre photo prints are a hybrid of glossy photo prints and matte photo prints. Lustre photo prints have rich colour saturation that gives a vibrant colour finish but it is not vulnerable to fingerprints like matte.
