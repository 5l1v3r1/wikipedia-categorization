Three Worlds is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in December 1955. Three Worlds depicts a large pool or lake during the autumn or winter months, the title referring to the three visible perspectives in the picture: the surface of the water on which leaves float, the world above the surface, observable by the water's reflection of a forest, and the world below the surface, observable in the large fish swimming just below the water's surface. Escher also created a picture named Two Worlds. The picture is based on true optical effects, reflection and refraction. The angle of incidence is the line between the reflection of the trees and refraction allowing the view of the fish.
