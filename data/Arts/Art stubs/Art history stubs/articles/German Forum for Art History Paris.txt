The German Forum for Art History Paris (Deutsches Forum für Kunstgeschichte (DFK; Centre Allemand d'Histoire de l'Art de Paris; German Center for the History of Art, Paris) is a German research institute specialized in French and German art and currently situated in the Hôtel de Lully in Paris, the former residence of the French composer Jean-Baptiste Lully. It organizes conferences, symposia, and workshops, undertakes research projects, and has published many books on art. The DFK was founded in 1997 with German, French, and Swiss colleagues by Thomas W. Gaehtgens. It is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Until October 2007, the institution was headed by Gaehtgens, from 2009 to 2014 by Andreas Beyer (de) and since February 2014 by the current director, Thomas Kirchner (Historiker) (de). From 2006, the Forum is part of the "Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad", which is now called "Max Weber Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad". The DFK supports research by German scholars on French subjects. It also promotes the research of French scholars on German art and German art history and endeavors to include other European and transatlantic countries and academic disciplines to participate in its research programs. The DFK cooperates with the Institut national d'histoire de l'art (INHA) in Paris, the Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History in Rome, the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz and the Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte in Munich.
