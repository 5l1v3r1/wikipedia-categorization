Alessandro Vittrice (or Vittrici) was a Roman art collector. He was appointed bishop of Alatri in 1632 and governor of Rome in 1647.  Alessandro was the son of Gerolamo Vittrici (died March 1612), sotoguardaroba to every pope since Gregory XIII. Gerolamo commissioned the Deposition of Christ from Caravaggio for his uncle's chapel (the Capella della Piet√†) in Santa Maria in Vallicella (the Chiesa Nuova),  a church built for the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri.  Vittrice is also known to have been, in 1620, the owner of Caravaggio's The Fortune Teller, which he gifted to Pope Innocent X.
