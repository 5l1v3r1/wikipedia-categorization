Castrum doloris (Latin for castle of grief) is a name for the structure and decorations sheltering or accompanying the catafalque or bier that signify the prestige or high estate of the deceased. A castrum doloris might feature an elaborate baldachin and would include candles, possibly flowers, and in most cases coats of arms, epitaphs and possibly allegorical statues. Many extensive castra doloris can be traced to the customs of 17th century and 18th century or even earlier, since Pope Sixtus V's funeral arrangements included a castrum doloris in the late 16th Century. Notable examples include coffin portrait (Polish: portret trumienny) of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
