The Westminster School of Art was an art school in Westminster, London.   The Westminster School of Art was located at 18 Tufton Street, Deans Yard, Westminster, and was part of the old Royal Architectural Museum. H. M. Bateman  described it in 1903 as: "... arranged on four floors with galleries running round a big square courtyard, the whole being covered over with a big glass roof.  Off the galleries were the various rooms which made up the school, the galleries themselves being filled with specimens of architecture which gave the whole place the air of a museum, which of course it was." In 1904 the art school moved and merged with the Westminster Technical Institute, in a two-story building on Westminster's Vincent Square,  established by the philanthropy of Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts in 1893.
