Anjumani-shuara (Persian - "Poets council") was a literary council of the 19th century in Azerbaijan. It was first held by Sheykhali khan Kangarli in 1831 in Ordubad. From 1870-80 the council was led by Haji agha Fagir Ordubadi. Later this mission was obliged to Mohammad Taghi Sidgi. The councilâ€™s activity operated with different intervals and there were lots of well-known writers and poets. After the death of Fagir and shifting of Sidgi in Nakhchivan the council was weakened and suspended its activities in 1890-1895.
