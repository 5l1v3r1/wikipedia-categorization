The Foundation for the Advancement of Art, founded in 2002  by painter Michael Newberry, has as its stated purpose "to establish innovative representational painting and sculpture as the alternative to postmodern art in the world's leading contemporary art museums."  The foundation hosts an annual lecture conference.  The foundation's web site complains that although there are very many representational artists, they are discriminated against by art museums. The Foundation held its first conference in New York City on October 6, 2003, with two speakers Dr. Stephen Hicks and Dr. David Kelley.
