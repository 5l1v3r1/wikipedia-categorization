Grupo Madí was a group of artists in Argentina, founded in 1946 by Gyula Kosice, Rhod Rothfuss, and Arden Quin.  The origin of the name is not clear, but it could be an acronym for Movimento de Arte De Invención (because the group was against static arts) or Marxisme/Matérialisme Dialectique, but it could also be a nonsense word.  The Grupo Madí was one of two prominent groups of artists pursuing abstract art in Argentina. The other was Arte Concreto-Invencíon, or AACI, founded in 1945.
