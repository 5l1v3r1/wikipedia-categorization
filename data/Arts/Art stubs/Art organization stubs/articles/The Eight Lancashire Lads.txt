  The Eight Lancashire Lads was a troupe of young male clog dancers who toured the music halls of Great Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were founded by Bill Cawley and J.W. (William) Jackson (1863–1940) of Wigan, Lancashire.  As they became more successful, they recruited other members such as Charlie Chaplin, who got his first professional break with them at the age of ten. The book 'CHAPLIN Stage by Stage' (ISBN 978-0-9521308-1-9) by A.J Marriot, lists all of the Eight Lancashire Lads performances which featured Charlie Chaplin.
