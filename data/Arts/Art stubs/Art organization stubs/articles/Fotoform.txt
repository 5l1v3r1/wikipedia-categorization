Fotoform was a group founded in 1949 by the photographer Otto Steinert.  Until 1958 it was the preeminent group of avant-garde West German photographers. Other collaborators were Peter Keetman, Ludwig Windstoßer, Toni Schneiders, Wolfgang Reisewitz, Siegfried Lauterwasser, Heinz Hajek-Halke and Christer Christian (the pseudonym of the Swedish photographer Christer Strömholm). It made photographic experiments and sought to draw attention to the creative possibilities of photography which had been extingished by Nazi cultural policy.
