  The Earthworks Poster Collective  was an artist's collective that operated out of the Sydney University Art Workshop, more commonly as the Tin Sheds. The collective was active from 1972 to 1979.   The Collective produced, mainly screen-printed, political posters that sought to promote the rights of Aboriginal people, gays and lesbians, women, the unemployed and workers.  In addition, the collective produced anti-nuclear, protest posters.  The Collective disbanded in 1979, after failing to attract the funding needed to continue.   Today the Collective is regarded as having been the principal driving force in the early development of Australian political poster art during the 1970s.  Works produced by the Collective are held within the collections of The State Library of New South Wales, National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery, the Powerhouse Museum and the University of Sydney.
