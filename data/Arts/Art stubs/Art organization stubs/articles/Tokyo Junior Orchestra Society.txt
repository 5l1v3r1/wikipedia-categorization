Tokyo Junior Orchestra Society (東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティー) was established in April 1994 by Fuminori “Maro” Shinozaki, the Principal Concertmaster of the NHK Symphony Orchestra.   Orchestra members are instructed by members of professional orchestras and university instructors, including some former members of TJOS. Most members are currently enrolled in pre-collegiate music programs, contributing to its reputation as one of the most selective youth orchestras in Japan.    Prospective members must pass auditions held throughout the year. Past performances include a performance of Chopin’s Piano Concerto no.1 with Aimi Kobayashi which was broadcast on television in 2010, joint concerts with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, were also broadcast on television, and the California Youth Symphony.  Its motto is "interplay", in which members interact to form a tightly knit ensemble and "society", which is reflected in its name. Tokyo Junior Orchestra Society was accredited by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as an endorsed NPO in 2009.
