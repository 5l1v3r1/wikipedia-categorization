Intermedia was a loose association of Vancouver artists who, working in a variety of media, collaborated on and staged events. It was founded in 1967 by Jack Shadbolt and Glenn Lewis,  among others. At the time of its inception Intermedia aimed to create a centre of community resource in Vancouver where artists, architects, engineers, technologists and educators could come together and explore new models and formats for the purpose of intensifying and expanding the effectiveness of creative sensibility in the community.  As time passed the aims of the group changed to focus of individual artists and small groups: The purpose/aim of Intermedia is to help the artist realize [their self] and [their] work by providing an umbrella/shelter of cooperatively-structured, contiguous and inter-related functioning artists' groups, often service-oriented. It did not have its own space until 1970, when it moved into 575 Beatty Street in downtown Vancouver.  Around this time, Werner Aellen was appointed director. The Vancouver Art Gallery hosted Intermedia Nights, which enabled Intermedia to reach a wide audience. The artists associated with Intermedia explored different techniques, including performance art, experimental film, correspondence art, and other media, to expand popular concepts of art. In 1972, Intermedia ceased to function as an organization.  http://intermedia.vancouverartinthesixties.com/1969/072
