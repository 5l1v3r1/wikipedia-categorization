The Womenâ€™s Guild of Arts was founded in 1907 by Arts and Crafts artists May Morris and Mary Elizabeth Turner. The organisation offered female artists an alternative to the Art Workers Guild, the artists' association established in 1884 and based on the ideas of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement, as this was not open to women.    The Women's Guild was established with May Morris as its First President and watercolourist and engraver  Mary Annie Sloane as its Honorary Secretary.
