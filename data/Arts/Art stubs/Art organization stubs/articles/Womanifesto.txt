Womanifesto an international art exchange program, based in Thailand. Womanifesto is a biannual artist-initiated event focusing on the work of women artists from around the world. It has gained international recognition and developed steadily since the first event in 1995. Through various activities, including art exhibitions, workshops and seminars, Womanifesto develops networks among participating artists and encourages interaction within urban and rural communities.
