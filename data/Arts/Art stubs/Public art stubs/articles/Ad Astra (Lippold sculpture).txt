Ad Astra is a public artwork by American artist Richard Lippold. The abstract sculpture is located outside on the Jefferson Drive entrance of and in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum.    The sculpture's title is Latin, meaning "to the stars."  This abstract statue is made of gold-colored polished stainless steel. Standing at 100 feet tall, the piece consists of a "...three-planed narrow shaft ending in a pointed tip, penetrates a triple star-like cluster near its apex."   Lippold believed that "the characteristic art of our time deals with the conquest of space," with Ad Astra symbolizing just that.  In 2009 the sculpture made an appearance in the film Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian.
