Erastus B. Wolcott is a public art work by American artist Francis Herman Packer, located in Lake Park on the east side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The bronze equestrian commemorates a military officer and physician.  It is located in the center of Lake Park, near Eight Stone Lions and the North Point Lighthouse. The inscription reads, "Gen. Erastus B. Wolcott. Surgeon General of Wisconsin in the Civil War for thirteen years afterward. He lived a blameless life. Eminent in his profession. A lover of humanity. Who delighted to serve his fellowmen, his city state and nation. Fraternity - Charity - Equality - Devotion." It is said that his wife wrote the epitaph.
