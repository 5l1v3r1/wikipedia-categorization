Cristo del Pacífico, "the Christ of the Pacific", is a 37 metre high statue of Jesus erected in Lima, Peru, in 2011. Its erection was a gift from a consortium of Brazilian companies to the city of Lima, under former President Alan García, and described as a parting gift to the nation on occasion of his leaving office after the 2011 presidential election. It was inspired by the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. At 37 metres (121 feet) including its pedestal, and 22 m (72 ft) without, the statue is smaller than the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, which measures 39.6 m (130 ft), 30 m (98 ft) without its pedestal.
