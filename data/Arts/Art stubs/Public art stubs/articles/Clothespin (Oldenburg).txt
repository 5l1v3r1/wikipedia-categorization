Clothespin is a weathering steel sculpture, by Claes Oldenburg.  It is located at Centre Square, 1500 Market Street, Philadelphia.  It is designed to appear as a large black clothespin. Oldenburg is noted for his attempts to democratize art, and the location of Clothespin, above SEPTA's City Hall subway station, allows thousands of viewers to view it on a daily basis.   It was dedicated June 25, 1976.   Made of Corten steel, Clothespin is praised by art critics for its velvety texture and weathered, warm reddish-brown color.   The silvery steel "spring" part the two textured work resembles the numerals "76", apt for the United States Bicentennial year.   Tying in Philadelphia's colonial heritage with its difficult present, Clothespin addresses the city's civic issues and attempts to close the gap between income levels within the city through its universally recognized form.  The design has been likened to the "embracing couple" in Constantin Brâncuși's sculpture The Kiss in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  It was commissioned in May 1974, by developer Jack Wolgin, as part of the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority's one percent for art program.
