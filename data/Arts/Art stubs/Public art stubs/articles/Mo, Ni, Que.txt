Mo, Ni, Que is a public art work by Swiss artist Samuel Buri located at the Lynden Sculpture Garden near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The fiberglass sculpture consists of three colorful cows that appear to graze; it is installed on the lawn.  The title of the sculpture is derived from the name of its original owner, Monique Barbier.  Mo, Ni, Que was exhibited at the Kunsthalle, Basel, Switzerland from January 22 to February 20, 1977 as part of a three-man show featuring Samuel Buri, William Phillips and Hans Remond.
