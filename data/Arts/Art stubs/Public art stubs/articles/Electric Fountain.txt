The Electric Fountain is a water fountain with public art sculptures and evening lighting, surrounded by mosaic pavement, seating and landscaping, in Beverly Gardens Park, Beverly Hills, California. The two-level circular fountain includes a circular raised fountain spray area surrounded by a 30-foot diameter pool.  It was designed by architect Ralph Carlin Flewelling in 1931, in partnership with sculptor Robert Merrell Gage who created the center sculpture and bas relief.     Robert Merrell Gage placed the 6-foot stone sculpture of a Tongva/Gabrieleno tribe member, kneeling in prayer, on a 20-foot stone column.  According to Peter James Holliday, the image was "said to be modeled after Gradin Newsom, who was part Cherokee."  The sculpture sits in the center of a circular raised fountain with 3-foot high bas relief sculptures.  The surrounding pool is edged with ceramic tile.  Terra cotta mosaic pavement tiles show images from the early history of the area and the founding of the city.  Landscaping and benches surround the pool, and the entire fountain is illuminated at night by colorful lighting.  The fountain is located on the prominent corner of Santa Monica and Wilshire Boulevards in Beverly Hills, California. The fountain was a gift to the City of Beverly Hills from Sarah Elizabeth (Fraser) Lloyd, mother of silent-screen actor Harold Lloyd in 1931, and the original installation was funded by the Beverly Hills Women's Club.   It was built on land donated by the Rodeo Land and Water Company.    In 2014-2015, Chinese businessman Wang Jianlin donated US$200,000 for the restoration of the fountain,  and in 2016 the fountain, sculptures, and surrounding public space received a major restoration and renovation. It was featured in the 1995 movie Clueless  and The Go-Go's 1981 music video for "Our Lips Are Sealed".
