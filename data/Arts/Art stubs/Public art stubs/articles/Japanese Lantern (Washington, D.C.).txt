The Japanese Lantern is a stone statue in West Potomac Park, Washington, D.C. It is located next to the Tidal Basin, among the cherry trees first planted in 1912. It is lighted during the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. A pair of lanterns were created in 1651, to mark the death of Tokugawa Iemitsu. The lantern was formerly located at the Tōshō-gū temple, in Ueno Park, where its twin remains. The lantern was given, by the governor of Tokyo, to the people of the United States, and was dedicated on March 30, 1954.
