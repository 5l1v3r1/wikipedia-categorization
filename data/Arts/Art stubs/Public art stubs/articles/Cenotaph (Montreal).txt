The Cenotaph is a public monument in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, commemorating the First and Second World Wars and Korean War. The Governor General of Canada, Lord Byng of Vimy, unveiled Montreal's Cenotaph in the Place du Canada, a part of Dominion Square, in 1921. The monument was inspired by the Cenotaph, London (1920).  On the sixth anniversary of the armistice (November 11, 1924) a crowd assembled at the monument. At exactly eleven o'clock the assembled crowd fell silent for two minutes.
