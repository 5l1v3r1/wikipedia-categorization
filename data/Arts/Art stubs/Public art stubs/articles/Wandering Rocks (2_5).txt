Wandering Rocks is a public art work designed by American artist Tony Smith, located at the Lynden Sculpture Garden near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The five-part sculpture of rectilinear forms has highly reflective surfaces and is installed on the lawn.    This is the second of an edition of five in the series (with one artists proof).  While these "rocks" are individual elements they were conceived as a single artwork without fixed spatial relationships to each other.   They have been installed in a variety of ways, each being slightly different. Other editions of the sculpture are on display at:
