The sculpture depicts the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in female form standing on a lotus pedestal. She may also be commonly known by her Chinese name Guanyin. It was created by sculptor Mai Chi Kim,  who wanted to work on a bigger project after the temple had commissioned several smaller statues from her. With the base included, the statue stands at 72 feet tall, making it one of the tallest statues in the United States and looks over a large pond beside an ornate red bridge. It is also suspected to be the largest Buddhist statue in the western hemisphere.  Quan Am is one of the most highly revered bodhisattvas in Vietnam and is called by many epithets, including 'Mother of Buddhas' and 'Goddess of Compassion'.
