The Aaron Monument is a public art work by artist Brian Maughan.   It is located in front of the Miller Park stadium west of downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The sculpture depicts Hank Aaron, a member of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, in a batting stance. The figure wears the uniform of the winners of the 1957 World Series: long socks, loose-fitting knee-length pants, a button-front short-sleeved jersey and a cap. The sculpture was dedicated on April 5, 2001.
