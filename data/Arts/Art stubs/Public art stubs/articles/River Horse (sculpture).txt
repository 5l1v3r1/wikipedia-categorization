The River Horse is a bronze sculpture of a hippopotamus located on the campus of George Washington University. It is in front of Lisner Auditorium, at 21st Street and H Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.  In 1996, George Washington University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg presented this bronze statue as a gift to the University's Class of 2000. The hippo stands with its mouth wide. Its nose is slightly worn due to passerby rubbing it. A plaque is placed on the base: The hippopotamus is not native to North America.  President Trachtenberg admitted he invented the story.  He said that, for fun, he made up a story that George Washington watched hippos swim in the Potomac River.  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trachtenberg-reveals-truth-behind-hippo   http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Petition-Seeks-to-Change-GW-Colonials-to-the-GW-Hippos-481773571.html
