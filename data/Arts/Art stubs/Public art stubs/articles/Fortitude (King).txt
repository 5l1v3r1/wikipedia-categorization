Fortitude is a public artwork by artist American James King, located at Howard University in Washington, D.C., United States. Fortitude was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey in 1993.  The sculpture depicts a figure of a woman cut from a thin piece of metal. She "wears" a sleeveless dress, high heels and has short, straight hair. She is walking; with her proper left arm swinging above her head and her proper right arm back behind her.   Born in Chicago, sculptor James King received education from The Art Institute of Chicago, Goethe Institute and the University of Vienna.  The sculpture was unveiled on April 28, 1979 at 3:15pm by members of Delta Sigma Theta, to honor the founders of the service sorority. The sculpture is described as symbolizing "the attributes of strength, courage, hope, wisdom, beauty and femininity as depicted by the 22 founders of Delta Sigma Theta".  This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and it was described as "well maintained".
