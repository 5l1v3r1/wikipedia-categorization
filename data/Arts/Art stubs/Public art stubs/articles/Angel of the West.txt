Angel of the West is an outdoor sculpture in Jupiter, Florida, USA. The sculpture was made in 2008 by German sculptor Julian Voss-Andreae. Referencing British sculptor Antony Gormley's monumental 1998 piece Angel of the North it was created based on an antibody structure published by E. Padlan  for the Florida campus of the Scripps Research Institute.  The antibody is placed into a ring referencing Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man highlighting the similar proportions of the antibody and the human body.
