A Room for London is a temporary structure located on the roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank.  The structure, designed by architect David Kohn  is described as "a one-bedroom installation"   and is shaped to appear like a boat perched on top of a building. The structure has been in place since 2012 and has acted as a "single-room, boat-shaped hotel",  available to be booked for single-night residencies. A Room for London is one of a number of projects by Living Architecture, a not-for-profit holiday home rental company founded by philosopher and writer Alain de Botton.
