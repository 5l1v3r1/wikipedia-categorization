Hill Arches is a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, catalogued as LH 636. The piece is made of four separate parts, three of which are described by Roger Berthoud, Moore's biographer, as being stirrup-shaped; the fourth is a large sphere.  One cast is situated in the Karlsplatz in front of the Karlskirche in Vienna,  where it was installed in 1978  â€“ initially to complaints that it disrupted the views of the historic church.  Another is sited at the headquarters of Deere and Company in Illinois.   Media related to Hill Arches - Henry Moore (LH 636, Karlsplatz, Vienna) at Wikimedia Commons
