Teamwork is a public sculpture by Omri Amrany located at Miller Park west of downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin near the former Milwaukee County Stadium site. Teamwork is cast in bronze and honors three Iron Workers Local 8 members killed during the construction of the new baseball stadium.  The sculpture was commissioned by the Habush, Habush and Rottier Charitable Foundation for $250,000.    Teamwork depicts three figures dressed for construction work. All wear jeans, t-shirts, boots and hardhats. One holds a clipboard. The sculpture honors William DeGrave, Jerome Starr and Jeffrey Wischer, three ironworkers who were killed by a piece of the stadium's retractable roof that fell when a crane failed during the construction of Miller Park. The widows of the workers, Marjorie DeGrave, Ramona Dulde-Starr and Patricia Wischer, settled a lawsuit against crane-maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of America for $57 million.  Attorney Robert L. Habush represented two of the widows in their suit.
