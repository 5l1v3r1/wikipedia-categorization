The Chollima Statue (Chosŏn'gŭl: 천리마동상; MR: Ch'ŏllima Dongsang) is a monument on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The monument symbolizes the "Chollima speed" of the Chollima Movement. The legendary winged horse Chollima depicted by the monument is said to travel 1,000 ri (400 km) a day.  The monument was constructed as a gift to Kim Il-sung.  It was built by the Merited Sculpture Production Company of the Mansudae Art Studio.  The statue was unveiled on 15 April 1961, the 49th birthday of Kim Il-sung.  The impetus to build the monument was Kim Il-sung's speech "Let Us Further Develop Popular Art" given to rural amateur artist groups on 7 March 1961.   The Chollima Statue was awarded the People's Prize.  The monument is 46 meters tall in total. The sculpture stands 14 meters high and is 16 meters long. The two figures riding the Chollima, a worker and a woman peasant, are 7 meters and 6.5 meters tall, respectively.  The worker raises a document from the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the peasant holds a sheaf of rice.  The figures are made of bronze, while the base is granite.
