Cubi XII is an abstract sculpture by  David Smith.  Constructed of stainless steel, completed on April 7 1963, it was purchased from his estate by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 1968.     It is a part of the Cubi series.  He used the shiny finish to contrast with the landscape. The circular grind marks change in varying lighting conditions.
