Standing Woman is a bronze sculpture by Gaston Lachaise.  It is one of at least two statues of that name created by Lachaise, the other is often referred to as Standing Woman (Elevation) because the figure appears to be lifting up, as opposed to this work in which, "it is the reverse of buoyancy that is sought. This is a triumphant figure of earth."    The model for both statues was Lachaise's wife Isabel Dutaud Nagle, "his model, his muse and his abiding inspiration."   Modeled in 1930, it was cast in 1932. It was an edition of 8, examples are at the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden,  Milwaukee Art Museum,   The Brooklyn Museum,  The Museum of Modern Art   and Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.
