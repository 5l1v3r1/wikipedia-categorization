RosWall (2008) is an environmental art mosaic project located in Roswell, Georgia, United States, a northern suburb of the state capital of Atlanta. The mosaic runs approximately 150 feet and began on a small portion of the wall and has continued to grow with the help of local groups including students of the nearby The Cottage School and local mosaic artist Donna Pinter.
