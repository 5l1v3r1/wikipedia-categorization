The Reaper is a public art work by artist Gustav Bohland, located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The bronze sculpture depicts an agricultural worker dressed in overalls and a wide-brimmed hat. One hand rests against his hip, and the other hand grasps the snath of a scythe that rests across his shoulders. The tool's toe and cline hang behind the figure's back. His boots rest on a small round base mounted on a circular flagstone pedestal.  The artwork is located at the former corporate headquarters of Froedtert Malting Company which is now the US headquarters of MaltEurop.
