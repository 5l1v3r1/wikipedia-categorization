Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks is a weathering steel sculpture by Claes Oldenburg.  It is located at Morse College Courtyard, Yale University.   An architecture student, Stuart Wrede, and a group of architecture students raised money, under the name of the Colossal Keepsake Corporation of Connecticut, and worked in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. It was installed on May 15, 1969, in Beinecke Plaza at Yale University, as a speakers' platform for anti-war protests.  It had a soft, inflated lipstick section, and wooden treads.   In the autumn of 1969, women were admitted to Yale University. The sculpture deteriorated and was removed by Oldenburg in March 1970.  It was redone in weathering steel and fiberglass, and reinstalled at Morse College, on October 17, 1974.  It has been shown at the Guggenheim Museum   and National Gallery of Art.
