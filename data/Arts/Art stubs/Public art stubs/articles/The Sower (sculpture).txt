The Sower is a public art work by artist Gustav Bohland, located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The bronze sculpture depicts an agricultural worker dressed in overalls and carrying a seed bag. The figure's shirt sleeves are rolled up past his elbows and the wide brim of a hat shades his face. His shirt collar is open. One hand holds the seed bag against his hip, and the other hand is cupped and extended in a gesture of scattering seeds. His boots rest on a small round base mounted on a circular flagstone pedestal.  The artwork is located at the former corporate headquarters of Froedtert Malting Company which is now the US headquarters for MaltEurop.
