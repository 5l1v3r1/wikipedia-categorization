Ascension is the name of two sculptures created in 1978 and 1986 by Luxembourgish sculptor Lucien Wercollier. A first version of the sculpture was completed in 1978. It had been ordered by the government of Luxembourg as a present to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. It is made out of pink marble and can be found in the concert hall.  Eight years later, in 1986, a second version made out of bronze was erected in front of the city hall in Strassen, Luxembourg, on a pedestal of granite, which contains the name of the sculpture and the artist (Lucien Wercollier sculpteur). The sculpture itself is signed with LW 1986. Coordinates: 49°37′N 6°04′E﻿ / ﻿49.617°N 6.067°E﻿ / 49.617; 6.067
