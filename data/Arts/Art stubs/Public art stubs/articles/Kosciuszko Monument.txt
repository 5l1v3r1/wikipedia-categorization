General Thaddeus Kosciuszko is a public art work by Italian and American artist Gaetano Trentanove located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States.   The bronze equestrian sculpture depicts Kosciuszko in his military uniform and hat.  It is located at South 9th Place and West Lincoln Avenue in Kosciuszko Park. The statue was placed in October 1904 but was not officially unveiled until June 18, 1905  with a speech by Archbishop F. Symon from Rome. The statue was moved to its present location in 1951 and a celebratory unveiling was held on September 15 of that year.  A condition assessment of the monument was conducted by McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory. They found several condition issues some originating from the poor quality of the original cast and others due to climate. The condition problems included casting porosity, patches and plugs, chill cracks, weaknesses in armature, and a general need for cleaning.  In 2013 the Restore Kosciuszko Monument Project successfully raised funds to fully restore the monument.  The statue was rededicated on November 11, 2013.
