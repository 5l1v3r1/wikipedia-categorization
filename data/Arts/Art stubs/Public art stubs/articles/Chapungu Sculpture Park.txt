The Chapungu Sculpture Park  is a sculpture park in Msasa, Harare, Zimbabwe, which displays the work of Zimbabwean stone sculptors.  It was founded in 1970 by Roy Guthrie, who was instrumental in promoting the work of its sculptors worldwide. One way this was done was by exhibiting the sculptures in Botanical Gardens in a touring exhibition called "Chapungu: Custom and Legend â€” A Culture in Stone". The places visited include: Among the artists whose works can be seen at the park are: The park is home to the Chapungu Sculpture Centre, which hosts an important residency program that allows young sculptors to work on their craft for two years under its aegis; many of the sculptors whose work is shown in the park began their careers at the Centre.  Another Chapungu Sculpture Park was created in 2007 in the United States, along with a gallery, in Loveland, Colorado.
