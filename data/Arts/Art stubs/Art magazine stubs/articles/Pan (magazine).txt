Pan was an arts and literary magazine co-founded by Richard Dehmel and published from 1895 to 1900 in Berlin by Otto Julius Bierbaum and Julius Meier-Graefe.   The magazine was revived by Paul Cassirer in 1910, published by his Pan-Presse. Pan played an important role in the development of Art Nouveau in Germany. The magazine printed a number of illustrations by both well-known and unknown young artists. Among the best-known artists who contributed to the periodical were Franz von Stuck, FÃ©lix Vallotton, and Thomas Theodor Heine. Pan also printed stories and poems, in the emerging Symbolist and Naturalist movements; authors published included Otto Julius Bierbaum, Max Dauthendey, Richard Dehmel and Arno Holz. Under Cassirer contributors included Frank Wedekind, Georg Heym, Ernst Barlach, and Franz Marc.  Alfred Kerr took over the publication of the magazine in 1912 and it appeared only sporadically until its demise in 1915.
