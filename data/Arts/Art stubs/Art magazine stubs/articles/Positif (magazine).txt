Positif is a French film magazine, founded in 1952 by Bernard Chardere. It is the second oldest French-language film magazine in publication after Les Cahiers du cinéma.  The magazine is headquartered in Paris and is published monthly.  Positif often acts as a counterpoint to Cahiers du cinéma,  another well-known French film journal, notably with Gerard Gozlan's article sarcastically titled "In Praise of André Bazin."  Positif has a Marxist-Leninist approach towards films.  The magazine was edited by Eric Losfeld from 1959.   The current chief editor is Michel Ciment.  The contributors included Ado Kyrou.
