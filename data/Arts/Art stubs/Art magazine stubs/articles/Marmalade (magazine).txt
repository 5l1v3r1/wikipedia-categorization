Marmalade is a British quarterly publication covering the creative industries, media, style, fashion and contemporary culture.  Marmalade was founded in 2001  by journalist Kirsty Robinson and art director Sacha (Spencer Trace) Teulon  welcomed its arrival "“A cerebral yet emotive blend of intelligent and innovative artwork”" whilst Henrietta Thompson praised it in Blueprint Magazine “In the end, there are only two things I could hate about Marmalade. Firstly everyone keeps trying to steal min. Secondly, I wish I’d done it first.” The magazine is published on a quarterly basis.  The magazine has been on maternity leave since 2009. Teulon has since moved into directing drama with "We are where we are"  Its contributors ranged from established artists, photographers and writers to new and unknown talent, many of whom were still studying.  In May 2006, it was awarded Teulon a prestigious D&AD award for art direction in the Newspaper and Magazines field, a prize not awarded since the 1970s when it was given to Nova magazine. The 'cut and paste' aesthetic has influenced design since. On 18 December 2006, it was reported that Marmalade and MySpace.com were working together to create the first magazine made entirely from MySpace user-generated content.  Jamie Kantrowitz, Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Content, MySpace Europe, was quoted in The Guardian as saying, "MySpace is the ultimate democratic medium where anyone with talent can showcase their work. Through our partnership with Marmalade we hope to translate this DIY quality into print, and hand the reins over to undiscovered creatives with fresh ideas."
