Die Insel (in English "The Island") was a German literary and art magazine that was published in Munich from 1899 to 1901 by Otto Julius Bierbaum, Alfred Walter Heymel, and Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der. Despite its short life, it is considered one of the most important German literary magazines of early modernism. The magazine published texts from already well-known authors like Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Rainer Maria Rilke as well as from new voices like Robert Walser. The symbol of the magazine, a sailing boat, was designed by Peter Behrens. It is still the logo of the Insel Verlag publishing company, which arose from the magazine.
