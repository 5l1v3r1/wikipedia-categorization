Vector is the critical magazine of the British Science Fiction Association (BSFA), established in 1958.  It is free to members of the BSFA and can be purchased at genre conventions and BSFA events. The first issue was published in 1958 under the founding editorship of E. C. Tubb.  The magazine was established as an irregular newsletter for members of the BSFA, founded in the same year, but "almost at once it began to produce reviews and essays, polemics and musings, about the nature and state of science fiction."  The magazine has changed format and periodicity many times over the years.  It currently focuses on articles and interviews, and is published "two to three times per year."
