FiRST is a Singaporean movie magazine formerly published monthly, now running as a weekly newspaper insert.  Established in December 2002 by SPH Magazines, the magazine was the only Singaporean publication entirely about movies. Each issue contains reviews of films and DVDs, as well as collectibles such as posters and postcards. The magazine also includes movie news, early buzz about upcoming films and exclusive interviews. The magazine focuses mostly on films from Hong Kong and the U.S. Often, freebies such as double-sided posters, postcard packs or A4-sized posters are enclosed. The magazine has won an Honourable Mention for Excellence in Magazine Front Cover Design from the Society of Print Awards in 2006. FiRST's tagline is "Asia's premier movie magazine." From 7 May 2009, FiRST stopped running as a monthly magazine and became a weekly pull-out section in The New Paper.
