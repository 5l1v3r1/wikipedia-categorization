Nippon Camera (日本カメラ, Nippon kamera)  is a Japanese photography magazine, published since 1950. Nippon Camera started in March 1950 as a bimonthly magazine, published by Kōgeisha (Tokyo) as the successor to the book series Amachua Shashin Sōsho (1948–49). It became a monthly magazine from July 1951.   The magazine is now (2012) published (in Tokyo) by Nippon Camera-sha, which also publishes an annual, Shashin Nenkan (写真年鑑) and other photography-related books.  Since the demise of Camera Mainichi, the sole rival of Nippon Camera as a photography magazine attempting to cater to all interests has been Asahi Camera.
