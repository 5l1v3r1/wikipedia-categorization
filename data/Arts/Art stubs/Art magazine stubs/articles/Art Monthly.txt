Art Monthly is a magazine of contemporary art founded in 1976 by Jack Wendler and Peter Townsend.   It is based in London and has an international scope, although its main focus is on British art. The magazine is published ten times a year (with double issues in the summer and winter) and is Britain's longest-established contemporary art magazine. Regular items in Art Monthly include feature articles, an editorial opinion column, news briefings, exhibition reviews, book reviews, an art-law column and exhibition listings. Occasional items include artist interviews, artist profiles, reviews of artists' books, films, performance, internet art, art market reports from major auctions and reports from particular events such as festivals, conferences and biennales.  Since 2007, Art Monthly has been expanding its website to reach a more diverse contemporary art readership.  2007 saw the publication of Talking Art: Interviews with Artists Since 1976, in association with Ridinghouse. Talking Art is an indispensable collection of the best of Art Monthly's interviews since the magazine's inception in the early seventies. It provides a supplementary history of twentieth-century art from over 150 perspectives through discussions between artists and critics. Many leading practitioners have been interviewed, often at highly significant moments in their careers. The interviews provide the most immediate access to an artist's thought processes and offer compelling narratives of the changing creative process. The artist interview has occupied an important position in Art Monthly since its first issue, and the book is published as part of the magazine's 30th anniversary celebrations.
