City Limits magazine was founded in 1981 in London by former staff members of the weekly London listings magazine Time Out, after its owner Tony Elliott abandoned running Time Out on co-operative principles.  City Limits was edited in its prime by jazz writer John Fordham and former Oz writer Nigel Fountain. This alternative weekly arts and listings magazine for London continued to be run as a co-operative for most of its existence,  then underwent a chaotic final period of three different owners within two years before it finally ceased publication in 1993.  Among other journalists, it launched the careers of Melissa Benn, Kim Newman, and Suzanne Moore. It was also an early site for the writings of the art critic Matthew Collings.
