  The Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil was a monthly magazine published by the proprietors of The Argus between 1873 and 1889.  The Sketcher was issued at monthly intervals according to shipping movements between Australia and Britain.  The magazine contained many illustrations, engravings, and articles which capture "the picturesque phases of our public and social life of notable objects and events in Australia and New Zealand".  It provides an important pictorial account of life in the colonies before the widespread use of photography. The Sketcher employed many prominent artists, including political cartoonist Tom Carrington  and illustrator Julian Ashton,  and published Arthur Streeton's first black and white work on 24 January 1889.  In 1880 it briefly moved to a fortnightly publication which lasted until 1882 before returning to a monthly journal. In 1889, it merged with The Australasian.
