Errr-Magazine is a Mexican magazine devoted to art and literature. Its first edition (labeled no. -1) was published in March 2009 and dealt with creative experience.   The magazine is published bi-monthly, and encourages artists and writers to send their work. The magazine is based in Mexico City and is distributed free.  Mexican author Jorge Volpi has contributed to the magazine. Originally, the magazine set topics such as memory or creative experience, as a theme for an edition. However, as of the 3rd edition, this no longer holds true.
