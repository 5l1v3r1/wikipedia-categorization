Richard Rhodes   Canadian Art is a quarterly art magazine published in Toronto  and focusing on Canadian contemporary art. The magazine publishes profiles of artists, art news, interviews, editorials, and reviews of modern art exhibitions.  Established in 1943 it was known as artscanada between 1968 and 1983. With assistance from the Carnegie Corporation, Acadia University professor Walter Abell established the Maritime Art Association's publication Maritime Art in 1940. Violet Gillett was also instrumental in the creation and production of the magazine.   With assistance from the National Gallery of Canada the magazine changed its name to Canadian Art in 1943 focusing on Canadian and international art. Under the editorship of Paul Arthur and Barry Lord the name was changed to artscanada in 1968.  In 1983, the publisher Society for Art Publications ceased operations and the name was changed back to Canadian Art.  Struggling financially, the magazine was purchased by Maclean Hunter and Key Publishers in 1984.  Canadian Art has been owned by the Canadian Art Foundation since 1991, receiving charitable status in 1992.  Richard Rhodes edited the magazine for 25 years, retiring in 2015.   In 1998 the magazine began co-sponsoring an art award, the Canadian Emerging Artist Prize, with Connor Clark Private Trust.  More recently the magazine has organized a film festival, Reel Artists, which screens films about art and artists.
