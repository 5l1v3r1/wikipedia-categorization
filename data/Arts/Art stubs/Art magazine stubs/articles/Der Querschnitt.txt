Der Querschnitt (The Cross Section) was an art magazine published by the German art dealer Alfred Flechtheim between 1921 and 1936. The magazine was based in Berlin.  According to Erika Esau, the magazine 'represented the politically detached aspirations of the aesthetically attuned of the Western world. Lightheartedly snobistish, the magazine;s inclusions of works by anyone who was anybody in the Weimar period and its unorthodox graphic and literary style quilifies it as an avant-garde publication.'  Hermann von Wedderkop served as an editor of the publication.
