Outdoor Photographer is an American nature photography magazine.    It is published eleven times per year, monthly save for a combined January/February issue.   In 2000, it had roughly 172,000 regular subscribers.   Regular contributors have included Galen Rowell,  Frans Lanting,  and Dewitt Jones.  In July 2014, columnist Bob Krist revealed that he was not paid by the magazine in over a year. Many other contributors are rumored to be awaiting payment, as well, and the magazine stopped responding to payment requests. Also in July, 2015, an announcement was made that the magazine was acquired by the Boston-based publishing company Madavor Media.  Shortly after the announcement, former contributors were contacted and promised that information would soon be provided about how to recover fees owed by former owner, Werner Media.
