Beautiful/Decay is an art magazine created by Amir Fallah and Jay Littleton.  First published as a black-and-white zine at a Kinko's in 1996,  it was resurrected as a full-fledged magazine in 2001.  In his Basics Illustration series, author and artist Mark Wigan named it an essential magazine resource for "global contexts".
