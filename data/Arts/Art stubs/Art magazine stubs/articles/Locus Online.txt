Locus Online (founded 1997)   is the online component of Locus Magazine. It publishes news briefs related to the science fiction, fantasy and horror publishing world, along with original reviews and feature articles, and excerpts of articles that appeared in the print edition. Information for Locus Online is compiled and edited by Mark R. Kelly.    In 2002, Locus Online won the first Hugo Award for Best Web Site.   It was nominated again in 2005.  In January 2016, longtome short-fiction reviewer Lois Tilton announced her resignation. She wrote, "Without consulting or informing me, they had begun deleting material they considered negative from my reviews. To me, this is censorship and completely unacceptable."
