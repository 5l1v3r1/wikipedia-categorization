Hyperallergic is a Brooklyn-based arts online magazine. Founded by the art critic Hrag Vartanian and his husband Veken Gueyikian in October 2009, the site describes itself as a "forum for serious, playful, and radical thinking."  The New Yorker critic Peter Schjeldahl has described the site as "infectiously ill-tempered."  Holland Cotter of the New York Times has also praised the site, crediting it with a revival in popular art criticism.  The publication was cited by the TED blog as one of "100 Websites You Should Know and Use" in 2007.  In 2018 Nieman Reports published an article outlining how Hyperallergic came to rival print art journalism, in which Sarah Douglas, the ARTnews editor in chief, said that Hyperallergic had reinvigorated art criticism.      Hyperallergic LABS, its Tumblr blog, was named by Time magazine as one of the “30 Tumblrs to Follow in 2013.”  Hyperallergic publishes a weekend edition edited by John Yau, Thomas Micchelli, Natalie Haddad and Albert Mobilio.
