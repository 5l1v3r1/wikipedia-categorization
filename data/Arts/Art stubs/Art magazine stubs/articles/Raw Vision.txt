Raw Vision is a British magazine devoted to outsider art   and edited by John Maizels.  It features content about the subject worldwide.  Raw Vision was founded by John Maizels in 1989 as a way of telling people about outsider art with a small freelance staff and text contributed by scholars.   Each issue features outsider artists from different countries, as well as covering general news on the subject of outsider art from around the world.   Raw Vision has been described as "outsider art's Rolling Stone"   in 2007, as it is the only international publication  whose exclusive content is outsider art. Over the years it has featured several hundred self-taught and visionary artists, many of whom were completely unknown. It also features visionary environmentsâ€”sculpture gardens, self built architecture and unique buildings.  It defines outsider art as "creative expression that exist outside accepted cultural norms, or the realm of 'fine art'", and says that its "creators would not consider themselves artists, nor would they even feel that they were producing art at all."    "O.O.A." (Rivista dell'Osservatorio Outsider Art, University of Palermo), originally published in 2010, is a six-monthly review directed by Eva di Stefano and published on paper by Glifo Edizioni (http://www.glifo.com). This magazine is known for its  splendidly illustrated  pages and for gathering together some of the most important international contributors of the Outsider Art world.
