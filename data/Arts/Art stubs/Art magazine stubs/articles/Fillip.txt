Fillip is a Vancouver-based contemporary art publishing organization formed in 2004.  It publishes a magazine as well as books of critical writing. The magazine with the same name was started in 2005.   The publisher of the magazine is the Projectile Publishing Society, a Canadian non-profit.  In 2008 it opened an office on the border between Gastown and the Downtown Eastside from which it hosts month events including artist talks, publication launches, and screenings.   Fillip builds on Vancouver’s tradition of critical art publishing such as the pre-magazine era Vanguard (1972–78), Boo (1994–98), and Last Call (2001–02) by stimulating conversations about contemporary art through critical writing, projects, and events. Beginning in 2009, Fillip began publishing artist books and books of critical writing under the Fillip Editions imprint.
