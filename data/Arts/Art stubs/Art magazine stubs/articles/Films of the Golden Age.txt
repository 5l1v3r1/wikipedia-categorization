Films of the Golden Age is a quarterly magazine devoted to films and movie stars from the 1910-1960 film era in Hollywood. It is published by the Muscatine Journal division of Lee Enterprises, Inc., the same publishers of the monthly Classic Images magazine. Bob King has been its editor and general manager since its inception. Films of the Golden Age was founded in 1962.  The magazine is based in Muscatine, Iowa.  Each issue typically profiles a half dozen performers from classic films, major stars and supporting players as well as less-remembered individuals in the film industry during the era. Most issues also have an article or two devoted to a specific film from the period. Among the many performers who have been covered by the magazine over the years were Tyrone Power, Butterfly McQueen, Olivia de Havilland, Betty Hutton, Robert Mitchum, NoÃ«l Coward, Anita Page, Conway Tearle, Edna May Oliver, James Dean, Dorothy Dandridge, Gene Kelly, Esther Williams, Una Merkel, and directors Michael Curtiz, and W. S. Van Dyke. Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne has gone on record proclaiming Films of the Golden Age one of his favorite magazines.
