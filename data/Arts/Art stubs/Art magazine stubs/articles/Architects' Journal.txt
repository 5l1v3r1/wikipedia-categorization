The Architects' Journal is an architectural magazine published in London by Metropolis International. The first edition was produced in 1895. Originally named The Builder's Journal and Architectural Record, from 1906 to 1910 it was known as The Builder's Journal and Architectural Engineer, and it then became The Architects and Builder's Journal from 1911 until 1919, at which point it was given its current name.   In October 2015, title owner Top Right Group announced it was to stop producing print editions and that, over the next 12–18 months, all titles, including The Architects' Journal, would become digital only.  In December 2015 Top Right Group rebranded as Ascential,  who, in January 2017, announced its intention to sell 13 titles, including The Architects' Journal;  the 13 "heritage titles" were to be "hived off into a separate business while buyers are sought."  The brands were purchased by Metropolis International Ltd (owner of Property Week title since 2013) in a £23.5m cash deal, announced on 1 June 2017.  The Architects' Journal remains in print. In June 2012, the magazine had a circulation of 6,714.  Three years later (June 2015), this figure had risen slightly to 6,817.
