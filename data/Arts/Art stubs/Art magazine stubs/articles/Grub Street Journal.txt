The Grub-Street Journal, published from January 8, 1730 to 1738,    was a satire on popular journalism and hack-writing as it was conducted in Grub Street in London.  It was largely edited by Richard Russell and the botanist John Martyn.  While he disclaimed it, Alexander Pope was one of its contributors,   continuing his satire which he had started with The Dunciad. After its end, The Literary Courier of Gruber Street succeeded it for a few months.
