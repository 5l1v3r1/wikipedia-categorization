It concentrated on providing a pictorial record of West End theatrical productions, each issue being devoted to a single show, with descriptions of the plot, the costumes and the sets, and numerous  photographs of the cast and scenes from the production; in the case of musicals, it usually included some of the lyrics and short extracts from the score. In its early years, the magazine experienced several changes. The ownership changed hands in May 1904, when the first editor, Rudolph Birnbaum, was replaced by Frank M Boyd. He in turn was succeeded after less than a year by Fred Dangerfield. who edited the next 20 issues.

The last issue of Play Pictorial, no 446, appeared in 1939,  after which the magazine was absorbed into another London theatrical magazine Theatre World
