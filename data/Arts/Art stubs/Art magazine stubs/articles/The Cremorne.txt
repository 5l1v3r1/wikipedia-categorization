The Cremorne was a pornographic magazine published by William Lazenby in London in 1882 (but falsely backdated to 1851).   The title alludes to Cremorne Gardens which had by that time become a haunt of prostitutes.  The magazine was a sequel to The Pearl. The story "The Secret Life of Linda Brent" is an obscene parody of "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl", by Harriet Jacobs writing under the pseudonym of Linda Brent.  It is in the same vein as "My Grandmother's Tale", previously published in The Pearl.
