Photo is a French magazine about photography previously published by Hachette Filipacchi Médias, and currently owned by EPMA.  Photo was started by Hachette Filipacchi Médias as a monthly magazine in 1960.  It was modeled on the magazine American Photo.  The magazine is now published ten times a year.  It concentrates on the artistic aspects of photography, rather than technical aspects. The editorial line is tripartite: fashion/nude/glamour, historical images of wars/guillotines/poverty or similar, and selected journalism news photos from around the world. It is read and distributed around the world, and is known featuring naked models, colorful saturated graphic images, and its annual amateur photography contest. It was sold by Hachette Filipacchi in 2011. An American edition was published under the name Photo World from 1973 to 1978.
