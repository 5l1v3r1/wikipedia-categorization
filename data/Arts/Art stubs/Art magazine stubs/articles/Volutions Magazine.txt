Volutions Magazine (volutions Magazine) is a hypermedia online artistic enterprise founded in 2005 by artists and intellectuals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The inaugural edition included poetry, prose, music, painting and photography. The original founders were UNC graduate students: musician John Rib√≥ (Kapow! Music and member of the Buhanan recording cooperative which also includes artists such as David Karsten Daniels), experimental poet Eduardo Ramos, pen name of Joaquin Bueno and Brazilian-American poet Marco Alexandre de Oliveira. The magazine began as a collaboration among aspiring doctoral students in what they viewed as an ethical wasteland. Motivated especially by events such as the United States presidential election, 2004 and a growing anti-liberal sentiment of post 9/11, post-postmodern America, the movement was an example of grassroots utilization of emerging Web 2.0 tendencies and the democratization of information. Eventually, the Volutions project became a collaboration with artists and intellectuals in various schools in multiple countries, especially from poets and literary critics associated with the University of Virginia in Charlottesville (attended by Eduardo Ramos). Currently, the majority of Volutions collaborators are geographically centered in both Charlottesville and the Chapel Hill and Carrboro areas in North Carolina. Later, the magazine discarded the initial democratized concept of open submissions, opting for an invitation-only format. In 2010, Volutions Magazine was purchased by a consortium of graduate students at Duke University. Although the transaction's details were not disclosed, estimates place figures in the upper tens of dollars. Its correspondents write under the names of Eduardo Ramos and Bartleby. They currently live in Galicia, Spain and London, respectively.
