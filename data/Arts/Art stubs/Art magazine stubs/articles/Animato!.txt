Animato! was a magazine that was dedicated to animation, generally viewed by animation fans as a successor to Michael Barrier's pioneering Funnyworld and David Mruz's Mindrot/Animania.  Animato! was founded and initially edited by Michael A. Ventrella in Boston in the early 1980s  and featured the film Rock & Rule as its first cover.  Harry McCracken later become editor and expanded the magazine to full sized with a color cover.  Ventrella later sold the rights to Patrick Duquette, who began distributing through newsstands. It ceased publication in the late 1990s.
