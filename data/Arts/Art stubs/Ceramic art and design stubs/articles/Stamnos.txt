A stamnos (plural stamnoi) is a type of Greek pottery used to store liquids.  It is much squatter than an amphora and has two stubby handles relatively high on its sides. It is a relatively unusual container form, related to the Krater vase. Stamnoi have a similar function to Kraters, and are thought to have been used to stir wine and water together to dilute them. However, some Stamnoi have lids, indicating that they were used for storage too.  Media related to Stamnos at Wikimedia Commons
