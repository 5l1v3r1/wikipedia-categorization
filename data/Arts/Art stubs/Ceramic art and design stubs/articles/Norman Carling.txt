Norman Carling (1902â€“1971) was an English designer/modeller in ceramics, who created a large number of Art Deco models and joined Maling pottery in 1935 from the firm of A.J. Wilkinson, a company which also employed Clarice Cliff. Mostly these were one of a kind or in very small runs, but which never saw full production.  He was responsible for Maling's classic 1930s art deco design called "Blossom Time".  Carling was one of a talented design team working for Maling in the 1930s, the other two being Miss Theo Maling and Lucien George Boullemier.  Carling also introduced designs in relief to Maling's patterns, giving a tactile effect to floral depictions. Maling's art deco lustre ware is prized for its iridescent sheen.
