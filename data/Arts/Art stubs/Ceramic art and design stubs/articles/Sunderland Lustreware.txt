Sunderland Lustreware is a type of pottery originating from Sunderland, England.  According to Michael Gibson   there were 16 potteries in Sunderland of which 7 are known to have produced lustrewares in the Nineteenth Century. Though many made everyday tableware, some of them made a distinct type which became known as Sunderland Lustreware. Indeed, similar pottery made in Tyneside (Newcastle upon Tyne and North Shields) and in Staffordshire also received this designation in later years. This pottery is now very collectible.  It is normally found in a pink form, but orange and other colours are also found. Typical pieces are religious plaques, and jugs featuring a design incorporating the bridge over the River Wear, or various heraldic - especially Masonic - devices. Most of the pieces available today were produced in Anthony Scott's Pottery in Southwick, Dawson's Pottery in Low Ford (now South Hylton), or at Dixon, Austin & Co. A comprehensive collection is on display in the Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens
