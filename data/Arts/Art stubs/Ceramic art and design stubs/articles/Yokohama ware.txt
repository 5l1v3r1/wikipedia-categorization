Yokohama ware (横浜焼, Yokohama-yaki) is a broad term for Japanese export porcelain mostly destined for export to Europe and the West, which was shipped out of Yokohama.  Yokohama ware is difficult to define, but encompasses styles such as Arita ware and Satsuma ware that were destined for export. One of the companies specialising in it is Masuda Arts.
