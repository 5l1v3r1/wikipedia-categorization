The Regina Vasorum or Queen of Vases is a 4th-century BC hydria from Cumae depicting Eleusinian divinities with gilded flesh in polychrome relief. It is held in the collections of the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg. In addition to its aesthetic qualities, it is valued as an iconographical source for ancient Greek religion. The Regina Vasorum is a "spectacular" and unusually large example of technical experimentation among Greek potters after the red-figure style had run its course.  The figures were made separately, painted, and gilded, then attached to the vase with slip,  possibly by sprigging.
