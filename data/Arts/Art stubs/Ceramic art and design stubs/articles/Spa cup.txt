Spa cup (in Czech: Lázeňský pohárek ) is a special kind of porcelain, which is used to drink mineral or thermal water directly from spring. Spa cups were developed in north-west Bohemia in the spa region around the well known spas such as Karlovy Vary, Mariánské Lázně and Jáchymov. Originally people  drank spa water using glasses. The development of spa cups started in the 17th century  and went through a variety of materials, shapes and decorations. Now they are part of the Czech folklore.
