Banko ware (萬古焼, Banko-yaki) is a type of Japanese pottery (Stoneware) traditionally from Yokkaichi, Mie. It is therefore also known as Yokkaichi-Banko ware.   It is believed to have originated in the 18th century.  Most products are teacups, teapots, flower vases, and sake vessels.   Media related to Banko ware at Wikimedia Commons
