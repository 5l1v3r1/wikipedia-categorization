A pelike (Ancient Greek: πελίκη) is a one-piece ceramic container similar to an amphora. It has two open handles that are vertical on their lateral aspects and even at the side with the edge of the belly, a narrow neck, a flanged mouth, and a sagging, almost spherical belly. Unlike the often-pointed bottom of many amphorae, the pelike's bottom is always flanged so it will stand on its own. Pelikes are often intricately painted, usually depicting a scene involving people.  The shape first appeared at the end of the 6th century BCE and continued to the 4th century BCE.
