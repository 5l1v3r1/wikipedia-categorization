Vitrified tile is a ceramic tile with very low porosity.  It is an alternative to marble and granite flooring. Vitrified tiles are often used outdoors due to their water and frost resistance. There are four types of Vitrified tiles - Soluble salt, Double charge, Full Body, Glazed. Vitrified tiles is made by hydraulic pressing a mixture of clay, quartz, feldspar and silica, which make vitreous surface. Thus creating a single mass making them hard with low porosity. Different clay bodies reach vitrification at different temperatures.
