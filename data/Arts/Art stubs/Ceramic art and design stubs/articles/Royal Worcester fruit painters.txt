The Royal Worcester fruit painters were a group of painters who specialized in depicting fruits on porcelain tableware. The tradition originated with the painter Octar H. Copson, who in 1880 had also painted a plaque commissioned by a local farmer to commemorate the introduction of the Pershore plum. Royal Worcester fruit pieces remain highly desirable and have been auctioned for more than $10,000.
