A Wally Bird is a tobacco jar or vase in the style of a grotesque owl or bird, first termed for the sculptural productions in this form by Robert Wallace Martin. These were typical examples of Martinware â€” salt-glazed stoneware which was produced by the Martin Brothers in their pottery; first in Fulham and then in Southall.   The Wally Birds were popular but did not make the Martins wealthy; the pottery closed during the Great Depression.   Examples of these birds now sell at auction for large sums of money.
