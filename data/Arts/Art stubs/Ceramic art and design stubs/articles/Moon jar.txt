Moon jar is a type of traditional Korean white porcelain which was made during the  Joseon Dynasty (1392â€“1910) . The Joseon white porcelain was adopted as imperial ware in the fifteenth century. The name comes from its shape and milky color of the glaze to resemble the coloration of the moon Often times it consists of two hemispherical halves that have been joined together in the middle.  The slightly uneven natural shape added to its appeal during the Joseon dynasty.  It has inspired many artists such as Kim Whanki and Bernard Leach.
