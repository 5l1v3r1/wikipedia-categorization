The Federal Standard 595 camouflage colours were developed by the Mobility Equipment Research and Design Command (M.E.R.D.C) during the 1970s.  The colours and pattern scheme could be adjusted as the environments changed.   Military modelers often use the Federal Standard 595 colours for painting models and soldiers.  To be included in the list the colour must be "Federal Standard 595" and have the word "camouflage" in it.
