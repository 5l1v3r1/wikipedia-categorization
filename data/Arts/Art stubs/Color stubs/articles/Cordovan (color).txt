Cordovan is a rich shade of burgundy and a dark shade of rose.  Cordovan takes its name from the city of Cordoba, Spain, where the production of cordovan leather was first practiced by the Visigoths in the seventh century.   The term cordovan has come to describe the color of clothing, leather in particular; in this sense, the use of cordovan overlaps with that of oxblood. The first recorded use of cordovan as a color name in English was in 1925.  Jackets Shoes Uniforms Gaming Jeep Grand Wagoneer
