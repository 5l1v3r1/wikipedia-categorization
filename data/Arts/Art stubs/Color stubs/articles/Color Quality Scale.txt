Color Quality Scale (CQS) is a color rendering index (a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce colors of illuminated objects). Developed by researchers at NIST  the metric aims to overcome some of the issues inherent in the widely used CIE Ra.   Several manufacturers are beginning to publish data on CQS scores of their products, including some who claim light sources with CQS scores up to 97.
