Flax or Flaxen is a pale yellowish-gray, the color of straw or unspun dressed flax.  An early use of "flaxen" to describe hair color appears in David Copperfield, by Charles Dickens: Mr. Omer's granddaughter, Minnie, is described as "a pretty little girl with long, flaxen, curling hair."  The first recorded use of flax as a color name in English was in 1915.
