Lemon chiffon is the X11 color and web color lemonchiffon,   reminiscent of the color of lemon chiffon cake. It was first introduced as a named color in the X Window System when the X11 colors were adopted in 1987; the origins of the names are obscure. These were adopted for the Netscape Navigator web browser for colors in its extended palette, and in turn recognized by Mosaic and Internet Explorer. No specification, however, recognizes it as an official HTML color name.
