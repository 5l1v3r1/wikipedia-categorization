Titanium yellow, also nickel antimony titanium yellow, nickel antimony titanium yellow rutile, CI Pigment Yellow 53, or C.I. 77788, is a yellow pigment with the chemical composition of NiO·Sb2O3·20TiO2. Its CAS number is 8007-18-9. It is a complex inorganic compound. Its melting point lies above 1000 °C, and has extremely low solubility in water. While it contains antimony and nickel, their bioavailability is very low, so the pigment is relatively safe. The pigment has crystal lattice of rutile, with 2-5% of titanium ions replaced with nickel(II) and 9-12% of them replaced with antimony(V). Titanium yellow is manufactured by reacting fine powders of metal oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates in solid state in temperatures between 1000-1200 °C, either in batches or continuously in a pass-through furnace. Titanium yellow is used primarily as a pigment for plastics and ceramic glazes, and in art painting.
