 Ecru is the color of unbleached linen or silk, a light beige or fawn. The word comes from French écru, 'raw' or 'unbleached'. The second generation Pokémon games, Gold, Silver, and Crystal (as well as their reboots HeartGold and SoulSilver) are known for naming cities after plants or plant-related things. One such city is named Ecruteak and is the centre point of Legendary Pokémon activity in this iteration of the franchise.
