Earth tone is a color scheme with multiple meanings. In its narrowest sense it refers to any color containing some brown , the color of ground or soil (earth). It can also refer to natural colors (colors found in nature): brown soil, green leaf, cloudy sky, as well as the red sun. These palettes can create a warm, nature-friendly atmosphere.  More generally it refers to neutral colors, colors that are muted and flat in an emulation of natural colors. Neutral colors can be created by mixing two complimentary colors or combining a pure color with white, black, or gray. Pure neutral colors include black, white, and all grays while near neutrals include browns, tan, and darker colors.  Many earth tones originate from clay earth pigments, such as umber, ochre, and sienna.
