Rust is an orange-red-brown color resembling iron oxide. It is a commonly used color in stage lighting, and appears roughly the same color as photographic safelights when used over a standard tungsten light source. The color is number 777 in the Lee Filters swatch book. The first recorded use of rust as a color name in English was in 1692.  Rust is named after the resulting phenomenon of the oxidation of iron.  The word 'rust' finds its etymological origins in the Proto-Germanic word rusta, which translates to "redness."  The word is closely related to the term "ruddy," which also refers to a reddish coloring in an object.
