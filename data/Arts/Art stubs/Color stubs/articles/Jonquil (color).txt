Jonquil is a hue of yellow. It is the color of the interior of the central cylindrical tubular projection of the jonquil flower. The color takes its name from a species of plant, Narcissus jonquilla, which has clusters of small fragrant yellow flowers, and is native to the Mediterranean. The first known recorded use of jonquil as a color name in English was in 1789. [unreliable source?] Kurt Vonnegut uses the word jonquil in his novel The Sirens of Titan, Titan being the largest moon of Saturn.
