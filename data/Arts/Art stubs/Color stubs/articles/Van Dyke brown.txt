Van Dyke brown, also known as Cassel earth or Cologne earth, is a dark brown color named after the painter Anthony van Dyck. The color was originally made from peat or soil, and has been applied as both watercolor and oil paints.  Today, the pigment is made by combining asphalt-like black with iron oxide. This replicates the color of the original iron oxide-rich earth found in Cassel and Cologne, Germany.  Television host Bob Ross frequently used Van Dyke brown oil paint on The Joy of Painting as a color for trees, cabins, and basecoats.
