Tiffany Blue is the colloquial name for the light medium robin egg blue color associated with Tiffany & Co., the New York City jewelry company, created by Charles Tiffany and John Young in 1837. The color was used on the cover of Tiffany's Blue Book, first published in 1845.   Since then, Tiffany & Co. has used the color extensively on promotional materials like boxes and bags. The Tiffany Blue color is protected as a color trademark by Tiffany & Co. in some jurisdictions including the U.S.  [dead link] The color is produced as a private custom color by Pantone, with PMS number 1837, the number deriving from the year of Tiffany's foundation. As a trademarked color, it is not publicly available and is therefore not printed in the Pantone Matching System swatch books.
