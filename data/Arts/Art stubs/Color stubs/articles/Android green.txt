Android green is a shade of yellow-green, defined by Google as the color of the "Android robot" logo for the Android operating system. It is defined to be RGB hex value #A4C639 online and Pantone PMS376C in print.  However, the logo shown with the defining language at the Google website, as well as other versions of it in different resolutions and formats, are a slightly different #A4C439. Additionally, in the headers of that site and elsewhere, the color used varies substantially.
