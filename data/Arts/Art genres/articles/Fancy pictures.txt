He invented in to describe the paintings of Philip Mercier, such as Venetian Girl at a Window or the series The Five Senses.  The extended term for the same subgenre, fancy pictures was invented by Joshua Reynolds to describe paintings with beggar or peasant children produced by Thomas Gainsborough in his final decades.
