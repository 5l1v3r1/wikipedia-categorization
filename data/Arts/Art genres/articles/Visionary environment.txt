A visionary environment or fantasy world is an extensive/large-scale artistic installations (buildings, sculpture parks, etc.) intended to capture intense subjective/personal experiences (dreams, fantasies, obsessions, etc.) of their creators. The subjective/personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and outsider art.
