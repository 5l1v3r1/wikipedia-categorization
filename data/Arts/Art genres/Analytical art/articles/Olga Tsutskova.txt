Olga Tsutskova (Russian: О́льга Петро́вна Цуцко́ва; June 6, 1952) is a painter who lives in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. She was born in St. Petersburg in 1952 and graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (now - the Repin Institute, formerly known as Imperial Academy of Arts) in 1977. She joined the Leningrad Section of the USSR Union of Artists in 1985. Tsutskova's oeuvre, marked by special attention to details, is dominated by still life and portrait. Starting from the Russian avant-garde (Pavel Filonov), I finally came to classical style. This was my personal choice. Oil painting as a universal mode of expression, a way of understanding the world. The great masters of the past (Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci) remain our contemporaries and teachers.Many of her works were acquired by the Exhibition Boards of Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as by private collectors in Düsseldorf (Germany), Seoul (S. Korea), and some other European and North American cities. Her works have been displayed in a number of exhibitions in Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
