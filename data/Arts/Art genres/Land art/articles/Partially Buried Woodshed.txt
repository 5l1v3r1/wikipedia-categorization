Partially Buried Woodshed is a work of land art created by Robert Smithson. It was created at Kent State University in January 1970. The work has since been demolished, and only concrete remains in the grass. It is located southeast of the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus. Shortly after the Kent State shootings, which took place on May 4, 1970, an inscription was added to the artwork that recontextualized the work in such a way that it came to be associated by some with the event.
