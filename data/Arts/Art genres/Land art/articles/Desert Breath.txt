 The Desert Breath, located in the Egyptian desert near Hurghada on the Red Sea coast, is a double-spiral work of land art. It was created by the D.A.ST. Arteam, a group made up of three Greek artists - Danae Stratou, sculptor, Alexandra Stratou, industrial designer, and Stella Constantinides, architect. The work, completed on March 7, 1997, covers an area of about 10 hectares (25 acres).   It consists of 89 protruding cones of gradually increasing size set in a spiral and another 89 depressed (incised) cones set in spirals. The sand dug out from the depressed cones was used to create the protruding cones, resulting in the displacement of 8000 cubic meters (10500 cubic yards) of sand.  At the center of the art piece used to be a body of water 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter which has since evaporated.   The artwork is subject to natural erosion and in due course the area will revert to original desert plain. It is viewable by satellite pictures via Google Earth. The artists have stated that the project was meant to suggest an experience of infinity with the desert as a landscape of the mind.   Even though it is in a state of slow disintegration, Desert Breath is still viewable two decades after its creation.   Through its slow disintegration, the installation has been seen as an instrument to measure the passage of time.  Coordinates: 27°22′52″N 33°38′00″E﻿ / ﻿27.38111°N 33.63333°E﻿ / 27.38111; 33.63333
