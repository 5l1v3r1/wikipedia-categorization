The International Uranium Film Festival  was founded in 2010 in Rio de Janeiro, and has traveled to Germany, Portugal, India  and the United States. This educational event merges art, ecology, environmentalism and environmental justice, to inform the public about uranium mining and milling, nuclear power issues, nuclear weapons and the nuclear fuel cycle from "cradle to grave" life-cycle assessment - and the effects of radioactivity on humans and other species.     The festival founders and principal organizers are Norbert Suchanek and Marcia Gomes de Oliveira. The legal organizer of the International Uranium Film Festival is the arts and education non-profit "Yellow Archives".  The organizers and the festival participants seek to educate and activate the international public on these issues through the dynamic media of film and video.  The films shown typically have content that critiques and analyzes uranium mining, milling, and use, and the effects there of on land, water and human health. A key objective of the festival is to inform cultures and future generations about the effects of radioactivity and radioactive materials.  Public education and open discussion of these matters may lead to a more peaceful, healthy future, and hold promise to promote a safe, sustainable future without nuclear risks.         The Atomic Age nuclear world has produced millions of metric tons of high-level, low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste during the past sixty years.    This waste will remain hazardous for over 100,000 years.  Other themes explore atomic legacy issues, including the research, development, testing and use of nuclear weapons.   Many of these events affected specific populations including the Marshall Islanders, Native American cultures in the U.S. Southwest and Northwest, First Nations in Western Canada, among others.  The legal organizer of the International Uranium Film Festival is the arts and education non-profit "Yellow Archives".   This charitable organization is registered in Rio de Janeiro and officially recognized by the Brazilian Government. Partners of the festival are the Heinrich Boell Foundation   Brazil, Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Modern Art MAM-Rio   and the Technical State School for TV, Cinema, Tourism and Events - Adolpho Bloch of the Foundation for Education and Science FAETEC.
