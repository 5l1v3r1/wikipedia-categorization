Peintre de la Marine (Painter of the Fleet) is a title awarded by the Minister of defence in France to artists who have devoted their talents to the sea, the French Navy and other maritime subjects. It was set up in 1830 by the July Monarchy and can be awarded to painters photographers, illustrators, engravers, and sculptors. The title is unpaid but does grant certain facilities and privileges: The peintres agréés are named for a 3-year term by a jury of naval officiers and peintres titulaires and presided over by a general officer of the Navy. To become a peintre titulaire, one has to serve as a peintre agréé for more than 4 consecutive years.
