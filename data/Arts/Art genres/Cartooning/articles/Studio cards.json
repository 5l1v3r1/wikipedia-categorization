Soon Welcher was designing 200 cards a year, many in contrast to the saccharin sentiments expressed by established card companies. Her best-selling card combined the song title \"Stay as Sweet as You Are\" with a happily sloshed woman drinking herself under the table.

Although Los Angeles gift shops initially showed little interest, sales soared at the USC and UCLA student stores.

After they launched <b>Box Cards</b> in the mid-1950s with a few California accounts, they attended the New York Stationery Show, where they added more accounts and acquired representatives. The timing was perfect, since Box Cards introduced humor and vitality to the moribund greeting card industry at the same time <a href=\"/wiki/Harvey_Kurtzman\" title=\"Harvey Kurtzman\">Harvey Kurtzman</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mad_(magazine)\" title=\"Mad (magazine)\">Mad</a></i> was making a transition from comic book to magazine.

Kennedy liked what Caroll had produced for her <b>Nellie Card Company</b>, and she became the first artist hired by Box Cards. Another contributor to Box Cards was the cartoonist <a href=\"/wiki/Joel_Beck\" title=\"Joel Beck\">Joel Beck</a>, credited as one of the founders of the underground comics movement in the mid-1960s. Only a few years before he first published <i><a href=\"/wiki/Penthouse_(magazine)\" title=\"Penthouse (magazine)\">Penthouse</a></i> in 1965, <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Guccione\" title=\"Bob Guccione\">Bob Guccione</a> drew cartoons for Box Cards.

In the decades that followed, humorous cards evolved through many different approaches at the major companies and came full circle in 1993 when Gibson made a licensing agreement with <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mad_(magazine)\" title=\"Mad (magazine)\">Mad</a></i> to publish a 1994 line of <i>Mad</i> greeting cards with artwork by the <i>Mad</i> cartoonists.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beatniks\">Beatniks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Studio_cards&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Beatniks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Hallmark labeled their early 1950s line <b>Fancy Free</b>, and American Greetings called theirs <b>Hi Brows</b>. In its official history, American Greetings acknowledges Hi Brows were published in 1957 because the earlier studio cards were a cartooning breakthrough:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><a href=\"/wiki/Beatnik\" title=\"Beatnik\">Beatniks</a> launched the anti-establishment movement in the 1950s, and Americans began to question tradition. Building on this counterculture momentum, American Greetings introduced a new kind of greeting card - Hi Brows. These irreverent, witty cards were slim and tall. Even the name of the cards was a rebellious parody. The inspiration for Hi Brows came from funny cards being made by Bohemian artists in their Greenwich Village studios. Hi Brows featured short, comic punch lines and cartoon-style artwork, a new generation of greeting cards to help a new generation communicate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Box_youth.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Box_youth.jpg/200px-Box_youth.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"487\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/Box_youth.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"202\" data-file-height=\"492\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Box_youth.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A 1950s Box Card by Bill Box</div></div></div>\n<p>In 1960, Box Cards were collected into a book, <i>Burn This</i>, with an introduction by <a href=\"/wiki/Mort_Sahl\" title=\"Mort Sahl\">Mort Sahl</a>, who wrote:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>My initial exposure to the new awareness cards, as I shall refer to them, was not in the area of shock, because I recognized them for what they were.

The greatest disservice we can do ourselves is not to be aware of our times and how things are changing.
