The Nib is an online daily comics publication focused on political cartoons, journalism, essays and memoir about current affairs. Founded by cartoonist Matt Bors in September 2013, The Nib is part of First Look Media.  Originally published on Medium, the platform underwent changes in May 2015 resulting in The Nib shifting focus and publishing less content regularly. In July 2015, Bors announced The Nib would no longer publish on Medium, and stated he would take the title elsewhere.  He self-published a collection of comics as a print anthology called Eat More Comics!: The Best of The Nib in September 2015.  In February 2016, First Look Media announced it would partner with Matt Bors to relaunch The Nib.  The site officially re-launched under First Look Media in July 2016.  In October 2016, First Look Media announced that Topic, the company’s multimedia storytelling studio, would produce The Nib’s first animated series, also called The Nib. The series’ first episode premiered in June 2017, and its second season launched in March 2018.  In 2016, The Nib received a nomination for a Will Eisner Comic Industry Award for Best Anthology.  In 2017, contributors Ted Closson, Sarah Winifred Searle, Eleri Harris, and Ben Passmore received nominations for The Cartoonist Studio Prize for Best Web Comic of the Year  and contributor Gemma Correll won a National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award.  Also in 2017, contributors Amanda Scurti and Mike Dawson received nominations for Ignatz Awards for Outstanding Online Comic.   Dawson also received a nomination in 2018 for a Will Eisner Comic Industry Award for Best Webcomic.  Contributor Bianca Xunise received an Ignatz Award in 2017 for her Nib comic "The Weight of Being Black in America".
