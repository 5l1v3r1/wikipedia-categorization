Pichhwai are devotional pictures found on cloth or  paper which portray Lord Krishna.   They originated in the Deccan,  India, and the villages of Aurangabad and Nathdwara in Rajasthan state.  The purpose of Pichhwais, other than artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate.  The word Pichhwai stands for hanging at the back (Sanskrit word “Pichh” means back and “wais” means hanging). Pichhwai paintings are big sized paintings done on cotton cloth using natural colours and are hung behind the idol of Lord Shrinath Ji to depict his leelas.  Pichhwai have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors. The artists live mostly in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. Often a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skilful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist. Pichhwai are hung behind Srinathji's idol at Nathdwara temple.  Some prominent Pichhwai artists are Ghasi Ram Sharma, Gopilal Sharma, Narottam Narayan Sharma, Kanhaiyalal Sharma, B. G. Sharma, Reva Shankar Sharma, Dwarkalal Sharma, Bitthaldas Sharma, Bhuralal Sharma, Raghunandan Sharma, Rajaram Sharma, Ghanshyam Sharma, and Nitin-Nilesh Sharma.     The Pichhwai in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art was a gift of The Friends of Asian Art in 2003 and may be seen in Gallery 243. It is 97 5/8 x 103 1/8 inches (248 x 262 cm).
