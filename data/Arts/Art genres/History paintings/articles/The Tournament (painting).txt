The Tournament is a major 1812 painting by Pierre RÃ©voil, who presented it to the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon (which still owns it) sometime before 1815. It shows the final moments of a legend of Bertrand Du Guesclin, when he reveals his identity after competing anonymously in a tournament and beating all comers.
