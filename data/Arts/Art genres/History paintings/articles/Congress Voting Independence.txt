Congress Voting Independence is a painting by Robert Edge Pine showing the interior of Independence Hall, Philadelphia, and contains the portraits of most of the signers of the United States Declaration of Independence.  The artist worked on the painting from 1784 until his death in 1788.  The painting is unfinished.  It currently is held in Independence Hall, Philadelphia.   Most of the portraits can be identified.   The central figures, left to right, are John Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert R. Livingston, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, and Benjamin Franklin (seated).   In the foreground on the left is Samuel Adams of Massachusetts and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania (wearing white).  Above Samuel Adams is Robert Treat Paine of Massachusetts and above him is Dr. Benjamin Rush of Pennsylvania.  Immediately to the left of Samuel Adams is Samuel Chase.  Above Robert Morris wearing dark is Benjamin Harrison.   On the extreme right of the painting, from right to left, are Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island, Rev. John Witherspoon, Caesar Rodney of Delaware, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, Charles Carroll of Maryland (seated in foreground), John Morton of Pennsylvania, an unidentified signer, Richard Henry Lee (leaning over the table), and John Hancock (seated erect). An engraving based on the painting was made by Edward Savage in 1801, who finished the unpainted portraits.
