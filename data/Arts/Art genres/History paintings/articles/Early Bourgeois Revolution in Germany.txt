It spans 14 metres (46 ft) by 123 metres (404 ft) and depicts a circular panorama of the Battle of Frankenhausen, fought on 15 May 1525 during the German Peasants' War. The painting has more than 3000 characters.  The painting is the main attraction of the Panorama Museum, built specifically to host it, in Bad Frankenhausen, Thuringia. The painting was commissioned in 1976 by the Ministry of Culture of East Germany. It was finished in 1987.  The canvas was woven in one piece at the textile factory in Sursk, the Soviet Union, and weighs 1.1 tons. Tübke dedicated 480 workdays to the painting and used a total of 90,000 tubes of paint.
