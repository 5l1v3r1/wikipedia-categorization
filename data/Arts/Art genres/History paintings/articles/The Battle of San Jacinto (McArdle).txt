The Battle of San Jacinto refers to at least two paintings by Henry Arthur McArdle, depicting the Battle of San Jacinto. One version, measuring approximately 8 feet (2.4 m) by 14 feet (4.3 m),  is installed in the Texas Senate chamber of the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas.  A smaller oil painting, measuring 5 feet (1.5 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), was discovered in late 2009; this version is not a copy or study for the monumental painting in the Capitol.
