The Walking Artists Network (WAN) is an international network dedicated to walking as a critical and artistic practice; it reflects the growth and increased interest in walking art.    It is based at the University of East London's Centre for Performing Arts Development and contains a network of over 500 members from across the globe, though predominantly based in the United Kingdom.  WAN originated in late 2007 when a small group of artists in central London invited ‘all those who are interested in walking as a critical spatial practice’ to its first meeting.  It was further developed in  2011 through a successful Arts and Humanities Research Council bid, which provided funding for international development of the network.  This enabled it to open up to a wider membership, develop a website and fund the Footwork research group.  WAN currently runs the Step by Step seminar series at the University of East London, bringing together artists and academics to discuss ideas around walking, and maintains an active email discussion community through JISCmail. In 2014 the Walking Artists Network collaborated with Airspace Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent, to produce The Walking Encyclopaedia (2014) a gallery exhibition and online archive of walking practices that includes more than 150 walking practitioners and artworks. In 2015, a collection of walk suggestions, experiences, techniques and case studies by members of the Walking Artists' Network was published by Triarchy Press with the title Ways to Wander.
