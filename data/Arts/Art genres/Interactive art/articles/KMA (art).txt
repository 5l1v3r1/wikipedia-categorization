KMA is a collaboration between media artists Kit Monkman and Tom Wexler (UK). KMA's work is primarily focused on the use of projected light to transform spaces and the interactions of people within those spaces.  The idea of people gathering after dark to enact and / or watch a drama or ritual lies deep inside us and our ancestral history. It is surely one of the oldest, simplest and most essential of human responses to our fate. KMA’s work seeks to explore this impulse in the context of the modern city. By combining sophisticated interactive technologies with an emotional narrative the work choreographs pedestrian’s movement; it builds, sustains, and develops complex, physically networked, relations between the body, the individual, the crowd, and the city. KMA are best known for large scale public interactive works that use projected light and motion tracking technology to create immersive digital 'playgrounds' in existing public spaces. 'Flock' - based on 3 sections of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake - typifies this approach, and was presented at Trafalgar Square, London as a co-commission by the Institute of Contemporary Arts and The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Congregation (2010) was commissioned to represent the UK Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo.
