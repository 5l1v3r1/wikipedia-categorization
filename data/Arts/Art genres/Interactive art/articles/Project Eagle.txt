Project Eagle is an interactive art demo of a colony on mars, it is not a game in the conventional sense.  It was created by Blackbird Interactive Inc. in January 2017 for presentation at the 2017 D.I.C.E. Summit. In Project Eagle the Mars base titled "Eagle Base" is located at the foot of Mount Sharp, Aeolis Mons, in Quad 51 of Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater. This is near the site of the Curiosity Rover landing. Curiosity's landing site is marked with a plinth in Project Eagle.  Project Eagle was built in the Unity (Game Engine) and utilizes design elements similar to that of the RTS game Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, including the sensors manager view and camera systems. The terrain from project eagle was generated using radar data from NASA's HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Project Eagle is set in 2117 in a hypothetical future after the first human colonists arrive on Mars in the year 2034    Project Eagle was presented on stage at D.I.C.E. 2017 by NASA’s Dr. Jeff Norris, and BBI’s CEO Rob Cunningham and CCO Aaron Kambeitz.  The talk took place directly after the conference keynote speech by Jeffrey Kaplan from Blizzard Entertainment "We wanted to publicly exhibit a project that shows what this medium could do for inspiring space exploration.” -Jeff Norris
