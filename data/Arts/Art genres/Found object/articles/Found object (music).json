Their use in such contexts is as old as music itself, as the original invention of musical instruments almost certainly developed from the sounds of natural objects rather than from any specifically designed instruments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The use of found objects in <a href=\"/wiki/Modern_classical_music\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Modern classical music\">modern classical music</a> is often connected to experiments in <a href=\"/wiki/Indeterminacy_in_music\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indeterminacy in music\">indeterminacy</a> and aleatory music by such composers as <a href=\"/wiki/John_Cage\" title=\"John Cage\">John Cage</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen\" title=\"Karlheinz Stockhausen\">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, although it has reached its ascendancy in those areas of popular music as well, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Ambient_music\" title=\"Ambient music\">ambient</a> works of <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Eno\" title=\"Brian Eno\">Brian Eno</a>. In Eno's influential work, found objects are credited on many tracks. <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The ambient music movement which followed Eno's lead has also made use of such sounds, with notable exponents being performers such as <a href=\"/wiki/Future_Sound_of_London\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Future Sound of London\">Future Sound of London</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Autechre\" title=\"Autechre\">Autechre</a>, and natural sounds have also been incorporated into many pieces of <a href=\"/wiki/New-age_music\" title=\"New-age music\">new-age music</a>.\n</p><p>Found objects have occasionally been featured in very well known pop songs: \"You Still Believe In Me\" from the <a href=\"/wiki/Beach_Boys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beach Boys\">Beach Boys</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pet_Sounds\" title=\"Pet Sounds\">Pet Sounds</a></i> features bicycle bells and horns as part of the orchestral arrangements.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Einst%C3%BCrzende_Neubauten\" title=\"Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten\">Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten</a> became known for incorporating a wide range of found objects in their percussion gear. A more recent example of found objects being used as percussion instruments is <a href=\"/wiki/Shawn_%22Clown%22_Crahan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan\">Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan</a> from the <a href=\"/wiki/Nu_metal\" title=\"Nu metal\">nu metal</a> band <a href=\"/wiki/Slipknot_(band)\" title=\"Slipknot (band)\">Slipknot</a>, who beats a beer keg with a baseball bat to the beat of the song. <a href=\"/wiki/The_Dodos\" title=\"The Dodos\">The Dodos</a> also played a garbage bin as a part of their percussion gear. <a href=\"/wiki/Wall_of_Voodoo\" title=\"Wall of Voodoo\">Wall of Voodoo</a> drummer <a href=\"/wiki/Joe_Nanini\" title=\"Joe Nanini\">Joe Nanini</a> would commonly use pots and pans instead of conventional drums. Many <a href=\"/wiki/Street_musician\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Street musician\">street drummers</a> perform with empty plastic baskets. \n</p><p>The band <a href=\"/wiki/Neptune_(band)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neptune (band)\">Neptune</a> uses VCR-casings, scrap metal and all kinds of other found objects to create <a href=\"/wiki/Experimental_musical_instrument\" title=\"Experimental musical instrument\">experimental musical instruments</a>. Also other builders like <a href=\"/wiki/Yuri_Landman\" title=\"Yuri Landman\">Yuri Landman</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Partch\" title=\"Harry Partch\">Harry Partch</a> (his famous cloud chamber bowl instrument), <a href=\"/wiki/Pierre_Bastien\" title=\"Pierre Bastien\">Pierre Bastien</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Iner_Souster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Iner Souster\">Iner Souster</a> often incorporate found material in their works.\n</p><p>The use of found objects in music takes one of two general forms: either objects are deliberately recorded, with their sound used directly or in processed form, or previous recordings are <a href=\"/wiki/Sampling_(music)\" title=\"Sampling (music)\">sampled</a> for use as part of a work (the latter often being referred to simply as \"found sound\" or \"sampling\"). With the improvement and easy accessibility of sampling technology since the 1980s, this second method has flourished and is a major component of much modern popular music, particularly in such genres as <a href=\"/wiki/Hip_hop_music\" title=\"Hip hop music\">hip hop</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Found_object_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Experimental_musical_instrument\" title=\"Experimental musical instrument\">Experimental musical instrument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sampling_(music)\" title=\"Sampling (music)\">Sampling (music)</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Found_object_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See \"The Music of Man\", <a href=\"/wiki/Yehudi_Menuhin\" title=\"Yehudi Menuhin\">Y.
