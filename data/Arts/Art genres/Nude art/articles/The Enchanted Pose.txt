The Enchanted Pose is a 1927 painting by Ren√© Magritte  depicting a side-by-side pair of identical female nudes in a bare interior. It has been lost since the 1930s.   In 2013, technicians examining Magritte paintings using x-ray fluorescence discovered fragments of the composition concealed under two compositions Magritte painted in the 1930s. Sometime between 1927 and the mid-1930s, Magritte had cut the painting into pieces and recycled the canvas, to be painted over. In 2016, a third fragment was identified under a painting entitled The Human Condition in the Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery. In 2017, it was announced that the fourth and final fragment was found under his work God is not a Saint, located in a museum in Brussels
