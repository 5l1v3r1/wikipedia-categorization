Nude With Dressing Gown is a 1967 painting by Australian artist John Brack. The painting depicts a nude woman putting on a dressing gown. Unusually for a Brack nude, the painting is a not a formal sitting; instead the subject is "caught ... in a more private moment as she modestly dons a gown".   If his subject was not glowing with an almost fluorescent, irradiated green, this would be one of Brack's most sensual pictures. His model is lithe, adorned with a fashionable 1960s-style bob. She is far from Rubenesque, but the twist of hip is distinctly feminine. ... But any sensuality is counterbalanced by Brack's garish colouration.The work is part of the Joseph Brown Collection at the National Gallery of Victoria.
