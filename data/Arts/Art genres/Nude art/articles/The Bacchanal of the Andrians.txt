The Bacchanal of the Andrians is an oil painting by Titian. It is signed "TICIANUS F.[aciebat]" and is dated to 1523â€“1526.  The painting is now held at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but it was commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este for his Camerini d'alabastro ('chambers of alabaster') in Ferrara.  The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating Bacchus and Venus, the gods of wine and love. The Bacchanal of the Andrians has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it.
