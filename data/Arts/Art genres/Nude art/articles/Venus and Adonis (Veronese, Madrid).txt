Venus and Adonis is a painting by the Italian late Mannerist artist Paolo Veronese, executed in 1580, now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.  The original painting was enlarged in the upper border in the 18th century. This added section was removed in a restoration (c. 1988) so the work recovered the horizontal format. The painting's subject is taken from Ovid.  It portrays the hunter Adonis sleeping in Venus' lap. In front of her is Eros, with a sighthound. Cupid is portrayed while trying to quench the dog's desire to hunt, as Venus had forecast that Adonis would die during a hunt.  In the background is a lively landscape, with a green- and blueshaded sky. The Prado also has a Venus and Adonis by Titian.
