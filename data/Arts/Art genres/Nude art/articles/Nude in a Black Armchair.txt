Nude in a Black Armchair (Nu au Fauteuil Noir) is a painting by Pablo Picasso. Painted on March 9, 1932, a time at which Picasso lived in Boisgeloup outside Paris,  it is the first and largest of a series of paintings Picasso completed that year of his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter.  The art critic Richard Lacayo cites the painting as an example of the creative give-and-take between Picasso and Henri Matisse, in which Picasso "borrowed Matisse's voluptuous curves as a sign for pleasure and his use of black to intensify pink".  Former Museum of Modern Art curator William Rubin deemed it a "squishy sexual toy,"  and other critics have described a theme of fecundity being mutually displayed by both the female figure and the plant.    In 1999 it was bought by Les Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, for $45.1 million.
