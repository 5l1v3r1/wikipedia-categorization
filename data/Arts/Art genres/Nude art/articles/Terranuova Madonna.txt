The Madonna with Child, St. John and a Child Saint is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, who finished it around 1504â€“1505.  It is also known as Madonna Terranuova as it belonged to the Italian Dukes of Terranuova, from whom it went to Berlin's Staatliche Museen, where it can still be seen, in 1854.
