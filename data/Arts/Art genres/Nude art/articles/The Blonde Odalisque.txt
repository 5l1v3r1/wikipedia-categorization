The Blonde Odalisque or Resting Girl (French - Jeune fille allongée, Jeune fille couchée or L'Odalisque blonde) is the title of two paintings by François Boucher. The first dates to 1751 and is now in the Wallraf–Richartz Museum in Cologne, whilst the second was produced in 1752 and is now in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Both their subjects are thought to be Marie-Louise O'Murphy, mistress of Louis XV for three years. They belong to the odalisque genre.
