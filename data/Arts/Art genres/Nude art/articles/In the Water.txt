In the Water (French: Dans l'Eau) is an oil on cradled panel painting of a skinny dipping young woman by Eugene de Blaas. This painting is the only nude picture created by de Blaas, as all his other subjects are fully clothed.  It is 78.4 cm high and 44.5 cm tall.  The painting depicts a naked young woman standing up to mid-calf in water, leaning forward, looking down at a school of tiny fish.  She has a rosy complexion, and her curly, dark brown hair is tied back. She is watching the fish swim around her naked body, not fearing the fish see her sensitive private parts. Although there is no sun in the composition, golden light shines through the cloudy sky and reflects on the water. There is land in the background, with a patch of greenery to the right. The artist signed his name and the date (1914) on the lower-left corner of the composition in dark ink. Eugene de Blaas was born into an  Austrian family of  artists.  Eugene's brother Julius von Blaas was a painter,  Karl von Blaas, his father was  a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, and also a painter and sculptor.
