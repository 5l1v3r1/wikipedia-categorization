The Last Sitting is a book and photo shoot of Marilyn Monroe by  photographer Bert Stern.  The photo shoot was commissioned by Vogue magazine in late June 1962,  taking place over three daily sessions, just six weeks before she died. Bert Stern first published The Last Sitting in 1982.  The book included a large number of the over 2,500 images that Stern had shot, including contact sheets with images Monroe had disliked and crossed out.  In the book, Stern recounted being enchanted by Monroe until a near-intimate encounter after the second day of shooting; he then realized that she was deeply troubled.  In 2008 Stern shot recreations of the images used by Vogue — with actress Lindsay Lohan as the model—for the February 25, 2008 issue of New York.
