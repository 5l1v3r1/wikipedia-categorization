The Bacchante is a painting by Gustave Courbet, produced between 1844 and 1847. The painting's title relates the work to images of Bacchantes from Greco-Roman mythology and to Renaissance paintings and sculptures on that subject. It is one of Courbet's earliest surviving works, from when he was still under the influence of nudes by the old masters such as Corregio and his Venus, Satyr and Cupid. Another female nude by Courbet from around the same time is Female nude sleeping by a stream (Detroit Institute of Arts). In 1914 it was sold by the art dealers Frederik Muller & Cie of Amsterdam. Until 1968 it was in the Van Nierop collection, before passing to the Lefevre Gallery in London, from which it was acquired by doctor Gustav Rau for the foundation he was founding in Cologne . In 2011 the musée Courbet put on an exhibition showing the links between the sculptor Auguste Clésinger and Courbet, who were very close friends - these links were especially seen between Clésinger's 1847 marble work Woman Bitten by a Serpent and Courbet's The Bacchante. .
