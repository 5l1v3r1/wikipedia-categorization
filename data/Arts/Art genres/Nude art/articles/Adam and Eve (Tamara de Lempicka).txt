Adam and Eve (Italian: Adamo ed Eva) is an oil on panel painting by a Polish Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka. It was completed in 1932 and is a religious subject based on the Art Deco style. The painting is 116 by 73 centimeters, and is housed in a private collection. Lempicka was fond of repeating certain interesting stories about the creation of Adam and Eve. The inspiration for this painting arose when a professional female model took a break to eat an apple. Lempicka asked her to hold the pose and started to sketch. She then invited a policeman who was making his rounds in the streets to pose for Adam.
