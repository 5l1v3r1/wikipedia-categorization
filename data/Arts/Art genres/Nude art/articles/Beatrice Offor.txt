Beatrice Offor (1864-1920) was a British painter. She is primarily known for portraits; often of an esoteric nature. Offor was born in 1864 in Sydenham, Kent  and trained at the Slade School of Art in London,  where she became a close friend of Moina Mathers.  In 1892 she married William Farran Littler, an artist and sculptor.   Much of her work consisted of representations of  heads of young women. A report published in  1907 said that: the famous "Offor Heads" are known the world over. Indeed, it may  be said that Miss Beatrice Offor is one of the most popular artists of the day, her pictures are  eagerly sought after, and publishers vie with one another for the honour of giving her works to  the public. Her paintings were shown regularly at the Royal Academy of Arts. She often used her sisters as models, often painting brides  and nude women.  She also painted portraits of  Joseph Howard MP and Sir Ralph Littler, KC.  She painted a copy of Perugino's Virgin and Child for Tottenham Parish Church.  For some time she was based in Chelsea   – the Royal Academy catalogues give an address in the King's Road from 1899  – but following her second marriage  to James Philip Beavan, a fruit importer, in 1907,  she moved to Bruce Grove, Tottenham, in North London. She suffered a nervous breakdown in 1919, and died on 7 August 1920 from injuries sustained after falling from a window.  A verdict of suicide while of unsound mind was returned at the inquest.  Almost 40 of her paintings are held in the collection of the Bruce Castle Museum, Tottenham; they include portraits of young women, local dignitaries, and a  woman believed to be the novelist 'Ouida'.  Her portrait of Sir Ralph Littler is in the Middlesex Guildhall Art Collection.  Destiny The Rosary Circe Miss B.S. The Crystal Gazer
