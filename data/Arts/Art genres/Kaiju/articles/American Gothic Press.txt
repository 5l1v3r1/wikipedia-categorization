American Gothic Press is an American comic book imprint of Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine. Established in the spring of 2015,  it focuses predominantly on the Kaiju, Sci-Fi, fantasy, and horror genres, reflecting Honorary Famous Monsters Editor-in-Chief Forrest J Ackermanâ€™s love for all things monstrous and mysterious. AGP officially launched in June 2015 with Gunsuits, a 4 issue science fiction mini-series. In 2016, AGP obtained the license for Irwin Allen's classic TV series Lost in Space and published adaptations of the previously unseen teleplays written by Carey Wilber.
