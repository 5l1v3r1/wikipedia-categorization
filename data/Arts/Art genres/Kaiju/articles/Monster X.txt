Monster X (モンスターエックス?, Monsutā Ekkusu), also known as Keizer Ghidorah (カイザーギドラ?, Kaizā Gidora), is a kaiju that first appeared in Toho's Godzilla: Final Wars (2004). Although Monster X is a similar species to King Ghidorah, the two are not the same and have separate trademarks, owing to the drastically different abilities between them. Monster X is a powerful opponent capable of using various attacks to overpower his foes. He can fire destructive beams from his eyes, utilise telekinesis to levitate and throw enemies around, and summon vast amounts of energy to transform. As Keizer Ghidorah, he can fire gravity beams from all three of his heads, choke foes using his necks, and drain energy from his opponent by biting them. Keizer Ghidorah also displays very large amounts of durability, being capable of defending against Godzilla's attacks seemingly relentlessly, and only being defeated by the Keizer powers given to Godzilla by Ozaki (a Keizer-human mutant). On Keizer Ghidorah's level of power, Godzilla is able to take down his foe. Monster X is 120 meters tall and Keizer Ghidorah is 140 meters tall.
