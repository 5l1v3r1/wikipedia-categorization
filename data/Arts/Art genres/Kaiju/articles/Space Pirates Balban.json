Cruel and violent but at the same time a great strategist and expert warrior who became immortal thanks to a Star Soul Jewel created by Daitanix, using the monster to gather a crew by offering them long life. Zahab's left hand is missing, as a result of the battle sustained with the first generation Ginga Red three thousand years earlier. He has replaced it with a cannon integrated hook. As a result, Zahab has a grudge against those who take the mantle of Ginga Red, including Ryouma. Hearing the death of an underling does not seem to affect him, but deep inside he suffers in private. Eventually, having known of Shelinda's death, Zahab can not take it anymore and falls apart in grief. In the final battle he uses the castle to take control of the Earth Demon Beast, but Zahab is forced to flee from his castle when it is destroyed by Bull Taurus. After losing the Earth Beast, Zahab fights and beats the tar out of the Gingamen, until Ginga Red and Black Knight use their fire ability to destroy his Star Soul Jewel. He is then killed by the Black Knight's Black Chop, the Gingamens' Galaxy War Radiance, and finally by Super Armor Shine Ginga Red's Beast Fire Flash attack as the final blow. He is later resurrected by Gregory, only to be killed once again by the Gingamen in the Galaxy Lights armor in <i>Seijuu Sentai Gingaman vs. Megaranger</i>.\n</p><p>Zahab is voiced by <a href=\"/wiki/Hidekatsu_Shibata\" title=\"Hidekatsu Shibata\">Hidekatsu Shibata</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u67f4\u7530 \u79c0\u52dd</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Shibata Hidekatsu</i>)</span>, who previously voiced Daimaoh in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ninja_Sentai_Kakuranger\" title=\"Ninja Sentai Kakuranger\">Ninja Sentai Kakuranger</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gregory\">Gregory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Space_Pirates_Balban&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Gregory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Captain Gregory<span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u30b0\u30ec\u30b4\u30ea\u8266\u9577</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Guregori-kanch\u014d</i>, <i>Gingaman vs. Megaranger</i>)&#32;<sup id=\"cite_ref-Gregory_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Gregory-2\">&#91;Note 2&#93;</a></sup></span> is an old friend of Zahab's who came to Earth to revive the Balban, with the aid of Hizumina, Dr. Hinelar's second \"daughter\".

A warrior with a sword and shell-themed armor, Shelinda had romantic feelings for Budoh though never forgave him for saving her life sometime in the past. During the Sutoiji incident, Shelinda destroys Hayate's flute before later attempting to stop him from making a new one. After finding him as Sutoiji is defeated, Shelinda duels Ginga Green with it ending with her forearm scarred as she vows a vendetta on him to the point of not allowing her own comrades to deny her killing Hayate. The most anxious to see Daitanix revived as her position of Steerwoman was pointless without Daitanix to steer often going to the aid of a Majin in order to speed along the revival. Shelinda is eventually killed in a final duel with Hayate in episode 49, where only her sword remained, to which the Yartots deliver it to Zahab to inform him of Shelinda's death. The sword itself was later destroyed along with Zahab's castle.

Prior to Sambash named acting general, Bucrates supported his niece Iliess in taking on the position from the start. While Budoh was acting general, Bucrates felt humiliated by the general after his numerous attempts to upstage Budoh. He proceeds to conspire with Iliess to frame Budou so she can become acting general. Though it seemed they got away with it, it turned out Zahab knew of the plot yet allowed Bucrates to remain until Iliess' death.

His Majin are based on insects. 3,000 years ago, Bull Black had come to Earth to hide the Galaxy Lights and Sambash cornered him in order to learn where they were hidden. Bull Black gave him the key of an empty chest and a fake location in Cape Kagerou, with Sambash keeping this information from Zahab. Being the first general chosen to revive it, Sambash attempts to find ways of providing energy for Daitanix to revive. After continuous failures to revive Daitanix and defeat the Gingamen, Sambash decided to go after the Galaxy Lights by first having Neikaa open up the cave at Cape Kagerou where the box containing the lights was hidden. Unable to open the entrance without an Earth user, Sambash has Gurinjii assume Hyuga's form to trick Ryouma into fetching it for him. As Gurinjii is destroyed by Gingaioh, heavily wounded from his fight with Ginga Red, Sambash opens the box to use the Lights of Ginga on himself to even the odds. However, finding it empty and with nothing to lose, a crazed Sambash climbs onto his bike to run over Ginga Red. In the process, after being hit by Ginga Red's attack, Sambash drives off a cliff as his motorcycle explodes, destroying both itself and him.

He possesses the Girasame sword, with which he can perform his \"Girasame Cruel Sword\" attack. Budoh has a strong sense of honor and loyalty that even Zahab recognized despite being unpredictable. His Majin are traditional Japanese <a href=\"/wiki/Samurai\" title=\"Samurai\">Samurai</a> culture and sea creature based. Budoh was always well-mannered and thanked his fallen Majin, who called him \"My Grand General\". He takes over the search for the Galaxy Light to revive Daitanix after Sambash dies, using a scroll of potential hosts that might contain the Light. With only one entry left, with his life endanged, Budoh sends his most powerful servant, Dotoumusha, to retrieve the Galaxy Light with success. However, Budoh is set up by Bucrates and Iliess to be made as a treasonous cur wanting the Light for himself. Placed in the brig, unable to perform <a href=\"/wiki/Seppuku\" title=\"Seppuku\">Seppuku</a> for an act he never even did, Budoh escapes to clear his name and kill the Gingamen to reclaim the Galaxy Light.

Her majin are based around entities from different cultural mythologies.

Having become impatient with waiting, Iliess conspired with her uncle Bucrates to depose Budoh so she can become the new active general. Having succeeded, Iliess intended to revive Daitanix through various forms of sorcery and mass sacrifices so she can obtain the riches Zahab offered for the monster's resurrection. However, after losing the Koseijuu, Iliess is given additional incentive to revive Daitanix when Zahab decides to reduce her earnings for each day she fails her objective.

In battle, Daitanix possesses powerful jaws, his tail is extremely muscular, and he can fire powerful blasts of energy from his mouth. By attaching his castle to Daitanix's back, Zahab was able to control him, destroying and absorbing stars throughout the Milky Way. The goal of the Balban is the resurrection of Daitanix which was still in a state of lifelessness after the seal was broken in the earthquake. The plan finally succeeds when Iliess' lifeforce is absorbed by him. It results in the monster's heart beating and Battobas eventually gathered enough energy to fully revive him by having Degius act as a conduct for a massive amount of energy from a passing Asteroid. When finally revived, he easily defeated Super Armor Shine Gingaioh even with Giga Rhinos and Giga Phoenix, but his body decays during the fight as his back where the Balban castle stood had gotten too far rotten, so the Balban leave the monster to die. After the Gingamen and Black Knight damage his back in the following battle he is overpowered by Bull Taurus armed with the Knight Axe, double-teaming Giga Phoenix and Giga Rhinos, and then finally killed by Super Armor Shine Gingaioh.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Earth_Demon_Beast\">Earth Demon Beast</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Space_Pirates_Balban&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Earth Demon Beast\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Earth Demon Beast<span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u5730\u7403\u9b54\u7363</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Chiky\u016b Maj\u016b</i>, 44-50)</span> was the result of a piece of Daitanix's flesh ending up within the Earth itself upon being destroyed, feeding on the life of the planet. The Balban then decides to make him the new host of their castle. However, having just been born, the Earth Demon Beast was still in an immature state, so Battobas attempts to give him the <i>Extreme Growth Extract</i> eventually succeeding with the monster now fully grown but at the cost of his life. At full size, he possessed immense brute strength, could breathe fire, and was able to fire deadly bursts of energy from his claws. During the battle, Ryouma focuses on using his Earth element of fire so they could destroy the Earth Demon Beast without the risk of creating a new Demon Beast. Having attached the castle to him, Zahab confronts Gingaman, increasing the Earth Demon Beast's fighting abilities. The Earth Demon Beast puts up an excellent fight, to which Hyuuga uses up most of Bull Taurus' power to destroy Zahab's castle and fight Zahab elsewhere to give the others a fighting chance. After a hard battle, the beast is killed by a sustained burst of fire from Super Armor Shine Gingaioh after gaining a power boost from Giga Rhinos and Giga Phoenix, which incinerates his body in the process.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ghelmadix\">Ghelmadix</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Space_Pirates_Balban&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Ghelmadix\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Demon Beast Fortress Ghelmadix<span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u9b54\u7363\u8981\u585e\u30b2\u30eb\u30de\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Maj\u016b Y\u014dsai Gerumadikusu</i>, <i>Gingaman vs. Megaranger</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-Ghelmadix_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ghelmadix-12\">&#91;Note 12&#93;</a></sup>)</span> is the second red-colored Daitanix that belongs to Gregory.
