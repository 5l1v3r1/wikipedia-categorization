However, deciding to take the planet by force when their demands are not met, Baranoia's first wave of attack was thwarted by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Airforce_Overtech_Hardware\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United Airforce Overtech Hardware\">Ohrangers</a>.

Seeing himself as a god, Bacchus Wrath believes he has all right to conquer the world and make humans into his slaves. Very violent, tending to malfunction when he goes berserk, Bacchus Wrath does not tolerate failure nor sentimentality in his minions' programming.\n</p><p>In episode 33, it is later revealed Bacchus Wrath had secretly been rebuilding some of his Machine Beasts and managed to harness the infinite energy from the Earth's magma. When his rebuilt Machine Beasts passed through the magma shower they became Super Machine Beasts. Thanks to the Ohrangers' \"Trojan Horse\" plan with the Blocker Robos, this facility was destroyed preventing any more Super Machine Beasts from being created. In episode 34, he grows in size and power thanks to the power of a space metal dark sword which, according to him, was the only one of its kind in the universe, which he intended to use on the Ohrangers.

After revising the Baranoia Constitution, Article 2, Bomber the Great challenged Buldont to a duel for the Empire which he won and banished Buldont, proclaiming himself \"Bomber the Great the 1st,\" the new Emperor of Baranoia. At first, being new to the <a href=\"/wiki/Throne\" title=\"Throne\">throne</a>, Bomber the Great did his best at leading the Empire, trying to win Hysteria's affections and to kill the Ohrangers in the process, but consistently met with failure in both prospects, exiling Hysteria as a result.
