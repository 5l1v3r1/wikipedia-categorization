Senki was created when the Org Heart merges the remnants of the three Highness Dukes, fulfilling the prophecy of the \"Last Org Advent\". Stronger than Hyakkimaru was, Senki overpowers the Gaorangers, destroying all the Power Animals and bringing the Animarium down. He then attacked the city, but the Power Animals are all revived and countless others arrive to help. All the Power Animals are able to destroy Senki's physical body, while the Gaorangers contributed their energy to Hyakujuuken and used it to destroy Senki's heart so he could not revive himself.

He once attempted to obtain Gao Elephant's Gao  Jewel while it was dormant, but is forced to leave both it and the scroll behind when the orb left painful scars on his palms. He attempts to have the Dukes find ideal Orgs with his detached eye, only to anger the Org Master with his repeated failure. Seeking to redeem himself, Shuten attempts to destroy the Gaorangers by blocking the Gao Soul, knocking them around in human form while the Dukes take their Gao  Jewels. But at the last second, Pyochan restores the Gao Souls, with Gao Red defeating Shuten with Gao  Mane Buster. Refusing to accept defeat, Shuten takes TsueTsue's staff to perform the Highness Duke secret technique to enlarge at full power. But Shuten was not much for the SoulBird-powered Gao Muscle and Gao King. Though he survives the Super Animal Heart, Shuten is killed by the newly awakened Highness Duke Org Ura, who drains and absorbs all his power. Shuten is later resurrected, fighting Gao Red and Gao Yellow in a vain attempt to protect the red idol on the mountain that powers the barrier protecting the Matrix.

Obsessed with collecting beautiful items, he is the one who awakens Rouki. He uses a magic <a href=\"/wiki/Mirror\" title=\"Mirror\">mirror</a> to see things at a distance and carries a fan as his weapon. Through Rouki, Ura gains the four Power Animal orbs that Rouki had stolen and uses them to create Chimera Org. However, the Org is beaten by the newly transformed Gao Silver, who also kills Ura. But Ura's crown survived and, after TsueTsue used it to briefly become Onihime, Ura regenerates himself from it. From there, Ura cultivates the displaced Thousand-Year Evil, making it stronger with each host he creates for it. Soon enough, Ura captures Gao Silver to have him reabsorb the evil power. However, after Gao Silver rejects it, Ura is able to absorb it to evolve into a more powerful form, Ultimate Form Ura<span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u30a6\u30e9\u7a76\u6975\u4f53</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Ura Ky\u016bkyokutai</i>, 30 &amp; 31)</span>, which was his actual plan from the beginning. With his new power, Ura kills the Gaorangers with only Kakeru and Shirogane the sole survivors of the first attack. The two Gaorangers try to fight Ura on their own until the others provide Gao Red with the Falcon Summoner and Gao Falcon as Gao God revives them to aid in forming Gao Icarus, engaging in a dogfight before purging his body of the Thousand-Year Evil with Icarus Dynamite. Restored to normal, Ura is wounded by Gao Silver who destroys his crown so Ura would be killed for good by the Gaorangers' Hyakuujuuken. Ura was later resurrected, fighting Gao Silver and Gao White in a vain attempt to protect the green idol in the forest that powers the barrier protecting the Matrix.

He is ravenous with an appetite for anything within reach, using a <a href=\"/wiki/Knife\" title=\"Knife\">knife</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fork\" title=\"Fork\">fork</a> as his weapons. He treats the Duke Orgs like dirt, painfully transferring their powers to certain Orgs. His very plan from the beginning was severing the ties between the Gaorangers and the Power Animals, using Kurushimemas Org to obtain Kakeru's G-Phone to implant a bug-extension of him into it to pinpoint Gao 's Rock. But he had an alternate motive in getting Tetomu, whose cooking he obsessed for. He almost got Tetomu as his chef, sacrificing TsueTsue in the process while removing the Gaorangers from the picture, if the Power Animals hadn't drove him away. Refusing to accept defeat, Rasets decides to complete his plan on <a href=\"/wiki/Christmas\" title=\"Christmas\">Christmas</a>, with his bug destroying the G-Phones prior to the fight while he smashes the G-Brace Phone. Rasets then ingests his creation to assume giant size to destroy Gao 's Rock. But before Rasets can eat the gang, the Power Animals arrive, with Gao Deers restoring the Gaorangers' transformation devices. Gao Muscle and Gao Hunter managed to wound the Highness Duke Org enough for Gao Kentarus to land the deathblow. Rasets is later resurrected as the leader of the other Highness Duke Orgs, fighting Gao Black and Gao Blue in a vain attempt to protect the blue idol within the lake that powers the barrier protecting the Matrix.

He manages to force the Gaorangers to dance until Tetomu and Shirogane momentarily negate the Org's music with their own until an infuriated Rasetsu attacks them, but Gao Deers arrives to fully break the spell. Though killed by the Gaorangers' Hyakujuuken, TsueTsue revives Magic-Flute Org, who uses his music to drown out Juuou Swords' call until Gao God emerges and destroys the Org's flute with his arrow, allowing Gao Icarus to be summoned and kill Magic-Flute Org.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Juggling\" title=\"Juggling\">Juggling</a> Org<span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u30b8\u30e3\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30aa\u30eb\u30b0</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Jaguringu Orugu</i>, 37)</span>: The younger brother of Yabaiba, whose aid he enlists to gain praise from Rasetsu, forming Team Circus. They make a few vain attempts to attack Kai, Gaku, and Futaro at an amusement park in the guise of mascots until they capture Futaro. Gao Blue and Gao Yellow are forced to take a beating until the others arrive and save Futaro. Though killed by Hyakujuuken, Yabaiba uses TsueTsue's staff to revive his brother, who has a hard time fighting Gao King on his own until Yabaiba uses the Org Seeds to aid Juggling Org.

Once force-fed Org Seeds, he succeeds in taking control of Gao King, Gao Muscle Striker, Gao Elephant and Gao Giraffe, with Gao Hunter Justice immune. Futaro arrived in time to free Gao King Sword &amp; Shield and Gao Muscle Striker from Animal Tamer Org's control, who uses their attacks to destroy his control whip.

Furthermore, he tricked Kakeru into thinking the Orgs are tired of fighting. As a result, Kakeru befriends the Org by giving him his G-Phone. Once the trap is sprung, Kurushimemas Org assumes his true form and attacks the other Gaorangers until Kakeru manages to break free before using the Hyakujuuken with extreme prejudice on the Org. TsueTsue revives Kurushimemas Org, who died at the hands of Gao Icarus in spite of aiding Rasetsu in his master plan.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/New_Year%27s\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Year&#39;s\">New Year's</a> Org<span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&#32;(<span lang=\"ja\">\u6b63\u6708\u30aa\u30eb\u30b0</span><span style=\"display:none\">,</span>&#32;<i>Sh\u014dkatsu Orugu</i>, 46)</span>: A strange Org Yabaiba encounters two weeks after Rasetsu's death.
