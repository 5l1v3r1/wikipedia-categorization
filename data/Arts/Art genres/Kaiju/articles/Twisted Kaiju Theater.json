The figures are now shot against a white background, then superimposed with <a href=\"/wiki/Chroma_key\" title=\"Chroma key\">Bluescreen</a> technology over a different background such as a sprawling cityscape. Special effects like <a href=\"/wiki/Dutch_angle\" title=\"Dutch angle\">Dutch angles</a>, explosions, <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_blur\" title=\"Motion blur\">motion blurs</a>, and Wild Takes have also been added to give a more cinematic and dramatic look.

Most of the time the plots are vehicles to deliver political, social, racial or religious <a href=\"/wiki/Satire\" title=\"Satire\">satire</a> while involving one or two fight scenes. Storylines included countless invasions (such as a takeover by <a href=\"/wiki/Yahoo!\" title=\"Yahoo!\">Yahoo!</a>), a quest to reshoot a lost episode, and even a journey into Shin-Goji's urinary tract to destroy his kidney stones akin to <i><a href=\"/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage\" title=\"Fantastic Voyage\">Fantastic Voyage</a></i>.\n</p><p>Due to TKT godzilla being inspired by Sean McGuinness, real life events which occur are sometimes reenacted in <i>TKT</i>, even having one of the characters being shown as the creator of <i>Twisted Kaiju Theater</i>, breaking the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourth_wall\" title=\"Fourth wall\">fourth wall</a>. Comics such as these range from many different topics, such as playing video games<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> or visiting <a href=\"/wiki/Fan_convention\" title=\"Fan convention\">comic conventions</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On April 24, 2009, a notice went up claiming that Twisted Kaiju Theater's website Neomonsterisland.com was under new ownership, and that the series was apparently coming to an end, though there is a listing for an April 27 update on the site at which time the new management claims it will explain what the change in ownership for the website will entail, both for the website and for TKT. The 1500th update to the series depicted a mock-image complete with non-working hypertext links of a 'page not found' page that often comes up when a website has ceased operations.\n</p><p>A short time later, the website was updated, changing its name to 'Once and Future' and then shortly thereafter to 'The Once and Future Tyrant'.\n</p><p>This turned out to be the latest in a series of epic storylines featured in the webcomic, intended to reintroduce the character of Tyrant, a recurring villain who had first appeared in the strip as the president of <a href=\"/wiki/Yahoo!\" title=\"Yahoo!\">Yahoo!</a>, who had returned and hatched an elaborate plan to take control of the island for himself, a recurring mission for the character. In this storyline, it was revealed that Tyrant is actually the elder brother of Shin-Goji, who had once ruled the island, but when their mother the Japanese sun goddess <a href=\"/wiki/Amaterasu\" title=\"Amaterasu\">Amaterasu</a> asked him to help end the 'War of the Monsters' and he refused, she set events in motion so that Shin would break away from Tyrant (whom she saw Shin as being too dependent upon) and become the leader of the island. She had expected Tyrant to understand. He did not. Instead, he lost his mind, apparently forgetting his true powers, and went on to become a supposed homosexual individual and later the president of Yahoo! He still harbored a desire to reclaim his birthright even in this insane state, which resulted in his numerous attempts to reclaim the island only to be rebuffed by Shin-Goji and the Toxic Pirates numerous times.\n</p><p>The storyline revealed that a previous epic storyline entitled Final Invasion was set up by Tyrant in order to distract Shin from realizing that Tyrant had managed to con him into essentially signing away the rights to the island by slipping in a falsified service provider document. Tyrant was revealed as Shin's elder brother and forced Shin to relinquish control of Neo Monster Island to Tyrant. As a direct result of the supposed 'change in management', the website itself became part of the storyline, allowing it to break the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourth_wall\" title=\"Fourth wall\">fourth wall</a>. Many fans were at first fooled by the events, while others- namely those on the online forums for the webcomic- were quick to point out that Sean McGuinness, the creator of the series, was still named on the website as the owner of the website and its copyrights.\n</p><p>Tyrant's plan was revealed to be twofold in its goals. Firstly he would regain what he saw as his birthright, and secondly to humble Shin, briefly exiling him from the island. Tyrant and Shin have since reconciled- for the moment at least- and went on a rescue mission to save the Toxic Pirates, who had gone missing during the storyline.\n</p><p>The strip has once again taken on the name Twisted Kaiju Theater, with Shin once again taking a starring role.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Characters\">Characters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twisted_Kaiju_Theater&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Characters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Toxic_Pirates\">Toxic Pirates</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twisted_Kaiju_Theater&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Toxic Pirates\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<dl><dt>Shin-Goji</dt>\n<dd>Small, loud, opinionated, vulgar, and more often than not insensitive and politically incorrect, Shin-Goji somehow leads the uncharted land mass known as Neo-Monster Island. The webcomic focuses mostly on his antics and the trouble he gets himself into. He works at a popular copy and shipping shop. Shin-Goji spent much of the last year absent from the strip except for flashbacks, has only recently returned to the series as a regular character. He has been replaced as the leader of Neo-Monster Island by Tyrant, who was recently revealed to be, in addition to a recurring villain, Shin-Goji's older brother. The two have since reconciled, though Tyrant has stated that if Shin still needs a 'rival' that he is more than willing to fulfill the role of being his 'Resident Evil'.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></dd>\n<dd>The figure used is an SD <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Heisei_era_(daikaiju_eiga)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Heisei era (daikaiju eiga) (page does not exist)\">Heisei</a> Godzilla from the Super Collection set, and is also a representation of the author, McGuinness, inserting himself into the comic.

After a conflict with some of the artists who submitted work to his site as gift art, he required all artists to include a disclaimer stating all fanworks sent to <i>Neo-Monster Island/Twisted Kaiju Theater</i> would be regarded as gifts unless otherwise specified, and K-Girls and other such characters would remain the intellectual property of their respective creators. Legal ownership of actual images is given to Shin-Goji/Sean McGuinness with the provision the creators would be consulted in the event of use beyond showcasing. Fanworks submitted by the artists and authors are treated with utmost care and respect, and in return the creators agree they no longer possess sole interest in the managing of their creations.\n</p><p>Artists have started donating Kaiju Girl artwork more rapidly than McGuinness can upload to the site, to the point where Wednesdays are usually devoted to updating and cleaning up the Kaiju Girl archives.\n</p><p>On May 18, 2009, The Kaiju Girls have been removed from the primary website of Twisted Kaiju Theater, and have their own website devoted entirely to them, called DaiKaiju Academy.\n</p><p>As of July 7, 2011, the Kaiju Girls have been removed from the site in their entirety, each character now being maintained solely by their original creators.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Archive_CDs\">Archive CDs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twisted_Kaiju_Theater&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Archive CDs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>McGuinness sold archive CDs of his work at cost. Volume I contained the first 500 episodes, two CD exclusive cartoons, an exclusive G.I.N.A. picture by manga artist Thor Thorvaldson, and the complete Kaiju Girl archive as of March 17, 2006. Volume II was released in March 2007, and also featured exclusive comics and Kaiju Girl artwork.
