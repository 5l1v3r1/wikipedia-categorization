The Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (Slovene: Gledališče sester Scipion Nasice) was founded on October 13, 1983, with a founding manifesto (The Sister Letter). The manifesto set this theatre group a time frame of operation – four years – and described its stages from formation to self-destruction. The Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (1983-1987) constituted – along with Laibach and IRWIN groups – one of the three pillars of the Neue Slowenische Kunst retrogarde movement. Within the retrogarde movement, theatre research engaged in the relation between religion, art and state. It focused on rituals and the function of spectacle in theatre and in the function of spectacle the state. The founders of the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre were Eda Čufer, Dragan Živadinov and Miran Mohar. The retrogarde production of events, as it was announced in the manifesto (The Sister Letter), incorporated an external manifestative part (actions) and an internal creative part (operations): - external part: The Appearance (1983), The Resurrection (1984) and The Self-Destruction (1987) - internal part: three stages of transformation - The Illegality (1984), The Exorcism (1985) and The Retro-Classic (1986) In 1987, the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre performed self-destruction.
