St Sebastian is a 20th-century painting by the Bohemian artist Bohumil Kubišta.  Saint Sebastian was a Christian matryr. It is held in the National Gallery in Prague. The picture is painted on in oils on canvas and has dimensions of 98 x 74,5 cm. It is one of the most important works of Bohumil Kubishta, member of the pre-First World War Czech avant-garde. Unlike traditional Christian interpretations of the theme of suffering of the Christian martyr, Bohumil Kubishta combines cubist forms and expressiveness, but integrates spiritual strength.
