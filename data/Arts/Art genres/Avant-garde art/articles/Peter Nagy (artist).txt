Peter Nagy (born Bridgeport, Connecticut, 1959)  worked as an artist and exhibited his work throughout the United States and Europe during the 1980s. He also was a gallery owner of Gallery Nature Morte in New York City at the same time. He now represents Indian contemporary artists. With artist Alan Belcher opened Gallery Nature Morte in East Village, Manhattan, New York City in 1982.   Peter Nagy was a part of a generation of the East Village artist-gallery owners who established a small and rough but trendy avant-garde alternative to the established SoHo art scene.  The gallery was open for six years, until 1988.  They combined Conceptualism and Pop Art exploring the relationship between the art and the commodity.  In 1992, Nagy moved to New Delhi where he revived Gallery Nature Morte in 1997.  The Indian artist Subodh Gupta has said of him: "he has fresh eyes and has provided a platform for contemporary artists."   Richard Milazzo, "Peter Nagy: Entertainment Erases History.
