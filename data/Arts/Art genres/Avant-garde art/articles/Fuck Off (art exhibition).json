It took place in the Eastlink gallery as well as a warehouse at 1133 West Suzhou River Road. The show included both emerging and famous artists and totaled 48 in all. The work displayed in Fuck Off was raw and unedited, which was the polar opposite of the Shanghai Beinnale that was open at the same time. The entire purpose of the show was to truly show the Chinese government exactly how \"uncooperative\" these artists could be, and that is evident in the closing line of the exhibition catalogue: \"Perhaps there is nothing that exists 'on-site,' but what will last forever is the very uncooperativeness with any system of power discourse.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-ai13_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ai13-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In an interview by Chin-Chin Yap, Ai Weiwei was asked if the actual exhibit of \"Fuck Off\" had a concept similar to the Black, White, and Gray Cover Books he published. He went on to say that after the books were finished, there were a lot of interesting art works happening, and the people in his life continually recommended creating an exhibit with the theme of the books. His opinion was not that the show was really that good because it was organized so quickly, and he knew that there was a possibility that it could be shut down by the police and having all the work confiscated. Luckily, he said that the artists involved were \"cooperative and interested and the attitude was there.\" In a very eye-opening statement, Ai goes on to say that \"maybe Fuck Off was most important because of what it represented.\" Those involved had a clear thought about the image they wanted to give to Chinese institutions and Western curators, institutions and dealers, and that thought was:\"We had to say something as individual artist to the outside world, and what we said was 'fuck off'.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-ai51_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ai51-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One of the most famous examples from this exhibition was the performance of \"Eating People\" by <a href=\"/wiki/Zhu_Yu_(artist)\" title=\"Zhu Yu (artist)\">Zhu Yu</a>. It consisted of a series of photographs of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. One picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the <a href=\"/wiki/FBI\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"FBI\">FBI</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland_Yard\" title=\"Scotland Yard\">Scotland Yard</a>. The piece's cannibalistic theme was controversial in Britain when Zhu's work was featured on a <a href=\"/wiki/Channel_4\" title=\"Channel 4\">Channel 4</a> documentary exploring Chinese modern art in 2003. In response to the public reaction, Zhu Yu stated, \"No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it\". Zhu has claimed that he used an actual fetus which was stolen from a medical school. \n</p><p>Many influential artists of the current <a href=\"/wiki/Chinese_art\" title=\"Chinese art\">Chinese art</a> scene took part, many of whom have since been included in international exhibitions, catalogues and television documentaries. \n</p><p>The exhibition was closed by the Shanghai police before its scheduled closing date.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A catalog of the exhibition has been published, a black book with the simple title \"FUCK OFF\" on its cover.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Feng_Boyi_on_.22Fuck_Off.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Feng_Boyi_on_&quot;Fuck_Off&quot;\">Feng Boyi on \"Fuck Off\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fuck_Off_(art_exhibition)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Feng Boyi on &quot;Fuck Off&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Feng Boyi felt as though Chinese artists were just working for foreigners because the early Chinese contemporary art shows were being held in foreign countries.

In today's art, the alternative is playing the role of revising and criticizing the power discourse and mass convention. In an uncooperative and uncompromisable way, it self-consciously resists the threat of assimilation and vulgarization. A cultural attitude that stands against the power and makes no compromise with vulgarization is, together with independent individual experiences, feelings and creations, is what extends the pursuit and desire of art for spiritual freedom \u2013 an everlasting theme. Such a cultural attitude is obviously exclusive and alienated. It aims at dealing with such themes as cultural power, art institution, art trends, communications between the East and West, exoticism, post-modernism and post colonialism, etc.\n</p><p>'Fuck Off' emphasizes the independent and critical stance that is basic to art existence, and its status of independence, freedom and plurality in the situation of contradictions and conflicts. It tries to provoke artist's responsibility and self-discipline, search for the way in which art lives as \"wildlife\", and raise questions about some issues of contemporary Chinese art.\n</p><p>Allegory, directing questioning, resistance, alienation, dissolution, endurance, boredom, bias, absurdity, cynicism and self-entertainment are aspects of culture as well as features of existence. Such issues are re-presented here by the artists with unprecedented frankness and intelligence, which leaves behind fresh and stimulating information and traces of existence.\n</p><p>In this exhibition, participants and their works are not objects of choice, identification and judgment. They have no quest for any kind of excuse. Group identification and inner difference are both so fully respected and encouraged that it may be doubted if there is the necessity for the presence of audience.\n</p><p>An on-site ambiguity and uncertainty forces one to seek meaning and satisfaction only in the form of proliferation and postpone. Perhaps there is nothing that exists 'on-site', but what will last forever is the very uncooperativeness with any system of power discourse.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-fo_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-fo-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_Works\">Notable Works</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fuck_Off_(art_exhibition)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notable Works\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i><b>Accidental Dropping</b></i><sup id=\"cite_ref-fo_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-fo-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Ai Weiwei is so concerned with Chinese history as a whole and the fact that people are not playing the proper role in learning about it or preserving it.
