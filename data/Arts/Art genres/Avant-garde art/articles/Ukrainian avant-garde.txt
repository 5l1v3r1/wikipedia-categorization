The term "Ukrainian Avant-Garde" was first introduced by Parisian art historian Andr√©i Nakov for the exhibition Tatlin's dream, arranged in London, 1973, where works of international standard by avant-garde Ukrainian artists Vasyl Yermylov and Alexander Bogomazov were presented to the Western audience. Famous artists were mentioned by Nakov, such as Kazimir Malevich, David Burliuk, Vladimir Tatlin, Aleksandra Ekster, who were connected to Kiev, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odessa by birth, education, national traditions and identity. The Ukrainian avant-garde artists also include the outstanding Alexander Archipenko, whose art was influenced by impressions of his native land, Trypillya culture, archaic Cuman prairie statues, mosaics of Saint Sophia Cathedral, and St. Michael's reliefs and peasant pottery colours.
