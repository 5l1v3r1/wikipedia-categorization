Handkerchief of Clouds: A Tragedy in Fifteen Acts (French: Mouchoir de Nuages) is a French-language Dadaist play by Romanian-born author Tristan Tzara.  Tzara described it as an "ironic tragedy" or a "tragic farce", composed of 15 short acts, each with an accompanying commentary, with a strong influence from "the serialized novel and the cinema."  Its action, he continues, should be staged on a platform in the centre of a box-like room "from which the actors cannot leave"  It was first staged on 17 May 1924 at the Théâtre de la Cigale in Paris.  The play was Tzara's last Dada production.
