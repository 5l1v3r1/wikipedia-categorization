The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution was the name of the political party set up by the Berlin Dada movement following World War I. The Berlin Dadaists supported the Spartacist rising of 1918-1919, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. When this revolution was crushed and Liebknecht and Luxemburg killed, the Dadas continued to seek power through democratic means. They were present at the Congress of the Weimar Congress, but still remained relatively powerless. In the year 1919 in Berlin, the group outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical communism.
