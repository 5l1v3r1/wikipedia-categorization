 The Dada Manifesto (in French, Le Manifeste DaDa) is a short text that was written on July 14, 1916 by Hugo Ball and read the same day at the Waag Hall in Zurich, for the first public Dada party.  In this manifesto, Hugo Ball expresses his opposition to Dada becoming an artistic movement. He stayed active in the Dada movement for another six months, but the manifesto created conflict with his friends, notably Tristan Tzara.
