Jacques Vaché (7 September 1895 – 6 January 1919) was a friend of André Breton, the founder of surrealism. Vaché was one of the chief inspirations behind the Surrealist movement. As Breton said: He was born on 7 September 1895 in Lorient, France, and died in Nantes on 6 January 1919 from an overdose of opium. He was known for his indifference and for wearing a monocle.
