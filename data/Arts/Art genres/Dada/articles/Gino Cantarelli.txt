Gino Cantarelli (Mantova, 1899 â€“ 1950) was an Italian Dadaist poet and painter of the early 20th century. He was associated first with Futurism, then with Dada. He often wrote his poems in French. From 1917 to 1920 he published the journal Procellaria, together with Aldo Fiozzi, a journal which combined Futurist and Dadaist tendencies. In 1920 the two editors joined with Julius Evola to publish Bleu, which was devoted entirely to Dada and which appeared in Mantua like the earlier journal.
