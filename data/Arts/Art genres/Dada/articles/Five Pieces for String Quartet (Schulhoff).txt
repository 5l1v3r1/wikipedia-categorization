The "Fünf Stücke für Streichquartett" or "Five Pieces for String Quartet" is a suite of five musical pieces by Czech composer Erwin Schulhoff.  The work contains stylistic connections to both a baroque dance suite and to other pieces composed by the Second Viennese School. The piece premiered on 8 August 1924 at the International Society for New Music Festival in Salzburg, and was dedicated to Darius Milhaud.  Each of the pieces evokes a different style of dance music:  Robin Holloway described the work as a "parody and debunking", similar to later works by Aaron Copland and Benjamin Britten.
