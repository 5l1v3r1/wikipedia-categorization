Office in a Small City is a 1953 painting by the American realist painter Edward Hopper.  It depicts a man sitting in a corner office surveying the landscape outdoors. The style is reminiscent of many of Hopper's works in that it depicts loneliness and beauty in a uniquely stark yet pleasing fashion.  It is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
