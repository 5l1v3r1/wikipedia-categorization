The Gouden Bocht on the Herengracht in Amsterdam, Seen from the West is a 1672 painting by the Dutch artist Gerrit Berckheyde (1638-1698). As its title suggests it shows a section of the Herengracht canal. Between 1933 and 1940 it was bought from an art dealer by Jacques Gaudicicker. It was purchased by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1980 for 310,000 guilders - it is still in the Rijksmuseum collection.
