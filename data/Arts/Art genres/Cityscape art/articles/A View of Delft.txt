A View of Delft, with a Musical Instrument Seller's Stall is a 1652 painting by Carel Fabritius. It is an oil painting on canvas of 20.9 by 35.7 cm (8.2 by 14.1 in) of a cityscape of Delft. The work has been in the collection of the National Gallery in London since 1922. The unusual perspective suggests that it may have been intended to have been displayed on a curved surface at the back of a perspective box. Fabritius is documented to have worked on these.   The view is of the Nieuwe Kerk facing the Town Hall and several still-extant houses at the point where the Oude Langendijk canal meets the Vrouwenrecht.
