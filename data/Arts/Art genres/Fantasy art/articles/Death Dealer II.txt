Death Dealer II is a fantasy painting by American artist   Frank Frazetta.  It depicts a muscular, armor-clad warrior with a horned helmet, wielding a large broadaxe. His face is obscured by the helmet, except for glowing red eyes. The image eventually led to spin-offs of varying merchandise, novels, statues, and a comic book, published by Image Comics. This is the second painting in what would be a total of four Death Dealer works by Frazetta. The Death Dealer painting series spawned a novel franchise in 1988, written by author James Silke, and published by Tor Books. Four novels were published in total, the first of which used the Death Dealer II painting for its cover. American director and producer Robert Rodriguez is one of the largest private owners of Frank Frazetta original artworks. In 2014 Rodriguez opened a museum in Austin, Texas,  displaying the original Death Dealer II painting, among many others.
