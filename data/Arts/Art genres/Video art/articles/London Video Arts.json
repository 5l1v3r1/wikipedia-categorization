The idea for London Video Arts (LVA) was initiated by <a href=\"/wiki/David_Hall_(video_artist)\" title=\"David Hall (video artist)\">David Hall</a> and founded in summer 1976 by a group of video artists including Roger Barnard, David Critchley, <a href=\"/wiki/Tamara_Krikorian\" title=\"Tamara Krikorian\">Tamara Krikorian</a>, Brian Hoey, Pete Livingstone, Stuart Marshall, <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Partridge\" title=\"Stephen Partridge\">Stephen Partridge</a>, John Turpie and Hall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-andrews_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-andrews-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"London_Video_Arts\">London Video Arts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=London_Video_Arts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: London Video Arts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>LVA aimed to provide video artists with support promoting their work, beginning as Stuart Marshall later put it as \"a pressure group\" for the autonomy of video as an art practice, with its own systems of exhibition and distribution. This is apparent in the first LVA catalogue, produced in 1978, which places emphasis on \"artists\u2032 work on videotape, video performance and video installations\u2026\". LVA acted as a regular screening venue for video art with a distribution library that provided access to a selection of tapes by international as well as British artists working in the field. In the early days there were no production facilities, due in part to the unwieldy and expensive nature of the technology then available. It was not until the early 1980s that LVA managed to secure sufficient funding to set up a permanent office, employ staff and set up their first production facility, this was heralded in LVA\u2019s second 1984 catalogue by David Critchley. \"We now have, in March 1984, an organisation which is \u2018up and running\u2019 in all of the areas it was intended to cover by its founder members back in 1976\u2026LVA can now offer facilities for the production and post-production of video programmes, can exhibit those programmes through its own shows series, and can distribute them worldwide with the help of this catalogue.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Knight_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Knight-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>As video art became more established throughout the 1980s LVA changed to accommodate the different concerns which emerged across the decade. The phenomenon of <a href=\"/wiki/Scratch_video\" title=\"Scratch video\">Scratch video</a>, for example, and the rise of the music video and cheaper and more available video \"camcorder\" technology produced a different aesthetic less connected to the modernist concern for medium specificity which first characterised video. In 1988, after some disagreements with <a href=\"/wiki/John_Cleese\" title=\"John Cleese\">John Cleese</a>\u2019s video production company (Video Arts) over company names, LVA became London Video Access, and indeed its production facilities were in great demand at the expense of its distribution library during this period, showing a shift towards broadcast and the independent video sector and away from the arts. By 1994 another change of title to London Electronic Arts reflected developments in video technology towards a more dispersed digital media and again reasserted the artist led nature of the organisation. A further move to Lottery funded premises at the Lux Centre in 1996 also provided a purpose built gallery space to accompany distribution and production facilities. Under the pressure of funding cuts, and perhaps also determined by the increasingly blurred distinctions which now existed between video and other moving image media, LEA merged with the <a href=\"/wiki/London_Film-Makers%27_Co-op\" title=\"London Film-Makers&#39; Co-op\">London Film-Makers' Co-op</a> with whom it shared a venue under the collective name of the Lux Centre, continuing until the eventual demise of the Centre in 2001.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Knight_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Knight-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Its extensive library of video tapes, attesting to the rich history of British and international video art which LVA first helped to promote, continues to find distribution through <a href=\"/wiki/LUX_(UK_film_company)\" title=\"LUX (UK film company)\">LUX</a>, as do many of the artists originally involved.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=London_Video_Arts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/LUX_(UK_film_company)\" title=\"LUX (UK film company)\">LUX (UK film company)</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=London_Video_Arts&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-andrews-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-andrews_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bergpublishers.com/?tabid=2189\">\"A History of Video Art\"</a> Chris Meigh-Andrews (Berg 2006), p. 56.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Knight-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Knight_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Knight_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/books/view-Book,id=4748/\"><i>Reaching Audiences Distribution and Promotion of Alternative Moving Image</i></a> Julia Knight and Peter Thomas, Intellect (2012), pp. a 116;
