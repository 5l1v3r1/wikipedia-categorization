Razrusenye   (2011) is a site-specific video installation by Genco Gulan.  Genco Gulan had knocked down three walls of Gallery Artist in Istanbul on 17 February 2011 and on 18th of February, gallery interior has started to be shown as artwork. The piece features footage of the artist breaking down the walls of the gallery. Razrusenye (destruction in Russian) is about recreation through demolition, as the viewer witnesses the artist turning the art gallery itself into an art piece by breaking it down.
