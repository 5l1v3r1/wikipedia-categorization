Erotica was an adult, consumer exhibition held each November at Olympia, London, UK. A mainstream ‘lifestyle show’ aimed primarily at women and couples, visitors were encouraged to celebrate or re-kindle their relationships with goods and services aimed to enhance their love lives. Erotica's organisers have claimed[when?] that it is the world's largest lifestyle show "for freethinking adults who are comfortable with their sexuality". Erotica cancelled its 2014 show and has since shut its doors Exhibitors, including many small- to medium-sized companies and sole traders, offered: fashion, corsetry, lingerie, shoes, jewellery, art, photography, sculpture, adult toys, games, books, DVDs, furniture and romantic gifts. Popular, free entertainment includes: stage shows that run several times each day and are produced by London's Torture Garden; The Fantasy Boys' strip tease; entertainers that wander among the crowds; workshops and demonstrations (including glamour photography, bodycasting and burlesque classes); and a team of NHS sexual health advisors offering free advice, condoms and chlamydia testing. Erotica is keen to promote safe, respectful and responsible sex, and welcomes visitors of all persuasions – straight, gay and transgender.   Erotica's first show was at Olympia, London, in 1997  and has been an annual event there every November since then. Erotica Manchester had its first show at the G-Mex Centre in March 2003  but ticket sales were poor in 2005  despite attempts the previous year to attract visitors by having former Conservative Member of Parliament Neil Hamilton promote the event  and the organisers did not return. Erotica 2013 was held on 25-27 October 2013 at Tobacco Dock in London.
