Krishna and Radha in a Pavilion is an 18th-century Indian painting depicting the two Hindu deities Krishna and Radha engaged in sexual intercourse. The painting is the example of Pahari painting used in Gardner's Art Through the Ages:  "In Krishna and Radha in a Pavilion, the lovers sit naked on a bed beneath a jeweled pavilion in a lush garden of ripe mangoes and flowering shrubs. Krishna gently touches Radha's breast while gazing directly into her face. Radha shyly averts her gaze. It is night, the time of illicit trysts, and the dark monsoon sky momentarily lights up with a lightning flash indicating the moment's electric passion. Lightning is a standard symbol used in Rajput and Pahari miniatures to symbolize sexual excitement."
