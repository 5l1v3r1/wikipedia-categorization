  Ganga Devi (1928-1991) was an Indian painter,  considered by many as one of the leading exponents of Madhubani painting tradition.  She is credited with popularising the Madhubani painting outside India.  She was born in 1928 in Mithila in the Indian state of Bihar in a kayastha family and took to the traditional painting craft, specialising in the kachni (line drawing) style.  She travelled abroad with her art and was a part of the Festival of India in the United States,  which yielded a number of paintings under the title, America series, including Moscow Hotel, Festival of American Folk Life, and Ride in a Roller Coaster.  The Government of India awarded her the National Award for Crafts  and followed it up with the fourth highest civilian award of Padma Shri in 1984.
