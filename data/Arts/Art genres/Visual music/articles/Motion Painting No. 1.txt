Motion Painting No. 1 (1947) is a short animated film in which film artist Oskar Fischinger put images in motion to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no. 3, BWV 1048. The film was created by applying oil paint on acrylic glass. Fischinger filmed each brushstroke over the course of 9 months. In 1997, the film was selected for inclusion in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The Academy Film Archive preserved Motion Painting No. 1 in 2000.
