"Rainbow in the Night" debuted in December 2011, a song and music video written by New York-based filmmaker Cecelia Margules, a daughter of Holocaust survivors. Margules collaborated with producer and director Danny Finkelman.  Rainbow in the Night was described by Margules as the "first ever music video depicting the Holocaust." The video was created in order to raise awareness about the Holocaust. It follows the experiences of a Jewish family in Poland before World War II. Through the video, the dirty reality of life in the Krakow Ghetto is shown. The grim conditions become unimaginably worse when the family ends up being sent to a concentration camp. The video was filmed on location in Krakow, Poland and Majdanek concentration camp, also in Poland. Yaakov Lemmer partnered with the others to contribute to the project vocally and through acting. Lemmer's vocals tie the video together with emotional lyrics and a powerful voice.  The videos creators have expressed wishes that the video become "viral" in order to educate others, especially the current "fast-paced" contemporary generation.  The video can be freely accessed on YouTube.  Credits adapted from the liner notes of Rainbow in the Night
