Veejay is a free visual instrument and realtime video sampler for Linux released under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.  Veejay functions as a video tracker and editing tool, as well as a realtime video sequencer and effects generator that allows for live interaction. Additionally, the generated content can be recorded to disk for future use. The project was started in June 2002 by Niels Elburg, Matthijs van Henten and Dursun Koca with the objective to provide a tool that would allow the user to play the video like a piano (a visual instrument) and record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling). Veejay is not a traditional video editing application; The application aims for a high level of interoperability with other Audio/video applications through the use of Shared resources, Loop devices, various messaging protocols such as Midi, OSC and veejay's internal message system VIMS, but also through supporting third party modules such as Frei0r plugins and frameworks like Pure Data. It offers a wide range of video effects, a Video Keyboard for the video artist and it offers scripting capabilities for use in (automated) video installations. Veejay has separated the video processing core from the user interface, allowing the user(s) to control (multiple instances of) the application over the network.
