{"parse":{"title":"Clavilux","pageid":8900251,"revid":852796783,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Clavilux</b> is the term coined by the artist <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Wilfred\" title=\"Thomas Wilfred\">Thomas Wilfred</a> to refer to his mechanical invention that allowed the creation and performance of <a href=\"/wiki/Lumia_art\" title=\"Lumia art\">lumia</a>, which was Wilfred's term for <a href=\"/wiki/Light_art\" title=\"Light art\">light art</a>.\n</p><p>From <a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a>, Clavilux means \"Light played by key.\"\n</p><p>Wilfred built his first Clavilux, Model A, from March to May 1919.\n</p><p>While Wilfred intended the term to refer to any device that could be used to perform Lumia, the name Clavilux was not widely adopted by other artists working with light. As such the term is closely associated with Wilfred and his mechanical vocabulary. The only other artist known to have built a Clavilux is W. Christian Sidenius, who was an ardent admirer and later good friend of Wilfred's. Sidenius built a theatre behind his home to house his Clavilux and host Lumia recitals during the summer months.\n</p><p>Wilfred also built sixteen smaller home Clavilux models which he also called \"Clavilux Juniors.\" There are seven known to be extant, most of which are in private collections.\n</p><p>Two full-sized Claviluxii, Model E, (1924) and Model G (1936) were rescued in 2003. A 501(c)3 not-for-profit, Clavilux.org, has been formed to restore the Model E to working condition, and it plans on holding public recitals as soon as the machines are functional.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clavilux&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Color_organ\" title=\"Color organ\">Color organ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Visual_music\" title=\"Visual music\">Visual music</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Music_visualization\" title=\"Music visualization\">Music visualization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Oskar_Fischinger\" title=\"Oskar Fischinger\">Oskar Fischinger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Hallock-Greenewalt\" title=\"Mary Hallock-Greenewalt\">Mary Hallock-Greenewalt</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clavilux&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://Clavilux.org\">Website on history and restoration of Clavilux devices</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2163\nCached time: 20180914210628\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 15/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:8900251-0!canonical and timestamp 20180914210628 and revision id 852796783\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Visual_music"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Color organ"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Latin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Light art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lumia art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mary Hallock-Greenewalt"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Music visualization"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Oskar Fischinger"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Thomas Wilfred"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Visual music"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://Clavilux.org"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Clavilux","byteoffset":1288,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Clavilux","byteoffset":1414,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Clavilux","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5129636"}]}}
