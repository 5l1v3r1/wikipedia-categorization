Begone Dull Care is a 1949 visual music animated film directed by Norman McLaren and Evelyn Lambart. Using drawn-on-film animation, McLaren and Lambart paint and scratch directly onto film stock to create a visual representation of Oscar Peterson's jazz music. The film is produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Designated and preserved as a "masterwork" by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a charitable non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada's audio-visual heritage.  Winner of a Special Genie Award for experimental filmmaking. At the 1st Berlin International Film Festival it won the Silver Medal (Culture Films and Documentaries) award.  The Canadian electronic music duo Junior Boys named their 2009 album Begone Dull Care for the film, which was reported to have influenced its conception and creation.  McLaren opened the film with titles in seven different languages: English, French (Caprice en Couleurs), Spanish (Fantasía en Colores), Hindi (रंग बाहार; Raṅga Bāhāra), Italian (Capriccio a Colori), Russian (Красочная фанта́зия; Krasočnaja Fantázija), and German (Trübsal Ade!).
