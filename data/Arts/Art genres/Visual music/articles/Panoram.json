{"parse":{"title":"Panoram","pageid":5832437,"revid":820804965,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Panoram</b> was the <a href=\"/wiki/Trademark\" title=\"Trademark\">trademark</a> name of a visual <a href=\"/wiki/Jukebox\" title=\"Jukebox\">jukebox</a> that played music accompanied by a synched, filmed image (the effect being the equivalent of 1980s music videos) popular within the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> during the  1940s. The device consisted of a jukebox playing a closed-loop <a href=\"/wiki/16mm_film\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"16mm film\">16mm film</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Reel\" title=\"Reel\">reel</a> projected onto a glass screen.\n</p><p>The Panoram is now best known for the vast library of short, three-minute <a href=\"/wiki/Music_video\" title=\"Music video\">music videos</a> that were created for it. Called <a href=\"/wiki/Soundies\" title=\"Soundies\">soundies</a>, these films featured most of the great musical stars of the period, including <a href=\"/wiki/Duke_Ellington\" title=\"Duke Ellington\">Duke Ellington</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Count_Basie\" title=\"Count Basie\">Count Basie</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Cab_Calloway\" title=\"Cab Calloway\">Cab Calloway</a>. Many of the filmed interludes survive and are considered a priceless archive.\n</p><p>The Panoram was priced more than $10,000 in 2006 dollars. It was generally seen in bars, cafes, and upscale dancing establishments where they ran as a curiosity. Following <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, the device never recovered its previous popularity due to competition from <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a>.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Soundies\" title=\"Soundies\">Soundies</a> were printed backwards (mirror image) so that they would appear in a correct orientation when played in a Panoram machine. A Panoram was the size of a refrigerator and employed a series of mirrors to reflect the image from a projector onto a 27-inch, rear-projection, etched-glass screen in a tight, enclosed cabinet. The popular machines were first produced in 1939 by the <a href=\"/wiki/Mills_Novelty_Company\" title=\"Mills Novelty Company\">Mills Novelty Company</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chicago, Illinois\">Chicago, Illinois</a>, (which also made art-deco, fancy slot machines) and found their way into countless soda shops, taverns, bus and train stations and other public places across the nation. The specially made 16mm films ran in a continuous loop and stopped when a notch cut in the film allowed a micro switch to engage a step-back relay at the end of a Soundie. The patron then put another dime in the machine to run the series of eight 2- to 3-minute films again. The Panoram mechanics were housed in an Art Deco, high quality wood cabinet, the Soundies being 3\u00bd minute films that typically showed jazz and other musicians of the day, as well as dance troupes and other acts. With the beginning of World War II, production of the Soundies and Panoram machines was drastically reduced due to a wartime raw material shortage and the Mills Panoram's 1940 success quickly faded.\n</p><p>In the early 1940s, Al Donahue Band made 7 or 8 of the first \"Soundies\" at Radio City Music Hall, some of which are available on YouTube. \n</p><p>The basic concept behind the Panoram would be revived in the early 1960s with the <a href=\"/wiki/Scopitone\" title=\"Scopitone\">Scopitone</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Documentary\">Documentary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Panoram&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Documentary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2007 PBS produced a documentary about the Panoram called Soundies: A Musical History<sup><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.soundiestv.com/\">2</a></sup><sup><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nysun.com/arts/panoram-killed-the-radio-star/49783/\">3</a></sup>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Panoram&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.soundies.net/\">[1]</a> Soundies.net \u2013- History site with video clips</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.millspanoram.com/\">[2]</a>  Mills Panoram \u2013 A site for information and parts for the Panoram</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2271\nCached time: 20180918220708\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.013 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:5832437-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918220708 and revision id 820804965\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"nl","url":"https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panoram","langname":"Dutch","autonym":"Nederlands","*":"Panoram"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Visual_music"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Art_Deco"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Jukeboxes"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Music_videos"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"16mm film"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cab Calloway"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chicago, Illinois"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Count Basie"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Duke Ellington"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jukebox"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mills Novelty Company"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Music video"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Reel"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scopitone"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soundies"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Television"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Trademark"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World War II"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.soundiestv.com/","http://www.nysun.com/arts/panoram-killed-the-radio-star/49783/","http://www.soundies.net/","http://www.millspanoram.com/"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Documentary","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Panoram","byteoffset":2796,"anchor":"Documentary"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Panoram","byteoffset":3020,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Panoram","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q2108426"}]}}
