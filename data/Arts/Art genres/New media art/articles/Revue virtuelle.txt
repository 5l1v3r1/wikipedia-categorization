Revue virtuelle (1992-1996) was an exhibition project for early new media, virtual art technologies, computer graphics, virtual reality, hypermedia and digital art projects that was housed in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou during the years 1992 to 1996.  The Revue virtuelle also created a virtual "magazine" jointly created by the museum and the Centre de Création Industrielle, that addressed the issue of new technologies from the viewpoints of science, aesthetics, museography and education. These activities were documented in a bilingual CD-ROM entitled L'Actualité du Virtuel/Actualizing the Virtual, published in 1996.
