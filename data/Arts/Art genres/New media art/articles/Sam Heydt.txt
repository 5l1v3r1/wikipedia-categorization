Samantha "Sam" Heydt (born April 20, 1986) is an American social practice and recycled media artist.   Heydt was born and raised in New York City by the artist William Heydt.  After attending La Sorbonne, Cooper Union, University of Amsterdam, and University of Buenos Aires, ultimately earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communications, as well as a degree in Photography from Parsons New School for Design graduating summa cum laude.    In 2012, Heydt launched Jane Street Studio,  a photo-studio in the Meatpacking district of Manhattan.  The company has since expanded its focus from photography to design consultation and video work.  Heydt has undertaken non-profit work for developing countries,  including the 2014 production, Bulbul: Song of the Nightingale,  a feature-length documentary that sheds light on the longstanding tradition of child prostitution in the Banchara tribe of Madhya Pradesh, India.  Heydt has lived and worked in Paris, Venice, Amsterdam, Athens, Sydney, Udaipur and currently resides in Vienna.   With a background as a political activist and environmentalist, Heydt's work continuously examines different phenomenologies of our hyper-mediated society wherein "tabloids become history".   Her interest lies in semiology's role in the mutability of history, disillusionment of the social psyche and exploitation of a world increasingly reduced to a bottom line.      Heydt's work is exhibited internationally and sits in the permanent collection of a number of notable museums, including the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.
