Tomb paintings of Sindh are found mainly in the Shahdadkot tehsil of Qamber-Shahdadkot  in Sindh, Pakistan. During the Kalhora period (1680-1784 AD)  wall paintings became common. They often depicted folk tales,  scenes from rustic life, the  tribal chiefs and their battles.  The Jamali tombs Larkana and Qamber-Shahdadkot, are famous for the paintings, which depict the  romances of Sassui Punnhun,  Momal Rano, Suhni Mehar, Layla and Majnun and Noori Jam Tamachi.
