Hayd√©e (d. 2007) and Sahara (d. 2008) Scull, known as the Scull Twins or the Scull sisters, were Cuban-Chinese Folk-artists. They typically created humorous three-dimensional paintings and sculptures of Old Havana and Florida, using paper mache, wire and acrylic paint.  These now fetch high prices with collectors. They were referenced in a song entitled Scull Twins by Duncan Browne.
