Jim Denevan (born 1961) is an American chef and artist who creates temporary land art. He works with natural materials to create massive scale drawings in sand, ice, and soil. His sculptures are not placed in the landscape, rather, the landscape is the means of their creation.  Often aerial photography or video is needed to comprehend the final work. He is also the founder of *Outstanding in the Field, a traveling farm dinner series. March 2010, Denevan was commissioned by *The Anthropologist to create a large scale drawing on Lake Baikal. The drawing is the world's largest single artwork. A documentary of the journey and artwork called *Art Hard was released in 2011. The short version of the film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival and was also accepted at the Carmel Art and Film Festival, DocNYC Film Festival,  Milwaukee Short Film Festival and ION International Film Festival.
