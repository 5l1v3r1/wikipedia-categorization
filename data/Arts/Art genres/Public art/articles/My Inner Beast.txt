My Inner Beast is a series of one-ton heavy black concrete sculptures, created by the Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot. In November 1993 20 sculptures were erected in twenty cities across Europe without permission of the authorities.  The purpose of the sculptures was to put focus on the increasing intolerance and brutalization in Europe. This was seen in the growing racism, xenophobia and the persecution of minority groups.   In November 1993, the twenty one-ton heavy black concrete sculptures were erected in twenty cities across Europe within 55 hours, without the knowledge of the authorities. The sculptures created debate in political circles,  in the press and in the public. In several places a permanent position has been found for the sculpture that was a gift to each city. More than 100 volunteers contributed to the happening. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary Jens Galschiot and his staff initiated a search to find out what has happened to each of the 20 sculptures.  The fate of the Beasts varies quite a lot. In some cities the statue has been hidden away or even destroyed. All three sculptures set up in France have disappeared.  In other cities the Beast has found a prominent site. In Bonn it has even been incorporated in the German state’s art collection. The anniversary was celebrated during the European Social Forum 12–15 November 2003 in Paris where two Beasts participated in the big manifestation accompanied by Survival of the Fattest and 14 Hunger Boys.
