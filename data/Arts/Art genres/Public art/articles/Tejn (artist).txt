 TEJN (born 1976) is a pseudonymous Danish artist, who began his artistic work as a street artist in 2007 and occasionally exhibits contemporary art in galleries. TEJNs gallery sculptures typically demands a more extended effort to interpret, than his street art sculptures, which he often gives a layer of a more digestible nature, allowing it to communicate with an audience passing by on foot or bike. The highly symbolic works typically debate philosophy, politics or existentialism, suggesting a form of self-appraisal among the audience.  Based in Copenhagen, TEJN's street art has made its mark on most bigger European cities.  He is best known by his trademark: "Lock Ons"  which are site-specific sculptures or statues, typically welded in recycled iron and chained in the street without permission,  often mounted to urban furniture with a bicycle lock.  His second most preferred media is paintings on paper, pasted up with wheatpaste on a wall.   TEJN also makes installations,  stencil-art, and conceptual art.  TEJN finds metal scrap for his sculptures in urban areas and uses some of it in its original form. The rest is shaped and welded into figurative objects that express a narrative deadopen for interpretation.  The iron is later "given back to the street" as street sculptures, in the same areas where he originally collected the material. Iron sculpture Iron sculpture
