Lewin grew up in Maui and obtained her BA in Architecture and Computer Aided Design from the University of Colorado Boulder, later obtaining her M.P.S. degree in Interactive Design from Tisch School of the Arts.    Her most known work, The Pool, featured on Wired,  consists of over 200 LED-lit platforms that change colours ...according to pressure and speed changes elicited by viewers' interactions with the system.    Termed an "interactive light sculpture", where human interaction is necessary for its display, this installation has toured several countries.  Specializing in works that involve technology and human interaction, she often includes musical elements into her creations. For instance, other projects or hers include laser harps, where people elicit music via interrupting the laser arrangements.     According to the Boulder Weekly, Google commissioned Lewin to "create an Android app for tracking feedback between her innovations and the groups of people interacting with them".  Lewin, along with her Pool installation, was featured by the BBC News in May 2013.  Jen Lewin was co-founder of The Kitchen restaurants in Boulder, along with Hugo Matheson and Kimbal Musk.
