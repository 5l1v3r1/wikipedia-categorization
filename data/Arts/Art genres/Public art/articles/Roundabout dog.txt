A roundabout dog (Swedish: rondellhund) is a form of street installation that began in Sweden during the autumn of 2006 and continued for the rest of the year. There have been sporadic subsequent occurrences. The phenomenon consists of anonymous people placing homemade dog sculptures, typically made of wood (or sometimes plastic, metal or textile) in roundabouts. Occurrences were reported all over Sweden, and the phenomenon also spread to other countries, including Spain after it was mentioned on television.  Swedish tabloid paper Expressen even placed one at Piccadilly Circus.  The roundabout dogs started appearing in Linköping, Östergötland, Sweden after a sculptured dog that was part of the official roundabout installation Cirkulation II (English: Circulation II) by sculptor Stina Opitz had been vandalised and later removed. The original dog had been made of concrete,  and Opitz was planning to make a new version of it after the vandalism,  when someone placed a homemade wooden dog   on the roundabout. The dog was given a concrete dogbone  by another anonymous artist. Soon after the media reported these developments, roundabout dogs started appearing in various places around the country. In some smaller towns where there were no roundabouts, dog sculptures were placed in ordinary intersections with traffic islands. In April 2007 Bjorn Andersson started building roundabout dogs in his workshop south of Stockholm. His mission is to keep rondellhund at Philanthropic Street Art level and to give a moment of enjoyment to all people travelled by car. His dogs have been taken to Australia, the UK and the US.  In 2009, similar dogs appeared on some of the roundabouts in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.
