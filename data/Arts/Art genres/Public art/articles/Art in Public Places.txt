Art in Public Places (AiPP) is a common term for public art programs at the local government level (cities, counties).  Art in Public Places programs manage the selection, installation, and maintenance of public art.    The term does not refer to public art in general or to individual public artworks.  Art in Public Places programs are publicly administered, often overseen by public art review committees and permanent staff (Arts Coordinators).  Under the auspices of local government they may receive public funding as well as private funding.
