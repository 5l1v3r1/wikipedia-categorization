Albert Paris Gütersloh (born Albert Conrad Kiehtreiber; 5 February 1887 in Vienna – 16 May 1973 in Baden bei Wien) was an Austrian painter and writer. Gütersloh worked as actor, director, and stage designer before he focused on painting in 1921. As a teacher of Arik Brauer, Ernst Fuchs, Ruth Rogers-Altmann, Wolfgang Hutter, Fritz Janschka and Anton Lehmden he is considered one of the largest influences on the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism.
