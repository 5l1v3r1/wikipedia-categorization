He had one brother. Later his family moved to Tunbridge Wells in Kent. They were well off, successful in manufacturing. This gave Adamson some financial independence to achieve all he did during his life. He received a degree in Fine Art from Bromley School of Art in London (now part of  <a href=\"/wiki/Ravensbourne_(college)\" title=\"Ravensbourne (college)\">Ravensbourne College</a>). Subsequently he trained and qualified as a chiropodist, at his parents' behest as they wanted him to have 'a proper profession', concerned about his livelihood as an artist. He probably only saw a few patients \u2013 though his brass plate is in the Edward Adamson Archive at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wellcome_Library\" title=\"Wellcome Library\">Wellcome Library</a>: 'E.J.Adamson. M.B.A.Ch. Chiropodist' (a gift from his parents, but never hung). Then Adamson returned to a career in art, working as a graphic artist at a <a href=\"/wiki/Fleet_Street\" title=\"Fleet Street\">Fleet Street</a> advertising agency for the rest of the 1930s, while doing his own drawings and paintings, which he exhibited in both London and Paris.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> During <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, he was a <a href=\"/wiki/Conscientious_objector\" title=\"Conscientious objector\">conscientious objector</a>, serving as a medical orderly in the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps\" title=\"Royal Army Medical Corps\">Royal Army Medical Corps</a>, the Army happy to have him as a qualified chiropodist. He became interested in helping long-term hospital patients pass the time.\n</p><p>After the War, he volunteered to work with <a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Hill\" title=\"Adrian Hill\">Adrian Hill</a>, an artist who had coined the term \"Art Therapy\" in 1942 while a patient in <a href=\"/wiki/Sanatorium\" title=\"Sanatorium\">tuberculosis sanatoria</a>, teaching drawing and painting to his fellow patients, and, later, to hospitalised soldiers. At the time Adamson met him, Hill was working with the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Red_Cross\" title=\"British Red Cross\">Red Cross</a> Picture Library to loan and lecture on reproductions of paintings to patients in British hospitals to enhance their recovery. Adamson was in the group who first brought this programme to a <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_psychiatric_institutions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"History of psychiatric institutions\">long-stay mental hospital</a> - <a href=\"/wiki/Netherne_Hospital\" title=\"Netherne Hospital\">Netherne Hospital</a> \u2013 in 1946.\n</p><p>During his early visits to Netherne, Adamson was given several drawings by a man on a locked ward - JJ Beegan - made with the only materials he had, char from burnt matches and toilet paper.

Dax asked him to facilitate a new research art studio at Netherne, to investigate the role of art in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorder - a project maybe of its time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hogan_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hogan-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> This project was the post-war continuation of the 1930s research at the <a href=\"/wiki/Maudsley_Hospital\" title=\"Maudsley Hospital\">Maudsley Hospital</a> on art and psychosis (and <a href=\"/wiki/Mescaline\" title=\"Mescaline\">mescaline</a>) by the psychiatrists Eric Guttmann (1896\u20131948), Walter Maclay (1902\u20131964) and <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Reitmann\" title=\"Francis Reitmann\">Francis Reitman</a> (1905\u20131955) \u2013 the latter was Head of Clinical Research at Netherne from 1945.\n</p><p>The research art sessions were run single-handedly by Adamson from 1946 to 1950, and, according to Robertson, 689 people painted with Adamson in this period.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Robertson does not report how many works were created in this period, only referring to\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>\"<i>The number of paintings per patient showed extreme variation.

Initially Adamson worked inside the hospital in a committee room with up to forty patients at once, conducting at first two sessions, and, later, four per week. Another early location was a shower room, chosen by the nursing staff to be easy to clean afterwards. By 1948, when he was employed full-time, a studio was built in the hospital grounds for Adamson's own use. This building was a converted army hut, 48 feet (15 metres) by 16 feet (5 metres), and able to accommodate twenty people 'with comfort'. From 1948, Adamson also saw, for two hours each morning, a group of women, on a ward of the main hospital, most of whom had the diagnosis of schizophrenia, and who had all lived in Netherne for many years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1950, Dax lectured on and showed paintings from the early Netherne sessions (alongside works from 45 collections, including from five other British mental hospitals) at the influential \"<i>International Exhibition of Psychopathological Art</i>\", held at the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris during the First <a href=\"/wiki/World_Psychiatric_Association\" title=\"World Psychiatric Association\">World Congress of Psychiatry</a>.

Out of the 1946-1950 quasi-scientific 'experiments', Adamson established an open art studio, allowing people to come and paint freely: a radical act when those detained in the 'asylums' were living in bleak conditions, profoundly excluded from society, with minimum dignity, autonomy or even personal possessions. By 1970 he had 5 studios (including the army hut) in the grounds at Netherne, with a gallery for the Adamson Collection (see below), which at that time contained an estimated 60,000 works: he kept all the paintings, drawings, ceramics and sculptures created in the studios.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Creedy_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Creedy-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Among the artists he encouraged at Netherne were the painter <a href=\"/wiki/William_Kurelek\" title=\"William Kurelek\">William Kurelek</a> (1927\u20131977), the sculptor Rolanda Polonska (1923-1996 - Rolanda preferred Polonska, the Polish feminine spelling of her surname, but she is also known as Polonski and Polonsky), for both of whom he secured studios in disused rooms in the hospital; and the illustrator and engraver George Buday (1907\u20131990), for whom Adamson took over a summerhouse in the grounds of Netherne for his printing press. Kurelek came to Netherne from the Maudsley in November 1953 to work with Edward Adamson for 14 months. He gave the Adamson Collection three major paintings created while he was at Netherne: \"<i>Where Am I? Who Am I? Why Am I?</i>\", <i>\"I Spit On Life</i>\", and \"<i>The Ball of Twine and Other Nonsense</i>\".  About the last, completed shortly before he left hospital, Kurelek said, \"I have never really been mad. I was only fooling. I had you all on the end of a piece of string all the time!\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Adamson_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Adamson-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Polonska had been an artist before the onset of schizophrenia, but when Adamson first met her, she was mopping the hospital floors. For Polonska to practise her sculpture, Adamson had to persuade the hospital authorities to lift the restrictions on 'potential offensive weapons in the hands of mental patients' so she could have a hammer and chisel. In 1971 the <a href=\"/wiki/Arts_Council_of_Great_Britain\" title=\"Arts Council of Great Britain\">Arts Council of Great Britain</a> released a short film, \"<i>Rolanda Polonsky, Sculptor\"</i>. Polonska is filmed at Netherne, where she had already been living for 24 years, 'talking about her work, and the meanings that it has for her. Her art is deeply religious and personal, and she uses Christian themes in a refreshing and idiosyncratic way'. The film features, among other works, her masterpiece <i>Stations of the Cross</i>, which are in the Collection (along with several other sculptures and about 2000 sketches and drawings) but are still the original plaster casts, funding never found to cast them in bronze.\n</p><p>Adamson met his long-term partner and collaborator, the teacher and writer John Timlin (b. 1930), in 1953 at Timlin's production of Kenneth Woollard's play \"<i>Morning Departure</i>\" (1948). Timlin was working with 'emotionally disturbed' children in East London, and subsequently contacted Adamson about a series of drawings of apples by a boy, Tommy, who he was working with. Adamson visited the school, and met the children and looked at their paintings. Adamson and Timlin then worked together until Adamson's death. They wrote and lectured on art and mental health, and exhibited the Adamson Collection across the world, including Europe, Japan, Canada and the United States.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Art_therapy_in_the_UK\">Art therapy in the UK</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Adamson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Art therapy in the UK\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Adamson was the first artist employed in the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Health_Service\" title=\"National Health Service\">National Health Service</a>. He commenced work in 1946 at Netherne Hospital at an annual salary of just \u00a31000. This was never subsequently increased in line with inflation. The reason given was that his post was not officially recognised at the time, and it was \"not on the establishment\". A Charitable Trust - 'The Mrs Smith Trust', under the patronage of Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt - offered to increase his salary, and provide facilities to maintain and store the Collection at Netherne. This request was turned down by the hospital authorities, saying Adamson's salary would then \"exceed that of the doctors\" (as documented in correspondence in the Edward Adamson Archive at the Wellcome Library).  Adamson was obliged to make up the financial difference himself, and so he kept art therapy alive until it was later officially recognised by the NHS, and prevented it from being subsumed under <a href=\"/wiki/Occupational_Therapy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Occupational Therapy\">Occupational Therapy</a>.  The emerging field of art therapy was thereby protected by means of Adamson's professional and financial efforts.\n</p><p>He was involved from the late 1940s in the discussions and working groups that eventually led to the British Association of Art Therapists (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.baat.org\">BAAT</a>) in 1964, of which he was a founder member and, briefly, its first Chair. From 1969 and through the early 1970s, he was Head of the first British Art Therapy training programme, at St. Albans School of Art (the School was later renamed the Hertfordshire College of Art and Design, and then amalgamated with the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Hertfordshire\" title=\"University of Hertfordshire\">University of Hertfordshire</a> in 1992: art therapy training continuing in the University's School of Creative Arts, and still generally known as the St Albans' course).\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"After_Netherne:_Ashton.2C_.27Art_as_Healing.27_and_Outsider_Art_.281981.E2.80.931996.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"After_Netherne:_Ashton,_'Art_as_Healing'_and_Outsider_Art_(1981\u20131996)\">After Netherne: Ashton, 'Art as Healing' and Outsider Art (1981\u20131996)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Adamson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: After Netherne: Ashton, &#039;Art as Healing&#039; and Outsider Art (1981\u20131996)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After his retirement, Adamson opened a gallery on <a href=\"/wiki/Miriam_Rothschild\" title=\"Miriam Rothschild\">Miriam Rothschild</a> (1908\u20132005)'s <a href=\"/wiki/Ashton_Wold\" title=\"Ashton Wold\">Ashton Wold</a> estate in 1983, where the Adamson Collection was held until 1997. Rothschild was a friend and supporter of Adamson and Timlin, and a Trustee and subsequently Patron of the Adamson Collection Trust. The Adamson Collection Trust had been established in 1978 to promote research into Art Therapy, Adamson's work and the Collection.

He and Timlin had been regular visitors to Withymead, the Jungian art community led by Irene and Gilbert Champernowne from its founding in 1942 to its closure in 1967;<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> and later to Stanton, where Irene Champernowne and some of the Withymead staff moved after Withymead's demise with the intention of continuing with their work. Timlin had a cottage in Stanton, where he and Adamson would be most weekends. They were friends and associates with the group of British Jungians who are known as the 'Zurich classical school', as they were almost all trained at the <a href=\"/wiki/C._G._Jung_Institute_in_Z%C3%BCrich\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"C.

However, his point of view differed from art therapists who were psychoanalytically oriented, and in later life, he seemed more at home with those interested in <a href=\"/wiki/Outsider_art\" title=\"Outsider art\">outsider art</a>, the spontaneous creations of  untrained artists.

The act of creating was what mattered to Adamson, who felt the artist or therapist should avoid influencing, distorting, or impinging upon self-expression. Adamson encouraged 'free expression' by letting people come to paint or sculpt without comment or judgement, and with only minimal technical assistance. If the creator talked about a work, he'd listen. He abhorred psychological interpretation, which he dismissed as 'the therapist's own projections' onto the work, and maintained that only the creator could explain their own work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-O&#39;Flynn_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-O&#39;Flynn-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> This is the essence of his 'non-interventionist' working style, which perhaps would not be recognized as part of contemporary art therapy practice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hogan_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hogan-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><i>\"The actual \"therapy\" is purely incidental.

Adamson showed the Collection as early as 1947 in group shows of - to use a term from the time - 'psychiatric art'. In 1950, the \"<i>International Exhibition of Psychopathological Art</i>\" of '2000 works by 63 people from 17 countries' - including several paintings from the first Adamson studio - was held at the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris, during the First World Congress of Psychiatry, and 'helped create a climate of acceptance for work of the mentally ill' (p67).<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Works were included in three influential exhibitions held 'to promote the public awareness of art therapy' between 1955 and 1968. The first two were at the <a href=\"/wiki/Institute_of_Contemporary_Arts\" title=\"Institute of Contemporary Arts\">Institute of Contemporary Arts</a>: in 1955, <i>\"Aspects of Schizophrenic Art: an exhibition of work by patients in mental hospitals\"</i>, with 27 out of the 94 paintings shown from the Adamson Collection, curated by the psychiatrist G.M. Carstairs, and the catalogue introduction by the art critic  <a href=\"/wiki/Herbert_Read\" title=\"Herbert Read\">Herbert Read</a>, who had founded and led the ICA with <a href=\"/wiki/Roland_Penrose\" title=\"Roland Penrose\">Roland Penrose</a>: the two were the leading proponents of <a href=\"/wiki/Surrealism\" title=\"Surrealism\">Surrealism</a> in the UK; and in 1964, \"<i>Art as Communication: an exhibition of paintings made in art therapy departments of psychiatric hospitals and clinics</i>\". The third, in 1968, was at the <a href=\"/wiki/Commonwealth_Institute\" title=\"Commonwealth Institute\">Commonwealth Institute</a>: \"<i>Art and Mental Health: an exhibition of paintings, clay models and ceramics by psychiatric and subnormal patients and maladjusted children</i>\", (p101-108): the sub-titles of all these three surveys - particularly 1968's - speak of the attitudes of the time).\n</p><p>When Adamson retired from Netherne in 1981, he estimated there were 100,000 objects - paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics - in the Collection. The Netherne gallery had been opened in 1956, and was being visited by 3500 people a year by 1981, when it was closed on Adamson's retirement. (Among them was Hazel Guggenheim (1903\u20131995), <a href=\"/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim\" title=\"Peggy Guggenheim\">Peggy Guggenheim</a>'s sister. Timlin recalls \"Hazel was immaculately dressed and met the patients. She wore some fashionable red satin and diamant\u00e9, high heel shoes which a patient admired. Hazel sent them to Edward after her visit to present to the patient\").\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Anonymous,_%27TheTear%27._Adamson_Collection.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Anonymous%2C_%27TheTear%27._Adamson_Collection.jpg/220px-Anonymous%2C_%27TheTear%27._Adamson_Collection.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"276\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/Anonymous%2C_%27TheTear%27._Adamson_Collection.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"282\" data-file-height=\"354\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Anonymous,_%27TheTear%27._Adamson_Collection.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"<i>The Tear</i>\", anonymous, acrylic on canvas.

They were chosen by Adamson and Rudolf Freudenberg (a senior psychiatrist and Medical Superintendent at Netherne) for \"both artistic and psychiatric interest\". The Ashton gallery opened to the public in 1983. When Adamson and Timlin returned to Netherne later to move the rest of the Collection, it had disappeared, probably destroyed as considered by the hospital authorities to be of no value. A Police investigation never established their fate. In 1984, when the Adamson Collection was exhibited as <i>\"Selections from the Edward Adamson Collection\"</i>, at Art Gallery of Ontario, Adamson donated a large pencil drawing by Kurelek of one of the interiors of Netherne Hospital showing a group of patients at leisure to the Ontario Psychiatric Association, to decorate their common room - a donation facilitated by a psychiatrist, Dr. Appleton.\n</p><p>After Adamson's death in 1996, the Adamson Collection was moved for a second time, to Lambeth Hospital, an inner London mental health unit, part of <a href=\"/wiki/South_London_and_Maudsley_NHS_Foundation_Trust\" title=\"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust\">South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust</a> (SLaM), on permanent loan by the Adamson Collection Trust. The Collection was curated by the hospital Art Therapist, Alice Jackson, until 2012. In 2000 SLaM named a new mental health unit at <a href=\"/wiki/St_Thomas%27_Hospital\" title=\"St Thomas&#39; Hospital\">St Thomas' Hospital</a> as the Adamson Centre for Mental Health as a tribute to his pioneering work. Timlin donated  50 ink portraits by Adamson of people at work in the Netherne shower room, which he drew after one of the people in the session asked Adamson why wasn't he also drawing. (There are many more of these at the Wellcome Library Adamson Archive). The Adamson Centre closed in November 2016, due to service changes. The 50 drawings by Adamson passed to ACT; and 38 Adamson Collection paintings and drawings to the Wellcome Library.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Exhibitions_of_the_Adamson_Collection_.28selected.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exhibitions_of_the_Adamson_Collection_(selected)\">Exhibitions of the Adamson Collection (selected)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Adamson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Exhibitions of the Adamson Collection (selected)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>1947: Kingston Town Hall;</li>\n<li>1950: \"<i>International Exhibition of Psychopathological Art\"</i> at the First International Congress of Psychiatry, Paris;</li>\n<li>1955: \"<i>Aspects of Schizophrenic Art: an exhibition of work by patients in mental hospitals</i>\", Institute of Contemporary Arts, London;</li>\n<li>1961: Royal Society of Medicine;</li>\n<li>1964: \"<i>Art as Communication: an exhibition of paintings made in art therapy departments of psychiatric hospitals and clinics</i>\", Institute of Contemporary Arts, London;</li>\n<li>1967: \"<i>Fifth International Congress  of Psychopathology of Expression</i>\", Paris.

The rest of the paintings and drawings were stored either in a disused shower room (seemingly fitting as Adamson's first working space was in a shower room at Netherne), or stacked, unframed, in cardboard folders on shelves in a working team office at Lambeth Hospital, with the two Kureleks wrapped in blankets under a desk.\n</p><p>Between 2007 and 2010, the Adamson Collection Trust employed the then Curator, Alice Jackson, to undertake the Herculean task of cataloguing all the unframed paintings and drawings: they number about 2500 by Polanska - most are preparatory sketches for the \"<i>Stations of the Cross</i>\" - and another 2500 by over 200 people, more than half of them women. Adamson's records from Ashton, including albums of press cuttings and coverage, and of examples of Buday's Christmas cards and other prints, were in a filing cabinet.\n</p><p>Almost all the collection of several hundred stones, flints, ceramics and other small sculptures are in the third Adamson gallery (after the first and second at Netherne and Ashton), a small room outside a mental health ward. The objects were created with the cheapest materials \u2013 for example, almost all the paintings are poster paint on wallpaper backing paper - and date from 1946, so need specialist conservation and storage. Polonska's masterpiece \"<i>Stations of the Cross</i>\" and two other larger Polonska pieces were in a former Trustee's garage in Edinburgh - Michael Freudenberg, Rudolf Freudenberg's son - and very fragile and at risk as they are still the original plaster casts. Freudenberg was also storing a number of paintings and drawings. Almost all Adamson's personal papers, photographs and other artefacts, including hundreds of photographic transparencies of works (including of many now lost)  were at the Adamson's Hollywood Road studio, where Timlin still lives. Adamson Collection Trust records were in Trustees' homes across the country. Adamson's library of books and journals has been secured at AVAM since 1996.\n</p><p>Since 2010, the Trust has been collaborating with the Wellcome Library to secure the archives, and the Collection - in need of rescue for the third time in its history. In 2010-11, the Wellcome Library accepted Timlin's donation of Adamson's archive from Hollywood Road. In July 2013, the Wellcome took Adamson's Ashton archive (1981\u20131996); and further archive material from Lambeth Hospital. The Wellcome Library at the same time relocated all the 5000 paintings and drawings from Lambeth Hospital to temporary storage in their 'stacks' under Euston Road. The transfer deed was signed in December 2015 for all the flat works (bar Polonska's drawings and one Kurelek canvas).  These are now known as \"<i>Adamson Collection - Wellcome Library</i>\".\n</p><p>The remaining 2500 drawings are by Rolanda Polonska - many studies are for her 'Stations of the Cross' - and are located at the Wellcome. ACT holds about 500 sculptures at Lambeth Hospital, including the oeuvre of Gwyneth Rowlands. Six of her painted flints are on long term loan to the Wellcome Reading Room. Kurelek's ' 'The Ball of Twine and Other Nonsense' is on permanent loan to the Museum of the Mind (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://museumofthemind.org.uk/\">Museum of the Mind</a>). AVAM are cataloging the objects that Adamson donated in 1995.\n</p><p>The Adamson Collection Trust notes there are probably about twenty pictures and tapestries Dax took from the Netherne research studio to Melbourne to start the Dax Collection (now at the Dax Centre).\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\".27Third_Wave.27_literature_on_Adamson_and_Adamson_Collection_.282011_on.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"'Third_Wave'_literature_on_Adamson_and_Adamson_Collection_(2011_on)\">'Third Wave' literature on Adamson and Adamson Collection (2011 on)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Adamson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: &#039;Third Wave&#039; literature on Adamson and Adamson Collection (2011 on)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>2011: O'Flynn, D. \"<i>Art as Healing: Edward Adamson</i>\".
