Randyland is an art museum located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is widely regarded as one of America's most colorful public art landmarks.   The museum was created by Randy Gilson and is dedicated to his outsider art.  Randyland has played an important role in the cultural rejuvenation of Pittsburgh with its neighbors City of Asylum and Mattress Factory.   Randy Gilson's creation has received international attention through viral listicles.   It now counts itself among the most photographed places on Instagram.  Admission is free.  Randy Gilson was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Early in life he suffered from homelessness and poverty. He moved to Pittsburgh's Northside in 1982 where he was a community activist planting over 800 street gardens and 50 vegetable gardens.   His guerrilla gardening spans otherwise vacant lots across Manchester, the Mexican War Streets, and surrounding neighborhoods.  The property that would become Randyland was purchased on a credit card for $10,000 in 1995.  Gilson uses dumpster diving and upcycling to fill his home with colorful oddities that include pink flamingos, mannequins, and plastic dinosaurs.  The houses and fences are adorned with murals depicting neighbors dancing and smiling.  In late 2016, Gilson's partner Mac Mcdermott was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.  Upon hearing the news Randyland fans raised over $20,000 to send Randy and Mac on their first vacation ever. The couple visited the Grand Canyon and Hollywood.  Afterwards, Gilson stated plans to retire from the museum's day-to-day. Following the announcement Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director.    They continue to welcome visitors from around the world. The Courtyard of Randyland Outside Celebration Mural Randyland Welcome Wall Randyland Mirror Wall
