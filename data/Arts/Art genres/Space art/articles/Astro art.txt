Astro Art is the product of an artist and a creative idea that is associated with astronomy, atmospheric objects, or phenomena â€” real or imagined, future or historical. It is the creative process of communicating ideas about such objects through art. It is also an alternative name for Space Art or Astronomical Art, which concerns art or painting (traditional or digital) of objects in outer space, including galaxies, nebulae, stars, planets, moons, asteroids, etc. Space art may also include artifacts such as hardware, e.g. vehicles, satellites, rovers, bases or space stations, astronauts or robotic constructions. The art-form was used to weave stories into songs called waiata, which later became oral history. This form of Astro Art contained information regarding natural resources and navigation in Pacific civilizations. Modern computing software has enabled new methods of creating astro art, and the internet has enabled new methods of sharing it. Art, science, and technology often meet as equal partners for Astro artists while they are creating new work. "Astro Art" was registered as a business name in the UK by David A. Hardy   in 1970, registration number 1528398.
