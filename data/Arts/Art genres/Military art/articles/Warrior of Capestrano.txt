The Warrior of Capestrano is a tall limestone statue of a Picene warrior, dated to around the 6th century BC. The statue stands at around 2.09 m. It was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of Capestrano, along with a female statue in civilian attire, called Lady of Capestrano.  The Warrior statue has traces of pink paint, and features a warrior wearing a hat with a huge brim, and a disk-type armor (kardiophylax) protecting his chest and back,  a wide belt, necklace, and armlets. Additionally, the warrior bears a short sword, knife, axe, and a defensive device known to the Greeks as mitra (a short apron covering the back). A South Picene inscription incised on the pillar standing to the right of the warrior reads: "Makupri koram opsút aninis rakinevíi pomp[úne]í" ("Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]").  Investigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an Iron Age cemetery.
