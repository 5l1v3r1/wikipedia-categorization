Freydoon Rassouli is an Iranian-Born, American abstract surrealist and visionary artist and author. Inspired and encouraged by his Sufi mystic uncle, Rassouli began painting and learning the poetry of Hafiz and Rumi from early age. He studied with Persian miniature painters at the same time as he was learning European classical and Impressionist painting techniques. At fifteen, he won the title of "best student artist in Iran" and was awarded a government grant to study painting in Europe. Rassouli migrated to the United States in 1963,  where he studied painting and architecture at the University of New Mexico, and was honored with the Leadership Award from the Institute of International Education. Rassouli started his professional career as an architect, but later on became a full-time artist,  writer and inspirational speaker. Within the past thirty years, Rassouli has exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia. He has also written three books, and co-authored six books and three card decks. He guides others in retreats, shares his approach to creativity through public talks and in media interviews. Rassouli is presently living in Southern California. Rassouli's public artworks include the Angel of Unity, a 45 by 120 foot (14 m × 37 m) mural on a wall at the corner of Washington Blvd. and the Pacific Coast in Venice, California. Another of his murals is Creation, located in downtown Los Angeles. It is 82 by 16 feet (25.0 m × 4.9 m).  Rassouli's images also appear in the books Jung: A Journey of Transformation Exploring His Life and Experiencing His Ideas  and Language of Souls,  along with many magazines and book covers.
