Robert Venosa (January 21, 1936 - August 9, 2011) was an American artist who resided in Boulder, Colorado, USA. He studied with what are termed the New Masters. His artworks reside in collections around the world.  He first studied under Mati Klarwein in New York. Venosa move to Europe and studied with one of the founders of the Fantastic Realist movement, Ernst Fuchs (artist). From these masters he learned variations of a venerated painting technique developed in the mid 1400's called the Mische Technique which involves underpainting in water soluble tempera with transparent oil paint glazes. While living in Vienna he met his second wife, Jutta, with whom he had children Christian, Marcus, and Celene. Eventually Venosa moved to the coastal village of Cadaques, Spain, where he lived for fifteen years and befriended the consummate surrealist painter Salvador Dali. He later introduced H. R. Giger to Dal√≠.  Venosa traveled the globe with his partner Martina Hoffmann, teaching their painting technique. The technique is a derivative of what Venosa learned from his teachers. His technique differs in the material used for the underpainting (caesin versus egg tempera) but largely follows the same processes. His death on August 9, 2011 was the end of an eight-year battle with cancer.   Spiritual Spectrum - Spirituality in Art on YouTubeTalk
