  Nihâl Chand (1710–1782) was an Indian artist who produced some of the best known examples of Rajput painting. He was the chief painter at the court of Kishangarh during the time of the ruler Savant Singh (also known as Nagari Das). His paintings capture the romantic and religious passions of his patron Savant Singh. Nihal Chand is known for his idealized depiction of the female form called Bani Thani.
