Peter Paillou (1757â€“1831 or 1832), was a British painter of portraits including miniatures.   Paillou was the son of a natural history painter and illustrator also named Peter Paillou, who is believed to have been born in France before migrating to England. He practised in London for 20 years before moving to Glasgow for some years, where an 1803 advertisement states that he charged eight guineas for a miniature and ten guineas for a three quarter length portrait in oils.
