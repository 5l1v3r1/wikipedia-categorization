They therefore decided to establish independent workshops. The owners of these were committed to only work for the House of Faberg\u00e9 that would supply the sketches and models of the objects to be made. Nothing would be accepted by the House unless it had been approved by either Carl or his appointed deputy. The House of Faberg\u00e9 also employed its own designers. However we also know from the Memoirs of Fran\u00e7ois Birbaum written in 1919 (Birbaum was Head Designer of the House of Faberg\u00e9 from 1896 to 1917) that Carl also designed himself.\n</p><p>The workmasters presided over teams of craftsmen and were responsible for executing pieces conceived by the company's designers. The House of Faberg\u00e9 was staffed with some of the finest goldsmiths and jewelers available. \n</p><p>It is often said that Faberg\u00e9 did not make anything produced by the House of Faberg\u00e9. It is true that nothing has survived that can be said to have been the work of Carl Faberg\u00e9. His father, Gustav Faberg\u00e9 and the founder of the House of Faberg\u00e9, ensured that his eldest son received the best possible training to take over the business. After Carl\u2019s education in St Petersburg, this was followed by a course at the Arts and Crafts School in Dresden, the city to which his parents had retired. He then embarked on an eight-year Grand Tour of Europe where he received tuition from respected goldsmiths in Germany, France and England. The \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 with these goldsmiths would have resulted in Carl working at the bench and producing objects.\n</p><p>When Carl returned to the House of Faberg\u00e9 in St Petersburg during 1872 his father\u2019s trusted Workmaster Hiskias Pendin acted as his mentor and tutor. This would also have involved Carl working at the bench and producing objects. When he was awarded the title Master Goldsmith in 1882, his reputation was then so high that the usual three-day examination was waived; this would not have happened if he had never made anything.\n</p><p>The business was divided into several  workshops, each with its own specialty. In addition to the fabulous easter eggs, the workshop also produced table silver, jewelry, European-style trinkets, and Russian-style carvings. The two master jewelers most responsible for making the <a href=\"/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9_eggs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Faberg\u00e9 eggs\">Faberg\u00e9 eggs</a> were <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Perchin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Michael Perchin\">Michael Perchin</a> and Finnish-born <a href=\"/wiki/Henrik_Wigstr%C3%B6m\" title=\"Henrik Wigstr\u00f6m\">Henrik Wigstr\u00f6m</a>. Born in 1860, Perchin became the leading workmaster in the House of Faberg\u00e9 in 1886 and supervised production of the eggs until 1903. Those eggs he was responsible for have his MP (MP- Michael Perchin) markings. All signed eggs made after 1903 bear Henrik Wigstrom's HW mark. Of course, not all eggs were stamped, so other goldsmiths may have supervised production of some of the eggs. Altogether there have been more than 40 workmasters.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"List_of_Faberg.C3.A9_workmasters\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"List_of_Faberg\u00e9_workmasters\">List of Faberg\u00e9 workmasters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Faberg%C3%A9_workmaster&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: List of Faberg\u00e9 workmasters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>(The list is not complete.)\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/1st_Silver-_Artel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"1st Silver- Artel\">1st Silver- Artel</a> (1896-1917). <a href=\"/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Faberg\u00e9\">Faberg\u00e9</a> commissioned many silver articles from the 1st Silver-Artel.
