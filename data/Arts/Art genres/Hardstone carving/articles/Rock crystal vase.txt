A rock crystal vase is a vase made of rock crystal, a type of hardstone carving. Such vases were rare, expensive, and decorated with gold and jewels, used by royalty in Europe. A rock crystal vase {fr} that probably originated in the seventh century was given to William IX of Aquitaine (the Troubadour) by a Muslim ally (probably 'Abd al-Malik Imad ad-Dawla ). When Eleanor of Aquitaine, William IX's granddaughter, married King Louis VII of France in 1137, she gave him the rock crystal vase as a wedding present.  The inscription on it says he, in turn, gave it to the Abbey of St.-Denis.  It is now in the Louvre in Paris and is the only artifact of Eleanor's known to exist today. Another was a crystal and gold posset set the Spanish Ambassador gave Mary I of England and Philip II of Spain as a betrothal gift.  It was made by Benvenuto Cellini and the whole set is now on display at Hatfield House (England).
