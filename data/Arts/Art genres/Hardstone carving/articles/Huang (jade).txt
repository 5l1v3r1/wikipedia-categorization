A huang (璜) is a Chinese arc-shaped jade artifact that was used as a pendant.  These items were used in a jade pei ornament set (組玉佩),  where they were strung together to create a sound during movement.  At the ends, there were often abstract heads of animals carved into the jade. During the Eastern Zhou period, block-shaped tiger-like ends were often used in the huang, but these would develop into more-abstract notches.
