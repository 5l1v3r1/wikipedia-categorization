Live Arts Week  is a project by Xing, born in 2012 out the fusion of the experiences of the two Bologna festivals (2000>2011): Netmage - International Live Media Festival and F.I.S.Co. - Festival Internazionale sullo Spettacolo Contemporaneo. Live Arts Week takes place in Bologna, Italy, once a year, and it is developed throughout one week in different locations and settings in town. Event dedicated to live arts, it hosts a blend of artworks and productions that revolve around the presence, performance and perceptual experience of sounds and visions, with a program of live works (performances, environments, concerts, live media, expanded cinema) presented by important personalities in the international and contemporary research scene.
