These new genres are most commonly in the style of <a href=\"/wiki/Audience_participation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Audience participation\">audience participatory</a> installation pieces that can take place either on the internet or can be played on a CD \u2013 ROM. \u201cComputers are arenas for social experience and dramatic interaction, a type of media more like public theatre, and their output is used for qualitative interaction, dialogue and conversation.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The computer is vastly becoming a significant tool and agent of performative action and creation. Computer technologies can be contextualised as being of a social, cultural and artistic change. Computers do now permit for the artistic modes of expression and for the new generic forms of networking and interactive performance. Theatre itself has always been right at the cutting edge of technology and it has been quick on the mark to be able to recognise, and to take full advantage of the dramatic and aesthetic potentials that these new and existing technologies have to offer. Theatre, dance and <a href=\"/wiki/Performance_art\" title=\"Performance art\">performance art</a> have always been known to be a form of multimedia; and right at the very core of the theatre through all the manifestations right to the contemporary experimentation, as well as incorporating all of the visual elements into a production; at the foreground to any piece there is the human voice and the spoken text.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Locating the roots of digital performance practices can be traced back for many decades or even centuries. There are three main periods that can be highlighted in the history of multi - media performance; <a href=\"/wiki/Futurism\" title=\"Futurism\">Futurism</a> during the 1910s, mixed media performance during the 1960s and experimentation with a performance and the computer during the 1990s. Both during the eras of Futurism and the experimentation with computer incorporated within performance, they are both greatly inspired by the development of new and existing technology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Researching back, digital performance practices have experimented with numerous of the different avant \u2013 garde movements which can date right back from the early twentieth century, some of these movements can include the likes of <a href=\"/wiki/Bauhaus\" title=\"Bauhaus\">Bauhaus</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dada\" title=\"Dada\">Dada</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Surrealism\" title=\"Surrealism\">Surrealism</a> and many more. It could be said that digital performance can be linked to the aesthetics, philosophies and practices of the futurist movement. One of the main links that has been found which can connect futurism to digital performance was with the use of the \u2018machine\u2019 which was used in the set of <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Lepage\" title=\"Robert Lepage\">Robert Lepage</a>\u2019s Zulu Time (1999). Although, it can be said that the avant \u2013 garde movement Futurism does have a more philosophical basis for contemporary digital performance, more so than any of the other avant \u2013 garde movements such as the likes of Bauhaus, Dada and Surrealism which are mainly used to provide inspiration for a large part of the content and styles for the artistic expression. Looking back at the early twentieth century avant \u2013 garde, there were many works that would use pre \u2013 digital technologies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One of the earliest examples of when theatre and film were being integrated together in a performance, with the use of digital technology was to try and challenge the distinction between what is \u2018liveness\u2019 as in the live performer on the stage and the media imagery, it is about the relationship between the virtual and the actual performance being the dialogical <a href=\"/wiki/Interactivity\" title=\"Interactivity\">interactivity</a>. With the increased usage of digital media in a performance, not all performances are necessarily live, without the body\u2019s physical presence it could be argued whether this is this still live theatre or just a set of media images and footage. Theatre pieces which have integrated digital media and computer generated projections built into performances have a long historical lineage that stretches back to over a hundred years ago to an experiment that was conducted by <a href=\"/wiki/Loie_Fuller\" title=\"Loie Fuller\">Loie Fuller</a>. Fuller was the first modern dance choreographer to try out and to use new technology within her performance work. In 1911, Fuller, a dancer, conducted an experiment where she used film footage and projected it onto diaphanous robes. In the performance, as Fuller danced the robes in which she was wearing became a sort of \u2018screen\u2019 where multi \u2013 coloured lights were projected upon it. This was one of the first pieces of theatre where film footage was integrated into becoming a part of a live theatre performance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>From the early 1960s, computer generated imagery had then began to emerge as a distinctive art form, and in <a href=\"/wiki/John_Whitney_(animator)\" title=\"John Whitney (animator)\">John Whitney\u2019s</a> film Catalog (1961) viewers witnessed one of films\u2019 first ever uses of computer transformations.  Although digital arts had been developing since the 1960s, in the 1990s computer technologies had become much more accessible to artists which then led to a large increase in the digital performance activity. It was during this time that computer <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_hardware\" title=\"Computer hardware\">hardware</a> was built to become much more \u201cuser \u2013 friendly\u201d and we then witnessed the invention of the <a href=\"/wiki/Digital_camera\" title=\"Digital camera\">digital camera</a> and the home PC\u2019s (<a href=\"/wiki/Personal_computer\" title=\"Personal computer\">Personal Computer</a>) and the establishment of the World Wide Web.

During the period of the \u2018Digital Revolution\u2019 there was a great influence on the aesthetics, creation and culture of the performance arts; this had a significant effect on the process for film and television production to the creative writing and the visual and performance arts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>From 1970 there was a period of time of when theatrical experimentation elevated the visual over the verbal; there was a proliferation in the use of media projections in theatre, dance and performance art, using both screens and video monitors. With the ease of using these <a href=\"/wiki/Video\" title=\"Video\">video</a> technologies more and more artists began to play around with the possibilities of integrating visual media within their live performance work. The use of media technology including the likes of film, video and sound equipment became some of the main characteristics for the <a href=\"/wiki/Experimental_theatre\" title=\"Experimental theatre\">experimental theatre</a>, and some of the most noted performance artists of this time were creating work by incorporating video and film footage into their theatre productions. By the 1990s multimedia and computer technologies had widely become a part of everyday life. In live multimedia theatre: the projection screens or video monitor frame additional space, in two dimensions. Media screens are able to provide a uniquely flexible space, unlike the fixed point of view in which a traditional theatre provides to the members of the audience.

Digital performance is an expansion of a constantly progressing history of which embracing the adaptation of these new and already existing technologies, in which to amplify a performance and the visual art aesthetic effect, and to create the sense of a spectacle as well as capturing the emotional and the sensorial impact.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Production_examples\">Production examples</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Digital_performance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Production examples\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Video conferencing is also a part of digital performance, some theatre companies (such as \u2018The Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> and \u2018Kunstwerk-Blend\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>) introduced this into their productions to bring different performers from different locations together live on stage to create a lively new brand of digital performance. The Internet is used as a base for these productions with text-based online environments such as <a href=\"/wiki/MUD\" title=\"MUD\">MUDs</a> and MOOs as well as the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Webcam\" title=\"Webcam\">webcams</a> and webcasts. They all created new forms to come under the live and interactive performance area. With the ongoing increase of internet users more and more people are made accessible to these software\u2019s therefore more and more artists are experimenting and devising performances using computer technologies which them branches out and raises the number of digital performances and productions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another case of what is under the title of digital performance is dance productions, using software and computer techniques such as advanced animation and <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_capture\" title=\"Motion capture\">motion capturing</a>. You can project images of your virtual dancers made on to the stage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As you are using computer techniques and software to project on to a stage, which has a live audience the performance/production, then becomes digital due to the elements involved. Software that is highly involved with digital performance is custom-made <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_sensing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Motion sensing\">motion sensing</a>; this software allows you to control images, avatars, sounds and lighting live on stage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This is important for today\u2019s artists and audiences, as audiences are looking for something new and memorable. Artists are equally looking to create something new that will grab audiences, this software allows this to happen as you can experiment and change as much as you like live.\n</p><p>Communication through the Internet has been classed as a type of digital performance as it has been theorized as a type of virtual performance of the self. As this is so, people have already stated digital performance as being everywhere, which has led to digital performance being modernized itself. It has been noted as incorporating the elements of <a href=\"/wiki/Electronics\" title=\"Electronics\">electronics</a> in everyday life through the communicational and production elements.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some strands of performing have always been seen as multimedia forms such as theatre, dance and performance art. Dance involves an intimate relationship with <a href=\"/wiki/Music\" title=\"Music\">music</a> for a start. All three of the above are involved with visual aspects such as sets, props, lighting and costume which are all a part of the production to enhance the body/bodies in a space.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dixon_1-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dixon-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Using such aspects makes the performance become multimedia and that is becoming more advanced with the new techniques that computers are upgrading to therefore making digital performance a strong and popular area to study.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Digital_performance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Dixon-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-6\"><sup><i><b>g</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-7\"><sup><i><b>h</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-8\"><sup><i><b>i</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-9\"><sup><i><b>j</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-10\"><sup><i><b>k</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-11\"><sup><i><b>l</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-12\"><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-13\"><sup><i><b>n</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-14\"><sup><i><b>o</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-15\"><sup><i><b>p</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-16\"><sup><i><b>q</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-17\"><sup><i><b>r</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-18\"><sup><i><b>s</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-19\"><sup><i><b>t</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-20\"><sup><i><b>u</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-21\"><sup><i><b>v</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-22\"><sup><i><b>w</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Dixon_1-23\"><sup><i><b>x</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dixon, Steve (2007). <i>Digital Performance</i>.
