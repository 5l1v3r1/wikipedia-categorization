Hamid Naderi Yeganeh (Persian: حمید نادری یگانه‎; born July 26, 1990 in Iran ) is an Iranian mathematical artist.    He is known for using mathematical formulas to create drawings of real-life objects, intricate illustrations, animations, fractals and tessellations.    His artwork 9,000 Ellipses was used as the background cover image of The American Mathematical Monthly – November 2017.    Naderi Yeganeh has introduced two methods to draw real-life objects with mathematical formulas.  In the first method, he creates tens of thousands of computer-generated mathematical figures to find a few interesting shapes accidentally.  For example, by using this method, he found some shapes that resemble  birds, fishes and sailing boats.    In the second method, he draws a real life object with a step-by-step process. In each step, he tries to find out which mathematical formulas will produce the drawing.   For example, by using this method, he drew birds in flight, butterflies, human faces and plants using trigonometric functions.     He has designed some fractals and tessellations inspired by the continents.   For example, in 2015, he described the fractal Africa with an Africa-like octagon and its lateral inversion.   Naderi Yeganeh believes that there are an infinite number of ways of using mathematical tools in art.  He says, "I don’t think computer-made art clashes with human creativity, but it can change the role of artists.”  Naderi Yeganeh received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Qom.  He won a gold medal at the 38th Iranian Mathematical Society’s Mathematics Competition in May 2014 and a silver medal at the 39th IMS’s Mathematics Competition in May 2015.    Below are some examples of Yeganeh's mathematical figures:
