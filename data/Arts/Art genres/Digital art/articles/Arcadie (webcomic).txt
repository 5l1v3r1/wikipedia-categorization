 Arcadie is an English webcomic created by Dutch artist Ties Wijnker. Described in its tagline as "Comics for people," Arcadie revolves around a broad range of subjects, often dealing with the conditions and experiences of individual characters within modern life.  Recurrent themes include irony, technology, entertainment, boredom, alienation, and fantasy. Many of the comics contain absurd or surrealist characters and premises, and they often lack a clear plot or traditional punchline. Arcadie features self-contained comics, with characters and settings changing per comic. They are organized in a single-page format, with the amount of panels per comic ranging from three to several dozen. Every comic comes with an additional short text placed under it, elaborating on its ideas. The artwork consists of digital linework and coloring with little shading, producing a minimalist aesthetic.
