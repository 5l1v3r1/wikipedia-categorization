Obscura Digital, a Madison Square Garden company, is a creative studio located in Historic Pier 70 in the Dogpatch District of San Francisco, CA.  Combining innovative technology with creative expression, Obscura designs and develops immersive, interactive digital art installations and experiences around the world. Obscura works with Fortune 100 companies, cultural dignitaries, and global foundations to communicate transformative messages using original content for emerging technologies.  Obscura specializes in custom video content, large scale interactive displays, architectural installations, kinetic sculpture, stage shows, and projection mapping that turns nearly any surface into a video screen.   Obscura is best known for first-of-its-kind, large-scale projection mapping events on St Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican  and the Empire State Building in 2015, in conjunction with the film Racing Extinction. The Empire State Building project was named Modern Met’s Top 15 Most Remarkable Art Installations and (combined with the Vatican event) achieved 5.4 billion media impressions globally.  Other notable events include projecting an 8-minute program entitled "Chrysalis" in the world's largest geodesic projection dome (at 120 feet diameter) for Coachella; projecting real-time election results, maps, images of seminal moments in American History, and photos from the campaign trail on the south façade of the Empire State Building during CNN's 2016 election night coverage; and projecting seminal images from Harper's Bazaar on the north façade of the Empire State Building celebrating Harper's' 150th anniversary.  Other notable work includes permanent installations such as the LiveFX Board at AT&T Stadium in Dallas,  the 52-foot RFID-triggered wall at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta,  and the immersive LED wall in the Salesforce office building lobby at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco.  Travis Threlkel and Chris Lejeune founded the company in 2000, and assembled a small team to work out of a South of Market warehouse.  Today, Obscura employs a team of over 70 artists, technologists, builders, and strategists, working in three main categories: live events, installations, and experimental technologies with tangible prototypes. In November of 2017, Obscura was acquired by the Madison Square Garden Company.
