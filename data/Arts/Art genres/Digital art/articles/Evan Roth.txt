Evan Roth (born 1978) is a US artist who applies a hacker philosophy to an art practice that visualizes transient moments in public space, online and in popular culture.   In 2012, he was awarded a Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award.  Evan Roth received a degree in architecture from University of Maryland and a MFA from the Communication, Design and Technology school at Parsons The New School for Design, where he graduated as class valedictorian.  During his time at Parsons, he developed several projects, including Graffiti Taxonomy, Typographic Illustration, Explicit Content Only and Graffiti Analysis, his thesis project. Roth was named one of the ten most interesting recent graduates of 2006.  After graduating Roth worked at the Eyebeam OpenLab, an open source creative technology lab for the public domain as a Research and Development Fellow from 2005â€“2006 and a Senior Fellow from 2006-2007. Roth's work with graffiti, open source technology and public space led to him forming the Graffiti Research Lab ("GRL") with James Powderly in 2005.   GRL projects include LED Throwies and L.A.S.E.R. Tag.  In 2007, Roth co-founded the Free Art and Technology Lab (F.A.T. Lab), an Internet-based art-and-technology collective dedicated to the intersection of open-source hacking and popular culture.
