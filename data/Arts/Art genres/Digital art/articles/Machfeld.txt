MACHFELD is an Austrian art duo. Founded in 1999 by  media artists Michael Mastrototaro and Sabine Maier in Vienna, Austria, they work in different fields: Netart, short and experimental films, streaming projects, interactive installations, and art in public space. Projects, exhibitions and screenings have been held in Africa, Europe, Central America and the United States of America. Examples of their work include The Game 1 (2002), a comparative experiment about the social behavior of individuals as a function of the medial context.  The comparison took place between the real and the virtual world: participants had the possibility of playing with two women, like they were puppets.
