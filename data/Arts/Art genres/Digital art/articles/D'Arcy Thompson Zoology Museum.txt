  The D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum is a museum of zoology at the University of Dundee in Scotland.   The museum is named after the Scottish biologist and mathematician D'Arcy Thompson (1860–1948), who founded it in the 1880s.  The museum has a collection of birds, fish, insects, mammals, and reptiles from around the world, together with some of D'Arcy Thompson's models and teaching material. The museum has 27 specimens from the voyage of HMS Challenger of  1872–1876.  The museum also has an art collection, including digital art of cellular forms by Andy Lomas, inspired by the work of D'Arcy Thompson and funded by the UK Art Fund.
