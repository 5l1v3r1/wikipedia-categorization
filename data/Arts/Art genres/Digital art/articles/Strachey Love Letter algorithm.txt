Christopher Strachey wrote a combinatory love letter algorithm for the Manchester Mark 1 computer in 1952. The poems it generated have been seen as the first piece of digital literature  and a queer critique of heteronormative expressions of love.  Rather than modeling writing as a creative process, the love letter algorithm represents the writing of love letters as formulaic and without creativity.   The algorithm has the following structure: The lists of words were compiled by Strachey from a Roget's Thesaurus.  Although the list of words included several variations on the word love, none of these variations made it into any of the widely circulated letters generated by Strachey's procedure.
