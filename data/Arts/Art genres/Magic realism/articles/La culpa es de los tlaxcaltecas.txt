Returning to her life in 20th century Mexico City, Laura feels guilty and torn between her two lives. Laura goes back to meet her "primo marido" despite her 20th century husband's (Pablo Aldama) will and physically abusive reaction. Laura continues to see the suffering of her "primo marido" from his war wounds. The story finishes with an open ending as Laura leaves with her "primo marido" and Nacha decides to leave the house as well.
