Our Word is Our Weapon (ISBN 1-85242-814-7) is a collection of writings by Subcomandante Marcos of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. Marcos has become somewhat of an icon, a poetic representative of a much larger struggle. Much of the book contains political essays, as well as stories and commentary in the style of magical realism, with conversations between Marcos and a beetle named Durito. The book was published by Seven Stories Press in 2002. "Somewhere between the passionate analysis of Ricardo Flores Magón, and the poetic fury of Eduardo Galeano, lie these most powerful and essential communiques of the new Mexican Revolution. Possibly the most influential collection of writings upon my musical and political perspective." — Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine. "Our Word is Our Weapon crystallizes the passion of a rebel, the poetry of a movement, and the literary genius of indigenous Mexico. The flame that burns here is a light for literature and democracy, a dangerous fire for those in power." — Martín Espada.
