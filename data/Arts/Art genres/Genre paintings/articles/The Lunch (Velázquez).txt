The Lunch is a very early painting by Spanish artist Diego Velázquez, finished c. 1617. The work, an oil painting on canvas, is in the Hermitage Museum of Saint Petersburg. The painting portrays a table covered by a creased cloth, on which lie two pomegranates and a piece of bread. People attending the lunch include an aged man on the left and a young man on the right, while, in the background, an apparently carefree boy pours wine into a  jug. On the wall in the background hang a white neck-band, a leather bag and, on the right, a sword. The Lunch is nearly identical to another painting by Velázquez, The Farmers' Lunch (1618).
