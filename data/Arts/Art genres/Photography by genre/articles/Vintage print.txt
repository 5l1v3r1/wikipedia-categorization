In photography, a vintage print is the first print that the photographer makes immediately after developing a negative. Vintage prints are considered the original piece of art, as it is possible  to arbitrarily obtain many copies from the same negative. This means that vintage prints are often signed by the photographer.  However, in the art market the term is used of old prints - especially earlier 20th century and 19th century examples of lithography, etching or steel engraving.  Really old prints (before c1800) are called Old master prints.
