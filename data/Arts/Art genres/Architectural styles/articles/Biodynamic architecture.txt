Biodynamic architecture is a new way of architectural thinking, it is a spiral-based architecture-planing-method used in the creating processes and works of SPIRALI art & architecture (2014). Founder Catalin D'arco introduced this term to define a new way of architectural thinking, a new philosophy to connect architecture, nature and biorythm in a dynamic way. Biodynamic architecture is a new point of view to redefine architecture and architectural thinking. It creates the harmony between the aura and the constructed environment (houses, buildings, gardens, urban and landscape environment). Biodynamic architecture is working with SPIRALI imagines buildings with curves and spirals made from natural and healthy materials and sees the nature also inside of our buildings. Spaces of living and working have to have energetically balance and harmony, so when people enter in a room or in a designed space they get more energized and activated. It also uses the tendency to change statical thinking to dynamical, to create that kind of environment which motivate us to live our life active and healthy!
