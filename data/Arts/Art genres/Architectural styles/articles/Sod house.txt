The sod house or "soddy"  was an often used successor to the log cabin during frontier settlement of the Great Plains of Canada and the United States. If the prairie lacked standard building materials such as wood or stone, sod from thickly-rooted prairie grass was abundant and could be used for contruction.  Prairie grass had a much thicker, tougher root structure than modern landscaping grass. Construction of a sod house involved cutting patches of sod in rectangles, often 2'×1'×6" (60×30×15 cm), and piling them into walls. Builders employed a variety of roofing methods.  Sod houses accommodated normal doors and windows. The resulting structure was well-insulated and depending on the roof type inexpensive when compared to a wood frame house. However, sod houses required frequent maintenance and were often vulnerable to rain damage, especially if the roof was also primarily of sod. Stucco was sometimes used to protected the outer walls. Canvas or stucco often lined the interior walls. Sod was also used to construct animal shelters, corrals and fences. While the influence of the sod house cannot be overlooked, stone or timber was preferred when available. In addition, where railroads existed, framed houses and buildings were used extensively during the settlement period.
