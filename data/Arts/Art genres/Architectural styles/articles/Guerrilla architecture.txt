Guerrilla architecture is the hacking of existing buildings, often old, disused or distressed, adapted to a new function. Guerrilla architecture is both a social and political movement. It challenges the established architectural hierarchy by creating interventions in a very non-conformist way.    Students tired of waiting for sustainable transformation in the built environment and disillusioned with the pace of change in architectural sustainability challenge hijack disused spaces to create socially responsible and sustainable designs. Buildings, spaces, attachments and interventions are often characterised by their parasitic or alien nature. In the same way that a parasite is fed and sheltered by its host, so-called 'parasitic architecture' feeds off a pre-existing structure, providing alternative solutions to overcrowded spaces. In an age of mass migration and a general lack of space, parasitic architecture might be the key to our growing future housing needs for the population and lack of space in major cities? Take a look at some examples of parasitic architecture worldwide.
