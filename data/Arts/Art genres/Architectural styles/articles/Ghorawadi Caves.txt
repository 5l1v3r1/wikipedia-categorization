They are close to the NH4 highway connecting Pune and Mumbai.  The caves were carved out of a single rock formation around the 3rd and 4th century CE. There are nine rooms for meditation adjoining the chaityagriha. An inscription in Brāhmī script on one of the walls says that the Chaityagriha is dedicated with affection to the Buddha and the Samgha by the daughters of "Dhapar", who was a disciple of "Bhadantsingh". The chaityagriha is now known as Shri Ghorwadeshwar Temple. The caves are situated at the top of a hill.
