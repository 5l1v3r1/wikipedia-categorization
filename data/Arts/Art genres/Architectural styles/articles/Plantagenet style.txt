Plantagenet style is an architectural building design of churches and cathedrals during the 12th century, characterized by cross-ribbed vaults and extremely curved dome vaults which resulted in the use of thick walls and piers. It is also the start of the transition from the Romanesque style to the Gothic style of architecture.
