A rosette is a round, stylized flower design. The rosette derives from the natural shape of the botanical rosette, formed by leaves radiating out from the stem of a plant and visible even after the flowers have withered. The rosette design is used extensively in sculptural objects from antiquity, appearing in Mesopotamia,and in funeral steles' decoration in Ancient Greece. It was adopted later in Romaneseque and Renaissance, and also common in the art of Central Asia, spreading as far as India where it is used as a decorative motif in Greco-Buddhist art. One of the earliest appearances of the rosette in ancient art is in early fourth millennium BC Egypt.  Another early Mediterranean occurrence of the rosette design derives from Minoan Crete; Among other places,  the design appears on the Phaistos Disc, recovered from the eponymous archaeological site in southern Crete.
