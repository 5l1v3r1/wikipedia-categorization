Persian weave is a method of weave used in jewelry and other art forms. When used for making chains, the Persian weave makes a dense chain with a ring pattern. Persian weaves works best with relatively large rings. The Persian family of weaves is a "rope" type weave based on a stacked ring orientation. In the construction of Persian weaves the rings become stacked and form pairs, resulting in a different grain and a thicker, tighter weave. Most Persian weaves have both left and right-handed versions.
