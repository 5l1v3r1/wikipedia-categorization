A buyao (traditional Chinese: 步搖; simplified Chinese: 步摇; Wade–Giles: pu-yao) is a type of Chinese women's hair ornament.  The jewelry dangles when the wearer walks, hence the name, which literally means "shake as you go".   Common materials for buyaos include gold, silver, jade, and agate. During the Western Han period, buyaos were created and adopted the style of the Western region's accessories. At the time of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the buyao was introduced to Korea and Japan.  The buyao was a status symbol in Chinese culture. After the Han Dynasty, the buyao was introduced to the folk communities and passed down over generations. Some noble women also put buyaos on their tiaras, making their hair decoration more luxurious than simple buyaos. Shape: phoenix, butterfly and other winged animals; tassels and pendants.
