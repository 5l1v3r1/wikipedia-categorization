Campbell Folk School\">John C. Campbell Folk School</a>.  She and other founding members met through the Southern Mountain Workers Conference which was held in <a href=\"/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee\" title=\"Knoxville, Tennessee\">Knoxville</a> beginning in 1900. At the Southern Mountain Workers Conference of 1926 Olive Campbell suggested forming an actual official crafts organization. This was followed by planning meetings in 1928 and 1929 at which founding members decided the goals and by-laws of the Guild at the Spinning Wheel in Asheville, North Carolina.\n</p><p>They then came up with the name of Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. The organization was <a href=\"/wiki/Charter\" title=\"Charter\">chartered</a> in 1930 as the Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild and in 1933 changed its name to the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. The name changed again in the 1990s where the word \"Handicraft\" was changed to just \"Craft\".\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">Great Depression</a> and in the 1930s the Guild cultivated commerce for craftspeople in the <a href=\"/wiki/Appalachia\" title=\"Appalachia\">Appalachian</a> region. Educational programming is another fundamental element of the organization's mission. The Guild began work with the National Park Service in 1942 when they opened a shop on the <a href=\"/wiki/Skyline_Drive\" title=\"Skyline Drive\">Skyline Drive</a> in Virginia.  Unfortunately, World War II gasoline rationing ended that for the duration.

She came to the Asheville region in 1890 to do educational and organizational work as a volunteer for the Presbyterian Home Mission Board.
