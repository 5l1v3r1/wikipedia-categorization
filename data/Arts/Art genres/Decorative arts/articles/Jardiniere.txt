Jardinière is a French word, from the feminine form of "gardener". Jardinière has three meanings:  Garden Urn, at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, UCLA. Jardinière by Govert-Marinus Augustijn, ca. 1900. Dragon jardinière at Kindrogan House, Enochdu, Scotland. A jardinière dish Gertrude Jekyll wrote: There are some English words which have no equivalent in French, but then there are a great many more French words ... for which we have no English. One of these is jardinière. Even in French it does not quite rightly express its meaning, because the obvious meaning of jardinière is female gardener, whereas what we understand by it ... is a receptacle for holding pot-plants.
