Feather flowers are artificial flowers created using feathers that are dyed, cut and shaped to resemble petals. Some artists are able to create very realistic looking flowers and leaves using feathers.   The art of creating feather flowers was mentioned as early as 1873 in a book called Art Recreations published by Shepard and Gill in Boston.  Nahuatl, translated as "Precious Feather Flower," is another name for Xochiquetzal, the Aztec god of beauty, sexual love, and household arts.
