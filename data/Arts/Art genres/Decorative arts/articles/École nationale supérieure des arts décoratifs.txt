The École nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ÉnsAD, also known as Arts Decos', École des Arts Décoratifs) is a public grande école of art and design of PSL Research University. The school is located in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris. The École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs played a major role in the development of the Art Deco design movement in the 1920s and in the creation of new design concepts. The School has an international reputation for its teaching in the fields of animation, photography, scenography, industrial design, communication design, interactive design, video, interior design, fashion, textile and engraving. The E.N.S.A.D. has its roots in the École royale gratuite de dessin (Royal Free School of Art) founded in 1766 by Jean-Jacques Bachelier, confirmed in 1767 by letters patent from Louis XV of France. Its founder's aim was to develop crafts relating to the arts in order to improve the quality of manufactured goods. Through a rigorous and demanding apprenticeship in the Arts, the school strove to combine technique and culture, intelligence and sensitivity, so as to enable the more gifted artisans to develop into creative artists. After several changes of name, in 1877 the school became the National School of Decorative Arts (École nationale des arts décoratifs) before taking its present name of ENSAD (École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs) in 1927.
