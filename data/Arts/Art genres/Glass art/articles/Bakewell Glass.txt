Bakewell Glass is glassware produced in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company that produced it was Bakewell & Ensell and, subsequently, Bakewell, Pears & Co.  Founded in 1808 by Englishman Benjamin Bakewell, the factory was renowned for its cut and engraved glass. Production lated until the company closed in 1882.  Bakewell is known as the father of the flint glass industry in the United States Another family member, John P. Bakewell, invented and patented the first known process for pressed glass in 1825, making possible mass production of glass for the first time. The company survived the Great Fire of Pittsburgh in 1845, but lost many of its early records.  A Bakewell Glass retrospective was curated by the Frick Art & Historical Center in 2005.
