A suncatcher or light catcher is a small, reflective glass or nacre piece that is hung indoors at windows to "catch the light" from a nearby source. A suncatcher is like the optical equivalent of a wind chime. Some designs are simple and abstract with perhaps some mobile-like chained elements, while more complex designs often evoke plants or animals. Many designs combine suncatchers with wind chimes. It is believed that suncatchers were first made by the Southwestern Native-Americans.  Suncatchers may be mass-produced, or created by hand, and can be of varying simplicity of design from an arts and crafts project to a professionally handmade glass sculpture.
