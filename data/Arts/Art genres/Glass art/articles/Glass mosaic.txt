Glass mosaic (Burmese: မှန်စီရွှေချ) is a traditional Burmese mosaic made with pieces of glass, used to embellish decorative art, structures, and furniture.  Glass mosaic is typically divided into two subcategories, hman gyan si (မှန်ကြမ်းစီ) and hman nu si (မှန်နုစီ).  The former is typically used to decorate the walls and ceilings of pagodas, while the latter is used to embellish furniture and accessories.  The art form originated in the 1500s during the Nyaungyan era.  Glass mosaic is often studded with gems and semi-precious stones.
