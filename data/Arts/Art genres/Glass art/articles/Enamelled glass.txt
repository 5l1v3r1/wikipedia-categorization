Enamelled glass is glass which has been decorated with vitreous enamel (powdered glass, possibly mixed with a binder) and then fired to fuse the glasses. It can produce brilliant and long-lasting colours, and be transparent, translucent or opaque.  It is similar to vitreous enamel on metal surfaces, but the supporting surface is glass. Glass may be enamelled by sprinkling a loose powder on a flat surface, painting or printing a slurry, or painting or stamping a binder and then sprinkling it with powder, which will adhere.  As with enamel on metal, gum tragacanth may be used to make sharp edges. Some modern techniques are much simpler than historic ones.  For instance, there now exist glass enamel pens.  Enamelled glass is often used in combination with gilding. Mica may also be added for sparkle.  Venetian enamelled glass was called smalto.  Mosque lamps are made of enamelled glass. They generally have lugs, from which they are suspended to light not only mosques, but also similar spaces such as madrassas and mausoleums.  They have a religious symbolism based on the Quranic verse of light, with which they are often calligraphed.  During the European Renaissance, expensive enamelled goblets were used as courtship and marriage gifts. These goblets were rarely used, and some have survived.  Glass painting involves painting on glass, with glass, making the finished work transparent.  Glass fusing is similar, but powders are not mixed into a paintable paste first; however, the result is similar.
