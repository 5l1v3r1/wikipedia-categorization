The banker's lamp (or Emeralite) is a style of electric table lamp characterised by a brass stand, green glass lamp shade and pull-chain switch (though modern versions may make use of alternate switch types). Other examples can feature different colors of glass. The first patent for a banker's lamp was filed on 11 May 1909 by Harrison D. McFaddin and were produced and sold under the brand name Emeralite ("emerald" and "light"). Emeralite lamp shades were produced by the J. Schreiber & Neffen factory located in the city of Rapot√≠n, Moravia.  Later competitors were sold as "Greenalite", "Verdelite" and "Amronlite".
