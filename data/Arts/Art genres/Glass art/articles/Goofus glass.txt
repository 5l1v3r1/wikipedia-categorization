Goofus glass is pressed glass which was decorated with cold, unfired paint in the early 20th century in America by several prominent glass factories. Because it was mass-produced and relatively cheap, it was given as a premium for buying things and awarded as prizes at fairs. It was the first carnival glass, preceding the iridized product known as carnival glass today. Articles produced included plates, bowls, vases, oil lamps, dresser sets, salt and pepper shakers and candle holders. The most common colors used were gold, red, and green, with gold usually being the predominant color. Major producers included Indiana Glass Company, Dugan Diamond Company and H. Northwood.  These companies produced pieces which consisted of lines of pressed glass known as intaglio and painted opalescent glass. The term "goofus" has come to refer more to the use of un-fired enamel decoration to a piece of pressed glass, rather than to the glass itself. The term generally excludes milk glass and painted jewelry, items produced after the 1930s, and items produced outside of the United States.
