On 1 November 1957 he appeared on the front page of <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Guardian\" title=\"The Guardian\">The Manchester Guardian</a></i> with his proposal for the Academy's Spring Exhibition the following year. Although Lowry had painted portraits before (cf. the 'Horrible Heads' series from the 1930s), <i>Portrait of Ann</i> was seen as a major departure from Lowry's stock images of industrial scenes and millscapes &#8212; not least because Lowry very rarely used women as his subjects. Lowry described the style of the painting as being \"modernist\", explaining that the sitter \"did not want her picture to be realistic; it had to be stylised.\" In common with Lowry's other oil paintings, <i>Ann</i> was executed using ivory black, vermilion, prussian blue, yellow ochre and flake white with no medium.\n</p><p>Upon its eventual exhibition, the painting was criticised by the art critic G.S. Whittet in the August 1958 edition of <i>The Studio</i> as having a \"crudely stylised face\", but it was not without its supporters; Nesta Ellis, writing for the <i>Sphinx</i> art journal, thought the painting \"gave the impression of an impassive yet willful woman\".<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
