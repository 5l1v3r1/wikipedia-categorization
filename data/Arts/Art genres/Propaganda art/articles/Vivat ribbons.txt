Vivat ribbons (German: Vivatb√§nder) were silk ribbons issued to raise money for the Red Cross in Germany and Austria  during World War I .  Ribbons had printed patriotic messages which celebrated battles and important events, as well as royalty and the military leaders. They were designed by many famous German artists of the period.  Most ribbons had the same size and followed the same design pattern with word "Vivat!" ("Long live!") printed on top, followed by unique text and graphic below.  The bottom of the ribbon showed "Zum Besten Des Roten Kreuzes; Verlag Amsler u. Ruthardt; Berlin W8" ("To the benefit of the Red Cross; Verlag Amsler & Ruthardt; Berlin W8") text, since they were released by the German Red Cross to raise funds for war relief. During World War I 200 thousands ribbons were sold   and they become popular collectors items.
