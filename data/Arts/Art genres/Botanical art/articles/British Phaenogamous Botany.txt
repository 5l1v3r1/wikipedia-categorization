 British Phaenogamous Botany is figures and descriptions of British flowering plants compiled by the botanist William Baxter. The six volumes were published in Oxford by J.H. Parker between 1832 and 1843.   The 509 hand-coloured copper-engraved plates were accompanied by botanical descriptions in 8vo. To illustrate this work on the British flora, Baxter employed two local artistsâ€”Isaac Russell (an Oxford glass painter) and C. Matthews. The plates were hand-coloured by Baxter's daughters and daughter-in-law.
