The Culture of Popular Laughter is a historical-anthropological theory devised by the literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin, first published in the book Rabelais and His World, based on observations of popular culture in the Renaissance. Bakhtin analysed François Rabelais' book Gargantua and Pantagruel and its portrayals of "grotesque realism" (i.e. celebrations of primary needs) and carnival in which social norms were subverted. The Culture of Popular Laughter combines two literary ideas developed by Bakhtin in the same work: the idea of "Grotesque body" and "Carnivalesque" debauchery. It is distinguished from each, however, by its applications outside literary theory. The idea of "Carnivalesque" was also created by Bakhtin and forms part of his wider theory of Popular Laughter. He argued that, during times of carnival such as the Feast of Fools, social norms were deliberately turned upside-down. The carnival then became a form of Safety-valve institution, which served a Structural-functionalist role to temporarily release stresses in the contemporary social system.   Bakhtin, however, argued that this form of system was "formalized" in the culture of the period as "popular laughter". The historian Gábor Klaniczay argued that the Culture of Popular Laughter stretched through all echelons of society and was certainly not restricted to the peasantry.  Bakhtin's theory has also been credited with bringing about a scholarly reassessement of the importance of popular culture in history.  The Culture of Popular Laughter was originally formulated based on the writings of Rabelais, but has also been applied in the interpretation of peasant scenes painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his descendants.   The example has also been applied to Japanese society.
