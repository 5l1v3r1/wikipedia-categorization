Big Top Ballet is a 2012 indie art game series developed for iOS, Android, OS X and Chrome  by Canadian developer VectorBloom. Coined as an alternative 'trippy' game featuring a custom composed soundtrack of electronica dubstep by musician and DJ, ill-esha. The game was originally crowdfunded in 2011 as a concept app for iOS and Android on Appbackr.com with a return of 54% earnings for the game's backrs. The aim of Game 1 of the series is to dress as many spinning 'paper' ballerinas as possible with floating costume pieces in 3D space. Players can orbit the stage space by using gyroscope tilt controls on mobile devices or arrow keys for the desktop or laptop computers. If a player drops too many costumes to the stage it's a game over. Added game play dimension occurs after so many ballerinas have been dressed that a butterfly appears on the stage. Touching the butterfly switches point of view to the butterfly that when driven through hoops cause the paper ballerinas to transform into butterflies themselves and ascend upwards to fly over a field. "Kaleidoscope" custom composed by ill-esha Competing in IndieCade 2012.
