McDonald's Video Game is an online Flash game created by the Italian group La Molleindustria.  It is an "anti-advergame", a satire of a company and its business practices.  McDonald's Video Game is a parody of the business practices of the corporate giant McDonald's, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. The game presents the player with four views, the farmland, the slaughterhouse, the restaurant, and the corporate HQ,  and through each of these views, decisions can be made which will affect the fate of the player's company. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to feed the player's cows genetically altered grain,  or plow over rainforests, or feed the player's cattle to other cattle (a practice known to spread mad cow disease). The player can also choose advertising strategies and public official corruption to counteract opponents of the player's actions. Some choices within the game, such as the opportunity to demolish villages or bribe public officials, paint the corporation in a negative light. These aspects of the game are unflattering to McDonald's, who issued a statement saying that the game "has no association with McDonald's, and is therefore a complete misrepresentation of our people and our values."  On some websites Molleindustria released a version of the game called Burger Tycoon, which is exactly the same except that it eliminates all mention of McDonald's such as the franchise logo and a bear replacing the Ronald McDonald mascot. This was done in order to avoid copyright sanctions. The game has been translated into nine languages; English, Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Danish, Turkish, Portuguese, French and German.
