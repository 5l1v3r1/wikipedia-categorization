Olfactory art is an art form that uses scents as a medium. Olfactory art includes perfume as well as other applications of scent. The art form has been recognised in art starting from 1980.  Marcel Duchamp was one of the first artists who pioneered with using scents in art.  In 1938, the poet Benjamin Péret roasted coffee behind screens at the Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme which was orchestrated by Marcel Duchamp, and was possibly one of the first true examples of olfactory art.

Spice Chess and Smell Chess relied on the use of spices or scented liquids in the pieces.  In Spice Chess, the black king was scented with asafetida, the black queen with cayenne, and the black bishops with cumin.  The white pieces included cinnamon pawns, nutmeg rooks, ginger knights and an anise white queen.  Self-Portrait in Scent, Sketch no. 1 was a 1994 exhibit by Clara Ursitti at The Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow, Scotland.  It consisted of a small, specially constructed room outfitted with motion sensors and scent dispensers.  Green Aria: A Scent Opera was an exhibit by Christophe Laudamiel at the Guggenheim that incorporated both over two dozen fragrances pumped through special "scent microphones" to 148 seats, accompanied by music.  Some scents were intended to invoke natural fragrances, while others were described as "Industrial" or "Absolute Zero".  LacrimAu was an exhibit by the Czech artist Federico Díaz at an exposition at Shanghai. An individual could enter a glass cube containing a 30 inch tall golden teardrop. After putting on a headband, the person's brainwaves would be read by sensors, which would translate them into a uniquely tailored scent. It was described as a "surprise hit".
