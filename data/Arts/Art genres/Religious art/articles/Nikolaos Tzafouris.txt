Nikolaos Tzafouris, also Niccolo, Niccolò, Niccolö, Zafuri, Zafuris, (active 1487 - 1501) was a Greek Renaissance painter of the Cretan School.  Not much is known about Tzafouris' life except through his works. He primarily painted religious-themed works for church commissions. Tzafouris is known from documents to have been working in the city of Candia (now Iraklion) in Crete. Five of his signed icons survive, which were executed in the maniera italiana, as practiced by Cretan painters for western commissions. One work executed by Nikolaos Tzafouris was a triptych Pietà with Saints Francis and Mary Magdalen which can be found at the Ashmolean Museum.  Another example of signed icon from Nikolaos Tzafouris, Christ Bearing the Cross,  is in the collection of Metropolitan Museum of Art NYC.
