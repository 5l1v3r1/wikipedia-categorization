Kid 'n Play is an animated cartoon series based on the real life hip-hop duo, Kid 'n Play.   It ran for one season on NBC from September 8, 1990 to December 8, 1990. On the show, Kid 'n Play were portrayed as teenagers, but their recording careers remained the same as in real life, as did their character traits. Production was by Marvel Productions and Saban Entertainment. The real Kid 'n Play appeared in live-action wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors took over for the animated versions of the duo.  The show stressed positive role models, teaching children how to get along with each other and stay out of trouble. Akin to the House Party films, Play was the less responsible member of the duo, cooking up get rich quick schemes, while Kid, the more responsible member, would usually be made to clean up messes. Oftentimes the issue would be resolved by the characters' girlfriends, or sometimes by an elderly jazz musician who wore a blue beret and was aptly named "Old Blue". The lessons ranged from serious to lighter fare. One of the "less serious" episodes dealt with Kid's father not understanding hip-hop and Kid not having the means to put it in a positive light, and Old Blue offers to help to sending Kid on a trip back in time to the era of jazz and speakeasies to help better understand its roots. In 1992, Marvel Comics published a comic book based on the cartoon. The comic book ran for nine issues.  The series was created by John Semper Jr. and Cynthia Friedlob who also served as the show-runners and head-writers. They would later go on to write Kid 'N Play's first live action feature film for a major studio, "CLASS ACT" for Warner Bros. Semper would later produce and be the head-writer for "Spider-Man: The Animated Series," for Marvel Films Animation.
