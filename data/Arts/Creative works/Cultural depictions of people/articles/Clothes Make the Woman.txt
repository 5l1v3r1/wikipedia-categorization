Clothes Make the Woman is a surviving 1928 American silent historical romantic drama film directed by Tom Terriss, and starring Eve Southern and Walter Pidgeon.  The film is loosely based on the story of Anna Anderson, a Polish woman who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the daughter of the last czar of Russia Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra.  Anastasia was killed along with her parents and siblings by communist Bolshevik revolutionaries on July 17, 1918.  Southern stars as Anastasia, a young Russian princess who is saved from execution by Victor Trent (Pidgeon), a Russian revolutionary. Victor risks his life to help Anastasia flee and the two part ways. Victor later makes his way to Hollywood unaware that Anastasia is also living in the city and attempting to become an actress. By this time, Victor is a popular film actor and producer. Victor sees Anastasia in a crowd of extras and recognizes her as the princess he had previously saved. He promptly casts her in a film about her life and casts himself as her leading man. During a scene reenacting the execution of her family, Victor accidentally shoots Anastasia but she soon recovers. The film ends with the marriage of Anastasia and Victor.
