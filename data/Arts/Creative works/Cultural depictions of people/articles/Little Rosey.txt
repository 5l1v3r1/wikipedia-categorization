Little Rosey is a Canadian animated television series produced by Nelvana that aired in the United States on Saturday Mornings on ABC. It was Roseanne Barr's first attempt at a cartoon.  Based loosely on comedian Roseanne's childhood, this animated series aired late in the day on ABC's Saturday morning lineup. Roseanne didn't voice her own character, although it is rumored she would have had a second season been produced. The series revolved an 8 year old Roseanne, her sister Tess, and best friend Buddy. The three would use their imaginations to overcome the obstacles they faced, such as spelling bees, family vacations, and rules that their parents forced upon them. Among the recurring cast were Rosey's parents, little sister Nonnie, baby brother Tater, and a pair of nemesis science nerds. Each episode was composed of two eleven-minute segments. After the first season, ABC execs told Roseanne that they needed to change a few things, such as adding more boys to the show, among other things. An agreement couldn't be made, and ABC cancelled the show before a second season could be produced, in which Roseanne would have taken over voicing her character. Two years later, an animated special called The Rosey and Buddy Show was produced as a prime-time special which aired on May 15, 1992, in which Rosey and Buddy invaded CartoonLand to take on the meddling execs who wanted to "change their show". The first 6 episodes are divided into 2 segments. The last 7 are 1 segment per episode.
