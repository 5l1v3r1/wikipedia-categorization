"Sous les pav√©s, la plage!"  (Under the paving stones, there is a beach!), is a slogan from the May 1968 protest movement in France. It was coined by student activist Bernard Cousin,  in collaboration with public relations expert Bernard Fritsch.  The phrase became a symbol of the events and popular movement during the spring of 1968, when the revolutionary students began to build barricades in the streets of major cities by tearing up street pavement stone.  As the first barricades were raised, the students recognized that the stone setts were placed on top of sand. The statement encapsulated the movement's views on urbanization and modern society in both a literal and metaphorical form.
