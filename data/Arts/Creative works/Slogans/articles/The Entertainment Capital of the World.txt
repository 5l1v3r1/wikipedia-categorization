The Entertainment Capital of the World is an advertising slogan first coined to refer to Los Angeles due to the presence of Hollywood, and the area's radio, television, music, and filmmaking, as well as the abundance of tourist and amusement attractions in the region. This title is also claimed by Las Vegas although sometimes also referring to itself as the Live Entertainment Capital of the World.  The slogan was billed on the sign at MGM Grand Las Vegas.
