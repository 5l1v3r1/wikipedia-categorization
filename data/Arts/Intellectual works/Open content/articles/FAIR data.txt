FAIR data is data which meets standards of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.  A March 2016 publication by a consortium of scientists and organizations called these the "FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship", using FAIR as an acronym and making the concept easier to discuss.  At the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit the G20 leaders issued a statement endorsing the application of FAIR principles to research.   The Association of European Research Libraries recommends the use of FAIR principles.
