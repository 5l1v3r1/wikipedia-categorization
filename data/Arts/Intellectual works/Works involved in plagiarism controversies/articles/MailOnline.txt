 MailOnline (also known as dailymail.co.uk) is the website of the Daily Mail, a newspaper in the United Kingdom, and of its sister paper The Mail on Sunday. MailOnline is a division of DMG Media, part of Associated Newspapers Ltd. Launched in 2003, MailOnline was made into a separately managed site in 2006 under the editorship of Martin Clarke and general management of James Bromley.   It is now the most visited English-language newspaper website in the world,  with over 11.34m visitors daily in August 2014.  The website has an international readership, featuring separate home pages for the UK, USA, India and Australia.   While the MailOnline maintains the conservative editorial stance of the print edition, much of the content featured on the website is produced exclusively for the MailOnline and is not published in the Daily Mail. It is known for its "sidebar of shame",   a box listing celebrity misdemeanours.  The Financial Times has suggested that "If you are tired of MailOnline, you are tired of Kim Kardashian’s life – and most readers are not";  conversely George Clooney has described it as "the worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers" after it published an untrue story about his fiancée's family.  The website reached 199.4 million unique monthly visitors in December 2014,  up from 189.52 million in January 2014 and 128.59 million in May 2013,  according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.  Globally, MailOnline is the most visited English-language newspaper website;  ComScore gave the site 61.6 million unique desktop computer visitors for January 2014, ahead of The New York Times  website, which received 41.97 million visitors in the same month.  According to ComScore, MailOnline recorded 100.5 million visitors across desktop computers, smartphones and tablets in that month.  In July 2014 it recorded 134 million users.  Almost 70% of its traffic comes from outside the UK, mostly from the United States.   The Daily Mail print newspaper has no presence there, but has aggressively targeted the country with its online offering, branded as the "Daily Mail" rather than MailOnline.  In January 2014 it paid over £1m to the Charleston Daily Mail for the domain name www.dailymail.com in order to increase its attractiveness to US advertisers.  In January 2014, it was ranked the eighth most-visited news website in Australia, up from 10 in December 2013.  Globally the site was forecast to reach £60m in advertising sales in the year to September 2014, up 49%.  £35m has been invested in creating the site.  The site has introduced sponsored articles, with a guarantee of 450,000 page views at a cost of £65,000 per article.  MailOnline features a broad mixture of international news, and carries mainly UK-focused coverage of sport, personal finance, travel, celebrity news, science and lifestyle editorial. As of September 2014, it employs 615 people, including 406 editorial staff.  These create over 750 articles per day,  the editorial stance of which broadly reflects that of the Daily Mail, being to the right wing of mainstream British politics and typically supporting the UK Conservative Party.   MailOnline articles tend to be dominated by pictures rather than long-form journalism.  A major component of the website is its entertainment news, often featuring celebrities such as Kim Kardashian  or members of the British Royal Family such as the Duchess of Cambridge.  It is estimated that 25% of the traffic received by the website is purely to access the entertainment and gossip stories.  The website allows users to create accounts in order to comment on articles, and also allows anyone to express anonymous approval or disapproval of comments made. The site also publishes statistics about this activity.   The house rules state that the monitors usually remove inappropriate content in full,  although they do reserve the right to edit comments.  The site also does not allow comments on some articles for legal or editorial reasons.  In March 2012, the Poynter Institute published an article criticising the MailOnline for failing to give proper attribution to the sources of some article content, and often reprinting paragraphs without permission or attribution. The article said that when the MailOnline is called out for stealing content, it will sometime removes the text in question without acknowledging or apologising for the problem.  Martin Clarke, editor of MailOnline, said, "We will soon be introducing features that will allow us to link easily and prominently to other sites when further recognition of source material is needed."  However, by July 2013, MailOnline articles, including main articles, still did not contain any links to original sources or tips.  In 2015, James King, who left the MailOnline after a year as a reporter, said that the editorial model of the Mail depended on "dishonesty, theft of copyrighted material, and sensationalism so absurd that it crosses into fabrication".  King worked as a contractor, and declined a full-time job because he did not want to put his byline on his stories.  In March 2014, MailOnline Sports was named Laureus Sports Website of the Year at the 2014 Sports Journalist Association awards.  2 In December 2013, the MailOnline Android mobile app, Daily MailOnline, was named one of "The Best Apps of 2013" in the UK by the Google Play store.  In 2013, the MailOnline was singled out for a Design Effectiveness Award by the British Design Business Association. Brand42, the British agency that designed the MailOnline, received a Gold and the Grand Prix for the 2008 revamp  at the annual Design Business Association's Design Effectiveness Awards. The Grand Prix is the top prize at the awards ceremony and is given to the design project that delivers the greatest commercial benefit.  In 2012, the MailOnline received the chairman's award for Online Media.  In 2012, the Daily Mail and MailOnline won "eight awards, including newspaper of the year, campaign of the year and hat-trick for Craig Brown". In 2011, the first year of the Online Media awards, MailOnline won for  "Best Brand Development."
