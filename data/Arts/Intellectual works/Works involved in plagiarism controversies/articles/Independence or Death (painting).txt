 The painting Independence or Death (Independência ou Morte in Portuguese), also known as the Cry of Ipiranga (Grito do Ipiranga in the original), is the main artwork representing the proclamation of Brazilian independence.  The artist Pedro Américo finished the painting in 1888 in Florence, Italy, 66 years after the proclamation of independence. The  Brazilian imperial house commissioned the work, due to investments into the construction of the Museu do Ipiranga (presently the Museu Paulista ). The goal of the artwork was to emphasize the monarchy.  There exists evidence that the painting is not an accurate description of the events on the shores of the Ipiranga Brook.
