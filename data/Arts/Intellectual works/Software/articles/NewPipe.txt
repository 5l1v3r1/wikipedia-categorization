NewPipe is a FOSS media player app, that is most well known as a YouTube Client. It is only available in the FOSS-only F-Droid  app store and therefore only installable on Android devices. It is often used as an alternative to the official YouTube app . NewPipe was originally released as Version 0.3 on 4 September 2015  and was originally developed by Christian Schabesberger.  NewPipe does not use the official YouTube API, but instead scrapes the website for video and meta-data (like upvotes, downvotes and views). This is done intentionally to decrease the amount of data shared with Google. The web-scraping tool is called the NewPipe-Extractor , and is a stand-alone project. It is also used in the app SkyTube.   In newer versions of the App, the Extractor supports both YouTube and SoundCloud, and there are plans to extend it to more platforms. Because of the way NewPipe accesses YouTube without using the API or displaying advertisements, it would be in conflict with the Google Terms of service, if it were available in the Google Play Store.
