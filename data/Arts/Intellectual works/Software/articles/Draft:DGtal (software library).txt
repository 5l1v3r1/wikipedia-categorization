DGtal (Digital Geometry tools and algorithms library) is a software library for digital geometry programming. Its main objective is to structure different developments from the digital geometry, topology and mathematical morphology communities  . It offers both geometrical and topological tools, and allows representation of images and objects in n-dimensional digital spaces   .  DGtal was used in a number of applications such as: digital integration and properties of digital objects , feature extraction , 3D CT image processing for evaluating timber , geometric estimators   . In 2016 the library was recognized by Symposium on Geometry Processing by its software award  . The library was partly developed with the financial support of ANR Project DigitalSnow and ANR Project CoMeDiC.
