The Instant Pot is a brand of electronically controlled, combined pressure cooker and slow cooker . It is marketed as a 7-in-1 kitchen appliance designed to consolidate the cooking and preparing of food to one device (multicooker). The concept of a multi-purpose cooker has been around since 2006 with the patent from the Midea Group, which would go on to manufacture the Instant Pot,  detailing the function and simple structure of what would become the Instant Pot.  In 2008, Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and one other friend, all former employees of Nortel in Ottawa, Canada, started working on designs for the Instant Pot.  Wang is credited as the inventor of the Instant Pot. This beginning model operated as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice / porridge cooker, yogurt maker, saut√© / searing pan, steamer, and food warmer.  This model was under development for 18 months. Double Insight Inc was founded by Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and three other partners in 2009.  They are the distributor and designers of the Instant Pot.   Wang has a PhD in computer science with a specialty in artificial intelligence. The company became profitable in 2012, with the Instant Pot as their main product. In 2016, Double Insight sold more than 215,000 Instant Pots on Amazon's Prime Day.   In July 2015 the Instant Pot Smart-60 cooker was recalled, affecting about 1140 units in the United States and Canada. The defect caused electric current to leak, which could potentially shock the product's user. There were four reported instances of this shock before it was recalled.  In February 2018, five production runs of Instant Pot Gem 65 8-in-1 Multicookers were recalled because they were overheating and subsequently melting due to a manufacturing issue.  In name, IP stands for "Instant Pot", followed by model (LUX, DUO, SMART, ULTRA and GEM). Instant Pots are manufactured by the Midea Group in GuangDong, China.
