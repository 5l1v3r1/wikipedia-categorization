Pokito is a type of collapsible, reusable coffee cup designed by Canadian inventor Andrew Brooks  in the United Kingdom. The cup is manufactured in England. Brooks is marketing the pokito cup though his company, Pocket Enterprises UK, and has completed a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to fund initial production. The Pokito Kickstarter campaign is in the top 1% of all time Kickstarter campaigns.  The cup adjusts to three sizes.    It flattens to about 4.5 cm in height when not in use, and so can be stored in a pocket or purse.  Remaining dregs of coffee are kept inside without leakage.   The pokito is designed to reduce the usage of disposable cups.  It also saves energy if the cup is used more than 15 times.    It is made of a rubbery plastic called thermoplastic elastomer which is FDA approved.  By the end of the campaign Brooks had raised Â£100,500 multiple times the original Kickstarter goal.  pokito.net
