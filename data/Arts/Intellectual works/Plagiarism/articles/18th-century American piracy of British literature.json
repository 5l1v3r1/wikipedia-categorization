During the 18th century, it was extremely common for British Literature to be reprinted across the Atlantic Ocean in America without any acknowledgment or payment given to the original author. This form of plagiarism, referred to as literary piracy, was not an easy action to control because of the immense distance between the two countries, and the lack of any real international law which would work to protect the original authors in England. It was not until 1988 that these international laws were truly set in place and able to be enforced with any form of consistency.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Early_piracy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early piracy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Establishment_of_copyright_laws\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Establishment of copyright laws</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#International_piracy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">International piracy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Notes_and_references\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes and references</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_piracy\">Early piracy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=18th-century_American_piracy_of_British_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Early piracy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although it is now believed to be a crime, plagiarism has not always been considered a negative action. Thoughts, ideas, and writing were considered public property, not something an individual was able to claim as their own <sup id=\"cite_ref-lynch_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lynch-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  The \u201dborrowing\u201d from others was thought of as a form of learning and was encouraged as an opportunity to enhance one's work. It was used as a stepping stone during the creative process. In order to create new stories, plots, and characters for a narrative, it was only natural for authors to look at what others before them had done.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Wrong_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Wrong-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The difference between this recycling of ideas and copying is that an author will add original material to the inspiration, not simply recopy what came prior. Borrowing was deemed acceptable if it is only part of the final result and has a distinct twist from the original piece.  A prime example of accepted plagiarism can be found in Shakespeare, who \u201cborrowed\u201d from other authors and playwrights of his day in order to create almost all of his now famous plays. The term plagiarism originally comes from the Latin word for thief, in this case, a literary thief.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Establishment_of_copyright_laws\">Establishment of copyright laws</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=18th-century_American_piracy_of_British_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Establishment of copyright laws\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>London was the first city where authors were able to rightly protect themselves and their ideas after the first copyright law, known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Statute_of_Anne\" title=\"Statute of Anne\">Statute of Anne</a>,  passed in 1710.<sup id=\"cite_ref-lynch_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lynch-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The specific purpose of this statute was \u201cthe encouragement of learned men to compose and write useful books\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-lynch_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lynch-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This act not only protected authors in Britain, it also worked to protect the authors who had works being brought across the Atlantic to be reprinted without receiving any compensation for their literature. In 1880 the first international copyright laws were proposed by Mr. Edward Thorton in order to prevent this piracy from occurring and establishing consequences if it did (5). This treaty gave British authors protection in America and vice versa, allowing for consequences to follow the rules for the country of original publication. Pirated copies of novels and musical pieces were prohibited. It took over 100 years after these laws were proposed for the United States to fully cooperate with them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-lynch_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lynch-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"International_piracy\">International piracy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=18th-century_American_piracy_of_British_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: International piracy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During the 18th century, the plagiarists and literary thieves (pirates) would bring British novels back to America, reprint them (with the original author\u2019s name in order to escape incrimination, but still using another author's work for their own personal gain), and yet never give the original author any compensation for their work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-lynch_2-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lynch-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This system fell into place largely because the nation did not have any real individual literary identity at that point in time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Phegley_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Phegley-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> During that period, the United States was still in the early stages of its independent development as a nation and most of what the new American public was comfortable with involved British culture and ideas. These pirated novels had already established a reputation and success in England and were therefore not a risk to publishers in the States, who already knew that there would likely be a success in the New World. In some cases, these pirated novels were more accessible in America than they were to the British where they were originally printed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Phegley_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Phegley-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Although novels were a large portion of the pirated works from England, magazines, and newspapers were included in the stolen works as well.\n</p><p>One primary example can be seen in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Harper%27s_New_Monthly_Magazine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Harper&#39;s New Monthly Magazine\">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</a></i>, a magazine that was aimed at women and attempted to create a patriotic attitude in the developing nation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Phegley_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Phegley-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Harper\u2019s ideas and strategies involved exposing these women to the British form of \"elevated\" culture in an effort to increase the standard and quality of the new American literature, which would result from the British inspiration they provided in their magazine. It was formerly believed that because of America's lack of a social class system, there would be no real need for a strong literary tradition. Harper's tried to expose the British tradition in order to facilitate growth for the American tradition. They sold for a low cost because there was no compensation being paid to the original authors back in England for the sole purpose of exposing every educated person in the new American public to \"the unbounded treasures of the periodical literature of the present day\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Phegley_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Phegley-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The important thing was not the actual content of the magazines or their national origin but more about how much circulation and exposure these pieces received. This feeling of inspiration eventually backfired when the American authors were intimidated by the intense connection and dependence on British authors and did not produce many.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Phegley_4-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Phegley-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Eventually, the resentment for the lack of Americanism led to a change in Harper's to include more national, not international, authors. This change never really paid off and the magazine did not see the same amount of success and profit that it received from the British pirated material.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_and_references\">Notes and references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=18th-century_American_piracy_of_British_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Notes and references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Guralnik, D: <b>Webster's New World Dictionary</b>, page 1087.
