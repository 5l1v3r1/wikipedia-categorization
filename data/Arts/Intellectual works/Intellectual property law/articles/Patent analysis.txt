Patent analysis is a family of techniques and tools for studying the information present within and attached to patents, a major form of intellectual property.  Although this has traditionally been done using spreadsheet-based data analysis methods, the field of intellectual property has witnessed a surge in the availability of software-based patent analysis tools.  The cost structure of most patent analysis tools varies from freemium business models to annual subscriptions.
