Notorious markets is a term used in the United States to describe websites and physical markets where large-scale intellectual property infringement takes place. Since 2006,  the members of the International Intellectual Property Alliance in conjunction with the Office of the United States Trade Representative has annually filed a list of Notorious Markets  as a part of their Special 301 Report to the U.S. federal government. It lists virtual markets (websites) and physical markets outside of the US where large scale copyright infringement takes place and recommends trade sanctions for countries with weak copyright protection enforcement. Since 2010 the list is separately issued as a part of an out-of-cycle review between the main report submissions.  Whilst the list of markets does not directly form national trade policy: The United States encourages the responsible authorities to step up efforts to combat piracy and counterfeiting in these and similar markets
