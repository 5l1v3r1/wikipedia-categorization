The Allied Powers (England and France) perceived <a href=\"/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst\" title=\"William Randolph Hearst\">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s INS to be unduly favorable to the Central Powers (Germany and Austria); therefore, the Allies barred INS from using Allied telegraph lines to report news; this effectively prevented INS from reporting war news.

But in a court of equity, where the question is one of unfair competition, if that which AP has acquired fairly at substantial cost may be sold fairly at substantial profit, a competitor who is misappropriating it for the purpose of disposing of it to his own profit and to the disadvantage of AP cannot be heard to say that it is too fugitive or evanescent to be regarded as property.

Some states, such as New Jersey and Wisconsin, and at times New York, have applied the doctrine more broadly to cover any conduct that the courts deemed \"immoral\" under open-ended, flexible, adaptable, capacious, and amorphous standards.\n</p><p>For example, the Second Circuit at one point spoke sweepingly of the scope of the New York misappropriation doctrine in these terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>New York courts have noted the incalculable variety of illegal practices falling within the unfair competition rubric, calling it a broad and flexible doctrine that depends more upon the facts set forth than in most causes of action. It has been broadly described as encompassing any form of commercial immorality, or simply as endeavoring to reap where one has not sown; it is taking the skill, expenditures and labors of a competitor, and misappropriating for the commercial advantage of one person a benefit or property right belonging to another. The tort is adaptable and capacious.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the determinative factor is \"whether the acts of a defendant are 'fair or unfair, according to principles recognized in equity, and not by 'the morals of the market place.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Similarly, New Jersey courts have said that state's unfair competition law is a matter of determining what is \"fair play.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> More generally, the Third Circuit said of New Jersey unfair competition law:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>New Jersey's common law of unfair competition does not have clear boundaries but is instead flexible and elastic as evolving standards of morality demand, and the essence of an unfair competition claim is the enforcement of fair play.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>New Jersey courts have therefore placed great focus on what they perceived to be the moral and ethical quality of the defendant's conduct.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> They recognize that their \"law of unfair competition is an amorphous area of jurisprudence. It knows no clear boundaries.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <i>Mercury Records Productions, Inc. v. Economic Consultants, Inc.</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that <i>INS</i> states the applicable law for Wisconsin: \"The unfair competition-misappropriation theory applied in <i>INS</i> .&#160;.&#160;. comports with the theory\" of the Wisconsin courts and \"is consistent with the public policy of the state of Wisconsin\"; that state policy is \"simply simply the principles of old-fashioned honesty,\" meaning that \"[o]ne man may not reap where another has sown nor gather where another has strewn.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>California, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Nouth Carolina, and Wisconsin applied the <i>INS</i> misappropriation doctrine to enjoin those copying records (so-called record piracy) during the period when federal copyright law did not cover sound recordings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>But those courts have applied the misappropriation doctrine, as well, to other forms of copying, such as copying of products. Many of these cases were decided before the Supreme Court's <i>Sears</i>, <i>Compco</i>, and <i>Bonito Boats</i> decisions, which have raised preemption issues as to some of these misappropriation decisions.\n</p><p>For example, in a 1940 case under New York law, the defendant copied the ornamental design of the plaintiff's silverplate as well as \"a similar system of advertising, copied at least in part by the defendant; and high pressure salesmanship in obtaining a wide market amongst dealers by offering attractively a greater number of pieces in a set of inferior quality at a much lower price,\" while pointing out to the dealers that they could sell the defendant's silverware to customers instead of the plaintiff's because \"purchasers would readily believe that the old pattern or a new one of similar type was being offered at a bargain.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> In this manner, the defendant succeeded in \"attracting the interest of a class having some knowledge of patterns but being largely uninformed and undiscriminating concerning the quality of the wares and the reputation and business standing of different manufacturers, who are attracted by offers of a bargain.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> The court held that this was unfair competition, under the standard that \"whether the acts of a defendant are 'fair or unfair, [must be judged] according to principles recognized in equity, and not by 'the morals of the market place.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>In another New York case, the defendant copied the plaintiff's unpatented, uncopyrighted \"Mustard Seed Remembrancer\" locket, containing a mustard seed to remind users of the power of \"so much faith as a grain of mustard\" to move mountains (<i>Matt</i>. 17:20). The court found misappropriation under the <i>INS</i> doctrine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> It also cited and relied upon the concept of unfair competition described in the preceding silverplate case. The court specifically declined to follow the <i>Kellogg</i> decision, discussed earlier.<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1985, in a subsequent case under New York law, involving the copying of ornamental jewelry designs, the defendant asserted preemption as a defense. The district court opined in <i>dicta</i>\u2014\"Were Gemveto's claim predicated solely upon Cooper's having copied plaintiff's jewelry designs [<i>i.e.</i>, New York misappropriation law] the claim perhaps would be preempted by federal law.\" But \"there was proof not only that Cooper copied Gemveto's products but of a deliberate attempt by Cooper to deceive the consuming public as to the source of its \"knockoffs\" and thereby to appropriate the goodwill or reputation of Gemveto, a rival seller.\" Therefore, it was proper to enjoin the defendant under New York's law against palming off, the district court ruled, without reaching the issue of whether federal copyright or patent law preempted New York's misappropriation law against product imitation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> On appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against copying, because it was insufficiently clear as to what palming-off activity the defendant was prohibited from engaging in. The final order by the district court permanently enjoined Cooper \"from selling or offering for sale any item of jewelry that is confusingly similar in appearance to any item of plaintiff's jewelry such that the sale or offer for sale of such item, <i>by any method or means, is calculated to deceive the public as to its source</i>....\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> But \"the <i>Sears</i> and <i>Compco</i> decisions .&#160;.&#160;. hold that copying of the article itself that is unprotected by the federal patent and copyright laws cannot be protected by state law,\" the Second Circuit stated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> To avoid colliding with <i>Sears-Compco</i>, the district court had to enter an order with \"an appropriate re-wording of the injunction to specify Cooper's acts which would, if not enjoined, constitute palming-off under New York common law.\" The court ruled that the injunction must be directed against deceptive conduct (palming off), not the nature of the product; under <i>Compco</i>, for example, the defendant had a right to make a confusingly similar jewelry item, so long as it did not engage in deceptive palming off.<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A much more recent jewelry-copying case under New York law appears to state the current view of New York's misappropriation law, as applied to both patent and copyright preemption (outside the \"hot news\" field):\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>In order to avoid preemption, that which is claimed to be unfair competition must be something different from copying, or the fruits of copying, or the intent or bad faith that can be inferred from the act of copying; if the harm [to plaintiff] arises from the simple fact of copying, the claim falls within the Copyright Act [or patent law] and is preempted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>When the claim is in substance based on mere copying, it will be dismissed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> More generally, the Second Circuit has said of preemption and the misappropriation doctrine:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[W]e believe that <i>Metropolitan Opera</i> 's broad misappropriation doctrine based on amorphous concepts such as \"commercial immorality\" or society's \"ethics\" is preempted. Such concepts are virtually synonymous for wrongful copying and are in no meaningful fashion distinguishable from infringement of a copyright.<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Other circuits have treated the misappropriation doctrine and preemption boundary similarly to the Second Circuit's line of cases. They require the state-law claim to be based on something significantly or \"qualitatively\" extra, beyond mere copying of the plaintiff's product or service to avoid preemption.<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup> Many of these cases hold that \"commercial immorality\" plus copying is no more than copying alone for preemption purposes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-49\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Misappropriation_doctrine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><span style=\"color:blue;font-size:90%\">The citations in this Article are written in <b>Bluebook</b><br />style.
