Technology fusion involves a transformation of core technologies. An example is the fusion of mechanical and electronic engineering to create mechatronics. The fusion of technologies goes beyond mere combination. Fusion is more than complementarism, because it creates a new market and new growth opportunities for each participant in the innovation... It blends incremental improvements from several (often previously separate) fields to create a product.
