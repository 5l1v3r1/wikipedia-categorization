{"parse":{"title":"Global Release Day","pageid":48782520,"revid":804232470,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Global Release Day</b> (alternatively known as <b>New Music Fridays</b>) is a new set international day for releasing of music singles and albums. The new global release day went into effect on 10 July 2015 in more than 45 major recorded music markets worldwide with new music being released on a <a href=\"/wiki/Friday\" title=\"Friday\">Friday</a> as part of 'New Music Fridays'. \n</p><p>The official announcement was made on 11 June 2015 by <a href=\"/wiki/International_Federation_of_the_Phonographic_Industry\" title=\"International Federation of the Phonographic Industry\">International Federation of the Phonographic Industry</a> (IFPI), which represents the worldwide recording industry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-billboard_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-billboard-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The move means that new music will be available on the same day worldwide rather than on varying national release days, being Mondays for releases in France and the United Kingdom, Tuesdays in United States and Canada and Fridays, for example in Germany and Australia.\n</p><p>Music releases are now uniformly available around the world on Fridays at 00:01 local time in all 45 signatory countries. Of these, 11 countries had their release music on Fridays, while the remaining markets had to switch their day of release when the new albums and singles would become available. This move effectively ends the earlier phenomenon where new music was unavailable in one country when it was legally available elsewhere.<sup id=\"cite_ref-charts_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-charts-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>However, in some countries, particularly in Asia, local music repertoire will still be released on different days. For instance, in Japan domestic acts will continue to release new music on Wednesdays, two days earlier than international repertoire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-billboard_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-billboard-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The move has changed earlier traditional days where charts were being published as the official country charts try to adapt to the new \"global day\" for releases such that they capture a full week's sales and streaming from Friday mornings to Thursday nights. The UK Top 100, for example, published by <a href=\"/wiki/Official_Charts_Company\" title=\"Official Charts Company\">The Official Charts</a> moved from being published on a Sunday to a Friday with the <a href=\"/wiki/BBC\" title=\"BBC\">BBC</a> moving its new Top 40 charts program from Sundays at 4 p.m. local time to Fridays at 4 p.m. local time.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Global_Release_Day&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-billboard-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-billboard_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-billboard_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Smirke, Richard. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6591060/global-release-day-launch-set-for-july\">\"Global Release Day Launch Set for July\"</a>, <i>Billboard</i> magazine, June 11, 2015</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-charts-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-charts_2-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\">Rob Copsey (10 June 2015). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/global-release-day-new-music-fridays-and-the-official-chart-to-kick-off-your-weekend-from-next-month__9801/\">\"Global Release Day: New Music Fridays and The Official Chart to kick off your weekend from next month\"</a>.
