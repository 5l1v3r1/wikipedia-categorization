In the Hollywood movie industry, a four-quadrant movie is one which appeals to all four major demographic "quadrants" of the moviegoing audience: both male and female, and both over- and under-25s.  Films are generally aimed at at least two such quadrants, and most tent-pole films are four-quadrant movies. A film's budget is often correlated to the number of quadrants the film is expected to reach, and movies are rarely produced if not focused on at least two quadrants.  Although four-quadrant movies are generally family-friendly, this is not a requirement.  Some other genres meeting this may be romantic (such as Titanic and Meet the Parents) or horror films (The Exorcist), or be crowd-pleasing in nature,   such as high-profile action films or adaptations of popular novels. Four-quadrant movies often have both adult and child protagonists.  They are often built on a "high-concept" premise with well-delineated heroes and villains, with emotion, action and danger present in the story.
