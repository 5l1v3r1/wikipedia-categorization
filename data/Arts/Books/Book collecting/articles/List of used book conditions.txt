Booksellers use standard terms to describe the condition of the used books that they sell. The set of terms below were proposed in 1949 by AB Bookman's Weekly. They were adopted by the bookselling community and are still in use today.     In all cases, the lack of a dust jacket should be noted if the book was issued with one. The same applies to other possible accessories, such as inlays (like errata lists, cards, photo prints, PCBs), foldouts (like maps), media (like diskettes, CDs, DVDs) etc. There is no standard term for books in a condition below poor. Their normal fate is to be discarded or to be broken into individual pages if these have any value. With the advent of the internet AB Bookman's Weekly magazine declined and its place was taken by the internet listing services starting with Interloc in 1994. These services, for their own purposes, have made  modifications to this list. Amazon adds the terms "acceptable", for example.
