The Singerman list is a numeric cataloging system for antisemitica items, as defined by the 1982 bibliographic listing, Antisemitic Propaganda: an annotated bibliography and research guide by Robert Singerman. The list consists of a chronological listing, by year at least, of books, pamphlets, and other sorts of texts, with full bibliographic information. In addition each item is assigned a unique 4-digit number with a short, paragraph-length, annotation. For example, "Singerman 0121" identifies uniquely a particular imprint of The Jewish Bolshevism. Most imprints of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, not just first editions, that were published in Europe or the United States are listed and uniquely identified, as are many other noteworthy antisemitic publications. The book's foreword is by Colin Holmes. As of 2007, the work is out of print. The book is used extensively by rare book dealers and antiquarians specializing in antisemitica in precisely identifying first editions and rare books or imprints sought after by book collectors.
