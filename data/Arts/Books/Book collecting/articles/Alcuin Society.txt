A voluntary association established in 1965 by Geoff Spencer, the Alcuin Society is a non-profit organisation founded for the book arts. It is located in Canada. It should not be confused with the Alcuin Club, an Anglican publishing society.  Among the other six founding members is Basil Stuart-Stubbs.  The society is named after the Alcuin of York.  Since 1996, the society has awarded an Annual Award for Excellence in Book Design.  In 2007, the society started awarding the Robert R. Reid Award and Medal for lifetime achievement or extraordinary contributions to the book arts in Canada.
