The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy is a non-fiction book by Robin Moore first published in 1969 about the notorious "French Connection" drug trafficking scheme. It is followed by the book The Setup. The book was adapted to film in 1971 as The French Connection, written by Ernest Tidyman and directed by William Friedkin. The story follows the exhausting investigation of New York City detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso as they attempt to uncover the participants of a major drug ring.  Acting on a hunch, the detectives begin surveillance on Pasquale "Patsy" Fuca, who was observed in a nightclub consorting with known criminals.  It soon becomes apparent that Fuca is involved in a large drug trafficking operation, including two Frenchmen: Jean Jehan, the main person responsible for importing the heroin shipment to the United States, and Jacques Angelvin, a television personality.
