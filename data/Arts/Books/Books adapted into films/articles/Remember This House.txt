Remember This House is an unfinished manuscript by James Baldwin, a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.   Following Baldwin's death, publishing company McGraw-Hill sued his estate to recover the $200,000 advance they had paid him for the book, although the lawsuit was dropped by 1990.  The manuscript forms the basis for Raoul Peck's 2016 documentary film I Am Not Your Negro.  In February 2017, Vintage International published the book I Am Not Your Negro to accompany the documentary.
