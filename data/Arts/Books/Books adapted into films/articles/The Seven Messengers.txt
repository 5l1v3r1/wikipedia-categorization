The Seven Messengers (Italian: I sette messaggeri) is a collection of short stories written by Dino Buzzati and published as a book in 1942. It contains nineteen short tales, in which the characters often interact with the presence of the fantastic and/or death, many of which are left unconcluded, leaving the reader in suspense or trying to guess their ending. "The Seven Messengers" is also the name of the book's first short story. The story "Sette piani" was the basis for the 1967 film The Seventh Floor.
