  Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives is a 2016 non-fiction book by Gary Younge about 10 American children and teenagers killed by guns in a 24-hour timespan.           Younge explores how the deaths are normal by American standards—in that none made national news—but not normal by civilized standards. It was published by Nation Books. David Oyelowo will star in the film adaptation of the book.
