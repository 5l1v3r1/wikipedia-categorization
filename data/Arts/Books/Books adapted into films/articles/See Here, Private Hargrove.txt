See Here, Private Hargrove (1942) is a book by journalist Marion Hargrove about the author's experiences as a soldier in the U.S. Army during World War II. The light-hearted book was a hit with readers,  and spent 15 weeks atop the New York Times best-seller list. It was still in print 50 years after its original publication date.  The book was made into a movie of the same name, starring Robert Walker, Donna Reed, Keenan Wynn, Chill Wills, and Robert Benchley. This was followed by What Next, Corporal Hargrove? in 1945. Lloyd Shearer, who later became a gossip columnist, was mentioned in the book. Elaine Woo of the Los Angeles Times wrote that therefore Shearer "gained some notoriety".[further explanation needed]
