In 1905, Francis Yeats-Brown, then a young cavalryman, arrives in Bengal to serve in the 17th Bengal Lancers. He quickly discovers that life in the presence of his fellow soldiers is anything but boring. When not on active duty, he spends his time riding horses around the countryside, hunting boars and smoking tobacco. In addition to all this, Yeats-Brown begins to write about his exploits in India and the life of a Bengal lancer. In the middle of all this, he falls in love with "Masheen", a local woman with a talent for dancing, with whom he begins an affair. Their love becomes known as "his forbidden love affair" within his regiment. The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)
