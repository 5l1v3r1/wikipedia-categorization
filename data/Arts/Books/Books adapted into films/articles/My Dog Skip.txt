My Dog Skip is a memoir by Willie Morris published by Random House in 1995. My Dog Skip is the story  about nine-year-old Willie Morris growing up in Yazoo City, Mississippi, a tale of a boy and his dog in a small, sleepy Southern town that teaches us about family, friendship, love, devotion, trust and bravery. Willie and Skip's relationship goes beyond that of owner and dog, but is a relationship recognized and celebrated by the entire town. In 2000, the book was made into a film of the same name. Although Skip was a Fox Terrier, a number of Jack Russell terriers were used in filming, two of which were Moose, and Moose's son Enzo who both portrayed Eddie on NBC's sitcom Frasier. The original dog in the book, Skip, was actually a Smooth Haired Fox Terrier, and not a Jack Russell portrayed in the movie.
