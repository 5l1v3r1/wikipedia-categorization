Escape from Alcatraz is a 1963 non-fiction book, written by J. Campbell Bruce, about the history of Alcatraz Penitentiary and the escape attempts made by the inmates. It was revised in 1976 and again in 2005. Portions of this book concern the escape of Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin, which was the basis for the film Escape from Alcatraz in 1979.
