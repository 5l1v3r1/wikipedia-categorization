Across the Wide Missouri, With an Account of the Discovery of the Miller Collection  is a 1947 book by American historian Bernard DeVoto.  It is the second volume of a trilogy that includes The Year of Decision (1942) and The Course of Empire (1952). Across the Wide Missouri is a history of the fur trade in the American West, during its peak in the 1830s.  The trapping of beaver and other animals caused conflicts between the trappers and the various Native American tribes of the Upper Missouri River Basin. The book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1948  and was adapted as an eponymous 1951 film starring Clark Gable.
