The Federation of Children's Book Groups is a national charity in the United Kingdom that promotes children's books and reading for pleasure for all ages of children, from newborns to teenagers. The organisation is run by volunteers interested in supporting children and their books, both at a national level, through an executive, and a local level, through local groups, with the support also of individuals and professional members. The Federation liaises with publishers, libraries, schools and other bodies with an interest in literacy, reading and young people.  The Federation owns and coordinates the Red House Children's Book Award, the UK's only national book award voted for entirely by children.

The Federation regularly publishes booklists for children of different ages, as well as producing newsletters three times a year, and providing general advice and information on children's books and reading for enjoyment.
