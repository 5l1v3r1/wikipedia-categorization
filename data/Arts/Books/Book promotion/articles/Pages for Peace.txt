Pages for Peace is a book created as an after school enrichment program by the Groton-Dunstable Regional Middle School in Groton, Massachusetts.  The group created the second largest book in the world (by physical dimensions).  The subject of the book they have chosen to create is World Peace. This enrichment program was created by 5th grade teacher Betsy Sawyer.   Pages for Peace consists of recollections and reflections on the topic of World Peace from people all over the world. In October 2004 eight 5th grade students joined Pages for Peace becoming its first members. In late 2007 members of Pages for Peace visited The University of Massachusetts Lowell to create the page turner for the book. In September 2008 members of Pages for Peace visited the United Nations headquarters in New York City to give a presentation to the annual international youth conference, and have been invited back every year since (as of 2016).  In June 2010, Pages for Peace was awarded the Peace Abbey's "Courage of Conscience" award, which had previously been awarded to Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama.  The group received the honor of meeting and speaking with the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2015, a decade into the project. In October 2014, Pages for Peace went to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum to begin its world tour, and the event even featured a personal video message of the United Nations Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon.
