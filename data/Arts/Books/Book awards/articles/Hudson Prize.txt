The Hudson Prize is an American literary award for a collection of poetry or fiction.  The award is administered by Black Lawrence Press. It was previously awarded, under a different endowment, as the Ontario Prize.  Poets & Writers magazine has consistently listed it as a "top ten" literary prize in its annual rankings.    It is the largest and longest-running single category/multiple genre book prize in the United States.  In 2013, three of the 25 recipients of National Endowment for the Arts grants were past winners of the Hudson Prize.
