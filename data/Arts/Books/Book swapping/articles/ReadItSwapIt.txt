ReadItSwapIt (RISI) was a book exchange website co-founded in 2005 by Andrew Bathgate and Neil Ferguson of London, UK.  And closed in Sept 2017. It facilitated direct swapping of books among its members in the UK. ReadItSwapIt operated a "direct swap" method of exchange, where a single book belonging to one member was exchanged for a single book belonging to another member. This is contrast to other book swap sites, which offer a credit-based system of exchange.
