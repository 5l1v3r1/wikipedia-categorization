I, Lucifer is the third studio album by British band The Real Tuesday Weld and was released in 2003. It was intended as a companion soundtrack to the novel I, Lucifer by Glen Duncan. "Bathtime In Clerkenwell" is the song used by Alex Budovsky in the short animation "Bathtime in Clerkenwell".  At least four different versions of the album exist - the first incarnation on Dreamy Records, the second on PIAS recordings in Europe and the third on Six Degrees in the US. A picture-disc vinyl release accompanied the 2004 PIAS re-release of the album. Each version of the album features different sequencing and different mixes of the tracks "Bathtime in Clerkenwell" and "The Ugly & The Beautiful".  Additionally, the entire album was newly remixed for its U.S. release in 2004. It was awarded album of the week in the UK Times and Telegraph and has generally been critically lauded.
