A number of musical CDs have been created for the media franchise built around Eiichir≈ç Oda's manga One Piece. Various theme songs and character songs were released on a total of 49 singles. Many of them were also released in collected form on the eight compilation albums or the 16 soundtrack CDs, along with background music from the anime television series, the series' feature films, and video games. The anime television series currently consists of 36 pieces of theme music; eighteen opening themes and eighteen ending themes. As of episode 279, ending themes were omitted and, starting from episode 326 onwards, opening themes were extended from 110 seconds long to 150 seconds long. In episodes 1-206 of Funimation's English-language release of the series, the opening and ending themes were dubbed into English by various voice actors, before reverting to the Japanese versions from episodes 207 onwards. The sub-lists on compilation albums and singles list the releases peak position in Oricon's weekly charts as well as the length of the release's chart run in weeks. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network states that "One Piece has always stood out for its use of music", which they describe as a "usual mix of trumpeting pirate bombast, rocking action music, and catchy individual themes".  Margaret Veira of Active Anime states that the anime television series's "background music sets the mood and the scenes perfectly."
