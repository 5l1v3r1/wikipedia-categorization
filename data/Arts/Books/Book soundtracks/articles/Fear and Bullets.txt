Fear and Bullets is an album created through a collaboration between James O'Barr and longtime friend John Bergin as a soundtrack to O'Barr's graphic novel The Crow. It was originally released in 1994 along with a limited edition hardcover copy of the graphic novel.  The release also coincided with the publicity received from the film. In 1999, Fear and Bullets was re-released with a new cover, almost all the songs completely re-recorded or remixed, and the addition of two new tracks (but other two were removed).   The release included previously unreleased drawings by O'Barr.
