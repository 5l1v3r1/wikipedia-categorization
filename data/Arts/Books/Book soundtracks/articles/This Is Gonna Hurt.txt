This Is Gonna Hurt is the second studio album by Sixx:A.M., a side project of Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx, released on May 3, 2011. Like the first album which served as a companion soundtrack to Nikki Sixx' first book The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star, this album is a companion to the book of the same name, Sixx's second book, which was released on April 12, 2011. However, unlike its predecessor, this album does not contain any spoken word. Walmart refused to stock the album in stores because of the album's cover art, which features a heart with nails through it.
