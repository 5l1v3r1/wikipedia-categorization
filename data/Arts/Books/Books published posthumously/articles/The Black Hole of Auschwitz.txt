The Black Hole of Auschwitz is a collection of essays by the Italian author Primo Levi. Originally published under the Italian title Asymmetry and Life it has two distinct halves. The first half, The Black Hole of Auschwitz is a collection of essays, often prefaces to other books, which make a plea against holocaust denial. The second half Other People's Trades are a mixture of essays on a wide variety of subjects. All of these works were collected together in the production of Levi's Italian anthology of works Opere in 1997. PART I: THE BLACK HOLE OF AUSCHWITZ Deportees.
