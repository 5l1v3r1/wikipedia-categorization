Daisy-Head Mayzie is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and illustrated in his style. It was published in 1995, after Seuss's death. It was republished on July 5, 2016 with Seuss's original drawings. The book is about a 12-year-old warmhearted schoolgirl named Mayzie who one day suddenly sprouts a bright white daisy from her head. It causes alarm in her classroom, family, and town, until an agent makes her a celebrity. The Cat in the Hat who serves as the narrator to this story helps Mayzie to understand her problem and persuade her to go back home. The book has a mini-song titled "Daisy-Head Mayzie" which her classmates chant. In 1995, prior to its actual publication, the book was adapted into a special for television on TNT. The special, which was produced by Hanna-Barbera, can be found as a bonus feature on the Horton Hears a Who! Deluxe Edition DVD. In 2011, Daisy-Head Mayzie was made a meetable character at Seuss Landing at Universal's Islands of Adventure. In 2016, after the popularity of What Pet Should I Get?, the book was republished with Seuss' original text and illustrations. As such, there are several differences between the editions.
