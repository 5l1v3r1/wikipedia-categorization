{"parse":{"title":"Musaeum Clausum","pageid":360240,"revid":842839865,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><i><b>Musaeum Clausum</b></i> (<a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a> for <i>Sealed Museum</i>), also known as <i><b>Bibliotheca abscondita</b></i>, is a <a href=\"/wiki/Tract_(literature)\" title=\"Tract (literature)\">tract</a> written by Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Browne\" title=\"Thomas Browne\">Thomas Browne</a> which was first published posthumously in 1684. The tract contains short sentence descriptions of supposed, rumoured or lost books, pictures, and objects. The subtitle describes the tract as an inventory of <i>remarkable books, antiquities, pictures and rarities of several kinds, scarce or never seen by any man now living</i>. Its date is unknown: however, an event from the year 1673 is cited.\n</p><p>Like his <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pseudodoxia_Epidemica\" title=\"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\">Pseudodoxia Epidemica</a></i>, <i>Musaeum Clausum</i> is a catalogue of doubts and queries, only this time, in a style which anticipates the 20th-century <a href=\"/wiki/Argentina\" title=\"Argentina\">Argentinian</a> short-story writer <a href=\"/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges\" title=\"Jorge Luis Borges\">Jorge Luis Borges</a> who once declared: \"To write vast books is a laborious nonsense; much better is to offer a summary as if those books actually existed.\"\n</p><p>Browne however was not the first author to engage in such fantasy. The French author <a href=\"/wiki/Rabelais\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rabelais\">Rabelais</a> in his epic <i><a href=\"/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel\" title=\"Gargantua and Pantagruel\">Gargantua and Pantagruel</a></i> also penned a list of imaginary and often obscene book titles in his \"Library of Pantagruel,\" an inventory which Browne himself alludes to in his  <i><a href=\"/wiki/Religio_Medici\" title=\"Religio Medici\">Religio Medici</a></i>.\n</p><p>As the 17th century <a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_revolution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scientific revolution\">scientific revolution</a> progressed the popularity and growth of antiquarian collections, those claiming to house highly improbable items grew. Browne was an avid collector of antiquities and natural specimens, possessing a supposed <a href=\"/wiki/Unicorn\" title=\"Unicorn\">unicorn</a>'s horn, presented to him by <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Dee\" title=\"Arthur Dee\">Arthur Dee</a>. Browne's eldest son <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Browne_(physician)\" title=\"Edward Browne (physician)\">Edward</a> visited the famous scholar <a href=\"/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher\" title=\"Athanasius Kircher\">Athanasius Kircher</a>, founder of the <i>Museo Kircherano</i> at <a href=\"/wiki/Rome\" title=\"Rome\">Rome</a> in 1667, whose exhibits included an engine for attempting <a href=\"/wiki/Perpetual_motion\" title=\"Perpetual motion\">perpetual motion</a> and a <a href=\"/wiki/Brazen_head\" title=\"Brazen head\">speaking head</a>, which Kircher called his <i>Oraculum Delphinium</i>. He wrote to his father of his visit to the <a href=\"/wiki/Jesuit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jesuit\">Jesuit</a> priest's \"closet of rarities\".\n</p><p>Early museums such as Kircher's were private affairs - wooden arks or cabinets where antiquarians kept collections of curious objects. The intellectual collector of such curiosities was the forerunner of today's professional natural historian and scientist. Physicians in particular took an interest in natural history. One of the best known early collectors was <a href=\"/wiki/Hans_Sloane\" title=\"Hans Sloane\">Hans Sloane</a>. Distinguished in medicine and science, Sloane was President of both the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Society\" title=\"Royal Society\">Royal Society</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians\" title=\"Royal College of Physicians\">Royal College of Physicians</a>. The books and objects he collected, including those auctioned from the libraries of Thomas Browne and his son Edward in 1711, became the foundation of the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Museum\" title=\"British Museum\">British Museum</a>.\n</p><p>The sheer volume of book-titles, pictures and objects listed in <i>Musaeum Clausum</i> is testimony to Browne's fertile imagination. However, his major editors, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Simon_Wilkins&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Simon Wilkins (page does not exist)\">Simon Wilkins</a> in the nineteenth century (1834) and Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Geoffrey_Keynes\" title=\"Geoffrey Keynes\">Geoffrey Keynes</a> in the twentieth (1924) summarily dismissed it. Keynes considered its humour too erudite and \"not to everyone's taste.\"\n</p><p>Browne's miscellaneous tract may also be read as a parody of the rising trend of private museum collections with their curios of doubtful origin, and perhaps also of publications such as the so-called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Musaeum_Hermeticum\" title=\"Musaeum Hermeticum\">Museum Hermeticum</a></i> (1678), one of the last great anthologies of alchemical literature, with their divulging of near common-place alchemical concepts and symbols.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External
