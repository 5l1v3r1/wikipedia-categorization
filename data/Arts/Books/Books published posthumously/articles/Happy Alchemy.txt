Happy Alchemy, first published by McClelland and Stewart in 1997, is a collection of writings by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. The collection was edited after Davies' death in 1995 by his literary executors: his wife Brenda and daughter Jennifer . Happy Alchemy consists of various of Davies' unpublished speeches, book reviews and essays . It touches on themes, subjects and interests that were near to Davies' heart: in particular, theatre, opera and music. The book opens with a quotation from the English poet Matthew Green:"By happy alchemy of mind They turn to pleasure all they find." Happy Alchemy was preceded in 1996 by a companion volume, The Merry Heart.
