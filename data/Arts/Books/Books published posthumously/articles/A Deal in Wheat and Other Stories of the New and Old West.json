takes place in rural <a href=\"/wiki/Kansas\" title=\"Kansas\">Kansas</a>. Sam Lewiston leaves his wife, Emma, home on the ranch while he goes into town one last time to try to sell his wheat to Bridges &amp; Co., Grain Dealers before being forced out of the market. At sixty-two cents a bushel, Lewiston can no longer afford to raise wheat and must take a job with his wife\u2019s brother in Chicago.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>II.\tThe next section, \"The Bull- Wheat at a Dollar-Ten\", introduces the two main players of the Chicago-run wheat business, the bear and the bull: Treslow and Hornung. When Treslow had let the price fall to sixty-two cents, Hornung had almost run him out of business. Instead, Mr. Gates makes a deal with Treslow, on behalf of Hornung, to sell him one hundred thousand bushels for export at $1.10 each.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>III. Hornung has grown to dominate wheat sales at $1.50 a bushel. One day in \"The Pit\", a mysterious man named Kennedy sells one thousand bushels to three of Hornung\u2019s men: Going, Kimbark, and Merriam. They get word that a total of twenty-five thousand bushels are being sold in Chicago by someone other than Hornung. Hornung instructs them to continue buying but, with The Bear supposedly out of the market, they do not know who they are buying from.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>IV. The fourth section, \"The Belt Line\", takes place in Hornung\u2019s home. His broker, Billy, and a detective named Cyrus Ryder are there to discuss the now eighty thousand bushels he has purchased. Ryder reveals that the bushels are the same ones that Treslow had purchased to export. He had been shuttling them around the city on trains, making it appear as if they had just arrived. Hornung laughs upon finding out he has been cheated, and decides to further raise the price.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>V. The final section of the story, \"The Bread Line\", describes Sam Lewiston\u2019s life in Chicago. He stands in the <a href=\"/wiki/Bread_lines\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bread lines\">bread line</a> with many other poor, hungry workers who rely on the bakery\u2019s nightly giveaways, but the price of wheat has put too much of a strain on the bakery. Lewiston manages to find work as a street cleaner and climb the rankings to success but, because of his experiences as a farmer and a worker, his resentment towards the operators of the wheat business will not die.</dd></dl>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character_list\">Character list</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Character list\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<ul><li>Sam Lewiston</li>\n<li>Emma Lewiston</li>\n<li>Truslow</li>\n<li>Mr. Gates</li>\n<li>Hornung</li>\n<li>Going</li>\n<li>Kimbark</li>\n<li>Merriam</li>\n<li>Kennedy</li>\n<li>Billy</li>\n<li>Cyrus Ryder</li></ul>\n<h4><span id=\".22The_Wife_of_Chino.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;The_Wife_of_Chino&quot;\">\"The Wife of Chino\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;The Wife of Chino&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_2\">Plot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Plot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<dl><dd>I.\tThe story starts off with \"Chino\u2019s Wife\", in which Lockwood, the superintendent of the Hand-over-fist Gravel Mine in <a href=\"/wiki/Placer_County,_California\" title=\"Placer County, California\">Placer County, California</a>, sits in solitude on his porch smoking tobacco after dinner. He graduated from the <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_School_of_Engineering_and_Applied_Science\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science\">Columbia School of Mines</a> and has since spent his life in isolated Western mining communities. He enjoys isolation, and spends every evening admiring the scenery and fantasizing about Felice Zavalla, a beautiful <a href=\"/wiki/Mexican_American\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mexican American\">Mexican</a> woman married to one of his employees.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>II.\t\"Madness\", documents Lockwood\u2019s strong desire to be married to Felice despite his inability to understand her. He has never seen the world or socialized much, having studied for the first part of his life and worked for the latter. His isolation causes him to get carried away with emotions, and he is convinced he should have Felice.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>III.\tIn \"Chino Goes to Town\", Lockwood begins finding excused to interact with Felice, such as to give her mail, until he at once realizes that he has crossed the line and begins to avoid her entirely. He, instead, buries himself in his work until an accident in the mine breaks his foot. He usually goes to the Iowa Hill Post Office every couple of weeks with Chino to deliver the brick of gold collected from the mine, but his injury prevents him from going. He is left with nothing but thoughts of Felice to ease the pain.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>IV.\tIn the section, \"A Dispatch from the Express Messenger\", Felice confronts Lockwood and asks why he has been avoiding her. She gave him a look that told him she had made a mistake with Chino. Just when Lockwood realizes that he will not keep himself from having an affair with Felice he gets a message from <a href=\"/wiki/Iowa_Hill,_California\" title=\"Iowa Hill, California\">Iowa Hill</a> informing him of a criminal named Reno Kid on the trail. The messenger advises him not to leave, but Chino was already on his way. Lockwood realizes he has no other options, and struggles his way onto a horse and takes off.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>V.\t\"The Trail\" documents Lockwood\u2019s pursuit of Chino. He almost reaches Iowa Hill with no sign of him or Reno Kid, so he turns around to search harder. He eventually hears a horse galloping in the darkness and assumes it to be Reno Kid and shoots, but it is Chino.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>VI.\t\"The Discovery of Felice\" begins when Lockwood arrives back at the Zavalla\u2019s house and confesses his actions to Felice. Felice fetches the doctor and, as he examines Chino\u2019s wound, she tells Lockwood that now they can be together. Lockwood, however, suddenly sees Felice in a different light. She appears savage and unfaithful.</dd></dl>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character_list_2\">Character list</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Character list\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<ul><li>Lockwood</li>\n<li>Felice Zavalla</li>\n<li>Chino Zavalla</li>\n<li>Reno Kid</li></ul>\n<h4><span id=\".22A_Bargain_with_Peg-Leg.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;A_Bargain_with_Peg-Leg&quot;\">\"A Bargain with Peg-Leg\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;A Bargain with Peg-Leg&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_3\">Plot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Plot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<dl><dd>This story describes Bunt McBride\u2019s account of Peg-Leg Smith, an infamous one-legged criminal. Bunt retells the story on his break from the night shift at the mine.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Peg-Leg amputated his own leg and fashioned himself one from a tree stump after he was shot. He was known for his nastiness and spent his life trying to get people to stop using cuss words. Bunt encountered him at a bar in <a href=\"/wiki/Yuma,_Arizona\" title=\"Yuma, Arizona\">Yuma</a> when Bunt was just a teenager. He was there watching his friend, Clarense, play a gambling game with some men that involved taking their temperatures. Clarence won, and the guys start accusing him of cheating. Peg-Leg had been sleeping in the back room, but he appeared and tackled Clarence from across the room. Bunt jumped to Clarence\u2019s defense and pulled off Peg-Leg\u2019s leg. Knowing he was in trouble, he chucked the wood out the window, grabbed Peg-Leg\u2019s gun from the back room, and took off across the street. Outside, a kid had gone to retrieve the leg and went to hand it to Peg-Leg, but Bunt grabbed it. Peg-Leg assured Bunt that he would come after him someday. Bunt knew what Peg-Leg is capable of and did not want to live in fear, but he also knew his weakness, so he made a deal with Peg-leg to never swear again in exchange for his safety. Peg-Leg was desperate to have at least one convert, so he gave in.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Three years later, Bunt says, he came across Peg-Leg again in Sonora, Arizona. The town was full of men seeking gold. He got word that a hotel was on fire and rushed over to see Peg-Leg at the window of the flaming building. People below were yelling for him to jump, promising to catch him on a blanket. Bunt starts chucking before he can finish the story. There hadn\u2019t been a blanket there.</dd></dl>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character_list_3\">Character list</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Character list\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<ul><li>Bunt McBride</li>\n<li>Peg-Leg Smith</li>\n<li>Clarence</li></ul>\n<h4><span id=\".22The_Passing_of_Cock-Eye_Blacklock.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;The_Passing_of_Cock-Eye_Blacklock&quot;\">\"The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_4\">Plot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Plot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<dl><dd>This story, like the last, describes Bunt McBride\u2019s account of the life of a Western criminal, Cock-Eye Blacklock. Bunt and the narrator finish dinner by the campfire and ride out into the <a href=\"/wiki/Idaho\" title=\"Idaho\">Idaho</a> desert because it is Bunt\u2019s night to ride the herd. Bunt has lived in the West for a long time and is wise when it comes to herding.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Bunt begins his story by recounting a herding experience in a Nevada blizzard. He and Cock-Eye Blacklock rubbed <a href=\"/wiki/Tobacco_water\" title=\"Tobacco water\">tobacco juice</a> in their eyes to stay awake. Blacklock was a bad man and had killed a lot of people. Bunt says that he went bad about two years after that, though, He traveled around gambling, taking all the money from a community before moving on. He got through <a href=\"/wiki/New_Mexico\" title=\"New Mexico\">New Mexico</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Arizona\" title=\"Arizona\">Arizona</a> and was making his way through Nevada when he shot a kid in Reno and headed up to a mining camp in Placer County, California. He immediately got into trouble there, too, and before long was driven out of camp.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Bunt lived nearby in Iowa Hill at the time, and he used to take weekly fishing trips to the <a href=\"/wiki/American_River\" title=\"American River\">American River</a> with his boss. On one trip they noticed that all the fish had been shot out of the river. The Fish Commissioners of the State assigned a guard to the area, but the fish kept dying. Blacklock was an obvious suspect, so Bunt, the Boss, and a marshal set up shooting boxes in trees to stand watch and try to catch him in the act. Unsuccessful for weeks, they caught a break one day with the help from a local dog named Sloppy Weather. Blacklock <a href=\"/wiki/Blast_fishing\" title=\"Blast fishing\">threw dynamite into the water to kill the fish</a>, but Sloppy Weather jumped in to fetch the dynamite and bring it back.

As they were leaving the island something came out of the sea that killed twenty men within a week. After another week there were six men remaining, and they all died on the island. Dixon recalls that each of the men on the <i>Glarus</i> felt uneasy about the mission. He felt like they were being watched. One night Strokher said he fell asleep while on watch and awoke to find a ship in the distance. It was unusual looking, with three <a href=\"/wiki/Mast_(sailing)\" title=\"Mast (sailing)\">masts</a> and no sails, and looked abandoned and frightening. The same night their shaft broke. They decided to continue for the island, but for days the wind would not let them budge. They had no choice but to turn around and saw the old ship in the distance behind them as they left. Upon returning to San Francisco the word spread that the <i>Glarus</i> had seen a ghost, and she has not seen the sea since.</dd></dl>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character_list_8\">Character list</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Character list\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<ul><li>Mr. Dixon</li>\n<li>Strokher</li>\n<li>Hardenberg</li>\n<li>Ally Bazan</li></ul>\n<h4><span id=\".22The_Ghost_in_the_Crosstrees.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;The_Ghost_in_the_Crosstrees&quot;\">\"The Ghost in the Crosstrees\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;The Ghost in the Crosstrees&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_9\">Plot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Deal_in_Wheat_and_Other_Stories_of_the_New_and_Old_West&amp;action=edit&amp;section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Plot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h5>\n<dl><dd>I.\tCyrus Ryder wants to claim a new island, the Island of Paa, so he calls upon the Three Black Crows.
