Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Colouring Book is a 2013 colouring book for adults by Johanna Basford. The book has been translated into 14 languages and has sold more than a million copies,  becoming one of the best-selling books on Amazon.   Basford had been approached by Laurence King Publishing in 2011 after the publisher had seen Basford's work online. While the publisher originally wanted a colouring book for children, Basford proposed one for adults.   Basford was inspired by several of her clients joking with her that they wouldd enjoy colouring in her work, which was frequently done in black and white.  Initially the publisher was reluctant to release such an unorthodox book. However they eventually relented and the first run quickly sold out.  The book's success is frequently cited as  starting the adult coloring book trend.    The book is modelled after the Brodick Castle Gardens on the Isle of Arran where Basford played as a child.  By August 2015, Secret Garden had sold 2 million copies worldwide and launched the colouring trend for adults. In 2013, Basford released a second book: Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Colouring Book, and a third, Lost Ocean: An Inky Adventure and Colouring Book in October 2015.
