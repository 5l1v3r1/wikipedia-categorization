Fiol's Octoechos is an incunabulum octoechos, the first printed book in the Cyrillic script. It was printed by Schweipolt Fiol, a German native of Franconia, in 1491 in Cracow. The only complete copy, of seven remaining, of Oktoikh is kept by the Russian State Library in Moscow. In the past this copy belonged to Johann Hess (1490â€“1547), a Wroclaw (Breslau) bibliophile and reformer.
