Werner's Nomenclature of Colours is a book of named colour samples compiled by Abraham Gottlob Werner, and subsequently amended by Patrick Syme.  The book, first published in 1814, was used by Charles Darwin in his scientific observations.   Werner's Nomenclature can be viewed as a predecessor of modern named colour systems such as Pantone.
