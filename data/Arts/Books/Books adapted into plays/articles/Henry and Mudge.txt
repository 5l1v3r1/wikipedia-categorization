Henry and Mudge is a series of American children's books written by Newbery Medal winner Cynthia Rylant and published by Simon & Schuster. The series is a common read found in curricula for 2nd and 3rd grade.   The series is illustrated by Su√ßie Stevenson.  Recently, a theatre adaptation was made intended for grades Pre-K through 3rd.  The story revolves around a young boy, Henry, and his canine companion, Mudge, an English Mastiff. Throughout the series, Henry learns many lessons, usually with the help of the 182-pound Mudge, about life, loyalty and love. He has a cousin named Annie who often features as well (and who stars in her own followup series Annie and Snowball, also by Rylant).
