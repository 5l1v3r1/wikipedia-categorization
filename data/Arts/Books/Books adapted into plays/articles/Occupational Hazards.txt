Occupational Hazards: My Time Governing in Iraq (published in United States as The Prince of the Marshes: And other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq) is a 2006 non-fiction book by the British writer and politician Rory Stewart (Picador, ISBNÂ 9780330440493).  It documents his experiences as Coalition Provisional Authority Deputy Governor of the Iraqi province of Maysan and Senior Advisor in the province of Dhi Qar for one year starting in August 2003. It describes his struggles to establish a functional government in these regions in the chaos of the Iraq War. He faced an incipient civil war and growing civil unrest from his base in a CIMIC compound in Al Amarah and, in May 2004, was in command of his compound in Nasiriyah when it was besieged by Sadrist militia. In 2017, the book was adapted for the stage by Stephen Brown, debuting at Hampstead Theatre under the title Occupational Hazards.
