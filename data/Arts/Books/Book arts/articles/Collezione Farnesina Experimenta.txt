Collezione Farnesina Experimenta is a bilingual book (Italian and English) that assembles and catalogues the eighty works (reproduced in colour) of the Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection, housed in Palazzo della Farnesina. Along with exhibitions of the collection that are promoted by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the aim of the volume is to valorize and make known contemporary Italian art, by supporting those generations of artists who made names for themselves from the nineties to the year 2000.  In addition to being a catalogue of the works, the volume contains biographical entries of the artists and four critical essays: which reveal how Italian contemporary art still shows a capacity to be reborn, to find a new meaning and new energies for facing the complexity of its own historical moment, by combining elements of the country’s prolific artistic history with the most evolved inclinations of contemporaneity.  The Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection amplifies the Italian collection of art of Palazzo della Farnesina and represents the current state of art in Italy.  The collection includes works that have been created using the different forms of expression that distinguish contemporary art: from video art to painting, from photography to digital art, from sculpture to drawing to installation. The eighty works in the collection are by artists from all over Italy.
