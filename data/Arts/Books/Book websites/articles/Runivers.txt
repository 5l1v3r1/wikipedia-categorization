Runivers (Russian: Руниверс) is a site devoted to Russian culture and history. Runivers targets Russian speaking readers and those interested in Russian culture and history. Runivers is an online library aimed to provide free access to authentic documents, books and texts related to Russian history, which were previously kept in major libraries and state archives. This project is not-profit. The main body of the collection consists of facsimile copies of books and journals published before 1917 as well as archive photos and documents on the history and culture of Russia.  The digitalizing is supported by Transneft.  As of August 2010, Runivers claimed to contain over 1,500 books (high quality facsimile copies of original materials) mostly about Russian history. Also Runivers provides access to encyclopedias, document collections and photos. Many of the publications were not available for general public or were forbidden in Soviet Union (e.g. works of Russian philosophers). The site includes a calendar with daily updates related to memorable events and people. Runivers offers a collection of photographs taken by distinguished Russian photographers at the turn of the 20th century. Each photo gallery is accompanied by the biography of the photographer. The captions give information about the picture, objects on it and a place where it was taken.
