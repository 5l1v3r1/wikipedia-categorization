PaperBackSwap (PBS) is a club co-founded in 2004 by Richard Pickering and Robert Swarthout of Suwanee and Rome, Georgia, (USA).  Swarthout later left the company to pursue other ventures.  The purpose of PaperBackSwap is to use the Internet to facilitate the parity trading of books (or "book swapping") among member bibliophiles in the United States.  The club also operates sister websites Swap-a-DVD and Swap-a-CD to facilitate parity trading of DVDs and CDs, respectively. Membership ranges from zero to $20 per year   and is offered to individuals residing at addresses served by the United States Postal Service, including APO and FPO (military mail) addresses.  Commercial enterprises are prohibited from membership.  Membership is restricted to adults 18 years of age or older.  Membership restrictions are covered in the site privacy statement. In February 2015 PaperBackSwap began charging a fee for their services. A credit system is used to enable members to trade books for credits and credits for books.  Credits may either be purchased, or they may be earned by mailing books which have been requested.  Consequently, a member need not seek another member who desires a parity trade; credits are the medium of exchange.  Both paperback and hardback books may be traded, as well as audiobooks.  Within the PBS system the value of any bound book is always one credit, and the value of an audio book is always two credits. The Box-O-Books program allows paying members to exchange boxes of books (rather than one at a time) to save on postage and provide variety. PBS offers optional printing of online postage for a small fee.  PBS also sells book accessories and other items bearing the club logo. In February 2015, membership tiers were introduced. Standard membership is $20 per year, limited membership is $12 per year and the free option is called a la carte. Each tier upgrade offers more wishlist slots and other benefits.
