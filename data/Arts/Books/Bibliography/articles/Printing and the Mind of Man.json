At the behest of typographer <a href=\"/wiki/Stanley_Morison\" title=\"Stanley Morison\">Stanley Morison</a> it was decided to put together an exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge. A display at <a href=\"/wiki/Earls_Court\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Earls Court\">Earls Court</a> concentrated on the technical side of printing, while a display at the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Museum\" title=\"British Museum\">British Museum</a> looked more at fine printing. However, both displays had the quite novel intention of promoting the study of books for their role in advancing factual knowledge, rather than for their aesthetics. <a href=\"/wiki/Ian_Fleming\" title=\"Ian Fleming\">Ian Fleming</a>, who lent 40 books from his library, was among the private collectors who contributed to the exhibition.\n</p><p>The catalogue, (which might be considered the pre-first edition of <i>PMM</i>) was printed by <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford_University_Press\" title=\"Oxford University Press\">Oxford University Press</a>, edited by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Carter_(author)\" title=\"John Carter (author)\">John Carter</a>, Stanley Morison, Percy H. Muir and others and entitled: <i>Catalogue of a display of printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of Western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the 15th century, organised in connection with the eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, under the title Printing and the Mind of Man, assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16\u201327 July 1963</i>.\n</p><p>A book-length edition, revised and enlarged, was printed at <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press\" title=\"Cambridge University Press\">Cambridge University Press</a> and published in 1967 by <a href=\"/wiki/Orion_Publishing_Group\" title=\"Orion Publishing Group\">Cassell</a> in London and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston in New York. This first book edition was entitled <i><b>Printing and the Mind of Man, a descriptive catalogue illustrating the impact of print on the evolution of Western civilization during five centuries</b></i>. It was edited by John Carter and Percy H. Muir and expanded upon the theme of the impact of printing on human thought.\n</p><p>A second revised edition was published in 1983 by Karl Pressler in <a href=\"/wiki/Munich\" title=\"Munich\">Munich</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/3-9800047-3-2\" title=\"Special:BookSources/3-9800047-3-2\">3-9800047-3-2</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Printing_and_the_Mind_of_Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Further reading\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Sebastian Carter - \"Printing and the mind of man\" in <i>Matrix</i> Volume 20 (2000)</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1272\nCached time: 20180909212045\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.036 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.065 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 249/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 1043/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 402/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 15/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.007/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 735 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   55.364      1 -total\n 50.47%   27.944      1 Template:ISBN\n 49.40%   27.349      1 Template:Italic_title\n 19.49%   10.792      1 Template:Catalog_lookup_link\n 10.18%    5.634      1 Template:Error-small\n  6.41%    3.549      3 Template:Yesno-no\n  5.16%    2.854      1 Template:Main_other\n  4.58%    2.533      6 Template:Trim\n  3.56%    1.973      1 Template:Tl\n  3.50%    1.935      3 Template:Yesno\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1481306-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909212045 and revision id 787541164\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Printing And The Mind Of Man","*":"1963_books"},{"sortkey":"Printing And The Mind Of Man","*":"1967_books"},{"sortkey":"Printing And The Mind Of Man","*":"20th-century_history_books"},{"sortkey":"Printing And The Mind Of Man","*":"Books_about_printing"},{"sortkey":"Printing And The Mind Of Man","*":"Bibliography"},{"sortkey":"Printing And The Mind Of Man","*":"1983_books"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bibliography"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"British Museum"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cambridge University Press"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Earls Court"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ian Fleming"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"International Standard Book Number"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"John Carter (author)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Munich"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Orion Publishing Group"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Oxford University Press"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Printing"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Stanley Morison"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Western culture"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Italic title"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:ISBN"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Catalog lookup link"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Trim"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Yesno-no"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Yesno"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Error-small"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Tl"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Italic title"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check isxn"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Error"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Further reading","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Printing_and_the_Mind_of_Man","byteoffset":2430,"anchor":"Further_reading"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"<i>Printing and the Mind of Man</i>","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"displaytitle","*":"<i>Printing and the Mind of Man</i>"},{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Printing And The Mind Of Man"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7245317"}]}}
