The ACS style is a set of standards for writing documents relating to chemistry, including a standard method of citation in academic publications, developed by the American Chemical Society (ACS).  The printed versions of the ACS style manual are entitled ACS Style Guide: Effective Communication of Scientific Information, 3rd ed. (2006), edited by Anne M. Coghill and Lorrin R. Garson, and ACS Style Guide: A Manual for Authors and Editors (1997). Titles of journals are abbreviated; e.g.: Deno, N. C.; Richey, H. G.; Liu, J. S.; Lincoln, D. N.; Turner, J. O. "Carbonium Ions. XIX. The Intense Conjugation in Cyclopropyl Carbonium Ions". J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1965, 87 (20), 4533-4538. The gray texts are optional.
