A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles (1992) is the first book by author Marianne Williamson and a New York Times Best seller. A Return to Love spent 39 weeks on the New York Times best sellers list in 1992.  A decade later, A Return to Love was credited as being one of the two books that helped bring New Age perspectives to the American mainstream.  Twenty years after her first appearance with the book, Williamson was interviewed again by Oprah Winfrey in July 2012, this time in a Super Soul Sunday (OWN TV) episode titled, "20 Years After A Return to Love".  Robert Todd Carroll, of The Skeptic's Dictionary, writes, "Williamson might be called Oprah's patron saint. She's all about love and healing, yin and yang, being wounded, and using love and prayer to heal all wounds. A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course In Miracles (1992) was number one on the Publishers Weekly non-fiction best-sellers list for 11 weeks. Williamson promoted her book and ACIM when she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, an episode that received more pro viewer mail than any other show for 1992. She also spoke of the book, and the course when she was interviewed by Barbara Walters on the ABC television news show 20/20.
