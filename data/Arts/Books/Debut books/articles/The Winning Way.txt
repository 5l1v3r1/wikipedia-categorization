The Winning Way is a 2011 debut book by Harsha Bhogle and Anita Bhogle, published by Westland And Tranquebar Press.  It is Harsha's first book published as an author.  The pair stated that the book took them two years to write, with The Hindu calling it "lively".  The Winning Way is a management advice book that focuses on what comprises a successful athlete and shows how management teams could apply that to their work force. The two fields: management and sport, typically have no relation to each other but they do however share the same core attributes.  The Hindu reviewed the book, calling it a "right pick as a playbook for managers."  Business Today praised the book, saying it "captures the essence of values in sport, values that make champion players and champion teams".
