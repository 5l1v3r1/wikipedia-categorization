Rahva Raamat was founded in 1912, when Estonian publisher Gustav Pihlakas opened his bookstore in Pärnu mnt 10, a newly designed house by respected Finnish-American architect Eliel Saarinen.  Since then, there has always been a bookstore in the same premises. In October 2002 Rahva Raamat in Pärnu mnt 10 in Tallinn was in danger of being closed down. Hundreds of protesters appeared on the street, which helped the oldest bookstore in Estonia to stay open.
