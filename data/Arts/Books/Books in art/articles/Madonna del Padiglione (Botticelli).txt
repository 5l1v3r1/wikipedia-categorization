The Madonna and Child with Three Angels (also known as Madonna del Padiglione) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, executed in 1493. It is housed in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana of Milan. The Virgin Mary is portrayed holding a book to her breast and gesturing to the Child, the latter being supported by an angel. The Italian name (padiglione meaning "pavilion") derives from the rich baldachin over the scene. There is an open book on a small prie-dieu between the Virgin and Child. Angels are pulling back the drapery of the pavilion. Together, the books and the open drapery signify the revelation that Old Testament prophecy has been fulfilled in the birth of the Christ Child to the Virgin.
