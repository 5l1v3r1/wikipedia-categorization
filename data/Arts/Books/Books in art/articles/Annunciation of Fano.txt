 Annunciation of Fano is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Pietro Perugino, executed around 1488-1490, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, Fano, central Italy. The work was successful, and a few years later he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the same church, the Fano Altarpiece. The painting is set within a four bay portico, a common element in Perugino's paintings from the 1480s (as, for example, in the Albani-Torlonia Polyptych and the Piet√†). Behind it, is a background with hills featuring light trees. In the foreground is the Annunciation, lit from the left. The angel, holding a white lily (symbol of purity), announces that she will bear Jesus; Mary, who was previously reading a book on a classical altar in front of her, has a surprised face. Behind them, in the upper center, is God in an oval with cherubim and seraphim, sending the Holy Spirit (portrayed as a dove) to her.
