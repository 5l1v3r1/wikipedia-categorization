The Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi. Dating to 1440-45, it is housed in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica of Palazzo Barberini, Rome. The composition pivots around the Virgin, who occupies the centre of the scene. In the background, on the right, two small figures of women are riding a stair. The two donor portraits show the unknown donors kneeling behind a cordonata.   That they were represented in natural size (i.e., in the same size as the religious figures) was a relatively new stylistic feature.
