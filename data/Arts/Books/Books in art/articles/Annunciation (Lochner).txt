Annunciation (or The Virgin Mary) is a panel painting by the German artist Stefan Lochner, the panels were probably conceived as outer wing for a lost altarpiece. It shows the virgin, rather conventionally receiving the voice of the holy spirit, who hovers above her in the form of a dove. A vase behind her holds a lily. Her white clothes and the flower represent her virginity.  It seems influenced by similar panels found in Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece.
