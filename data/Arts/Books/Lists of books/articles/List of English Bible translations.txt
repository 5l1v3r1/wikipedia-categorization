The Bible has been translated into many languages from the biblical languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. The Latin Vulgate translation was dominant in Western Christianity through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into many more languages. English Bible translations also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. Included when possible are dates and the source language(s) and, for incomplete translations, what portion of the text has been translated.  Certain terms that occur in many entries are linked at the bottom of the page. Because different groups of Jews and Christians differ on the true content of the Bible, the "incomplete translations" section includes only translations seen by their translators as incomplete, such as Christian translations of the New Testament alone.  Translations such as Jewish versions of the Tanakh are included in the "complete" category, even though Christians traditionally have considered the Bible to consist properly of more than just the Tanakh. 1560 (complete Bible) 1960 (single volume complete Bible) 1984 (reference edition with footnotes) 2013 (revised) 1993 (NT, text only) 1999 (single volume complete Bible, text only) 2003 (single volume complete Bible w/ footnotes) NT: Novum Testamentum Graece (Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament, 26th edition) 1530 (Pentateuch) 1915 1935 (various volumes and editions of the WVSS were published from 1913 - 1935)
