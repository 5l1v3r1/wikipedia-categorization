The 100 Books of the Century (French: Les cent livres du siècle) is a list of the one hundred best books of the 20th century, according to a poll conducted in the spring of 1999 by the French retailer Fnac and the Paris newspaper Le Monde. Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French voters responded to the question, "Which books have remained in your memory?" (Quels livres sont restés dans votre mémoire ?).  The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theatre, as well as the Asterix comic book. The list includes many French novels because of the demographics of the surveyed group. However, similar lists by English language sources include US and UK authors only (for example, the Modern Library 100 Best Novels published in 1998, with two lists, one by the Board of the Modern Library and the other by readers who responded). Remarkably, the omnipresence in the list of English and American works, and the rarity of works from other cultural spheres, reflect the present cultural dependence of France (a country formerly attracted to a large variety of cultures) on English-speaking culture as the perceived only valid international culture in spite of the year long attempt of the country's educated classes to advocate a 'dialogue des cultures' leading to a true cultural globalization. Note: Classified by the language of the book's first publication, which may not be the author's principal language.
