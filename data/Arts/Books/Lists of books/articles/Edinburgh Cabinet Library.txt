The Edinburgh Cabinet Library was a series of 38 books, mostly geographical, published from 1830 to 1844, and edited by Dionysius Lardner.   The original price was 5 shillings for a volume; a later reissue of 30 of the volumes was at half that price.  The publishers were Oliver & Boyd in Edinburgh, and Simpkin & Marshall in London.
