Ingersoll are available online at both the Secular Web  and as part of the Internet Archive project  The Drew University Library hosts a collection of pamphlets by and about Mr. Ingersoll.   In 2013 the Library of Congress announced the opening of the Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive which includes more than 1,500 boxes of donated material.  MacFarlane donated the funds which allowed the Library of Congress to purchase a collection of Carl Sagan's notes from Anne Druyan (widow of Carl Sagan) because of his concern over fading science literacy.
