Murray's Family Library was a series of non-fiction works published from 1829 to 1834, by John Murray, in 51 volumes. The series editor was John Gibson Lockhart, who also wrote the first book, a biography of Napoleon.  The books were priced at five shillings;  Murray's approach, which did not involve part-publication, is considered a fundamentally more conservative business model, and intention, than used by the contemporary library of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.  In 1834 Murray sold out to Thomas Tegg.  Further volumes were added to the Library, under Tegg's management. There was a total of 80 volumes, by 1847.
