Muhammad Iqbal also known as Allama Iqbal (1877â€“1938), was a Muslim philosopher, poet and politician of early 20th-century. He is particularly known in Indian sub-continent for his Urdu philosophical poetry. Iqbal became prominence since 1899, when he recited Nalay e Yatem at the annual meeting of Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-Islam, Lahore. The poems he wrote up to 1905, imbibe patriotism that includes the Tarana-e-Hind (popularly known as Saare Jahan Se Achcha). The Bang-e-Dara (1924) is a collection of Urdu poetry written in three distinct phases of Iqbals life, In his early work he also wrote on most of the Indian iconic personalities such as Rama Tirtha, Guru Nanak and Rama.   The Urdu poetry Iqbal wrote earlier to his visit of Europe in 1905, is considered by critics as the first phase of his poetry that reflects the blend of Persian mysticism and Patriotism.   Iqbals Urdu poetry collection is available in four books.
