This is a list of all known publications by Ottaviano Petrucci, an influential Italian printer of the 16th century. Most of these were reprinted several times during Petrucci's life, but in this list only dates of first publication are given. Some of the earlier publications (for instance, the Josquin masses) were reprinted separately, in Fossombrone, after Petrucci moved there around 1510; these reprints are listed. The vast majority of Petrucci's publications were published in Venice; those from his Fossombrone years are marked accordingly.
