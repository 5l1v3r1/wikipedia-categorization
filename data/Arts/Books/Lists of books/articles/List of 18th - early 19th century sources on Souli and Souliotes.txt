Souli is a toponym and today a municipality in Epirus, northwestern Greece. It is historically important as the former settlement of Souliotes, a semi-autonomous community of warriors who played a vital role in the Greek War of Independence (1821 - c. 1829). For this reason, Souli and Souliotes attracted the attention of many authors, travellers, historians, ethnologists etc from early 19th century. There are also some late 18th century documents written by Souliotes, which later became the subject of academic research. The traditional Souliotic communities were disolved during the Greek War of Independence and Souliotes were dispersed.
