The following is a list of Silesian language books in standard orthography. On August 10, 2009, standard orthography for writing in the Silesian language was adopted in Cieszyn, at a meeting of the Standardization Committee of the Silesian Language.  This orthographic standard is used, alongside another,  in the Silesian Wikipedia.
