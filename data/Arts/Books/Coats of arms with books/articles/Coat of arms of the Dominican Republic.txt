The coat of arms of the Dominican Republic features a shield in similarly quartered colors as the flag, supported by a bay laurel branch (left) and a palm frond (right); above the shield, a blue ribbon displays the national motto: Dios, Patria, Libertad (God, Homeland, Liberty). Below the shield, the words República Dominicana appear on a red ribbon. In the center of the shield, flanked by six spears (three on each side), the front four holding the national flag, is a Catholic Bible with a small golden cross above it The constitution dictates that the Bible be opened to the book of the New Testament, John 8:32, which reads "conocerán la verdad, y la verdad los hará libres", literal translation: "know the truth and the truth will set you free". The coat of arms appears in the center of the flag of the Dominican Republic. The coat of arms was slightly changed some twenty times before reaching the current design, which was made in the Monseñor Nouel Province in 1913.
