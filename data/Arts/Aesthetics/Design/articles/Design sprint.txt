A design sprint is a time-constrained, five-phase process that uses design thinking with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. It originates within GV (formerly, Google Ventures) through the work of Jake Knapp who subsequently published a book on the approach with co-authors John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz .  The process aims to help  teams to clearly define goals, validating assumptions and deciding on a product roadmap before starting development. It seeks to address stragegic issues using interdisciplinary, rapid prototyping, and user testing. This design process is similar to Sprints in an Agile development cycle . Claimed uses of the approach include The creators of the Design Sprint approach, recommend preparation by picking the proper team, environment, materials and tools working with six key 'ingredients'.   The main deliverables after the Design sprint: The suggested ideal number of people involved in the sprint is 4-7 people  and they include the facilitator, designer, a decision maker (often a CEO if the company is a startup), product manager, engineer and someone from companies core business departments (Marketing, Content, Operations, etc.).
