Boiler design is the process of designing boilers used for various purposes. The main function of a boiler is to heat water to generate steam. Steam produced in a boiler can be used for a variety of purposes including space heating, sterilisation, drying, humidification and power generation. The temperature or condition of steam required for these applications is different, so boiler designs vary accordingly. Modern boiler design offers several benefits. In the past, improper design of boilers has caused explosions which led to loss of life and property. Modern designs attempt to avoid such mishaps.  Further, mathematical modeling can determine how much space a boiler will need and the type of materials to be used.  When the design specifications of a boiler are determined, design engineers can estimate a cost and time schedule for the construction. Boiler design may be based upon: Accessories and mountings are devices which form an integral part of boiler but are not mounted on it. They include economizers, superheaters, feed pumps and air pre-heaters. Accessories help in controlling and running the boiler efficiently.  Certain common mountings (specifically those required by the Indian Boiler Act) include:
