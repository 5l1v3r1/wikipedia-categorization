Integrated design is an approach to design which brings together specialisms usually considered separately.  For example: The requirement for integrated design comes when the different specialisms are dependent on each other or "coupled". An alternative or complimentary approach to integrated design is to consciously reduce the dependencies. In  computing and systems design, this approach is known as loose coupling. Three phenomena are associated with a lack of integrated design:  A committee is sometimes a deliberate attempt to address disparate design, but design by committee is associated with silent design. The integrated design approach incorporates methods and tools to encourage and enable the specialists in the different areas to work together to produce an integrated design.  One such method is a charrette with all specialists present, early in the design process.
