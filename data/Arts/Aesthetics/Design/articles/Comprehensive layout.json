The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if approved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately, production.\n</p><p>Traditionally, the four stages of an illustration or other commercial art creation (e.g., advertisement) are:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Sketch&#160;\u2014 the initial idea roughly \"sketched out\" in order to quickly transfer the idea on to a physical substrate</li>\n<li>Layout&#160;\u2014 the idea laid out in relative position for further development</li>\n<li>Comp&#160;\u2014 the idea created in such a way as to closely mimic the final creation, usually as a step toward approval by decision-makers</li>\n<li>Finish&#160;\u2014 the idea rendered in the appropriate medium for sale, display, or reproduction</li></ul>\n<p>For traditional media (such as paint), the division between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for <a href=\"/wiki/Computer-generated_art\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Computer-generated art\">computer-generated art</a>. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) to see how it would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.\n</p><p>With computer-generated art, the distinction between layout and comp has become blurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely segmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-generated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This has led to a two-stage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly the same as with traditional media.  Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing software, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and materials to avoid investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the idea, depending on the complexity of the production task. If there is any three-dimensionality to the design (for example, the design is of a box or of a two sided piece) a \"physical comp\" is preferred to a computerized sketch because fundamental physical relationships (for example, position and show-through of die-cuts, or inadvertently designing M\u00f6bius strips) can be missed in a two-dimensional sketch. A hand-rendered comp may be useful in helping the client refrain from \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nitpicking_(pastime)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nitpicking (pastime)\">nitpicking</a>\" the production quality and focus on the design idea.\n</p><p>In the overall creation process there is also a distinction between finish render and final render. Finish rendering refers to the process, and final rendering refers to the schedule. The first finish rendering may not be the final rendering; the first finish rendering could be the first of many renderings, with each subsequent finish rendering needing refinement before the final version is created.\n</p><p>The illustration element may incorporate <a href=\"/wiki/Stock_photography\" title=\"Stock photography\">stock photography</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Clip_art\" title=\"Clip art\">clip art</a>, or other found material that gives an idea of what should be visually communicated, before entering any negotiations concerning the rights to use a specific image for the purpose. Picture agencies may encourage such use free of charge, in the hope that the comp image (sometimes referred to as a \"positional\" image) will end up being used in the final product. For this reason, it is sometimes mistakenly believed that \"comp\" is short for \"complimentary,\" as it is in some other promotional contexts.\n</p><p>The word \"comp\" can also be used as a verb. For example, an artist may \"comp something up\"; that is, they will create a comp.  \"Comp\" may also stand for \"composition\" or \"composite layout\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Storyboard#Animatics\" title=\"Storyboard\">Animatic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Previsualization\" title=\"Previsualization\">Previsualization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Communication_design\" title=\"Communication design\">Communication design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Website_wireframe\" title=\"Website wireframe\">Website wireframe</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2226\nCached time: 20180916110447\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.044 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.060 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 79/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4059/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 13/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.019/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   45.098      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   45.098      1 -total\n 67.36%   30.379      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1458964-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916110447 and revision id 843418987\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Comprehensive Layout","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009"},{"sortkey":"Comprehensive Layout","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Comprehensive Layout","*":"Advertising_terminology"},{"sortkey":"Comprehensive Layout","*":"Communication_design"},{"sortkey":"Comprehensive Layout","*":"Design"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from December 2009"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Advertising"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Clip art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Communication design"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Computer-generated art"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Graphic design"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Illustration"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nitpicking (pastime)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Page layout"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Previsualization"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Stock photography"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Storyboard"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Typography"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Website wireframe"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Comprehensive_layout","byteoffset":4191,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Comprehensive layout","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Comprehensive Layout"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5157009"}]}}
