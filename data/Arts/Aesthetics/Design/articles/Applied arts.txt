The applied arts are all the arts that apply design and decoration[disambiguation needed] to everyday objects in order to make them aesthetically pleasing.  The term is used in distinction to the fine arts that produce objects solely to be beautiful or stimulate the intellect. In practice, the two often overlap. The term "decorative arts" is synonymous with "applied arts".
