Concept-oriented design (COD) is a theory of design and development based upon the language and diagrams of practitioners. It has been implemented in a tool Chasm to build 3D user interfaces (3DUIs). Its name is borrowed from the generic programming idea of a software concept. It was created by Chadwick Wingrave under the direction of Doug A. Bowman while at Virginia Tech and detailed in his dissertation,  an early peer-reviewed workshop paper   and a peer-reviewed paper   at a conference on virtual reality sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Concept-oriented design should not be confused with any other concept-oriented theory such as concept-oriented programming or concept-oriented model, work of Alexandr Savinov. Their only relationship is a similar-sounding name.
