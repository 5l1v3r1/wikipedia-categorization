The Interaction Design Foundation is a non-profit educational organization  which produces open content and Open Access educational materials   online with the stated goal of "democratizing education by making world-class educational materials free for anyone, anywhere."    Materials are learning materials at graduate level targeted at both industry and academia in the fields of interaction design, computer science, user experience, information architecture, and design. The centerpiece of the Interaction-Design.org is the peer reviewed Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction, which currently number 40+ textbooks written by 100+ leading designers and professors as well as commentaries and HD video interviews shot around the world.         The website features professional and academic textbooks, video lectures, a conference calendar, and a comprehensive bibliography of the most authoritative publications within the design of interactive technology. In June 2013, the Interaction Design Foundation launched a 4 year 35,000 mile bike tour, named "Share the Knowledge Tour",  to raise awareness of the rising cost of education - with weekly events on university campuses.   Financial sponsors include the German software company SAP. Authors include Harvard professor  Clayton Christensen   and New York Times bestselling author, Robert Spence   who invented the "magnifying glass" visualization that is familiar to anyone with an iPhone or iMac, and Stu Card   who performed the research that led to the computer mouse's commercial introduction by Xerox. The Executive Board currently include Don Norman, Ken Friedman, Bill Buxton, Irene Au, Michael Arent, Daniel Rosenberg, Jonas Lowgren and Olof Schybergson.
