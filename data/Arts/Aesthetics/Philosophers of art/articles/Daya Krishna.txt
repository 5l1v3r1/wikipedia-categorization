Daya Krishna (1924–2007) was an Indian philosopher.  He was sometime Pro Vice Chancellor of Rajasthan University and editor of the Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research for over three decades.  He has published works in the fields of Indian Philosophy, Western philosophy and aesthetics. His doctoral thesis published as The Nature of Philosophy is said to have been acclaimed by the British philosopher, Gilbert Ryle, as an outstanding work.  His work explores the possibility of looking at Indian traditions through resources drawn from Indian concepts and categories. He has attempted to bring about "a dialogue between traditional Pundits, thinking and writing in Sanskrit, and scholars who “do” Indian philosophy in English".
