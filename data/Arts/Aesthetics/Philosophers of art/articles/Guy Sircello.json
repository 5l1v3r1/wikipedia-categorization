His parents were Pete and Teresa Sircello, and he had a younger sister, Teresa. Upon high school graduation, he was awarded the prestigious George Baker full four-year scholarship to <a href=\"/wiki/Reed_College\" title=\"Reed College\">Reed College</a>, in <a href=\"/wiki/Portland,_Oregon\" title=\"Portland, Oregon\">Portland, Oregon</a>, and graduated in 1958 with a double major in philosophy and history. In 1960, he married Sharon Chapin, a fellow Reed graduate, and shortly after, they left New York for Hamburg, where he had a Fulbright grant to further his studies of Ernst Cassirer, the subject of his doctoral dissertation at <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_University\" title=\"Columbia University\">Columbia University</a>. \n</p><p>In Hamburg, the Sircello's first child, Maria Anne Sircello was born, and the family returned to New York with another daughter as well, an adopted daughter, Deborah Ruth Sircello. In New York, the family grew as the Sircellos also became foster parents to Deborah's brothers, Billie, Alexander, and Constantine (Stan). In 1963, another daughter, Pier Andrea, was born in New York City just prior to the family's move to Portland, so that Guy could join the Reed faculty. In Portland, in 1965, another daughter, Anne-Marie Sircello was born, not long after the death of Maria Anne, who had been born with multiple serious disabilities. In 1966, the entire family of eight moved to Irvine, and finally, in 1967, the final child of the Sircello family, Christopher Chapin Sircello, was born. Guy was an attentive and involved father, and enjoyed family camping outings to Yosemite, a three-month family camping trip to Europe, and visits to museums, concerts, and the ballet. He was a major influence, along with Sharon, in three of his children becoming professional dancers, two others becoming professional visual artists, and another an accomplished amateur pianist. \n</p><p>The Sircellos separated, and later divorced after 15 years of marriage.\n</p><p>Sircello was a Professor of Philosophy at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California_Irvine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of California Irvine\">University of California Irvine</a> from 1966 until his death in 1992 at the age of 55.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He earned his PhD from <a href=\"/wiki/Columbia_University\" title=\"Columbia University\">Columbia University</a> in 1965.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He taught at <a href=\"/wiki/Reed_College\" title=\"Reed College\">Reed College</a> before becoming a founding member of UC Irvine\u2019s Philosophy department.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> While at Irvine he served as Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1973 to 1977,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1978 to 1983, Chair of the Committee on Educational Policy from 1988 to 1989,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and as the Philosophy Department's Director of Graduate Studies from 1990 until his death.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Sircello was active in the American Society for Aesthetics and served as the President of its Pacific Division from 1978 to 1979.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> His emphasis was in <a href=\"/wiki/Analytic_philosophy\" title=\"Analytic philosophy\">analytic philosophy</a> of aesthetics, and he was best known for what he called his New Theory of Beauty <sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philosophy\">Philosophy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Philosophy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Sircello's book <i>Love and Beauty</i> (1989) provides a sketch of his theory, which encompasses such topics as arousal, expansion, sublimity, and indulgence.  He considers the implications of his theory for aesthetics and ethics. He also develops theories of pleasure, quality, beauty and love.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Introduction\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>According to Sircello, philosophers have usually failed to understand and theorize properly about certain fundamental human modalities.  Among these is the human relation to and feeling for beauty.  In particular, Sircello found it dismaying that among philosophers the ancient conception of love of beauty had been displaced by other human concerns.  His last book, <i>Love and Beauty</i>, was intended to provide a theory to begin to fill the void left by this loss of interest.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pleasure\">Pleasure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Pleasure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Sircello distinguishes pleasure from enjoyment. He uses <i>propositional pleasure</i> as an example of a particular type of pleasure distinct from enjoyment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  Propositional pleasure is characterized as a pleasure taken in the occurrence of a fact, event, state or the like.  Such pleasure is relatively passive.  We may take pleasure in the outcome of a ball game or in the fact that traffic is light on the way to work, but the pleasure itself resulting from this satisfaction is something that happens to the subject rather than something they effect.  Enjoyment is constituted by the active role played by the subject.  Enjoyment can be obtained from experiences that are not entirely pleasant in all their parts via effort or resolve on the part of the subject.  For instance, a strenuous hike can be enjoyable even though parts of it may be difficult and painful.  The subject\u2019s resolve and ability to overcome difficulties can make the hike enjoyable despite these troubles.  Enjoyment involves a complex relationship to desire in that enjoyment tends to fuel further desires for its continuation.  As such enjoyment of experience is fundamental in Sircello\u2019s theory of love.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Qualities\">Qualities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Qualities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Central to Sircello\u2019s philosophy is his theory of qualities.  He defines the precise sense in which he uses this term through the concept of Properties of Qualitative Difference (or PQDs).<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  Such properties are to be distinguished from quantitative properties.  According to his theory, it is the perception of qualities that lies at the center of the experience of beauty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  According to Sircello qualities come in four main varieties.  These constitute four ways in which we experience our world.\n</p>\n<dl><dd><ul><li><i>Qualities that qualify our own actions:</i>  Qualities such as those we experience when we perceive or remember our own actions fall in this category.  Two examples used by Sircello are \u201cmy gentleness when I speak\u201d and \u201cmy efficiency when I work\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Loveand_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Loveand-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  These qualities comprise a major part of our experience of ourselves in our everyday lives.</li>\n<li><i>Qualities that we experience as qualifying the actions of others:</i>  We may experience the grace of another\u2019s movements, or the stubbornness of their attitude.  Sircello also includes in this category qualities perceived as being expressed by others in photographs, movies, painting, sculptures and so on.  So, we may perceive another's stolidness or joviality in a photo or video as well in first hand encounters.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Loveand_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Loveand-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><i>Qualities that are experienced as \u201ctracks\u201d of the actions of ourselves or of others:</i>  Sircello defines \u201ctracks\u201d as \u201cobjects\u201d that we may experience as the result of actions of sentient beings, either ourself or others.  Tracks need not actually be the result of such actions but are objects that can be perceived as such, in the way that a landscape might be regarded as a trace of the hand of a creator.  Sircello provides many examples of tracks in his book.  For example, the mark left by the tracing of your hand in the sand or the streak of light left by the movement of a firework sparkler through the air.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><i>Qualities experienced by a person as belonging to an \u201cobject\u201d of any sort under the following two conditions:  a) the quality is experienced as either like the act, trace or representation of an act of a sentient being and b) the quality is experienced by that person as belonging to that act, trace or representation:</i>  Perhaps too briefly, the quality may be experienced as being an act of the \u201cobject\u201d being considered.  Examples of this type of quality are:  \u201cA calm sea might be seen as if it were resting calmly.  In the delicate rustling of the leaves of a tree we might see the tree as delicately moving its limbs.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beauty\">Beauty</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Beauty\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Common wisdom tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Sircello\u2019s philosophy runs counter to this maxim.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>  He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made there is something about the object that is thought to be beautiful.  For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, this is due to the quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way.  Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree.  Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Love\">Love</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Love\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Sircello begins his account of love by setting it in relation to enjoyment.  To distance some of the standard associations with the term \u201clove,\u201d Sircello uses the capitalized form, Love, in a technical sense.  Fundamental to his theory is the notion of reproducing an experience of a quality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  Reproductions by S a subject may be regarded as recollections, repetitions or recreations of images, memories, thoughts, actions, feelings, or states that are parts of the experience.  Sircello presents his theory through the four principles paraphrased below:\n</p>\n<ol><li>For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, if S is Loving this experience, then there is some part or parts of the experience that S is reproducing such that what S produces are themselves parts of the experience.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, S is Loving this experience only if the S\u2019s reproducing parts of the experience both arouses and satisfies S\u2019s desire to so reproduce.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Loveand_a_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Loveand_a-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, if S is reproducing part or parts of the experience such that what S so reproduces are part(s) of the experience, and if such reproducing both arouses and satisfies S\u2019s desire to so reproduce, then S is Loving the experience.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Loveand_a_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Loveand_a-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>For any subject S and any \u201cobject\u201d for S, if S is Loving the \u201cobject\u201d, then there is (at least) some experience for S involved with the \u201cobject\u201d that S is Loving.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup></li></ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selected_works\">Selected works</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Guy_Sircello&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Selected works\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Books by Guy Sircello</b><sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Mind &amp; Art: An Essay on the Varieties of Expression</i>.
