Christine Buci-Glucksmann is a French philosopher and Professor Emeritus from University of Paris VIII specializing in the aesthetics of the Baroque, Japan and computer art. Her best-known work in English is Baroque Reason: The Aesthetics of Modernity. Christine Buci-Glucksmann began her work as a philosopher in the 1970s with political studies of Friedrich Engels and Antonio Gramsci. She followed this with research into aesthetics, based primarily around a study of the work of Walter Benjamin. This achievement was followed by her study into the aesthetics of the perception of the Baroque, which was published as "La Raison baroque" in 1984 and then again with La folie du voir in 1986. In this, her major accomplishment, she cites Gilles Deleuze and Jean-François Lyotard as being most salient to her concerns. She followed this interval with an investigation into the aesthetics of the virtual with two books: La folie du voir: Une esthétique du virtuel and Esthetique De L'ephemere. She has written numerous books and articles about digital art (for example L'art à l'époque virtuel (Art in the Age of Virtuality)) and new media art.  She has also written extensively on artists from China, for in example in Les modernités chinoises. In translation: In French:
