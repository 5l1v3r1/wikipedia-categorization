Étienne Souriau (French: [suʁjo]; April 26, 1892 – November 19, 1979) was a French philosopher, best known for his work in aesthetics. Son of Paul Souriau, he studied at the École Normale Supérieure and received his agrégation of philosophy in 1925. After teaching at the universities of Aix-en-Provence and Lyon he eventually became a professor at the Sorbonne, where he held a chair in aesthetics. He was the editor of the Revue d'esthétique and was elected to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques in 1958.
