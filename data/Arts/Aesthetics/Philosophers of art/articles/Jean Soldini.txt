Jean Soldini (born 13 March 1956 in Lugano) is a Swiss and French philosopher, art historian and poet. He studied in Paris, where he earned the Habilitation Ã  diriger des recherches (1995), after he graduated with a Ph.D. in philosophy and with a preceding Ph.D. in history of architecture. His studies are aimed to build a non-authoritarian metaphysics where aesthetics of hospitality plays a primary role within knowledge, looking for the possibility of a resistance against the annihilation of the Other. A resistance against the arrogance of any kind of authoritarian thinking with its multiform camouflages, with its never-ending threat against what is existing-with-other. The aesthetics of hospitality does not be confused with an aestheticization of hospitality. It is a philosophy involved to reflect on sensation through what has its focus on the senses: to donate and receive food, water, a roof for sleeping. Soldini is also author of essays on Alberto Giacometti, on the philosophical margins of a creative work that put into effect the vital desire to know radically.
