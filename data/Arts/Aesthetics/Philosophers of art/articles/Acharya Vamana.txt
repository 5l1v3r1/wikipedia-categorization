Acharya Vamana (latter half of the 8th century - early 9th century)  was one of the most brilliant Rhetoricians.His investigation into the nature of a Kavya is known as theory of Riti.  Vamanaâ€™s Kavyalankara Sutra is considered as the first attempt at evolving a philosophy of literary aesthetics. He regarded that riti is the soul of Kavya.  He presented his formulations in the form of Sutras.
