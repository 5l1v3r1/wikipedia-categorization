Gernot Böhme (born January 3, 1937 in Dessau) is a German philosopher and author, contributing to the philosophy of science, theory of time, aesthetics, ethics, and philosophical anthropology. He is the main pioneer of German ecocriticism, the study of the relationship between culture and the environment. He has been the director of the Institute for Practical Philosophy in Darmstadt since 2005.   Despite being one of Germany's most acclaimed public intellectuals, very little of his work has so far been translated into English.   Böhme studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Göttingen and Hamburg, and completed a PhD in 1965 at Hamburg University. As a research scientist he worked at the Max-Planck-Institute with Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. From 1977 to 2002 he was Professor of Philosophy at Technical University of Darmstadt.
