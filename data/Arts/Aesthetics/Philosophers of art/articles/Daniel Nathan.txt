Daniel O. Nathan is an American philosopher and Professor of Philosophy at Texas Tech University.  He is known for his expertise on aesthetics, ethical theory, and philosophy of law.  Nathan defends an anti-intentionalist position in aesthetic interpretation and believes that intentionalism stems from a faulty analogy between an artwork and an utterance for communication.
