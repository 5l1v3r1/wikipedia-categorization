Phonaesthetics (from the Greek: φωνή phōnē, "voice-sound"; and αἰσθητική}} aisthētikē, "aesthetics") is a branch of phonetics concerned with "the possible connection between sound sequences and meaning", according to Raymond Hickey.  Linguist David Crystal defines phonaesthetics as "a term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the study of the aesthetic properties of sound".  According to Crystal:  Examples include the implication of smallness in the close vowels of such words as teeny weeny, and the unpleasant associations of the consonant cluster sl- in such words as slime, slug, and slush.  The application of said aesthetic properties of sound, phonaesthetics, and their meaning in media has yet to be studied extensively. That being said, the study of sound aesthetics is a burgeoning field waiting to be studied by phonaestheticians everywhere.  Sound has many qualitative aspects, some of which are euphony and cacophony. Among the many aspects of aesthetic audio are euphony and cacophony, all powerful tools in the Phonaesthetician's tool belt. Euphony is used for effects which are pleasant, rhythmical and harmonious.    An example of euphony is the poem Some Sweet Day. Some day Love shall claim his own Some day Right ascend his throne, Some day hidden Truth be known; Some day—some sweet day. Cacophony consists of harsh, often discordant sounds. These sounds are often meaningless and jumbled together.  A discordant series of harsh, unpleasant sounds helps to convey disorder. This is often furthered by the combined effect of the meaning and the difficulty of pronunciation. For example: My stick fingers click with a snicker And, chuckling, they knuckle the keys; Light-footed, my steel feelers flicker And pluck from these keys melodies.
