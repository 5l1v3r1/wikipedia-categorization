Although virtually all films produced today are made within the IMR, it is not the only possible mode of representation.  Other possibilities include the <b>primitive mode of representation</b>, which was dominant before being replaced by the IMR; certain <a href=\"/wiki/Avant-garde_film\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Avant-garde film\">avant-garde films</a> that constitute a \u201c<a href=\"/wiki/Deconstructionist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deconstructionist\">deconstructionist</a>\u201d challenge to the IMR; and various non-western modes, notably pre-war Japanese film,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> that were possible before the IMR became the worldwide norm.   <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema\" title=\"Classical Hollywood cinema\">Classical Hollywood cinema</a> is the dominant style within the IMR, but other styles such as <a href=\"/wiki/Art_house\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Art house\">art house</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Independent_film\" title=\"Independent film\">independent</a>, and most (current) foreign styles fall no less under the IMR.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institutional_mode_of_representation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Overview\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The concept was developed by <a href=\"/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Burch\" title=\"No\u00ebl Burch\">No\u00ebl Burch</a> in his 1969 book <i>Praxis du cin\u00e9ma</i>.  Burch\u2019s goal is to show that the IMR was a class-determined practice, developed out of the bourgeois desire for totalizing illusionistic representation.  <a href=\"/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Bazin\" title=\"Andr\u00e9 Bazin\">Andr\u00e9 Bazin</a> had identified the \u201cmyth of total cinema,\u201d or a constant desire to represent reality as completely as possible, which he claimed as the root of cinema innovations (both technology such as sound, color, and widescreen as well as techniques such as more elaborate editing).  Burch, on the other hand, argues that IMR is no more elaborate or realistic a system than its alternatives.  \n</p><p>The IMR is characterized by the attempt to create an entirely closed fictional world on screen.  The audience is completely imaginatively involved in the film, instead of being distant from it and seeing it as an object to be examined.  Burch argues that the key to the IMR is \"spectatorial identification with a ubiquitous camera.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Various techniques (often referred to as the \u201clanguage of cinema\u201d) were developed in order to accomplish this identification:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Films are constructed out of a sequence of shots, each of which presents the viewer with one clear piece of information.  In contrast to the Primitive Mode, IMR therefore uses close-ups.</li>\n<li>A three-dimensional space is created, using Renaissance rules of <a href=\"/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)\" title=\"Perspective (graphical)\">perspective</a> as well as new <a href=\"/wiki/Cinematic_techniques\" title=\"Cinematic techniques\">cinematic techniques</a> such as <a href=\"/wiki/Editing\" title=\"Editing\">editing</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Lighting\" title=\"Lighting\">lighting</a>.  To preserve the illusion of spatial integrity, which was lost with the introduction of close-ups, eye-line and directional matches were introduced.  The film is thus perceived as taking place in an environment around the viewer.</li>\n<li>Characters are psychologically individuated, through close-ups on faces and acting methods borrowed from (bourgeois) theater.  Psychological depth is prized, and the narrative is driven by character psychology.  The audience is therefore invited to interpret the motivations of the characters, and thus involve itself with the film.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institutional_mode_of_representation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Formalist_film_theory\" title=\"Formalist film theory\">Formalist film theory</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institutional_mode_of_representation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">No\u00ebl Burch (1979). <i><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.aaq5060.0001.001\">To the Distant Observer: Form and Meaning in Japanese Cinema</a></i>.
