Linguistic film theory  is a form of film theory that studies the aesthetics of film by investigating the concepts and practices that comprise the experience and interpretation of movies. Linguistic film theory was proposed by Stanley Cavell  and it is based on the philosophical tradition begun by late Ludwig Wittgenstein. Critics from this tradition often clarify misconceptions used in theoretical film studies   and instead produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life.
