In mathematics, the plastic number ρ (also known as the plastic constant, the minimal Pisot number, the platin number,  Siegel's number or, in French, le nombre radiant) is a mathematical constant which is the unique real solution of the cubic equation It has the exact value  Its decimal expansion begins with 1.324717957244746025960908854….  The powers of the plastic number A(n) = ρn satisfy the third-order linear recurrence relation A(n) = A(n − 2) + A(n − 3) for n > 2. Hence it is the limiting ratio of successive terms of any (non-zero) integer sequence satisfying this recurrence such as the Cordonnier numbers (better known as the Padovan sequence) the Perrin numbers and the Van der Laan numbers, and bears relationships to these sequences akin to the relationships of the golden ratio to the second-order Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, akin to the relationships between the silver ratio and the Pell numbers.  The plastic number satisfies the nested radical recurrence:  Because the plastic number has the minimal polynomial x3 − x − 1 = 0, it is also a solution of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0 for every polynomial p that is a multiple of x3 − x − 1, but not for any other polynomials with integer coefficients. Since the discriminant of its minimal polynomial is −23, its splitting field over rationals is ℚ(√−23, ρ). This field is also a Hilbert class field of ℚ(√−23). The plastic number is the smallest Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number. Its algebraic conjugates are of absolute value ≈ 0.868837 (sequence A191909 in the OEIS). This value is also 1/√ρ because the product of the three roots of the minimal polynomial is 1. The plastic number can be written using the hyperbolic cosine (cosh) and its inverse: (See Cubic function#Trigonometric (and hyperbolic) method.) There are precisely three ways of partitioning a square into three similar rectangles:   The fact that a rectangle of aspect ratio ρ2 can be used for dissections of a square into similar rectangles is equivalent to an algebraic property of the number ρ2 related to the Routh–Hurwitz theorem: all of its conjugates have positive real part.   Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (het plastische getal in Dutch) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer Gérard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (le nombre radiant in French). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape.  This, according to Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.  The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazalé  and subsequently used by Martin Gardner , but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + √2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.  Donald E. Knuth has suggested referring to                                    ρ                        2                                     {\textstyle \rho ^{2}}     as "High Phi", along with suggesting a special typographic mark for it.
