The Structure of Iki (「いき」の構造, Iki no kōzō) is a 1930 book about the aesthetics of Japanese taste by the philosopher Shūzō Kuki.  Kuki argues that the Edo ideal of iki or "chic" has a threefold structure representing the fusion of the "amorousness" (bitai) of the Geisha, the "valor" (ikuji) of the samurai, and the "resignation" (akirame) of the Buddhist priest.  The work for which Kuki is best known,  The Structure of Iki is often regarded as the most creative work in modern Japanese aesthetics.  Graham Parkes has praised the work for its subtlety.
