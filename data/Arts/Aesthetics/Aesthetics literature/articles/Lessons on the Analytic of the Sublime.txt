Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime (French: Leçons sur l'Analytique du Sublime) is a 1991 book by the philosopher Jean-François Lyotard. Lyotard provides a detailed reading of Immanuel Kant's description of the sublime in the Critique of Judgment (1790).  Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime has been seen as Lyotard's most important work since The Differend (1983).
