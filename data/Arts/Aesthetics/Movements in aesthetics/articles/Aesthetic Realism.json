It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it\u2014contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: \"All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves.\"\n</p><p>The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in <a href=\"/wiki/SoHo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SoHo\">SoHo</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York City</a>, through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.\n</p><p>The Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that \"we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Philosophy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Philosophy</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Major_texts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Major texts</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Poetry\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Poetry</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Lectures_and_classes_by_Eli_Siegel\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#The_arts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The arts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Aesthetic_Realism_Foundation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Aesthetic Realism Foundation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Aesthetic_Realism_and_homosexuality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Opposition_to_prejudice_and_racism\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Opposition to prejudice and racism</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Criticism_and_response\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Criticism and response</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Bibliography\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bibliography</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philosophy\">Philosophy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aesthetic_Realism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Philosophy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful.

In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  Siegel reasoned, \"If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is \"every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation\u2014the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt\u2014\"the addition to self through the lessening of something else\"\u2014he or she is unjust to people and things.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress,<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner.

Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for \"human beings placed differently from ourselves\" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality.  Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity\u2019s economic activities.  The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that \"the world\u2019s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one\u2019s own life.\" Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, \"civilization has yet to begin.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Major_texts\">Major texts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aesthetic_Realism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Major texts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts.

This was the validity of the theory of \u2018Aesthetic Realism\u2019 as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition\u2026.Aesthetic Realism is: \u2018The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\u2019\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-46\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-46\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Smithsonian Archives of American Art: \"Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968.\" <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/koppchai.htm\">[2]</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-47\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-47\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ralph Hattersley, \"Form and Content in Color,\" <i>Popular Photography</i> July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87): \"The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, \u2018In reality opposites are one; art shows this.\u2019 Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-48\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-48\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Nat Herz, <i>Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography,</i> Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-49\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-49\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>Library Journal,</i> 1 September 1969: \"Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies.
