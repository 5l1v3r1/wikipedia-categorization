Peter Kivy (October 22, 1934 – May 6, 2017  ) was professor emeritus of musicology and philosophy at Rutgers University. He studied particularly the philosophy of music. Kivy earned master's degrees in both philosophy (University of Michigan, 1958) and musicology (Yale University, 1960). He earned his PhD at Columbia University in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. His early work was on the 18th-century British aesthetics, and was influenced by Francis Hutcheson. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he had been interested mainly in music philosophy. His book The Corded Shell made him a central figure in music aesthetics.  One preoccupation of his had been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to "express" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by Stephen Davies.  Some criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in Music, Philosophy, and Modernity (2007) by Andrew Bowie and Filosofía de la Música.
