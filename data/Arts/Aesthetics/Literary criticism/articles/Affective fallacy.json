The term was coined by <a href=\"/wiki/William_Kurtz_Wimsatt,_Jr.\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.\">W.K. Wimsatt</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Monroe_Beardsley\" title=\"Monroe Beardsley\">Monroe Beardsley</a> in 1946 as a principle of <a href=\"/wiki/New_Criticism\" title=\"New Criticism\">New Criticism</a> which is often paired with their study of <i>The Intentional Fallacy</i>. \n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Concept\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Concept</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Reception\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reception</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Wimsatt_and_Beardsley\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Wimsatt and Beardsley</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Concept\">Concept</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Affective_fallacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Concept\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The concept of affective fallacy is an answer to the idea of impressionistic criticism, which argues that the reader's response to a poem is the ultimate indication of its value. It is the antithesis of affective criticism, which is the practice of evaluating the effect that a literary work has on its reader or audience. The concept was presented after the authors had presented their paper on <i>The Intentionalist Fallacy</i>.\n</p><p>First defined in an article published in <i>The Sewanee Review</i> in 1949, the concept of an affective fallacy was most clearly articulated in <i>The Verbal Icon</i>, Wimsatt's collection of essays published in 1954. Wimsatt used the term to refer to all forms of criticism that understood a text's effect upon the reader to be the primary route to analyzing the importance and success of that text. This definition of the fallacy, if strictly followed, touches on or wholly includes nearly all of the major modes of literary criticism, from <a href=\"/wiki/Ovid\" title=\"Ovid\">Ovid</a>'s <i>docere delictendo</i> (to teach by delighting), <a href=\"/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Catharsis\" title=\"Catharsis\">catharsis</a>,  and <a href=\"/wiki/Longinus_(literature)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Longinus (literature)\">Longinus</a>'s concept of \"transport\" to late-nineteenth century <a href=\"/wiki/Belles-lettres\" title=\"Belles-lettres\">belles-lettres</a> and the contemporary <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago_Critics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chicago Critics\">Chicago Critics</a>. For Wimsatt, the fallacy led to a number of potential errors, most of them related to emotional relativism. A view of literature based on its putative emotional effects will always be vulnerable to mystification and subjectivity; Wimsatt singles out the belletristic tradition exemplified by critics such as <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Quiller-Couch\" title=\"Arthur Quiller-Couch\">Arthur Quiller-Couch</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/George_Saintsbury\" title=\"George Saintsbury\">George Saintsbury</a> as an instance of a type of criticism that relies on subjective impressions and is thus unrepeatable and unreliable.\n</p><p>For Wimsatt, as for all the New Critics, such impressionistic approaches pose both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it makes reliable comparisons of different critics difficult, if not irrelevant. In this light, the affective fallacy ran afoul of the New Critics' desire to place literary criticism on a more objective and principled basis. On the theoretical plane, the critical approach denoted as affective fallacy was fundamentally unsound because it denied the iconicity of the literary text. New Critical theorists stressed the unique nature of poetic language, and they asserted that\u2014in view of this uniqueness\u2014the role of the critic is to study and elucidate the thematic and stylistic \"language\" of each text on its own terms, without primary reference to an outside context, whether of history, biography, or reader-response.\n</p><p>In practice, Wimsatt and the other New Critics were less stringent in their application of the theory than in their theoretical pronouncements. Wimsatt admitted the appropriateness of commenting on emotional effects as an entry into a text, as long as those effects were not made the focus of analysis.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reception\">Reception</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Affective_fallacy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Reception\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As with many concepts of <a href=\"/wiki/New_Criticism\" title=\"New Criticism\">New Criticism</a>, the concept of the affective fallacy was both controversial and, though widely influential, never accepted wholly by any great number of critics.\n</p><p>The first critiques of the concept came, naturally enough, from those academic schools against whom the New Critics were ranged in the 1940s and 1950s, principally the historical scholars and the remaining belletristic critics. Early commentary deplored the use of the word \"fallacy\" itself, which seemed to many critics unduly combative. More sympathetic critics, while still objecting to Wimsatt's tone, accepted as valuable and necessary his attempt to place criticism on a more objective basis.\n</p><p>However, the extremism of Wimsatt's approach was ultimately judged untenable by a number of critics. Just as <a href=\"/wiki/New_Historicism\" title=\"New Historicism\">New Historicism</a> repudiated the New Critics' rejection of historical context, so <a href=\"/wiki/Reader-response_criticism\" title=\"Reader-response criticism\">reader-response criticism</a> arose partly from dissatisfaction with the concept of the text as icon.  Reader-response critics denied that a text could have a quantifiable significance outside its being read and experienced by particular readers at particular moments. These critics rejected the idea of text as icon, focusing instead on the ramifications of the interaction between text and reader.\n</p><p>While the term remains current as a warning against unsophisticated use of emotional response in analyzing texts, the theory underlying the term has been thoroughly eclipsed by more recent developments in criticism.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
