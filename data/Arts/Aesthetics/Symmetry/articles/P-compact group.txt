In mathematics, in particular algebraic topology, a p-compact group is (roughly speaking) a space that is a homotopical version of a compact Lie group, but with all the structure concentrated at a single prime p. This concept was introduced by Dwyer and Wilkerson.  Subsequently the name homotopy Lie group has also been used. Examples include the p-completion of a compact and connected Lie group, and the Sullivan spheres, i.e. the p-completion of a sphere of dimension if n divides p âˆ’ 1. The classification of p-compact groups states that there is a 1-1 correspondence between connected p-compact groups, and root data over the p-adic integers. This is analogous to the classical classification of connected compact Lie groups, with the p-adic integers replacing the rational integers.
