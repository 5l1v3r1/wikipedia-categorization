In physics, a global symmetry is a symmetry that holds at all points in the spacetime under consideration, as opposed to a local symmetry which varies from point to point. Global symmetries require conservation laws, but not forces, in physics. An example of a global symmetry is the action  of the                         U         (         1         )         =                    e                        i             θ                                     {\displaystyle U(1)=e^{i\theta }}     (for                         θ                 {\displaystyle \theta }     a constant - making it a global transformation) group on the Dirac Lagrangian: Under this transformation the fermionic field changes as                         ψ         →                    e                        i             θ                             ψ                 {\displaystyle \psi \rightarrow e^{i\theta }\psi }     and                                                                ψ               ¯                                          →                    e                        −             i             θ                                                                    ψ               ¯                                                  {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}\rightarrow e^{-i\theta }{\bar {\psi }}}      and so:
