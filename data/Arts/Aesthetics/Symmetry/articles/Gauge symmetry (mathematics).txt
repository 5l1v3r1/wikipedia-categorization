In mathematics, any Lagrangian system generally admits gauge symmetries, though it may happen that they are trivial. In theoretical physics, the notion of gauge symmetries depending on parameter functions is a cornerstone of contemporary field theory.  A gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian                         L                 {\displaystyle L}     is defined as a differential operator on some vector bundle                         E                 {\displaystyle E}     taking its values in the linear space of (variational or exact) symmetries of                         L                 {\displaystyle L}    . Therefore, a gauge symmetry of                         L                 {\displaystyle L}     depends on sections of                         E                 {\displaystyle E}     and their partial derivatives.  For instance, this is the case of gauge symmetries in classical field theory.  Yangâ€“Mills gauge theory and gauge gravitation theory exemplify classical field theories with gauge symmetries.   Gauge symmetries possess the following two peculiarities. Note that, in quantum field theory, a generating functional fail to be invariant under gauge transformations, and gauge symmetries are replaced with the BRST symmetries, depending on ghosts and acting both on fields and ghosts.
