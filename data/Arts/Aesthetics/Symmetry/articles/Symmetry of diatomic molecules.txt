Molecular symmetry in physics and chemistry describes the symmetry present in molecules and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry. Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in the application of Quantum Mechanics in physics and chemistry, for example it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's properties, such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions (based on selection rules), without doing the exact rigorous calculations (which, in some cases, may not even be possible). Group theory is the predominant framework for analyzing molecular symmetry. Among all the molecular symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features and they are relatively easier to analyze. The physical laws governing a system is generally written as a relation (equations, differential equations, integral equations etc.). An operation on the ingredients of this relation, which keeps the form of the relations invariant is called a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system. Symmetry is a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanics. It can predict conserved quantities and provide quantum numbers. It can predict degeneracies of eigenstates and gives insights about the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian without calculating them. Rather than looking into individual symmetries, it is sometimes more convenient to look into the general relations between the symmetries. It turns out that Group theory is the most efficient way of doing this. A group is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form (G,*)) consisting of a set G and a binary operation                                               ′                             ∗           ′                          {\displaystyle '*'}     (sometimes loosely called 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties: The set of all symmetry transformations of a Hamiltonian has the structure of a group, with group multiplication equivalent to applying the transformations one after the other. The group elements can be represented as matrices, so that the group operation becomes the ordinary matrix multiplication. In quantum mechanics, the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of states are given by unitary operators, so each of the elements of the symmetry groups are unitary operators. Now any unitary operator can be expressed as the exponential of some Hermitian operator . So, the corresponding Hermitian operators are the 'generators' of the symmetry group. These unitary transformations act on the Hamiltonian operator in some Hilbert space in a way that the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the transformations. In other words, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian. If                         U                 {\displaystyle U}     represents the unitary symmetry operator and acts on the Hamiltonian                         H                 {\displaystyle H}    , then; These operators have the above-mentioned properties of a group:  So, by the symmetry of a system, we mean a set of operators, each of which commutes with the Hamiltonian, and they form a symmetry group. This group may be Abelian or Non-Abelian. Depending upon which one it is, the properties of the system changes (for example, if the group is Abelian, there would be no degeneracy). Corresponding to every different kind of symmetry in a system, we can find a symmetry group associated with it. It follows that the generator                         T                 {\displaystyle T}     of the symmetry group also commutes with the Hamiltonian. Now, it follows that:                                                                d                                ⟨                 T                 ⟩                                                        d               t                                          =                                                d                                ⟨                                    Ψ                                        |                                      T                                        |                                      Ψ                                  ⟩                                                        d               t                                          =                    ⟨                                                                           ∂                   Ψ                                                     ∂                   t                                                                         |                          T                            |                          Ψ                      ⟩                  +                    ⟨                        Ψ                            |                                                                             ∂                   T                                                     ∂                   t                                                                         |                          Ψ                      ⟩                  +                    ⟨                        Ψ                            |                          T                            |                                                                             ∂                   Ψ                                                     ∂                   t                                                                   ⟩                          {\displaystyle {\frac {d\left\langle T\right\rangle }{dt}}={\frac {d\left\langle \Psi |T|\Psi \right\rangle }{dt}}=\left\langle {\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial t}}|T|\Psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |{\frac {\partial T}{\partial t}}|\Psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |T|{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial t}}\right\rangle }     Now,                         i         ℏ                                                ∂                                |                 Ψ                 ⟩                                                        ∂               t                                          =         H                    |           Ψ           ⟩                          {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial \left|\Psi \right\rangle }{\partial t}}=H\left|\Psi \right\rangle }     So,                                                                d                                ⟨                 T                 ⟩                                                        d               t                                          =         −                                 1                            i               ℏ                                                     ⟨                        Ψ                            |                          H             T                            |                          Ψ                      ⟩                  +                                 1                            i               ℏ                                                     ⟨                        Ψ                            |                          T             H                            |                          Ψ                      ⟩                  +                    ⟨                                                        ∂                 T                                               ∂                 t                                                  ⟩                          {\displaystyle {\frac {d\left\langle T\right\rangle }{dt}}=-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \Psi |HT|\Psi \right\rangle +{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \Psi |TH|\Psi \right\rangle +\left\langle {\frac {\partial T}{\partial t}}\right\rangle }     as H is also Hermitian.

So the observable corresponding to the operator T, is conserved. Some specific examples can be systems having rotational, translational invariance etc.. For a rotationally invariant system, The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the general rotation group. Now, if (say) the system is invariant about any rotation about Z-axis (i.e., the system has axial symmetry), then the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the group of rotation about the symmetry axis. Now, this group is generated by the Z-component of the orbital angular momentum,                                                 L                                   z                                     {\displaystyle {L}_{z}}     (general group element                         R         (         α         )         =                                                e                                                                             −                   i                   α                                                                                        L                                                                       z                                                                                                 ℏ                                                                 {\displaystyle R(\alpha )={{e}^{\frac {-i\alpha {{L}_{z}}}{\hbar }}}}    ). Thus,                                                 L                                   z                                     {\displaystyle {L}_{z}}     commutes with                         H                 {\displaystyle H}     for this system and Z-component of the angular momentum is conserved. Similarly, translation symmetry gives rise to conservation of linear momentum, inversion symmetry gives rise to parity conservation and so on. A molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually has some geometrical symmetry.This symmetry is described by a certain point group which consists of operations (called symmetry operations) that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that is indistinguishable from the starting configuration. There are five types of point group symmetry operation: identity, rotation, reflection, inversion and improper rotation or rotation-reflection. Common to all symmetry operations is that the geometrical center-point of the molecule does not change its position; hence the name point group. One  can determine the elements of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one uses a point group, the elements are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the elements rotate and/or reflect the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these elements commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by Longuet-Higgins . See the Section "Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry" below, and Link  .  The elements of permutation-inversion groups commute with the full molecular Hamiltonian. In addition to point groups, there exists another kind of group important in crystallography, where translation in 3-D also needs to be taken care of. They are known as space groups. The five basic symmetry operations mentioned above are:  It is to be noted that all other symmetry present in a specific molecule are a combination of these 5 operations. The Schoenflies (or Schönflies) notation, named after the German mathematician Arthur Moritz Schoenflies, is one of two conventions commonly used to describe point groups. This notation is used in spectroscopy and is used here to specify a molecular point group. There are two point groups for diatomic molecules:                                                                C                                         ∞               v                                                  {\displaystyle {{C}_{\infty v}}}     for heteronuclear diatomics, and                                                                D                                         ∞               h                                                  {\displaystyle {{D}_{\infty h}}}     for homonuclear diatomics. The group                                                                C                                         ∞               v                                                  {\displaystyle {{C}_{\infty v}}}    , contains rotations                         C         (         ϕ         )                 {\displaystyle C(\phi )}     through any angle                         ϕ                 {\displaystyle \phi }     about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflections                                                                σ                                         v                                                  {\displaystyle {{\sigma }_{v}}}     through the planes containing the inter-nuclear axis (or the vertical axis, that is reason of the subscript 'v').In the group                                                                C                                         ∞               v                                                  {\displaystyle {{C}_{\infty v}}}     all planes of symmetry are equivalent, so that all reflections                                                                σ                                         v                                                  {\displaystyle {{\sigma }_{v}}}     form a single class with a continuous series of elements; the axis of symmetry is bilateral, so that there is a continuous series of classes, each containing two elements                         C         (         ±         ϕ         )                 {\displaystyle C(\pm \phi )}    . Note that this group is Non-abelian and there exists an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group. The character table of the group is as follows: E 2c∞                                   ϕ                          {\displaystyle {\phi }}     ...                         ∞                                                σ                                         v                                                  {\displaystyle \infty {{\sigma }_{v}}}     linear functions, rotations quadratic  In addition to axial reflection symmetry, homonuclear diatomic molecules are symmetric with respect to inversion or reflection through any axis in the plane passing through the point of symmetry and perpendicular to the inter-nuclear axis.  The classes of the group                                                                D                                         ∞               h                                                  {\displaystyle {{D}_{\infty h}}}     can be obtained from those of the group                                                                C                                         ∞               v                                                  {\displaystyle {{C}_{\infty v}}}     using the relation between the two groups:                                                                D                                         ∞               h                                          =                                                C                                         ∞               v                                          ×                                                C                                         i                                                  {\displaystyle {{D}_{\infty h}}={{C}_{\infty v}}\times {{C}_{i}}}    .

So the quantum number                         l                 {\displaystyle l}     is no longer a good quantum number. The internuclear axis chooses a specific direction in space and the potential is no longer spherically symmetric. Instead,                                                                L                                         z                                                  {\displaystyle {{L}_{z}}}     and                                                                J                                         z                                                  {\displaystyle {{J}_{z}}}     commutes with the Hamiltonian                         H                 {\displaystyle H}     (taking the arbitrary internuclear axis as the Z axis). But                                                                L                                         x                                          ,                                                L                                         y                                                  {\displaystyle {{L}_{x}},{{L}_{y}}}     do not commute with                         H                 {\displaystyle H}     due to the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule is invariant under rotations about the internuclear line (the Z axis), but not under rotations about the X or Y axes. Again,                                                                S                                         2                                                  {\displaystyle {{S}^{2}}}     and                                                                S                                         z                                                  {\displaystyle {{S}_{z}}}     act on a different Hilbert space, so they commute with                         H                 {\displaystyle H}     in this case also. The electronic Hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule is also invariant under reflections in all planes containing the internuclear line. The (X-Z) plane is such a plane, and reflection of the coordinates of the electrons in this plane corresponds to the operation                                                                y                                         i                                          →         −                                                y                                         i                                                  {\displaystyle {{y}_{i}}\to -{{y}_{i}}}    . If                                                                A                                         y                                                  {\displaystyle {{A}_{y}}}     is the operator that performs this reflection, then                         [                                                A                                         y                                          ,         H         ]         =         0                 {\displaystyle [{{A}_{y}},H]=0}    . So the Complete Set of Commuting Operators (CSCO) for a general heteronuclear diatomic molecule is                         {         H         ,                                                                              J                                         z                                          ,                                                L                                         z                                          ,                                                S                                         2                                          ,                                                S                                         z                                          ,         A         }                 {\displaystyle \{H,{\text{ }}{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A\}}    ; where                         A                 {\displaystyle A}     is an operator that inverts only one of the two spatial co-ordinates (x or y).  In the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule, there is an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provided by the internuclear axis, there is a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei (the symmetry discussed in this paragraph only depends on the two nuclear charges being the same. The two nuclei can therefore have different mass, that is they can be two isotopes of the same species such as the proton and the deuteron, or                                                                O                                         16                                                  {\displaystyle {{O}^{16}}}     and                                                                O                                         18                                                  {\displaystyle {{O}^{18}}}    , and so on). Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an inversion of the coordinates of all electrons with respect to that origin, namely in the operation                                                                                                    r                   →                                                                         i                                          →         −                                                                                    r                   →                                                                         i                                                  {\displaystyle {{\vec {r}}_{i}}\to -{{\vec {r}}_{i}}}    .

Molecular term symbol is a shorthand expression of the group representation and angular momenta that characterize the state of a molecule. It is the equivalent of the term symbol for the atomic case. We already know the CSCO of the most general diatomic molecule. So, the good quantum numbers can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule.

This twofold degeneracy is actually only approximate and it is possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motions leads to a splitting of the terms with                         Λ         ≠         0                 {\displaystyle \Lambda \neq 0}     into two nearby levels, which is called                         Λ                 {\displaystyle \Lambda }    -doubling.                          Λ         =         0                 {\displaystyle \Lambda =0}     corresponds to the                         Σ                 {\displaystyle \Sigma }     states. These states are non-degenerate, so that the states of a                         Σ                 {\displaystyle \Sigma }     term can only be multiplied by a constant in a reflection through a plane containing the molecular axis. When                         Λ         =         0                 {\displaystyle \Lambda =0}    , simultaneous eigenfunctions of                         H                 {\displaystyle H}    ,                                                L                                   z                                     {\displaystyle {L}_{z}}     and                                                 A                                   y                                     {\displaystyle {A}_{y}}     can be constructed. Since                                    A                        y                                   2                             =         1                 {\displaystyle A_{y}^{2}=1}    , the eigenfunctions of                                                 A                                   y                                     {\displaystyle {A}_{y}}     have eigenvalues                         ±         1                 {\displaystyle \pm 1}    . So to completely specify                         Σ                 {\displaystyle \Sigma }     states of diatomic molecules,                                                                Σ                                         +                                                  {\displaystyle {{\Sigma }^{+}}}     states, which  is left unchanged upon reflection in a plane containing the nuclei, needs to be distinguished from                                                                Σ                                         −                                                  {\displaystyle {{\Sigma }^{-}}}     states, for which it changes sign in performing that operation. Homonuclear diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry at their midpoint. Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the electronic Hamiltonian is invariant under the point group operation i of inversion of the coordinates of all electrons at that origin. This operation is not the parity operation P (or E*); the parity operation involves the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass. Electronic states are either even, i.e. remain unchanged by the operation i, or they are odd, i.e. changed in sign by i. The former are denoted by the subscript g and are called gerade, while the latter are denoted by the subscript u and are called ungerade. The subscripts g or u are therefore added to the term symbol, so that for homonuclear diatomic molecules we have                                                                Σ                                         g                                          ,                                                Σ                                         u                                          ,                                                Π                                         g                                          ,                                                Π                                         u                                          ,         .         .         .         .         .         .                 {\displaystyle {{\Sigma }_{g}},{{\Sigma }_{u}},{{\Pi }_{g}},{{\Pi }_{u}},......}     electronic states. A homonuclear diatomic molecule has four non-degenerate                         Σ                 {\displaystyle \Sigma }     electronic states:                                    Σ                        g                                   +                             ,                    Σ                        g                                   −                             ,                    Σ                        u                                   +                             ,                    Σ                        u                                   −                                     {\displaystyle \Sigma _{g}^{+},\Sigma _{g}^{-},\Sigma _{u}^{+},\Sigma _{u}^{-}}    . Vibronic states are classified according to the irreducible representations of the appropriate point group. The complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic energy levels (usually called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label + or -. The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commutes with the operation of permuting (or exchanging) the coordinates of the two (identical) nuclei and rotational levels  gain the additional label s or a depending on whether the total wavefunction is unchanged (symmetric) or changed in sign (antisymmetric) by the permutation operation. Thus, the rotational levels of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are labelled + or -, whereas those of homonuclear diatomic molecules are labelled +s, +a, -s or -a. The rovibronic nuclear spin states are classified using the appropriate permutation-inversion group.  The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (as for all centro-symmetric molecules) does not commute with the point group inversion operation i because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of g and u vibronic states (called ortho-para mixing) and give rise to ortho-para transitions   If S denotes the resultant of the individual electron spins,                         s         (         s         +         1         )                                                ℏ                                         2                                                  {\displaystyle s(s+1){{\hbar }^{2}}}     are the eigenvalues of S and as in the case of atoms, each electronic term of the molecule is also characterised by the value of S. If spin-orbit coupling is neglected, there is a degeneracy of order                         2         s         +         1                 {\displaystyle 2s+1}     associated with each                         s                 {\displaystyle s}     for a given                         Λ                 {\displaystyle \Lambda }    . Just as for atoms, the quantity                         2         s         +         1                 {\displaystyle 2s+1}     is called the multiplicity of the term and.is written as a (left) superscript, so that the term symbol is written as                                                                        2             s             +             1                             Λ                 {\displaystyle {}^{2s+1}\Lambda }    . For example, the symbol                                                                        3                             Π                 {\displaystyle {}^{3}\Pi }    denotes a term such that                         Λ         =         2                 {\displaystyle \Lambda =2}     and                         s         =         1                 {\displaystyle s=1}    . It is worth noting that the ground state (often labelled by the symbol                         X                 {\displaystyle X}    ) of most diatomic molecules is such that                         s         =         0                 {\displaystyle s=0}     and exhibits maximum symmetry.

Spin–orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the z-component of spin interacts with the z-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis Jz.

If the energy values of the two terms become equal at the point                         (                                                R                                         C                                          +         Δ         R         )                 {\displaystyle ({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)}     (i.e. the terms intersect), this means that the two values of                         E                 {\displaystyle E}     given by formula, are the same. For this to happen, the expression under the radical must vanish. Since it is the sum of two squares, both are simultaneously zero. So, it gives the conditions:                                    E                        1                                   (             0             )                             −                    E                        2                                   (             0             )                             +                    H                        11                                                                 ′                                          −                    H                        22                                                                 ′                                          =         0                 {\displaystyle E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0}     and                                     H                        12                                                                 ′                                          =         0                 {\displaystyle H_{12}^{'}=0}     However, we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter                         Δ         R                 {\displaystyle \Delta R}     giving the perturbation                                    H           ′                          {\displaystyle H'}    . Hence the two conditions involving more than one parameter cannot in general be simultaneously satisfied (the initial assumption that                                    |                        Φ                            1                                         (               0               )                                   ⟩                          {\displaystyle \left|\Phi _{1}^{(0)}\right\rangle }     and                                    |                        Φ                            2                                         (               0               )                                   ⟩                          {\displaystyle \left|\Phi _{2}^{(0)}\right\rangle }     real, implies that                                    H                        12                                                                 ′                                                  {\displaystyle H_{12}^{'}}     is also real). So, two case can arise:  Thus, in a diatomic molecule, only terms of different symmetry can intersect, while the intersection of terms of like symmetry is forbidden. This is, in general, true for any case in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian contains some parameter and its eigenvalues are consequently functions of that parameter. This general rule is known as von Neumann - Wigner non-crossing rule.  [notes 1] This general symmetry principle has important consequences is molecular spectra. In fact, in the applications of valence bond method in case of diatomic molecules, three main correspondence between the atomic and the molecular orbitals are taken care of: Thus, von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule also acts as a starting point for valence bond theory. Symmetry in diatomic molecules manifests itself directly by influencing the molecular spectra of the molecule. The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are: In the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the electric dipole operator                         D                 {\displaystyle D}     along the molecular axis. This is the permanent electric dipole moment. In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there is no pure rotation spectrum. Heteronuclear diatomic molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra corresponding to rotational transitions, without change in the vibronic state.

orthogonality of the states. So, the transition matrix is non-zero only if the molecular dipole moment varies with displacement, for otherwise the derivatives of                         μ                 {\displaystyle \mu }     would be zero. The gross selection rule for the vibrational transitions of diatomic molecules is then: To show a vibrational spectrum, a diatomic molecule must have a dipole moment that varies with extension. So, homonuclear diatomic molecules do not undergo electric-dipole vibrational transitions. So, a homonuclear diatomic molecule doesn't show purely vibrational spectra. For small displacements, the electric dipole moment of a molecule can be expected to vary linearly with the extension of the bond. This would be the case for a heteronuclear molecule in which the partial charges on the two atoms were independent of the internuclear distance. In such cases (known as harmonic approximation), the quadratic and higher terms in the expansion can be ignored and                                                                μ                                         v               ,                                v                 ′                                                         =                    ⟨                                       v               ′                                         |                          μ                            |                          v                      ⟩                  =                                                (                                                                        d                     μ                                                           d                     x                                                                  )                                         0                                                     ⟨                                       v               ′                                         |                          x                            |                          v                      ⟩                          {\displaystyle {{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v\right\rangle ={{({\frac {d\mu }{dx}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v\right\rangle }    . Now, the matrix elements can be expressed in position basis in terms of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions: Hermite polynomials.

So, the only non-zero contributions to                                                                μ                                         v               ,                                v                 ′                                                                 {\displaystyle {{\mu }_{v,v'}}}     comes from                                    v           ′                  =         v         ±         1                 {\displaystyle v'=v\pm 1}    . So, the selection rule for heteronuclear diatomic molecules is:                         Δ         v         =         ±         1                 {\displaystyle \Delta v=\pm 1}     Homonuclear diatomic molecules show neither pure vibrational nor pure rotational spectra. However, as the absorption of a photon requires the molecule to take up one unit of angular momentum, vibrational transitions are accompanied by a change in rotational state, which is subject to the same selection rules as for the pure rotational spectrum.

These bands are in the infra-red part of the spectrum.

This gives rise to a further branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum, called the Q branch.

For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, this selection rule has two consequences:   Homonuclear diatomic molecules also show this kind of spectra. The selection rules, however, are a bit different. An explicit implication of symmetry on the molecular structure can be shown in case of the simplest bi-nuclear system: a hydrogen molecule ion or a di-hydrogen cation,                                                 H                                   2                                   +                                     {\displaystyle {\text{H}}_{2}^{+}}    . A natural trial wave function for the                                                 H                                   2                                   +                                     {\displaystyle {\text{H}}_{2}^{+}}     is determined by first considering the lowest-energy state of the system when the two protons are widely separated. Then there are clearly two possible states: the electron is attached either to one of the protons, forming a hydrogen atom in the ground state, or the electron is attached to the other proton, again in the ground state of a hydrogen atom (as depicted in the picture).

The electronic Hamiltonian of                                                 H                                   2                                   +                                     {\displaystyle {\text{H}}_{2}^{+}}     commutes with the  point group inversion symmetry operation i. Using its symmetry properties, we can relate the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian as:                                                                H

As a result, the ground state of                                                 H                                   2                                   +                                     {\displaystyle {\text{H}}_{2}^{+}}     is                                                                X                                         2                                                     Σ                        g                                   +                                     {\displaystyle {{X}^{2}}\Sigma _{g}^{+}}     and this state                                    (                        |             +             ⟩                      )                          {\displaystyle \left(\left|+\right\rangle \right)}     is called a bonding molecular orbital.  Thus, symmetry plays an explicit role in the formation of                                                 H                                   2                                   +                                     {\displaystyle {\text{H}}_{2}^{+}}    .
