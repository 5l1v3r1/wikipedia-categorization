In algebraic topology, a symmetric spectrum X is a spectrum of pointed simplicial sets that comes with an action of the symmetric group                                    Σ                        n                                     {\displaystyle \Sigma _{n}}     on                                    X                        n                                     {\displaystyle X_{n}}     such that the composition of structure maps is equivariant with respect to                                    Σ                        p                             ×                    Σ                        n                                     {\displaystyle \Sigma _{p}\times \Sigma _{n}}    . A morphism between symmetric spectra is a morphism of spectra that is equivariant with respect to the actions of symmetric groups. The technical advantage of the category                                                 S                                        p                        Σ                                     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}p^{\Sigma }}     of symmetric spectra is that it has a closed symmetric monoidal structure (with respect to smash product). It is also a simplicial model category. A symmetric ring spectrum is a monoid in                                                 S                                        p                        Σ                                     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}p^{\Sigma }}    ; if the monoid is commutative, it's a commutative ring spectrum. The possibility of this definition of "ring spectrum" was one of motivations behind the category. A similar technical goal is also achieved by May's theory of S-modules, a competing theory.
