Symmetry in the Quran is the belief held by some Muslims, that the word and verse structure of the Quran exhibits such complicated symmetry that it could be neither random placements, nor the intentional work of man, but rather  proof of "the will of God".  There are many examples of such symmetry. Using a program called QuranCode   and other analysis programs, scholars have found many patterns. An example is that chapter 76, called Al-Insan, has 247 words. It has three mentions of the word silver. The middle word of the chapter is word number 124. It is the word silver. It is in a verse that is the middle verse of the chapter (verse 16 of 31). It is the third of five words of the verse.   Some of this symmetry are the significance of the number 19: It is claimed that if all the numbers mentioned in the Quran are added up, their sum is 162,146, which is 19x6534; That there are 19x6  (114) Suras; that Muhammad's first revelation consists of a verse that has 19 words and 4x19 (76) letters.  Another aspect of the Quran's symmetry, which was discovered using linguistic computer searching algorithms (Quran Corpus, an open-source software), includes the number of times certain words and their forms are used in the whole Quran. Some of these symmetrical patterns include:
