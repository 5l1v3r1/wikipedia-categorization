In mathematics, a  fibrifold is (roughly) a fiber space whose fibers and base spaces are orbifolds. They were introduced by John Horton Conway, Olaf Delgado Friedrichs, and Daniel H. Huson et al. (2001), who introduced a system of notation for 3-dimensional fibrifolds and used this  to assign names to the 219 affine space group types. 184 of these are considered reducible, and 35 irreducible. The 35 irreducible space groups correspond to the cubic space group. Irreducible group symbols (indexed 195−230) in Hermann–Mauguin notation, Fibrifold notation, geometric notation, and Coxeter notation:
