Desert X is a site-specific,  contemporary art exhibition that was built in the Coachella Valley from February 25 - April 30, 2017.  It was formed by Desert Biennial, a 501(C) charitable organization founded in 2015.  The exhibit is meant to bring attention to the valley's environment through the display the works of emerging artists. Themes include climate change, immigration, tourism, gaming and native American culture.       Works include a camouflaged house covered in mirrors, an autonomous vehicle known as the "ShyBot" that is programmed to avoid people as well as an underground bunker where there is kitsch sculpture of John F. Kennedy.  “ShyBot” Lost and Found.  In February 2017 the robot’s creator, an Italian artist “Norma Jeane” lost contact with ShyBot.  All communication was lost, and some thought the art robot was “bot-napped”.     In July 2018, an off-roader from the Coachella Valley found ShyBot and through a QR code on the body was able to contact ‘Desert X’, and facilitate her return.   ‘DESERT X’ RETURNS FEBRUARY 9 – APRIL 21, 2019.
