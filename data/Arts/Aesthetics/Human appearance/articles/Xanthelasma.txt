Xanthelasma is a sharply demarcated yellowish deposit of cholesterol underneath the skin, usually on or around the eyelids.  While they are neither harmful to the skin nor painful, these minor growths may be disfiguring and can be removed.  There is no high-quality evidence that xanthelasma deposits are related to blood low-density lipoprotein levels or increased risk of atherosclerosis.  A xanthelasma may be referred to as a xanthoma when becoming larger and nodular, assuming tumorous proportions.  Xanthelasma is often classified simply as a subtype of xanthoma.  Xanthelasmata can be removed with a trichloroacetic acid peel, surgery, lasers or cryotherapy. Removal may cause scarring and pigment changes, but it is an uncommon side-effect of treatment.  Recurrence is common: 40% of patients with XP had recurrence after primary surgical excision, 60% after secondary excision, and 80% when all four eyelids were involved. A possible cause might be insufficiently deep excisions.   Xanthelasma is a rare disorder in the General population, with a variable incidence of 0.56%–1.5% in western developed countries. The age of onset ranges  ranges from 15 to 75 with a peak in the 4th to 5th decades of life. There also seems to be a greater prevalance in females, but this might be due to higher consciousness to cosmetic defects   The word is derived from Greek xanthós, ξανθός , "yellow" and élasma, έλασμα, "foil". The plural is xanthelasmata.
