Carboxytherapy is a non-surgical cosmetic medicine treatment. Carboxytherapy employs injections to infuse gaseous carbon dioxide below the skin into the subcutaneous tissue through a needle. It claims to kill fat cells, stimulate blood flow, improve the skin's elasticity and reduce the appearance of cellulite  although it has not been clinically tested nor approved by the FDA.  It has also become a popular treatment for stretch marks.
