The Apology Project, a 1980 conceptual art project, was created by Allan Bridge who employed the pseudonym Mr. Apology. Bridge used an answering machine to record confessions from anonymous callers. More than 1000 hours of confession were recorded, ranging from common confessions to ritualistic murders. Some of the confessions were published in Bridge's magazine Apology. This Apology Project is not to be confused with the Apology Project of Elliniko Teatro, a theatrical production based on Plato's The Apology of Socrates, featuring Yannis Simonides (see http://www.ellinikotheatro.org.)
