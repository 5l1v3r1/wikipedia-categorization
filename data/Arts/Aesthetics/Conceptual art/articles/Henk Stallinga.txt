 Henk Stallinga is a Dutch multidisciplinary contemporary artist  based in Amsterdam. Henk Stallinga graduated from the Rietveld Academy  in Amsterdam in 1993, and established Studio Stallinga the same year. As of 1998, the studio is co-owned by managing partner Annemarie Galani.    Stallinga received international recognition at the 1995 Mondriaan exhibition in the MoMA New York, when the Garden Café  of the MoMa was installed with work of Henk Stallinga, Joep van Lieshout, and others.  Stallinga’s visual language is rooted in De Stijl, Japanese architecture, minimal art and conceptual art.  Earlier works of Stallinga challenge the perception of the industrial product, its functionality and meaning.  At present, Stallinga works on sculptures and multimedia installations. His more recent works interweave visual elements with motion and sound.
