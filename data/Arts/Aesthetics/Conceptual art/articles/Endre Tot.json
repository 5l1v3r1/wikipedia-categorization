He started to make informel paintings, an absolute novelty in Hungary, in the early 60s followed shortly by collages and works executed in the spirit of Pop Art and Minimal Art. He became attached in the mid-60s to a leading but neglected Avant-Garde painter, Dezs\u0151 Korniss who highly appreciated his pioneering informel ventures. In 1968 and 1969 he joined his young Neo-Avant-Garde colleagues named collectively the Iparterv Group of Artists at two scandalous exhibitions heavily criticised by officialdom. A retrospective of his early works was staged at the Budapest Kiscelli Museum in 1989, his early pencil and ink drawings were shown at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r\u2019s King Stephen Museum in 2003, while a comprehensive exhibition of his early works entitled \u201eEarly Works \u2013 from painted to unpainted pictures\u201d at the Szombathely Gallery in 2004 presented most of his important works executed before his \u201eMy Unpainted Canvasses\u201d (1970). After the political turn of 1989-1990 many of his major works executed back in the 60s were acquired by important Hungarian museums.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_70s_.E2.80.93_The_Beginnings_of_Concept_Art\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_70s_\u2013_The_Beginnings_of_Concept_Art\">The 70s \u2013 The Beginnings of Concept Art</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The 70s \u2013 The Beginnings of Concept Art\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1970-71 he broke radically with painting and has since been pre-occupied with Concept Art. \u201eT\u00f3t may well have possessed the most phenomenal painter talent among artists living East of Amsterdam. And yet, he voluntarily relinquished painting for the sake of a truth that he had gradually recognised to be even more important than painting.\u201d (G\u00e9za Perneczky, writing in \u00daj M\u0171v\u00e9szet, October, 2003) As a farewell to his painter period he prepared his artist\u2019s book \u201eMy Unpainted Canvasses\u201d (1970), a virtual presentation of his canvasses never actually accomplished. Also in the early 70s, he evolved some of his basic ideas like \"Nothing/Zer0\", \"Rains and Gladnesses\" that were to permeate his works in subsequent decades.\nThe new media he employed in his art include telegrams, picture postcards, T-shirts, Xerox copies, typewriters, films, music, posters, graffiti, banners, actions, artist\u2019s books, street newsreels.\nCritics recognised his early \u201eAbsent Works\u201d published by Cologne-based DuMont Verlag (\"Aktuelle Kunst in Ost-Europa\", 1972) to be the very first conceptual works stemming from Eastern-Europe, works that were to be greatly enhanced in subsequent decades. Some other conceptual works of his were also published in Achille Bonito Oliva\u2019s \u201eEurope/America: The Different Avant-Garde\u201d (Milan, 1976).\n\u201eHe entered the stage of mail art almost in the very first hour\u201d, wrote J. M. Poison in his catalogue of 1971 entitled \u201eMail Art-Communication - A Distance-Concept\u201d. His fellow mail art correspondents included his later friend Ben Vautier, John Armleder, George Brecht, Daniel Spoerri, Cosey Fanny Tutti, Genesis P-Orridge, Dieter Roth, Marina Abramovich, Ken Friedmann and his dog. His mail art was exhibited at the Paris Bi-Annual of 1972 together with art by such other mail art pioneers as Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Richard Johnson, Ben Vautier, George Brecht. About his letters written with a zero code Pierre Restany, a friend of Yves Klein\u2019s, wrote this in 1978: \u201eIn the immaterial zone of a concentrated (ZEROED) sensitivity Endre T\u00f3t appears to be the Yves Klein of mail art, a monochrome of postage.\u201d\nHis first museum exhibition was staged by the Israel Museum in 1975. Since Hungary had severed its diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967, T\u00f3t was forced to smuggle his works out of Hungary in an adventurous way. His conceptual works (e.g. his Rainproof-ideas) executed between 1970 and 1974 were exhibited there simultaneously with Alberto Giacometti\u2019s statues. Art magazines in Germany, Italy, and France took note of the exhibition with the Jerusalem Post commenting: \"This is not to say that Endre Tot is the same race with Giacometti, but he is a totally new and rewarding experience.\"\nIn 1974, the Swiss Howeg Verlag published his sheet of stamps called Zero-Post among the very first artist\u2019s stamps of international mail art.\nAt the invitation of John Armleder, his later friend who became world-famous for his Neo Geo movement, he spent half a year with the Ecart Gallery of Geneva, an institution also functioning as a mail art centre. It was during his stay in Geneva that he accomplished his first street action (TOTalJoys 1976) which was filmed and later issued on DVD by the Paris Bureau des Videos in 2005.\nHis artist\u2019s books made in Budapest in the 70s earned him quite a lot of international praise. He had first published them on a samizdat basis but they were later republished by Western-European Avant-Garde publishers. 1971: \u201eMy Unpainted Canvasses\u201d,  \u201eThe States of Zeros\u201d, \u201eSemmi sem semmi / Nothing ain't Nothing\u201d, 1972: \u201eNothing\u201d, \u201eIncomplete Informations\u201d, 1974: \u201eZero-Texts (1971-72)\u201d, \u201eNight Visit to the National Gallery\u201d (Beau Geste Press, UK), \u201eZero-Post\u201d, \u201eRainproof Ideas (1971-74)\u201d, 1979: \u201dT\u00d3TalJOYS\u201d, 1981: \u201dVery Special Drawings\u201d, 1990: \u201eEvergreen Book\u201d. In 1998, the Paris Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale bought several of his artist\u2019s books. The library of the Paris Pompidou Centre acquired his Correspondence avec John Armleder (Ecart, Geneva, 1974) in 2010. His artist\u2019s books were exhibited in many European, American and Canadian museums including the Pompidou Centre\u2019s \u201eLivres d'Artistes\u201d exhibition of 1985.\nHe was still a resident of Budapest when, in 1977, he exhibited with Galerie Bama, one of the best-known Paris galleries. His show was reviewed in L 'Express by Otto Hahn. Due to his international actions and mail art activities he counted in the West as one of the most notable Eastern-European artists, an appraisal hardly acknowledged in his native country.\nHe was plucked from the isolation of his \u00d3buda apartment in the late 70s by an invitation coming from the Berlin Artist Program of DAAD. His applications for an exit permit had been refused by the authorities several times which created a political sensation in the Western press, a circumstance that eventually earned him a permit. After staying in Berlin for a year T\u00f3t opted for emigration. His \u00d3buda apartment was confiscated but his sibling had evacuated his works stored there in the nick of time. After being stored in various low-key places, they were eventually deposited with the Hungarian National Gallery in an orderly fashion.\nIt was in West-Berlin that T\u00f3t came to realise the ideas that he had taken with him in his suitcase and in his mind from Budapest. Shortly after arriving, he placed the following inscription upon the Berlin Wall: \u201eIch w\u00fcrde mich freuen, wenn ich etwas auf die andere Seite der Mauer schreiben d\u00fcrfte\u201d (I should be glad if I were allowed to write something on the other side of this wall). He demonstrated his joys (\"T\u00d3TalJOYs\") with posters in his hand or upon his back in the busiest spots of the metropolis. He even placed a flickering sentence speaking about his joy among the news items of a street newsreel atop a Kurf\u00fcrstendamm building. In 1978 DAAD filmed and published in book form his street action named TOTalJOYS. He twice exhibited his works with Galerie Ren\u00e9 Block, an institution previously hosting such notables as Joseph Beuys, Richard Hamilton, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell. The irony inherent in his actions and mail art definitely links him up with the fluxus movement in Germany. He was the sole Eastern-European protagonist of the itinerant exhibition organised by Ren\u00e9 Block entitled \u201eFluxus in Germany 1962-1992\u201d.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_80s_.E2.80.93_Blackout_in_Cologne\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_80s_\u2013_Blackout_in_Cologne\">The 80s \u2013 Blackout in Cologne</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The 80s \u2013 Blackout in Cologne\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After a stay of one and a half years in Berlin he moved to Cologne with his German wife Herta. The first years of his Cologne period were much less productive than his stay in Berlin. He hardly ever worked until the mid-80s. Invited by Artist Place, he flew to New York City in 1982 with a piece of chalk in his pocket that he used for placing graffiti on the walls of the gallery. It was here that he met up with a great number of notable artists including Alan Kaprow and his friend of old, John Armleder.\nWith the \u201eblackout years\u201d gone, as he himself called them, he started to work again feverishly from the late 80s on. He elaborated on the idea of \u201eabsent paintings\u201d, an idea dating back to his Budapest years (My Unpainted Canvasses, 1970, Night Visit to the National Gallery, A Visit to the Museum,  both in 1974). With his \u201eabsent paintings\u201d he accomplished a virtual return to painting but this was tantamount in his case to its final destruction. The spirit nurturing his Blackout and Catalogued paintings comes from an aesthetics of dearth[1] . Conceived in an aesthetics of disappearance, his \u201eabsent\u201d works attempt to visualise nothing and void itself. His large work entitled \u201eDada Messe in Berlin\u201d was exhibited at the show ICONOCLASH: Beyond the Image Wars in Science, Religion and Art (ZKM, Karlsruhe, 2002) presenting major iconoclastic works by D\u00fcrer, Rembrandt, Goya, Duchamp, Malevich, Picabia, Warhol, Beuys etc. At the Bremen exhibition \u201eWho Killed the Painting?\u201d (Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, 2010) his large triptych \u201eFluxus Triptichon\u201d (2002, 3 x 200 x 125&#160;cm) was on view alongside works by Beuys, Kaprow, Ben Vautier, G. Brecht, Al Hausen, Nam June Paik etc.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_90s_.E2.80.93_Retrospectives_and_Entering_the_Canon\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_90s_\u2013_Retrospectives_and_Entering_the_Canon\">The 90s \u2013 Retrospectives and Entering the Canon</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The 90s \u2013 Retrospectives and Entering the Canon\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the political change of 1989-1990 in Hungary T\u00f3t returned to his native country with his works created abroad. He filled all 12 exhibiting halls of the Palace of the Arts with them under the evocative title of \u201eNothing is Nothing\u201d. Four years later he exhibited with the Cologne Ludwig Museum (Who is afraid of Nothing?), and this selection of his works was re-exhibited with the Budapest branch of the Ludwig Museum in 1999. T\u00f3t is the first Hungarian artist to have been asked to put on an individual show at the Kassel Documenta. Curators there insisted on using the Hungarian title of his Budapest show (Semmi sem semmi) probably because they liked its exotic sound. His action on the city\u2019s main square involving him distributing flyers with a black mask hiding his face was cut short by the police even though the flyers contained no information at all. Along with his works accomplished in his studio, his street actions have also helped him achieve international fame. \n\u201eI am glad that I have stood here\u201d \u2013 this was inscribed in Hungarian on his bronze plaque placed in the pavement in 1998 in front of <a href=\"/wiki/Artpool_Art_Research_Center\" title=\"Artpool Art Research Center\">Artpool's</a> art space in Budapest (60, Paulay Ede St.). Six years later a similarly inscribed plaque (\u201eIch freue mich, dass ich hier gestanden habe\u201d) was placed in the floor of the roof terrace of the Cologne Ludwig Museum. \nHis Flyer, Zero, Joy etc. street actions as satellite events to international exhibitions have embarrassed or enraged passers-by in many cities over the decades, not infrequently causing even the police to intervene. International critics usually evaluate those anti-demonstrations by T\u00f3t to be responses to the mandatory political demonstrations that he had lived through as a young man in totalitarian Hungary.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_2000s\">The 2000s</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The 2000s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A photo documentation of T\u00f3t\u2019s earliest street action was exhibited at the international show \u201eProtest &amp; Survive\u201d put on by the famous London Whitechapel Gallery. Requested by the curators, he also re-staged his remarkable Geneva street action. The catalogue said this about his actions: \u201eT\u00f3t's response to the censorship, isolation and suppression inherent in a totalitarian state was to produce his series of joy\u201d. At the exhibition staged by the Vienna Kunstforum entitled \u201eSuperstars von Warhol bis Madonna\u201d (2005) his conceptual paperwork \u201edepicting\u201d or rather just marking Mona Lisa\u2019s (absent) smile was on view alongside Duchamps\u2019 famous moustached Mona Lisa. \nThe New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had acquired several works of his created during his Budapest isolation and exhibited them in 2006 at its show \u201eEye on Europe \u2013 1960 to Now\u201d. Along with Czech artist Milan Knizak, T\u00f3t was the only exhibiting artist coming from Eastern Europe. Two years later MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry presented an Honorary Artist Membership to him.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_2010s_.E2.80.93_T.C3.B3t_in_Collections\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_2010s_\u2013_T\u00f3t_in_Collections\">The 2010s \u2013 T\u00f3t in Collections</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: The 2010s \u2013 T\u00f3t in Collections\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2010 he exhibited with such wide-ranging institutions as Neues Museum N\u00fcrnberg, Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst Wesenburg - Bremen, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, The V. Koc Foundation Contemporary Art Collection Istanbul. The Pompidou Centre\u2019s catalogue published a copy of his 1975 letter to Pierre Restany ending with the words: \u201eSo I'm fucked with my zer0000000000000s\u201d. Simultaneously, the Paris Hungarian Institute staged a show of the Iparterv Group of Artists (Le Progr\u00e9s de l'Illusion), where T\u00f3t\u2019s early (1966/67) informel paintings and paperworks were also on view.\nHis conceptual works were acquired from 1975 through 2010 by such major collections as those of MoMA New York, Getty Museum Los Angeles, Museum Ludwig K\u00f6ln, Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin, Israel Museum Jerusalem, Haags Gemeentemuseum The Hague, and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts as well as East-Central European museums like National Gallery Prague, Museum Stuki \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Museum of Modern Art Ljubjana, National Gallery of Art Varsaw, Museum of Modern Art Olm\u00fctz, Hungarian National Gallery, Ludwig Museum Budapest, or even two museums in Latin-America: the Center de Arte y Communication (CAYC) Buenos Aires, and the Museu de Arte Contemporaneu da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. \nProbably more than a hundred of his major works are preserved in such notable private collections as Sammlung Dr. Speck (Cologne), Sammlung Ren\u00e9 Block (Berlin), Das Archive Sohm (Stuttgart), The Sacker Archive of Concrete und Visual Poetry (Miami Beach, Florida).\nIn 2009 he published a memoir entitled \u201eI\u2019m glad that I can write one sentence after another\u201d with Noran Publishers, Budapest. A critic wrote this about the book: \u201eThis is half-way between a logbook and an autonomous work of art since the primacy of the text is questioned throughout by its unusual layout and illustrations\u2026 The account T\u00f3t gives of his youthful love-affair is deeply moving, the way he recalls the relationship of the regime towards its artists in the 60s and 70s, convincing, and the list of his fleeting affairs with girls is very funny.\u201d\nDue to the extreme multiplicity of T\u00f3t\u2019s oeuvre, it is next to impossible to understand his art without a thorough-going theoretical back-up.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Awards_and_Recognitions\">Awards and Recognitions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Awards and Recognitions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Drawing Triennale, Wroclaw, 1974, 1977, 1992 \nLisbon International Show, Lisbon, 1979 \nDAAD-grant, Berlin, 1978/79 \nStudio grant, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, 1980 \nArbeitsstipendium, Kunstfonds e. v., Bonn, 1990 \nHonorary Artist Membership, Whitchapel Art Gallery, London, 2005 \nMunk\u00e1csy Mih\u00e1ly Award, Budapest, 2006 \nSpecial Award, 48th Autumn Salon, Belgrade, 2006 \nHonorary Artist Membership, Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2008 \nKossuth Award, Budapest, 2009\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scholarships\">Scholarships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Scholarships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>1977 <a href=\"/wiki/German_Academic_Exchange_Service\" title=\"German Academic Exchange Service\">DAAD</a> scholarship in West Berlin</li>\n<li>1980 Workshop Scholarship, <a href=\"/wiki/Stedelijk_Museum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stedelijk Museum\">Stedelijk Museum</a>, Amsterdam</li>\n<li>1990 One-year scholarship in the Arts Fund Bonn e.V.</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Solo_exhibitions_.28selection.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Solo_exhibitions_(selection)\">Solo exhibitions (selection)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Endre_Tot&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Solo exhibitions (selection)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>1966 Epit\u00f6k M\u00fcszaki Klubja.
