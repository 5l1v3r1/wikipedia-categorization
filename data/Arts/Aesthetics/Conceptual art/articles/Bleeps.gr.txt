 Bleeps.gr (or Bleeps) is the pseudonym used by M.V. Kakouris, who is a Greek artist. Bleeps creates political street art, paintings and installations;  he is involved with the artivism movement.  Most of his works can be seen in Athens, but a number of others can be found in cities and rural areas around Greece and Europe.  Bleeps started creating street art while he was in Bristol, UK, between 2003 and 2005, where he became familiar with the local underground scene.  Most of Bleeps' street art projects derive elements from conceptual art, folk art and various past art movements, while the protagonists depicted are associated with Bleeps' interpretation of social life.  His stated goal is to examine systemic figures such as religion, politics, monetary system and consumerism.   Since the beginning of the Greek financial crisis in 2008, Bleeps has been creating a series of works related to the crisis' impact on ordinary people  and the lower middle class, globally and in his country.
