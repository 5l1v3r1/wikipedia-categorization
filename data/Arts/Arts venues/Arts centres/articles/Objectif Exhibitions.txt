Objectif Exhibitions (vzw) is a not-for-profit contemporary art center in Antwerp, Belgium. Objectif Exhibitions receives structural support from the Flemish Community, with which it supports international contemporary artists by producing exhibitions, events, and publications of and related to their work, and by providing production budgets and stipends directly to those artists. The art center reaches its local and international publics in person, through printed matter, and on the Internet. The current programme consists of simultaneous and overlapping solo exhibitions, which are presented at differing physical and temporal scales, and with correspondingly different mediation, as well as events, off-site projects, and publications.  The director is given autonomy over the programme by the board of directors, and a new director is hired every four years.  Objectif Exhibitions (originally typeset as "objectif_exhibitions")  was founded in 1999 by Philippe Pirotte, Win Van den Abbeele, and Patrick Van Rossem. Pirotte served as its first director from 1999 to 2004. When Pirotte became director of Kunsthalle Bern, Van den Abbeele became the second director of Objectif Exhibitions. In 2007, Mai Abu ElDahab became the new director, and shifted the programmatic focus to one-person exhibitions, as well as publications and events. Chris Fitzpatrick is the current director, and was hired in 2012.  Objectif Exhibitions is currently located at Kleine Markt 7-9, and was moved to its current space in 2007 by ElDahab. Willem Elsschot once lived in the residence above, and the ground floor and basement facilities inspired Elsschot's classic novel "Kaas (Cheese)." Objectif Exhibitions was formerly located at Coquilhatstraat 14.
