louisvillepalace.com 78001361 The Louisville Palace (also known as the Palace Theatre) is a music venue in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, located in the city's theater district, on the east side of Fourth Street, between Broadway and Chestnut Street. It has a seating capacity of 2,700 people and is owned by Live Nation.  The historic landmark opened on September 1, 1928, and was designed by architect John Eberson.  It was originally known as the Loew's and United Artists State theatre. The Palace exhibits a Spanish Baroque motif with arcades, balconies and turrets. Cobalt blue, bursts of red and gold indirectly light all of the niches, coves and entrances. Above is a curved, vaulted ceiling with 139 sculptures of the faces of historical figures. The theater room inside The Palace is heavily ornamented and displays an imitation nighttime sky on the ceiling. The theater is two stories with a floor and a balcony.  Both floors contain bars that run the width of the building behind the theater, separated by a grand lobby of intricate art and architecture. Although the exterior had fallen behind the interior, the Palace was re-dedicated in 1994 and is now a premiere venue.  Its uncommon appearance has made it a popular venue for musicians to record live performances (including Third Day & Alison Krauss).  On June 2, 1983, A Flock Of Seagulls performed at the Palace and the show was recorded for broadcast by NBC's The Source. The theatre features an array of popular movies, old and new, as well as concerts by popular artists.
