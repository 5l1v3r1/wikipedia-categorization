Built in 1921, the building served for sixty years as a movie house.  The movie house closed in 1986, and was almost scheduled for demolition until a local entrepreneur bought it at auction and  turned it over to two arts advocates who created a non-profit arts organization, called the Kentucky Theater Project, Inc.  The newly renovated Kentucky Theater opened its doors in 2000 and is now a vibrant community arts center and art film house. In 2008, the Kentucky Theater was renovated into the Kentucky Theater Shops. It now includes a gourmet food shop, a wine and spirits shop, a bagel shop and a florist shop.
