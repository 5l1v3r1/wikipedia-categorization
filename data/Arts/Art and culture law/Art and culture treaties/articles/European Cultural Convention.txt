The European Cultural Convention is an international treaty for EU and EU accession states to strengthen, deepen and further develop a European Culture, by using local culture as a starting point, setting common goals and a plan of action, to reach an integrated European society, celebrating universal values, rights and diversity.  The European Cultural Convention was opened for signature by the Council of Europe in Paris on 19 December 1954.  Its signature is one of the conditions for becoming a participating state in the Bologna Process and its European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The term "Convention" is used as a synonym for an international legal treaty. The convention has been ratified by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe; it has also been ratified by Belarus, the Holy See, and Kazakhstan.
