The Foundation E.G. Bührle Collection (Stiftung Sammlung E. G. Bührle) was established by the Bührle family in Zürich, Switzerland to bring to public viewing Emil Georg Bührle's important collection of European sculptures and paintings. The Foundation's art museum is in a Zurich villa adjoining Bührle's former home. Although the collection includes a number of Old Masters and Modern art including works by Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso,  it comprises mainly French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism paintings by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Georges Seurat, Alfred Sisley, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh and others.

Cézanne's "The Boy in the Red Vest" was recovered in Serbia on April 12, 2012. Count Lepic and His Daughters was recovered in April 2012 with slight damages.  Three men were arrested in connection with the theft.  In a 2015 publication entitled The Bührle Black Book,  Thomas Buomberger and Guido Magnaguagno called for an investigation into Nazi era provenance gaps in a number of paintings in the Bührle collection.   The Foundation had been working with provenance researcher Laurie A Stein since 2002 to update the ownership history of the collection and to publish it online.
