 This is a list of damaged or destroyed works of guerrilla art created by Banksy, which have been removed from their original locations or otherwise damaged or destroyed. Banksy is an England-based graffiti artist. Most of the works that make up the Better Out Than In series, started in October 2013 in New York City, have been defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled.   As a result of the continued defacement, fans have been rushing to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced.  A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs.  The continued defacement has prompted some to take matters into their own hands by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced.  Property owners have also gone to some measures to protect the art, including hiring 24-hour guards and installing roll down gates that cover the art.
