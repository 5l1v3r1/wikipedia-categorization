Art competitions were held as part of the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Medals were awarded in five categories (architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture), for works inspired by sport-related themes. The art exhibition was held at the Stedelijk Museum from 12 June to 12 August, and displayed 1150 works of art from 18 different countries.  Additionally, the literature competition attracted 40 entries from 10 countries, and the music competition had 22 entries from 9 countries.  The art competitions at the 1928 Games was larger in scope than for previous Games.  Instead of a single competition in each of the five artistic categories, awards were presented in multiple subcategories.   The judges of the music competition declined to award any medals in two of the three subcategories, and only presented a single bronze medal in the third. Art competitions were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948.  At a meeting of the International Olympic Committee in 1949, it was decided to hold art exhibitions instead, as it was judged illogical to permit professionals to compete in the art competitions but only amateurs were permitted to compete in sporting events.   Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games. At the time, medals were awarded to these artists, but art competitions are no longer regarded as official Olympic events by the International Olympic Committee.  These events do not appear in the IOC medal database,  and these totals are not included in the IOC's medal table for the 1928 Games.
