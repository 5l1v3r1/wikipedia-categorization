This template is meant to be used on categories in the Manhwa Aeni by year and decade category structure, where the top-level categories are Category:Aeni debuts by date and Category:Manhwa debuts by date. This template accepts several unnamed parameters. The first should be set to either "Aeni" or "Manhwa", depending on what the category in question covers. The second one is the first three digits in the year (for instance, if the category covers 1997, the second parameter's value would be "199").
