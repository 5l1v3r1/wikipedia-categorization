 Iain M Hambling is the historian and archivist of English pottery company T G Green & Co Ltd (1864 – 2007) which was based at Church Gresley, Derbyshire. Starting as a collector of Cornishware in 1991, his collection grew and was largely featured in Paul Atterbury's first Cornish Ware & Domestic Pottery book.  First discussing Cornishware on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow (series 19, 1996–7), he went on to make another two appearances with other T G Green patterns and later a half-hour programme on Channel 4, Collectors' Lot. There was an active Collectors Club between 1996 and 2001, for which Hambling wrote and advised in 'Iain's Corner'. The club folded upon the acquisition of T G Green by neighbouring company Mason Cash. Increasingly aware of the many other unrecorded patterns dating from 1864, Hambling started to build collections of the patterns and created a virtual online museum. A second book, concentrating on the many other domestic wares produced, followed in 2001.  Hambling continued to piece together collections of patterns, concentrating initially on the Art Deco sets of the 1930s and later the Victorian sets from the company's inception as well as purchasing a lot of the original paperwork, tools and moulds which had been slowly lifted from the now-derelict factory site at Church Gresley by treasure hunters and opportunists. Through the means of Facebook, Hambling set up a dedicated page to the pottery's history and founded a Collectors Group with over 1000 members. Since 2016 there has been a privately run museum within the Swadlincote area displaying a majority of the patterns produced from the family owned period of 1864 to 1974 and the items from the original 'Cornish Ware Museum' run by the late Derek Green from his business in Hartley Wintney, returning the permanent display back to its original area of manufacture which will extend publicly in 2018.
