Hallie Lieberman is a writer  and a sex and gender historian.  Her first book, Buzz: The Stimulating History of the Sex Toy (2017)  traces the history of sex toys in the USA from the 1950s  to the present.  Lieberman teaches gender studies at Georgia Institute of Technology.  While studying for her Masters in Advertising from the University of Texas, Austin,  Lieberman threw home "Passion Parties" in 2003-2005 wherein she sold sex toys that were, at the time, illegal in Texas.  Curious about the history of such legislation, Lieberman enrolled in the University of Wisconsin-Madisonâ€™s Mass Communications Doctoral Program, and studied the history of sex toys for her PhD dissertation (2014).
