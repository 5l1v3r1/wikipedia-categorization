  The Chair of Ecclesiastical History of the University of Glasgow is the oldest chair of ecclesiastical history in the United Kingdom.  It was founded in 1716 by King George I of Great Britain.  The Crown granted 100Â pounds per year for this purpose. This was, thus, a Regius Chair until 1935, when constitutional arrangements in the Church of Scotland resulted in patronage being transferred to the University Court acting on a Board of Nomination consisting of representatives of the University Court and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
