The Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford is a long-established professorial position.  Holders of the title have often been medieval historians. The first appointment was made in 1724. The term "Regius" reflects the origins of the post as a royal appointment, itself a recognition of the important influence of history. The Regius Professor of History is ex officio a Fellow of Oriel College. Professor Lyndal Roper has held the Regius Professorship since 2011,  the first woman (and the first Australian) to have done so.  Modern History was a term of art, contrasting with ancient history.
