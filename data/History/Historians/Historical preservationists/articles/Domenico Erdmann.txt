Domenico Juul Erdmann (23 March 1879 – October 5, 1940) was a Norwegian painter, designer, decorator and conservation adviser.   He was a technical consultant and executive conservator in a number of Norwegian churches.      Erdmann was born in Bergen, Norway. He started his career as a conservator in Viborg Cathedral in Denmark where he trained under Oscar Matthiesen (1861- 1957) in Copenhagen during 1896. Erdmann followed Matthiesen to Berlin and Munich and also visited France and Italy. This was where he learned fresco techniques, decorative painting, and church restoration. After he returned to Norway in 1903, he worked together with Eilif Peterssen on decorating Ullern Church in Oslo. Erdmann studied church restoration in Denmark in 1912, and was made a conservation adviser in 1919. He also worked as a decorator and designer with Arnstein Arneberg. He performed design work for O. Mustad & Søn in Kristiania (now Oslo) from 1916 to 1921.  From 1912,  he received an assignment from the Fortidsminneforeningen for the investigation and restoration of historic Norwegian church interiors.         Erdmann's book Norsk dekorativ maling fra reformasjonen til romantikken (Norwegian Decorative Painting from the Reformation to the Romantic Period) describes his experiences with restoration in many Norwegian churches, including Stavern Church, Røldal Stave Church, Skjeberg Church, Fluberg Church, and Drøbak Church, as well as the Manor in Larvik (Herregården i Larvik)  and the Norwegian Military Academy.
