  Walter Bryce Gallie (5 October 1912 – 31 August 1998) was a Scottish social theorist, political theorist, and philosopher.   Gallie was born in Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, near Glasgow, the son of an engineer. He grew up in a British boarding school and later published his memoirs of this in the book An English School. He served in the British Army from 1940 to 1945, leaving the service with the rank of Major. He was awarded the Croix de guerre. [The time he spent in the army] evidently made an [sic] great impression upon him. Though a very out-going man, he never spoke of his wartime experiences though he repeatedly returned to the philosophical aspects of war in conversation.(Sharpe, R.A., 5 September 1998) Gallie married Menna Patricia Humphreys in 1940. They had a son and a daughter. He died in Cardigan, Ceredigion, on 31 August 1998: Walter Bryce Gallie, M.A., Emeritus Fellow of Peterhouse and Emeritus Professor of Political Science, died on Monday, 31 August 1998, aged 85 years. (Cambridge University Reporter, 7 October 1998.) His paper on 'Essentially contested concepts' (Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, vol. 56, 1956, pp. 167–198) is a seminal statement in the philosophy of the social sciences.  In it, Gallie argued that it is impossible to conclusively define key appraisive concepts such as 'social justice,' 'democracy,' 'Christian life', 'art', 'moral goodness' and 'duty', although it is possible and rational to discuss one's justifications for holding one interpretation over competing ones.  Clarification of such concepts involves not the examination of predictive relations (as is the case for most scientific concepts), but rather, consideration of how the concept has been used by different parties throughout its history.
