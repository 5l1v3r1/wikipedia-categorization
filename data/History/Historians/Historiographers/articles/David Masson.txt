In 1847 he went to London, where he found wider scope for his energy and knowledge.  He was secretary (1851–1852) of the "Society of the Friends of Italy." In a famous interview with Elizabeth Barrett Browning at Florence he contested her admiration for Napoleon III.

In 1865 he was selected for the chair of rhetoric and English literature at Edinburgh, and during the early years of his professorship actively promoted the movement for the university education of women. In 1879 he became editor of the Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, and in 1886 gave the Rhind Lectures on that subject. . In 1893 he was appointed Historiographer Royal for Scotland.
