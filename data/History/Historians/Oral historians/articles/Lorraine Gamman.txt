Lorraine Patricia Gamman (July 1957) is professor of design at the Design Against Crime Research Centre at Central Saint Martins in the University of the Arts, London.  Her taking of the oral history of professional shoplifter Shirley Pitts as part of her PhD  kindled her interest in oral history as a form and lead to her book Gone shopping: The story of Shirley Pitts, Queen of thieves.  In 2012, the production company Tiger Aspect bought an option to acquire the television and film rights to the book. In 1999 Gamman founded the Design Against Crime Research Centre which has led a socially responsive design focus at Central Saint Martins and has won numerous awards. She has worked in it with Marcus Willcocks , and since 2002, in partnership with the designer and researcher, Professor Adam Thorpe, with whom she co founded the Socially Responsive Design Hub at  CSM involving students and staff in research projects that address crime and other social problems through design. Also since 2012, linked to involvement with the DESIS network (founded by Ezio Manzini) Gamman and Thorpe  have engaged with participatory design projects, including those working with inmates in prison. All this work  has attracted significant funding from external research funding councils:  action design research projects Gamman has either led or co collaborated with Adam Thorpe and Marcus Willcocks such as Makeright , Bikeoff , Grippa  and In The Bag . Forthcoming publication Gamman has written many journal articles (too numerous to list here) but some of the chapters in books she has written include:
