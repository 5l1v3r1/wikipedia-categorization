Jean Maria Arrigo is an American social psychologist and oral historian. Arrigo was a member of a 2005 American Psychological Association (APA) task force evaluating the role of psychologists in U.S. intelligence and military interrogations of detainees.   She became known for exposing conflicts of interest of most of the others on the nominally independent task force, who were allied in advance with advocates of harsh interrogation methods.   For her whistleblowing actions, the APA honored Arrigo in 2015  and the American Association for the Advancement of Science presented their 2015 AAAS Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility to her.
