Aio (supposedly died 974) was a fabricated English monk of Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire and historian. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography strongly suggests he never existed.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Keary, Charles Francis (1885). "Aio".
