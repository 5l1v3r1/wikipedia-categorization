href=\"/wiki/Monitor_(comics)\" title=\"Monitor (comics)\">Monitor</a>, a cosmic being locked in an eternal war against his anti-matter counterpart the <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-Monitor\" title=\"Anti-Monitor\">Anti-Monitor</a>. Raising Lyla as his assistant, the two monitored the multiverse's heroes and arranged for weapons and super-powered henchmen for various villains, to test heroes that the Monitor would recruit for his impending final battle against the Anti-Monitor. The Earth that Lyla was rescued from was Earth Prime (Marv Wolfman said when asked on Facebook about what Earth was she rescued from).\n</p><p>When <a href=\"/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths\" title=\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> began, Lyla assumed the identity of \"Harbinger\" after entering a womb-like chamber which energized her and allowed her to create a series of doppelgangers in her new costume. These doppelgangers recruited a wide variety of heroes and villains to fight the Anti-Monitor's shadow demons and protect a series of vibration towers, designed to protect Earth 1 and Earth 2 from the wave of Anti-Matter destroying the DC Multiverse.\n</p><p>However, while recruiting the hero <a href=\"/wiki/Arion_(comics)\" title=\"Arion (comics)\">Arion</a>, a shadow demon merged with one of Harbinger's duplicates, allowing the Anti-Monitor to control her once her various doubles merged into a single entity. Under the Anti-Monitor's control, Lyla killed the Monitor. Monitor foresaw the Anti-Monitor's gambit and arranged to have his life force be the fuel to power up the vibration towers, saving Earths 1 and 2 from doom. The shock of what she did caused Lyla to revert to a version of her normal form, which then sacrificed all of her powers to save the last three alternate universe (home of the Freedom Fighters, the Charlton heroes, and the Captain Marvel family) from annihilation.\n</p><p>When the five remaining universes merged, Harbinger suddenly regained her power in the process of time and space merging to create a new single universe DC Universe. Afterwords, Harbinger recorded <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_the_DC_Universe\" title=\"History of the DC Universe\">the history of the Post-Crisis DC Universe</a> into a computer satellite. This led to the <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_(comics)\" title=\"Millennium (comics)\">Millennium</a> crossover, which had the satellite fall into the hands of the Manhunters, who used the data to confirm the identities of much of the Earth super-hero population as part of a greater plan to infiltrate the super-hero community. After the mini-series, Harbinger joined the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Guardians\" title=\"New Guardians\">New Guardians</a> and was infected with the AIDS virus along with half the team. She reunited with fellow Monitor allies Pariah and Lady Quark during War of the Gods, after which she was offered membership with the Amazon tribe of <a href=\"/wiki/Themyscira_(DC_Comics)\" title=\"Themyscira (DC Comics)\">Themyscira</a> as the <a href=\"/wiki/Amazons_(DC_Comics)\" title=\"Amazons (DC Comics)\">Amazons</a>' official historian.\n</p><p>When Kara Zor-El, aka the original <a href=\"/wiki/Supergirl\" title=\"Supergirl\">Supergirl</a>, was discovered to exist in the Post-Crisis DC Universe and arrived on Earth, she was given shelter and lodgings on the island of Themyscira. Harbinger befriended Supergirl and remembering how she sacrificed her life during the original Crisis, Harbinger willingly died protecting Kara in a failed bid to prevent Darkseid from kidnapping her.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Donna_Troy.2FDark_Angel_Connection\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Donna_Troy/Dark_Angel_Connection\">Donna Troy/Dark Angel Connection</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harbinger_(DC_Comics)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Donna Troy/Dark Angel Connection\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the events of the \"Return of Donna Troy\" mini-series, it was revealed that <a href=\"/wiki/Donna_Troy\" title=\"Donna Troy\">Donna Troy</a>'s arch enemy (and temporal doppelganger) Dark Angel served a similar role to Harbinger during the original Crisis before severing ties with the Anti-Monitor. Furthermore, the Titans of Myth revealed that Donna was a temporal anomaly thanks to the Crisis changing her and Wonder Woman's histories. The Titans, seeing potential in exploiting Donna's unconscious knowledge of the Pre-Crisis universe, rescued her as a child in order to manipulate her into becoming their own version of Harbinger.\n</p><p>Following the events of the Infinite Crisis, Donna recorded a new version of the \"History of the DC Universe\" reflecting the changes in the timeline following Infinite Crisis. Meanwhile, a new incarnation of Harbinger, a genetically altered being called <a href=\"/wiki/Forerunner_(DC_Comics)\" title=\"Forerunner (DC Comics)\">The Forerunner</a> was introduced that was tasked with killing anyone who crossed over between universes for the Monitors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Harbinger was reanimated as a <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Lantern_Corps\" title=\"Black Lantern Corps\">Black Lantern</a> during the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Blackest_Night\" title=\"Blackest Night\">Blackest Night</a></i> crossover.
