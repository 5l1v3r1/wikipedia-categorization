 Alan Balatine (fl. 1530s? – 1560) is a supposed historian mentioned by Edward Hall in the list of the English writers from whose works he compiled his Chronicle. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography makes it clear that this person is very likely a misnomer for John Bellenden, and never actually existed.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: "Balatine, Alan". Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885–1900.
