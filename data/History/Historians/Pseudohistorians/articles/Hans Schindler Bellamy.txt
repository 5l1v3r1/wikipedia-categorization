Hans Schindler Bellamy (1901 – 12 December 1982, poss. Vienna) was a researcher and author. His books investigate the work of Austrian cosmologist, Hanns Hörbiger and German selenographer, Philipp Fauth, whose now-defunct Cosmic Ice (Glacial Kosmogonie) Theory:  Bellamy's first book, Moons, Myths and Man, describes Hoerbiger's theory in detail, and its application to world myths, and his subsequent books develop the theory in light of the Bible, the Atlantis myth, and the Tiahuanaco ruins. H.S. Bellamy may be a pseudonym of Hans Schindler.
