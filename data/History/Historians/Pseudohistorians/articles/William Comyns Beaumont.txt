William Comyns Beaumont, also known as Comyns Beaumont, (1873–1956)  was a British journalist, author, and lecturer. Beaumont was a staff writer for the Daily Mail  and eventually became editor of the Bystander in 1903   and then The Graphic in 1932.  Beaumont's astronomical speculations were later mirrored by Immanuel Velikovsky's works. In Facts and Fallacies (1988) published by Reader's Digest, Beaumont's views are summarized: "In a series of books published between 1946 and 1949, British journalist William Comyns Beaumont astonished the world with the following extraordinary revelations: Jesus of Nazareth had been crucified just outside Edinburgh, Scotland — the site of the ancient city of Jerusalem. Satan was a comet that collided with the earth and caused Noah's Flood. The ancient Egyptians were in fact Irishmen. Hell is to be found in western Scotland. The Greek hero Achilles spent his childhood on the Isle of Skye. Galilee, birthplace of Jesus, was Wales. Ancient Athens was in reality Bath, England... Comyns Beaumont started his radical revision of history with the belief, innocuous enough, that the lost island of Atlantis might be Britain." Beaumont was also a proponent of the Shakespeare authorship question, arguing Shakespeare's plays were written by Francis Bacon.  He accepted the existence of giants based on British folklore, and argued other mythological creatures were actually real.  New Editions of The Riddle of the Earth; The Mysterious Comet; The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain, Britain: The Key to World History and now also "The Great Deception" have been published with the permission of The Estate of Comyns Beaumont.
