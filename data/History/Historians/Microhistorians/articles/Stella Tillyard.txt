She lives in Italy and England, was married to the historian John Brewer,  and has two children.   Her novel Tides of War, set in the Regency period, appeared in May 2011.  The author discussed in a magazine article the challenges of veracity faced by a writer of history and likewise of a historical novel: "No writer (including the professional historian) can ever really get beyond the envelope of self.... Are historians providing the master narratives of our times and historical novelists merely tinkering around the edges?"  The bibliographical information is taken from the online biography.  Aristocrats was described as "compulsively readable"  by The New York Times Book Review and "singular and remarkable" by The Washington Post  A Royal Affair was described by The New York Times as "scrupulously researched," but "looking at history sentimentally."  The Daily Telegraph (London) called Tides of War "a remarkably instructive novel" by "a fluent and attractive chronicler of historical detail," but added that "the responsibility of entwining fact and fiction has had a slightly dampening effect on Tillyard's novel."
