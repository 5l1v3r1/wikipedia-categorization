  Linda Bryder  (born 1959) is a New Zealand medical history academic. As of 2018 she is a full professor at the University of Auckland.   After a 1985 DPhil thesis from the University of Oxford titled  'The problem of tuberculosis in England and Wales, 1900-1950,'  Bryder moved to the University of Auckland, where she continued her research into the social history of medicine.   Bryder's highest profile work has been in relation to the Cartwright Inquiry into the 'unfortunate experiment.' The 2013 book "A History of the 'unfortunate Experiment' at National Women's Hospital" did not support one of the inquiry's central findings (that there had been a prospective study) and attracted a great deal of attention in academia,      popular press    and  wider public.    She has also written about the history of National Women's Hospital  and the Plunket Society.
