She is Emeritus Research Director at the CNRS and the Center Alexandre Koyré of the CNRS and the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS). She deals with scientific journals in the 17th and 18th centuries, also from a scientific sociological point of view and with the aspect of the history of the specialization of mathematics journals, with perspective in the Renaissance in connection with geometry and optics, and the letter as a communication tool of mathematics in the 18th century. She was co-editor (with Pierre Costabel (fr)) of the correspondence of Johann Bernoulli (Birkhäuser 1988, 1992) and published a French translation of the geometry of Albrecht Dürer. With Amy Dahan-Dalmédico (fr), she wrote a popular French-language textbook of mathematics, translated into English and German. From 1995 to 2015 she was co-editor of the Revue d'histoire des mathématiques (fr) and co-editor of Historia Mathematica.
