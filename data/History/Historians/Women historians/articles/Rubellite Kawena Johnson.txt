She then became Professor Emeritus of Hawaiian Language and Literature and continued to publish. She researched the history of the Kumulipo, a sacred chant of Hawaiian mythology, and early newspapers in the Hawaiian language.  Johnson was named one of the Living Treasures of Hawai'i in 1983 by the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i.  She was selected as an advisory committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. She generally opposes the Akaka Bill.  She submitted testimony as an expert witness on March 1, 2005 at the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.
