second of five children of <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_E._McKay\" title=\"Thomas E.

Born in <a href=\"/wiki/Ogden,_Utah\" title=\"Ogden, Utah\">Ogden, Utah</a>, she grew up in <a href=\"/wiki/Huntsville,_Utah\" title=\"Huntsville, Utah\">Huntsville</a>, about ten miles (16&#160;km) east.  Both her parents descended from families influential in early Mormonism.  Her maternal grandfather, <a href=\"/wiki/George_H._Brimhall\" title=\"George H. Brimhall\">George H. Brimhall</a>, was president of <a href=\"/wiki/Brigham_Young_University\" title=\"Brigham Young University\">Brigham Young University</a>.

At three she memorized and recited lengthy poems. When a <a href=\"/wiki/Whooping_cough\" title=\"Whooping cough\">whooping cough</a> epidemic convinced Brodie's mother to <a href=\"/wiki/Homeschooling\" title=\"Homeschooling\">homeschool</a> Fawn's sister Flora, who was two years older, Fawn more than kept pace. Introduced to school in 1921, the six-year-old Fawn was advanced to the fourth grade; when she lost the school spelling bee to a twelve-year-old, \"she cried and cried that this bright boy, twice her age, had spelled her down.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> At ten she had a poem printed in the LDS youth periodical, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Juvenile_Instructor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Juvenile Instructor\">The Juvenile Instructor</a></i>; at fourteen she was <a href=\"/wiki/Salutatorian\" title=\"Salutatorian\">salutatorian</a> of Weber High School.\n</p><p>Although Fawn grew to maturity in a rigorously religious environment that included strict <a href=\"/wiki/Sunday_Sabbatarianism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sunday Sabbatarianism\">Sabbatarianism</a> and evening prayers on her knees,<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> her mother was a closet skeptic who thought the LDS Church a \"wonderful social order\" but who doubted its dogma.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> According to Brodie, in the late 1930s, while her father headed <a href=\"/wiki/Mormon_missionary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mormon missionary\">Mormon mission</a> activities in German-speaking Europe, her mother became a \"thoroughgoing heretic\" while accompanying him there.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education_and_marriage\">Education and marriage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fawn_M._Brodie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Education and marriage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>From 1930 to 1932 Fawn attended <a href=\"/wiki/Weber_State_University\" title=\"Weber State University\">Weber College</a>, a two-year institution in Ogden then owned by the LDS Church, where she became an accomplished public speaker and participated in intercollegiate debate. She completed her <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts\" title=\"Bachelor of Arts\">B.A.</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/English_literature\" title=\"English literature\">English literature</a> at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Utah\" title=\"University of Utah\">University of Utah</a> in 1934.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> There she began to question core Mormon beliefs, such as that the Indians had originated in ancient Palestine. After graduation at age nineteen, she returned to teach English at Weber College, where she demonstrated excellent potential.\n</p><p>In high school, McKay had begun dating a classmate, Dilworth Jensen.  They wrote to each other faithfully during Jensen's long absence on an <a href=\"/wiki/Mormon_missionary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mormon missionary\">LDS mission</a> in Europe. In June 1935, both McKay and Jensen were accepted for graduate studies at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley\" title=\"University of California, Berkeley\">University of California, Berkeley</a>, and friends assumed they would marry.  Her sister Flora McKay had recently eloped with Jensen's brother, whom the McKays disliked. They encouraged Fawn to attend the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a> rather than marry. McKay seemed to have had \"growing doubts about marrying\" Jensen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At the University of Chicago, where she earned an <a href=\"/wiki/Master%27s_degree\" title=\"Master&#39;s degree\">M.A.</a> in 1936, Brodie lost her faith in religion entirely. In 1975, she recalled, \"It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could not go back to the old life, and I never did.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married <a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_Brodie_(military_strategist)\" title=\"Bernard Brodie (military strategist)\">Bernard Brodie</a> on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.\n</p><p>Brodie was a native of Chicago, the son of <a href=\"/wiki/Latvian_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Latvian people\">Latvian</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jewish\">Jewish</a> immigrants who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"No_Man_Knows_My_History\"><i>No Man Knows My History</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fawn_M._Brodie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: No Man Knows My History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/No_Man_Knows_My_History:_The_Life_of_Joseph_Smith\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith\">No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Composition\">Composition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fawn_M._Brodie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Composition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Having found temporary employment at the Harper Library of the University of Chicago, Brodie began researching the origins of the <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Mormon\" title=\"Book of Mormon\">Book of Mormon</a>.  By mid-1939, she confided to her uncle, Dean R. Brimhall (another ex-Mormon),<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> that she intended to write a scholarly biography of <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Smith\" title=\"Joseph Smith\">Joseph Smith</a>.  Progress toward that goal was slowed by the birth of the Brodies' first child and by three rapid moves, a consequence of her husband's search for a permanent position.  In 1943 Fawn Brodie was encouraged enough by her progress to enter her 300-page draft in a contest for the <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_A._Knopf\" title=\"Alfred A. Knopf\">Alfred A.

In May her application was judged the best of the 44 entries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Brodie continued her research at the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_of_Congress\" title=\"Library of Congress\">Library of Congress</a> in Washington, D.C., where the Brodies had moved for her husband's work, as well as at the headquarters of the <a href=\"/wiki/Reorganized_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\">Reorganized LDS Church</a> in Independence, Missouri. Eventually she returned to Utah, where she did research in the LDS Church Archives, gaining access to some highly restricted materials by claiming to be \"Brother McKay's daughter,\" a subterfuge that made her feel \"guilty as hell.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Her pursuit of little-known documents was not discreet enough, and eventually it attracted the attention of her uncle David O.

Brodie presents the young Joseph as a lazy, good-natured, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker. In an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, he developed the notion of <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_plates\" title=\"Golden plates\">golden plates</a> and then the concept of a religious novel, the <a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Mormon\" title=\"Book of Mormon\">Book of Mormon</a>.

(Bernard's employer, the <a href=\"/wiki/RAND\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"RAND\">RAND</a> Corporation, paid most of the bills.) Brodie's interest in psychology during this period was heightened by family problems: her mother attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Stevens biography took the better part of a decade to complete.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reviews_2\">Reviews</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fawn_M._Brodie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Reviews\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>When Brodie published the Stevens book in 1959, it enjoyed virtually unanimous praise from critics.

If he had been conducting a 28-year affair with a slave, then he could not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, <a href=\"/wiki/Dumas_Malone\" title=\"Dumas Malone\">Dumas Malone</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Merrill_Peterson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Merrill Peterson\">Merrill Peterson</a>, had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren who named his Carr nephews as fathers.
