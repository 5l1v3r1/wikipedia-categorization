 Marguerite Frick-Cramer (28 December 1887 – 22 October 1963), born Renée-Marguerite Cramer, was a Swiss historian. She became the first woman to join the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in November 1918.   Frick-Cramer studied law and humanities in Geneva and Paris and became a professor at the University of Geneva . She participated in the creation of the Prisoners of War International Agency (fr) before being co-opted as a member of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which at the time was made up exclusively of men.  Despite the hesitations some of its members felt in allowing a woman to join its ranks, the Committee understood that such change would be inevitable, in no small part because the Great War had deeply modified people's perception of gender equality . As a result of her experience with the Committee, Frick-Cramer became the first woman to be a member of the governing body of an international organization . Frick-Cramer remained active with the Red Cross through the 1930s, participating in Committee meetings in which the organization's attitude towards Nazi Germany was discussed.
