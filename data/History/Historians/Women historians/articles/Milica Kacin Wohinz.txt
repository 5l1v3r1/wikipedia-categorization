Milica Kacin Wohinz (née Brezigar, born 12 October 1930) is a Slovenian historian, renowned for her seminal study on the history of the forceful Italianization of the Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947) that took place between 1918 and 1943.  She was born in the Slovene Littoral that was after World War I annexed by the Kingdom of Italy and was at the age of twelve punished by the Italian Fascist regime for her father's resistance to Italianization by being expelled from school.  During World War II, she joined the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, helping Slovene partisans. After World War II and the annexation of the Slovenian Littoral to Yugoslavia in 1947, she attended the Slovene-language high schools in Postojna and Ljubljana.  In 1952, she enrolled to the University of Ljubljana, where she studied history. She obtained her PhD in 1970 under the supervision of Vasilij Melik. Since 1959, she worked at the Institute of Contemporary History in Ljubljana. Between 1979 and 1983, she was head of the Institute.  Because her research topic was the history of an ethnic minority and not the history of working class, her work was subjected to Marxist criticisms by Dušan Kermavner during Slovenia's socialist period.  Her works on Slovene and Croat anti-Fascist resistance against Italianization are considered pioneer. She was one of the first historians to engage in thorough research of the militant anti-Fascist organization TIGR. She was member of the joint Slovenian-Italian Cultural-Historical Commission, established by the governments of the Republic of Slovenia and Republic of Italy in order to jointly publish the account of historical relationship between the two peoples from 1880 to 1954 based on historiographic examination of sources.
