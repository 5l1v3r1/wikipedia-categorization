Prof. Dr. Ilaria L.E. Ramelli FRHistS, Dr.h.c., Dr.habil.bis (born 1973), is an Italian-born historian, scholarly author, and university professor, a specialist in ancient, late antique, and early mediaeval philosophy, especially the Platonic and Stoic traditions; ancient Christian philosophy, theology, and history (in Greek and Latin sources, partially also Syriac, Coptic and Armenian—with a predilection for Origen of Alexandria and the Origenian tradition down to the Cappadocian Fathers, Evagrius Ponticus,  Dionysius the Areopagite, Maximus the Confessor, and John Scotus Eriugena, and including Augustine of Hippo whom she incorporates within the Origenian tradition); Hellenistic Judaism and Jewish-Christian relations; ancient religions and their philosophical interpretations; classics; and imperial and late antiquity.  She is deeply interested in the relationship between Theology and Philosophy in ancient "pagan," Jewish, and Christian thought and endeavors to bridge the gap between these disciplines and promote an integrative (but also in-depth and specialistic) study of antiquity and late antiquity, against a tendency to compartmentalize research.  She is also very much interested in contemporary philosophy, theology, and social and ethical issues, as her scholarly and popular publications attest.  Ramelli has been since 2013 Full Professor of Theology and endowed Chair,  and (elected) Senior Research Fellow at Durham University, as well as at Oxford University, Christ Church (Fowler Hamilton Fellow), at Erfurt University's Max Weber Centre and at Humboldt University, Berlin (within a "Forschungspreis" from the Humboldt Foundation), and at CEU Institute for Advanced Study; and Fellow of the Royal Historical Society,  and of many other academic societies (e.g., EHS-Ecclesiastical History Society  , SNTS-Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas,  SBL-Society of Biblical Literature  , AAR-American Academy of Religion  , ISNS-International Society for Neoplatonic Studies  , SCS-Society for Classical Studies, formerly APA-American Philological Association, FIEC-Fédération Internationale des Études Classiques, Enoch Seminar, NAPS-North American Patristics Society, AIEP-IAPS-International Association of Patristic Studies, IAHR-International Association of the History of Religions  , Forum for Advanced Study Gaetano Massa, Sophia Institute – honorary, the Humboldt Network of Outstanding Researchers,  etc.). During the last two decades she served as Professor of Roman History (from 2002/3), Senior Research Fellow in Ancient and Patristic Philosophy (both at Durham University, for an earlier fellowship, and at Oxford University, Corpus Christi),  in Hellenic Studies at Princeton University,  in Religion (Erfurt, Max-Weber-Kolleg),  and in Ancient Philosophy (Catholic University, 2003–present), Senior Visiting Professor of Greek Thought (Harvard; BU),  of Church History, of Patristics, and director of international research projects. She has held many other senior visiting professorships and fellowships, and has given invited lectures, main and public lectures, seminars, and courses, besides directing graduate programs and research, at a number of Universities, including topmost ones, in North America, the UK, Europe, and Israel —notwithstanding severe physical disability and suffering for many years, as documented in some interviews.  She earned two MAs, a PhD (2000), a further Doctorate (honoris causa), a Postdoc, and some Habilitations to Full Professor (Ordinarius / W3). Ramelli has received a number of academic and scientific prizes and awards (from the Humboldt Foundation, the European Commission, the President of the Italian Republic, the Institute for Philosophical Studies, Universities, and scholarly foundations), for example, two Agostino Gemelli Prizes, the Marcello Gigante Classics International Award; a Marie Curie Award, the "Prix Auguste Pavie", and a Forschungspreis from the Humboldt Foundation (2017),  as well as nominations for the Goodwin Award of Merit (SCS), the G.Henkel Prize, the Holberg Prize, the AAR Award, and endowed chairs at major universities. She sits on numerous directive and advisory boards of academic series and journals, from Brill (for the series Ancient Philosophy and Religion ), SBL Press (for the series Writings from the Greco-Roman World ), Routledge – Taylor and Francis for the Journal of Early Christian History,  Akropolis: Journal of Hellenic Studies,  Eirene: Studia Graeca et Latina from the Czech Academy of Science,  and other publishers.  She is also actively promoting research and further editorial endeavors. She regularly serves as peer reviewer for distinguished scientific book series and journals (e.g., among the journals, American Journal of Philology, Philosophie Antique, International Journal of the Platonic Tradition,  Religion & Theology, Journal of Late Antiquity, The Classical Journal, Journal of Early Christian Studies, Modern Theology, Journal of the Bible and its Reception, Journal of Early Christian History, Studies in Late Antiquity: A Journal, Archiv für Religionsgeschichte, Philologus, Latomus, Exemplaria Classica, AUC Theologica, and many others; among the series, Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae, Byzantinisches Archiv — Series Philosophica, Gregory of Nyssa Colloquia, and other series, from Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Yale University Press, Brill, Wiley-Blackwell, Routledge, Wipf and Stock, Parmenides Publishing, Prometheus Trust Press etc.). In addition, she often serves as a referee in tenure and hiring evaluations for outstanding Universities. She also constantly functions as an expert in the evaluation of advanced research funding and excellence chairs for national and international scientific foundations in Europe, the UK, and North America.  She has directed many research projects, seminars, workshops, and publications. From 1996 onwards, Ramelli has published numerous books, articles, chapters, and reviews in the main peer-reviewed academic venues in her fields, mostly in English, but also in Italian, French, and German; moreover, some articles and books by her have been translated into English (when they were in Italian), French, German, Greek, etc. A number of her publications have substantially contributed to the advancement of scholarship, have received many positive reviews and citations, have suggested new avenues of research, have been discussed and referred to both in academic venues and in journals, newspapers, blogs, and interviews, and are often must-reads, e.g. about apocatastasis, restoration, and soteriology;  the Christian philosopher-theologian Bardaisan of Edessa and his relation to Origen and his tradition,  eschatology, eternity,  theories of time,  ancient allegoresis or allegorical interpretation especially of religious myths,  the ancient novels and their relation to early Christianity,  Origen,  Justin Martyr, Clement,  Eusebius,  the Dialogue of Adamantius,  Basil of Caesarea,  Gregory of Nyssa and his ideas on the resurrection-restoration of body and soul, infinite striving ("epektasis"), and Christology,  Evagrius,  Augustine,  Dionysius the Areopagite, Maximus the Confessor, John Scotus Eriugena,   Philo of Alexandria,  the New Testament and many issues of its textual criticism, also with the use of its ancient versions (esp.

Just three examples from the most recent monographs. Ramelli's monograph on apokatastasis (Brill 2013) is a dense, monumental study of historical theology in over 900 pages, showing that the doctrine of universal restoration was much more widespread than commonly assumed in first-millennium Christianity and was Christologically, Biblically, and philosophically grounded.   With a monograph on Bardaisan of Edessa (Gorgias 2009),  on the basis of a painstaking analysis of all sources, Ramelli has integrated an important Syriac thinker from the second/third-century CE into imperial philosophy (both "pagan" and Christian), has highlighted the role of Plato's Timaeus, of Middle Platonism, and of Stoicism in Bardaisan's thought, and has traced impressive and previously unnoticed parallels with the thought, and the school, of Origen of Alexandria. In this and other cases, she has interrelated Syriac and Greco-Roman studies, especially from the philosophical, religious, and historical perspective. Her monograph on social justice (OUP 2016) argues in detail that philosophical asceticism in antiquity and late antiquity was not simply about self-restraint or contempt for the body, but was often driven by a concern with justice and it is only in such circles that, in all of antiquity and late antiquity, we find an opposition to slavery as an institution, both in principle and in actual fact.

She has also published, by request, many popular interviews in newspapers, journals, books, videos, and columns (such as many articles for a column in Avvenire, then collected in the book I Cristiani e l’impero romano),  and academic blog articles, for instance one for Oxford University Press, on inequality, oppression, and new forms of slavery, and three for Philosophy of Religion on what is Philosophy of Religion, what it contributes to the modern University, and what norms or values define excellent philosophy of religion.
