Alisz Goriupp (also known as Alice Goriupp, 18 August 1894 in Buziásfürdő – 4 February 1979 in Budapest) was a Hungarian librarian, media historian and bibliographer. She published several papers on bibliography and other aspects of library science. In 1916, with a thesis on the work of philologist Gábor Döbrentei, Goriupp earned her doctorate at the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár, Austria-Hungary.  (Following the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the city was known as Cluj, and subsequently as Cluj-Napoca.) In 1917 Goriupp obtained a diploma to teach Hungarian and German, having attended the universities of Vienna and Leipzig on a partial scholarship. Afterwards she continued her studies at the University of Vienna. In 1917-18 she taught German language at her alma mater. In 1918 she began as a trainee at the National Széchényi Library (Országos Széchényi Könyvtár) in Budapest and in 1922 became an assistant library warden. With the newspaper library in poor condition after World War I, she compiled newspaper cataloguing rules in 1923 and directed the furnishing of a newly built warehouse in 1926. In 1928-29 she travelled to Austria for a year of further study abroad, and again in 1935 to Germany. Having studied Germany's new national library cataloging system introduced in Berlin, Göttingen, Frankfurt and Darmstadt, she established a new cataloguing system at the National Széchényi Library in 1936.  The reform introduced the Universal Decimal Classification and solved the problem of creating multiple catalogues indexed by author, title, subject, etc. In 1944 she became the national library's collections manager, her concern focused primarily on the safety of the collection during wartime. In 1945 and 1946 she was instrumental in the postwar restoration and reorganization.  In 1946 she founded the National Bibliography of Hungary (Magyar Nemzeti Bibliográfia); she remained its editor until 1954. From 1948 till 1953 she was Faculty Librarian at Eötvös Loránd University and instructed classes on cataloguing and bibliography editing.
