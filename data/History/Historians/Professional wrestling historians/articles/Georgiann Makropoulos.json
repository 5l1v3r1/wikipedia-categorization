She started writing for wrestling magazines in the early 1960s, and maintained a fan club for (Nature Boy) Buddy Rogers. She later served as vice president of a fan club for Bruno Sammartino. She maintained friendships with many of the wrestlers, who considered her a trusted confidant. Makropoulos was always encouraging to young fans who wanted to get involved with wrestling by publishing newsletters. She wrote a fan club column for <i>Wrestling World</i> that tried to help publicize the clubs and newsletters. Later, she would start her own <i>Wrestling Chatterbox</i> newsletter, which focused on non-mainstream news like listing wrestlers' birthdays and their personal appearance schedules for autograph signings.

She died on January 25, 2010, of a <a href=\"/wiki/Heart_attack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heart attack\">heart attack</a>.
