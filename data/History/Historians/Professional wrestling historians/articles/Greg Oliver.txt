In July 2008, Bret Hart, an acclaimed professional wrestler, spoke at the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, during the induction banquet for his father, Stu Hart, about Oliver. Upset over his ranking in one of Oliver's books – #14 in the greatest Canadian performers, behind midget wrestler Sky Low Low – Hart called Oliver a "charlatan".  Sports journalist Heath McCoy also criticised Oliver for his placement of Hart and asked if Oliver was joking with that decision. McCoy also stated that he believed Oliver's book was highly biased towards Ontario wrestling.
