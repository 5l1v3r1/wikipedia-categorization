Franca Iacovetta is a "feminist/socialist"  historian of labour and migration currently working at the University of Toronto. Her dissertation, published as Such Hardworking People: Italian Immigrants in Postwar Toronto, was supervised by York University's Ramsay Cook. She has since edited numerous collections of case studies, examining the lives of so-called "marginalized peoples" in Canada and the United States. Her most recent book Gatekeepers  was awarded the Canadian Historical Association's John A. Macdonald Prize in 2008. She has been critical of J.L. Granatstein, who questioned the dominance of social history in recent Canadian historical-writing in Who Killed Canadian History?, calling it a "clearly offensive", "ill-conceived little book".
