In Fall 2017 the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent re-installed its permanent collection and included works by contemporary artists Luc Tuymans, Ria Verhaeghe and Patrick Van Caeckenbergh. The new installation also included a few Russian avantgarde works from the Dieleghem Foundation (Toporovski collection). In 2018, however, the Toporovski collection was claimed to be doubtful concerning their authenticity by a group of art dealers and some scholars in The Art Newspaper and De Standaard.   The Belgian news claimed that Catherine de Zegher insisted the MSK had done art historical research and also worked with two art historians, experts in the field of the Russian avantgarde, stating to be able to proof it with the needed documents. Both of the experts however denied having done an expertise on the works and said to have warned Catherine de Zegher not to exhibit the Toporovski collection.    However, Catherine de Zegher disputed these claims.   The Director of the MSK and the City of Ghent closed the exhibition and terminated the contract with the owner so that the works could be returned. The latter stated that an investigation will be conducted to verify the authenticity of the works.  Several Flemish museum directors critiqued the handling of Catherine de Zegher and the MSK.  Catherine de Zegher however answered that they did all the necessary art historical research.   A former exhibition in France featuring work from the Toporovski's was questioned as well, however the court ruled the paintings to be real.  Due to the problems surrounding the collection the Museum board has ordered an audit on the event and has suspended Catherine de Zegher pending this process.   The Flemish Parlement debated in Februari how to limit the negative effects of this controversy for other Belgian musea   Currently the matter is into the hands of an investigating judge.  2017.
