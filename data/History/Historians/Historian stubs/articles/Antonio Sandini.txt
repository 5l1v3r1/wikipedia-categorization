Antonio Sandini  (1692 – 23 February 1751) was an Italian ecclesiastical historian. He was born June 31, 1692, and became, by the interest of his bishop, cardinal Rezzonico (who was afterwards pope Clement XIII), librarian and professor of ecclesiastical history at Padua, where he died, Feb. 23, 1751. He is known principally by his Vitoe Pontificum Romanorum (Ferrara, 1748; reprinted under the title of Basis Historioe Ecclesiasticoe). He also wrote Historioe Familioe Sacroe: — Hist. SS. Apostolorum: — Disputationes XX ex. Hist. Eccles., etc.: — and Dissertations in Defence of his Hist. Fam. Sac., which father Serry had attacked.  This article incorporates public domain material from the Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature by McClintock and Strong.
