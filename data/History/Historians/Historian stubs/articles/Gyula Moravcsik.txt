Gyula (Julius) Moravcsik (Budapest, 29 January 1892 – Budapest, 10 December 1972), who usually wrote just as Gy. Moravcsik, was a Hungarian professor of Greek philology and Byzantine history who in 1967 was awarded the Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts. Moravcsik explored in depth the relationship between Byzantium and the Turkic peoples, broadly defined and so including Hungarians, and this was reflected in the two volumes of Byzantinoturcica and the 1953 Bizánc és a Magyarság (Byzantium and the Magyars).  With R.J.H. Jenkins, he produced the important new critical and translated edition of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio. That work was first published in Budapest, 1949, and later at Dumbarton Oaks. Moravcsik also contributed to the later Commentary, also in the Dumbarton Oaks series. His son, Julius Moravcsik (1931 – 2009), became a Professor of Philosophy at Stanford University.
