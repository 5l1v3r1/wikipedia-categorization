 Anton F. Fahne (February 28, 1805 – January 12, 1883) was a German author, jurist, genealogist and historian. Fahne was born in Münster and studied medicine at the University of Bonn and law at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He produced several genealogical and local historical writings. Fahne helped to found the Historischen Verein für den Niederrhein (Historical Society of the Lower Rhine) in 1854.  Fahne died in Düsseldorf. He was buried at the Gerresheimer Waldfriedhof in Düsseldorf-Gerresheim. His estate manages the Historical Archive of the City of Cologne. It is a common mistake that Anton Fahne and Friedrich von Uechtritz are the same person.
