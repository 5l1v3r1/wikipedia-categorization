Philinus of Agrigentum (3rd-century BCE) lived during the First Punic War and wrote its history from a pro-Carthaginian standpoint. His writings were used as a source by Polybius for his description of the First Punic War.  Although Polybius uses Philinus' writings he does also accuse him of being biased and inconsistent.  Philinus maintained that the initial Roman intervention in Sicily at the start of the First Punic War violated a treaty between Rome and Carthage which recognized Roman sovereignty on the Italian peninsula and Carthaginian control in Sicily.
