Sayf ibn Umar al-Usayyidi al-Tamimi (Arabic: سيف بن عمر‎) was an early Islamic historian and compiler of reports who lived in Kufa. He wrote Kitāb al-futūh al-kabīr wa 'l-ridda, which is al-Tabari's main source for the Ridda wars and early Muslim conquests. It also contains important information about the structure of early Muslim armies and government. According to al-Dhahabi, Sayf died during the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786-809).  Little is known about Sayf, except that he lived in Kufa and belonged to the tribe of Banu Tamim.  The reliability of his hadiths has long been contested.  His narrations are said to be influenced by the tribal traditions of Banu Tamim.  However, he also collected accounts that highlight other tribes.  Shia researcher Arzina Lalani suggests that Sayf is the first person who mentions Abdullah ibn Saba in his writings. His claim that a Yemeni Jew was allegedly a founder of Shia Islam, was picked on by al-Tabari. She states that his account of early Islamic history was heavily influenced by later Sunni historiography.  According to a book called Abdullah bin Saba (عبدالله بن سبا) authored by Shia researcher Murtaza Askari the 12 the most popular Rijali (someone who knows about Ilm al-Rijāl) scholars, believed Sayf was not a reliable transmitter of Hadith. They are as follows: Yahya bin Moein, Al-Nasa'i, Abu Dawood, Ibn Sakan, Abu Hatim Muhammad ibn Idris al-Razi Ibn Hibban, Al-Daraqutni, Al-Hakim Nishapuri, Firoozabadi,[who?] Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, Al-Suyuti, and Safi Al din.[who?]  It has been recorded in Tahdib al-Kamal, that Yahya bin Moein held this view.
