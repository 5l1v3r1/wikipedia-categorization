Wolfram Setz (born July 7, 1941) is a German historian, editor, translator and essayist. Born in Stralsund, Setz studied at the universities of Cologne and Tübingen, completing his Ph.D. in 1975 with a dissertation on Lorenzo Valla's exposure of the Donation of Constantine as a hoax. Setz was subsequently employed as an editor at Monumenta Germaniae Historica in Munich. Following retirement in 2004, he relocated to Hamburg. Setz is editor of the "Bibliothek rosa Winkel", a series of over 70 volumes of LGBT literary  reprints, cultural studies, and historical works that was launched in 1991, published initially by Verlag rosa Winkel and since 2001 by Männerschwarm Verlag. Several of Setz's publications have contributed to the rediscovery of the gay rights pioneer Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1825–1895). Setz was editor of the book series "Homosexualität und Literatur" published by Verlag rosa Winkel (12 volumes, 1981-1999) and a coeditor of the scholarly journal Forum Homosexualität und Literatur (1987-2007). In 1986 he was a founding member of the German LGBT organization Bundesverband Homosexualität and served for several years as a board member until the organization was dissolved in 1997.
