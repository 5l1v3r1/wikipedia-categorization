John Lauritsen (born 1939) is a retired market research analyst, author, activist, and the founder of Pagan Press.   Lauritsen wrote for the New York Native, where he argued against the connection between HIV and AIDS    and questioned the safety of the anti-HIV drug AZT.  Lauritsen co-authored a book with Hank Wilson entitled Death Rush: Poppers and AIDS (New York: Pagan Press, 1986), in which they conjectured a connection between poppers and AIDS, especially Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer.  Lauritsen argues that poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, not Percy's wife Mary Shelley, was the real author of Frankenstein (1818). He expounded this theory in his work The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein (2007), which received both favorable and negative reviews.    He is also the author of The AIDS War, a 1993 book promoting HIV/AIDS denialism.
