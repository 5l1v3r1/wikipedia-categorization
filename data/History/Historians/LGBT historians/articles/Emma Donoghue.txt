  Emma Donoghue (born 24 October 1969) is an Irish-Canadian playwright, literary historian, novelist, and screenwriter. Her 2010 novel Room was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize  and an international best-seller. Donoghue's 1995 novel Hood won the Stonewall Book Award.  and Slammerkin (2000) won the Ferro-Grumley Award for Lesbian Fiction.  Room was adapted into a film of the same name, for which Donoghue wrote the screenplay which was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Donoghue was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1969.  The youngest of eight children, she is the daughter of Frances (n√©e Rutledge) and academic and literary critic Denis Donoghue.    She has a first-class honours Bachelor of Arts degree from University College Dublin (in English and French) and a PhD in English from Girton College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge she lived in a women's co-op, an experience which inspired her short story The Welcome.  Her thesis was on friendship between men and women in 18th century fiction.  At Cambridge, she met her future life partner Christine Roulston, a Canadian who is now professor of French and Women's Studies at the University of Western Ontario. They moved permanently to Canada in 1998 and Donoghue became a Canadian citizen in 2004.  She lives in London, Ontario with Roulston and their two children, Finn and Una.   Donoghue's first novel was 1994's Stir Fry, a contemporary coming of age novel about a young Irish woman discovering her sexuality.  It was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in 1994.  This was followed in 1995 by Hood, another contemporary story, this time about an Irish woman coming to terms with the death of her girlfriend.  Hood won the 1997 American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Book Award for Literature (now known as the Stonewall Book Award for Literature).  Slammerkin (2000) is a historical novel set in London and Wales. Inspired by an 18th-century newspaper story about a young servant who killed her employer and was executed, the protagonist is a prostitute who longs for fine clothes.   It was a finalist in the 2001 Irish Times Irish Literature Prize for Fiction and was awarded the 2002 Ferro-Grumley Award for Lesbian Fiction (despite a lack of lesbian content).    Her 2007 novel, Landing, portrays a long-distance relationship between a Canadian curator and an Irish flight attendant.  The Sealed Letter (2008), another work of historical fiction, is based on the Codrington Affair, a scandalous divorce case that gripped Britain in 1864. The protagonist is Emily Faithfull.  The Sealed Letter was longlisted for the Giller Prize,  and was joint winner, with Chandra Mayor's All the Pretty Girls, of the 2009 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction.
