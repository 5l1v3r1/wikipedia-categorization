        Base on an Assyria record of Eclipse on June 15, 763 BC, and the related date documents between Assyria and Babylonia, the dates after 1400 BC are reliable. According to the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a record of astronomical observations of Venus in Old Babylonian Empire king Ammisaduqa (1646–1626 BC), the rough date can be concluded. But about the accuracy date, the Historians have different opinions, in high chronology the finish date of Old Babylonian is 1651 BC, in middle chronology the finish date of Old Babylonian is 1595 BC，and in low chronology the finish date of Old Babylonian is 1531 BC. In this article we use the middle chronology, same as most of the books about Mesopotamia, but there are many evidence support the low chronology (even extreme low chronology).
