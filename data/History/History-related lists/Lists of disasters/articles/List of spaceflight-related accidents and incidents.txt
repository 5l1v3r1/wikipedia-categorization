This article lists verifiable spaceflight-related accidents and incidents resulting in fatality or near-fatality during flight or training for manned space missions, and testing, assembly, preparation or flight of manned and unmanned spacecraft. Not included are accidents or incidents associated with intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests, unmanned space flights not resulting in fatality or serious injury, or Soviet or German rocket-powered aircraft projects of World War II. Also not included are alleged unreported Soviet space accidents, which are considered fringe theories by a majority of historians. As of  2018[update], there have been 18 astronaut and cosmonaut fatalities during spaceflight.   Astronauts have also died while training for space missions, such as the Apollo 1 launch pad fire which killed an entire crew of three. There have also been some non-astronaut fatalities during spaceflight-related activities. As of  March 2018[update], in-flight accidents have killed 18 astronauts, in four separate incidents.  NASA astronauts who died on duty are memorialized at the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida.  Cosmonauts who died on duty under the Soviet Union were generally honored by burial at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow. No Soviet or Russian cosmonauts have died during spaceflight since 1971. There have been a total of five fatal in-flight accidents, four of which flew above the Kármán line. In each case, the entire crew was killed. The Soyuz 1 crash site coordinates are 51°21′41″N 59°33′44″E﻿ / ﻿51.3615°N 59.5622°E﻿ / 51.3615; 59.5622, 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) west of Karabutak, Province of Orenburg in the Russian Federation, about 275 kilometers (171 mi) east-southeast of Orenburg. In a small park on the side of the road is a memorial monument: a black column with a bust of Komarov at the top.    The Soyuz 11 landing coordinates are 47°21′24″N 70°07′17″E﻿ / ﻿47.35663°N 70.12142°E﻿ / 47.35663; 70.12142, 90 kilometers (56 mi) southwest of Karazhal, Karagandy, Kazakhstan, and about 550 kilometers (340 mi) northeast of Baikonur, in open flat country far from any populated area. In a small circular fenced area at the site is a memorial monument in the form of a three-sided metallic column. Near the top of the column on each side is the engraved image of the face of a crew member set into a stylized triangle.    The vehicle broke up over the southwestern United States and fell in fragments over eastern Texas and central Louisiana.  In addition to accidents during spaceflights, 13 astronauts, test pilots, and other personnel have been killed during training and test flights. Apart from actual disasters, a number of missions resulted in some very near misses and also some training accidents that nearly resulted in deaths. This list excludes deaths caused by military operations, either by deliberate detonations, or accidental during production - for example German V-2 rockets reportedly caused on average an estimated 6 kills per operational rocket just during its production stages.
