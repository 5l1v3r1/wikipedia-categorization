List of Masonic buildings identifies notable buildings around the world associated with Freemasonry.  Often these are significant landmarks in their towns or cities, and reflect the influence of Masons at one time.  Most are buildings built for exclusive or shared use by Masonic lodges, Grand Lodges or other Masonic bodies.  Many include original commercial space on ground or lower floors, with space intended for group meetings above.  (For a list of those within the United States, see: List of Masonic buildings in the United States) Most of the buildings on this list were purpose-built to house Masonic lodge meetings and ritual activities.  In a few cases, Masonic bodies converted existing landmark buildings to Masonic use.  Also included are buildings constructed by the Freemasons as part of their charitable endeavors (such as hospitals and schools).  This list is intended to include any building having some form of landmark status such as being listed on a heritage registers, and other notable ones as well.
