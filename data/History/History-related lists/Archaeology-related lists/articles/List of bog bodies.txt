 This is a list of bog bodies in order of the country in which they were discovered. Bog bodies, or bog people, are the naturally preserved corpses of humans and some animals recovered from peat bogs. The bodies have been most commonly found in the Northern European countries of Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Reports of bog bodies surfaced during the early 1700s.  In 1965, the German scientist Alfred Dieck catalogued more than 1,850 bog bodies, but later scholarship revealed much of Dieck's work was erroneous.  Hundreds of bog bodies have been recovered and studied,  although it is believed that only around 45 bog bodies remain intact today.

Glob wrote that Rendswühren Man was estimated to have been 40–50 years of age when he was battered to death, which left a triangular hole in his head. He was found naked, with a piece of leather on his left leg. A cape was found near him. After discovery, his corpse was smoked for preservation.  His skull had deteriorated, which required reconstruction.  Textile typologically the clothing found with the body has been dated into the Roman Iron Age of the 1st or 2nd century CE which has been confirmed by a carbon-14 dating of parts of the remains.
