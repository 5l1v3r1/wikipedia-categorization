List of archaeological excavations in Jerusalem is an incomplete list of archaeological excavations in Jerusalem. The nineteenth century saw much interest in Jerusalem develop. British Protestants, eager to find hard evidence for their Christian convictions, set out to dig the Holy City. Among them were Flinders Petrie, Charles Warren, Charles William Wilson and Montague Parker. During the Mandate, efforts to excavate Jerusalem continued with digs by R. A. Stewart Macalister in the City of David. Under Jordanian rule, Kathleen Kenyon excavated in the City of David, discovering numerous important finds including the proto-Ionic capital.
