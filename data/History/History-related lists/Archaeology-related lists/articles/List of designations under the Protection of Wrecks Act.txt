  This is a list of all sites designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. The designated sites are shown on charts and notified to mariners.  English Heritage provides administration of the arrangements under the Act in England and publishes information on each site.  In May 2011, it launched an online searchable database of all protected wreck sites in English territorial waters, the National Heritage List for England,  which includes the location co-ordinates, designation list entry description and brief historical details for each site.  The administration of designated historic wrecks in Scotland is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, and in Wales by Cadw. Section 2 of the Act designates wrecks categorised as dangerous.
