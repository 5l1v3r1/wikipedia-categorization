 List of electoral firsts in New Zealand lists members of the Parliament of New Zealand who are notable for age (oldest or youngest) or length of service or by being the “first” for a group e.g. women, Māori, ethnic minorities or LGBT people.  The list is mainly for the  House of Representatives rather than the former upper house (the  Legislative Council, which was abolished in 1951), and may include the second and third people to attain a position also. Where a source is not given, the source may be the article on the MP.  Members of Parliament are now just referred to as "MPs" or Members of Parliament. Until 1907 members of the House of Representatives were designated "M.H.R." for Members of the House of Representatives. With Dominion status members were designated "M.P." by a Royal Proclamation of 10 September.    Since the introduction of mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in 1996, a number of people from ethnic minorities have been selected by their party for the party list (some came into parliament between elections to replace a retiring list MP).
