This is a list of exoplanet discoveries that were the first by several criteria, including: and others. The choice of "first" depends on definition and confirmation, as below. The three systems detected prior to 1994 each have a drawback, with Gamma Cephei b being unconfirmed until 2002; HD 114762 b is near the boundary of exoplanet / brown dwarf mass; while the  PSR B1257+12 planets orbit a pulsar. This leaves 51 Peg b (discovered and confirmed 1995) as the first confirmed exoplanet around a normal star.   This object has a minimum mass of 11 Jupiter masses, or more depending on orbit inclination. It remains unclear whether this is a high mass exoplanet, or a low-mass brown dwarf.  However, these exoplanets orbit a pulsar rather than a normal star.  2005
