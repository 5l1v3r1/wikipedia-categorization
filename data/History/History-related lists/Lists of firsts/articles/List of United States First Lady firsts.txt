There have been forty-two official First Ladies and forty-five First Ladyships. This discrepancy exists because some presidents remarried while in office and some weren't married so had no official First Lady. Also note that First Ladies not recognized by the National First Ladies' Library listing include Martha Jefferson Randolph, Emily Donelson, Sarah Yorke Jackson, Angelica Van Buren, Priscilla Tyler, Mary McElroy, Rose Cleveland, Mary McKee, and Margaret Woodrow Wilson.
