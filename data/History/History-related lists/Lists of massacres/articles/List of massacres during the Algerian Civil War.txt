During the Algerian Civil War of the 1990s, many massacres occurred. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility for many of them, while for others no group has claimed responsibility. In addition to generating a widespread sense of fear, the massacres effected migration from and depopulation of the worst-affected areas. The number of massacres peaked in 1997, with a smaller peak in 1994, and they were particularly concentrated in the areas between Algiers and Oran, with very few occurring in the east or in the Sahara. This list is not exhaustive and covers only events in which over 50 civilians or prisoners were killed; the number of smaller massacres is far more numerous. Sources frequently disagree on the number of deaths.
