This is a list of New York State Historic Sites (SHS). It includes 40 state-designated historic sites and parks managed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.   Twenty-two sites also are National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) of the United States and are described further in List of National Historic Landmarks in New York.  The 18 SHS that are not NHLs may be of national importance and be NHL-eligible but, as state-owned and -administered sites, may have less need for additional protection; or may be of state, but not national, importance.
