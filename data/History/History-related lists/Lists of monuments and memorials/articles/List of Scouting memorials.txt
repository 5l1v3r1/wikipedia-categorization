 Since the birth and expansion of the Scout movement in the first decade of the 20th century, many Scouting memorials,  monuments and gravesites have been erected throughout the world. Erected on 28 May 1982, offered by the Scouts of Wiltz with the help of Scouts and Guides of the world, in honour of Lord Robert Baden-Powell 1857â€“1941 Founder of the Scout Movement. The sculpture of the Roman travertine is 3.5 meters high with a base approximately 11 tons and was made by the sculptor Lucien Wercollier from Luxembourg. Scouts who visited Wiltz each donated 1 penny. This paid for the monument and so it got its name. At Gilwell Park, Gembrook, Victoria the De Molnar Memorial Hall was opened 26 January 1964. The building  commemorates the former International Commissioner and Deputy Camp Chief of Hungary and Chairman of Melbourne Scout District Fritz de Molnar.
