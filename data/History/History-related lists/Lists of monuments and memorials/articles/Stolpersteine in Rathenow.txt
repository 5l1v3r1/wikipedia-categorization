The Stolpersteine in Rathenow lists the Stolpersteine in the town of Rathenow in Brandenburg. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims that were murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.  Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence.  The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim. The association Memento and the local cultural centre initiated the Stolperstein collocation in Rathenow.   It took place on March 19, 2007.  Both Egon and Günther Kornblum could survive. They married and each of them had several children. Egon died on January 25, 2005 in Essen, were he had lived with his wife and his children since 1958.  Günther died in Petah Tikva in Israel. One of Alfred Kornblums half brothers, Max Kornblum, his second wife Jette Seligmann and two of his children, Ruth (born 1907) and Günther (born 1909) were murdered at Auschwitz.
