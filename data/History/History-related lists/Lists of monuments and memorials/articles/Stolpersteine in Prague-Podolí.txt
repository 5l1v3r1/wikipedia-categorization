The Stolpersteine in Prague-Podolí lists the Stolpersteine in the district Podolí of Prague. Since 2002, the district belongs to Praha 4. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.  Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: Kameny zmizelých, stones of the disappeareds. The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim. Memorial stones in Khaatal (for the victims of the death march) and on the cemetery of Prague-Olšanský (for all five murdered members of his family) remind of Bedřich Kaufmann.   Also his parents and his brothers were killed in the course of the Shoah. His wife and all three sons were also murdered in the course of the Shoah. The report of his death to Yad Vashem was filled by his sister, who survived.  Also his parents and his brothers were killed in the course of the Shoah. Her husband and all three sons were murdered in the course of the Shoah. Her sister Martha, then a widow, was sent to Maly Trostenets extermination camp and killed there. Most probably also her sister Fanny was killed by the Nazi regime. Her brothers could survive. Jindra died 1975 in an unknown location, Rudolf 1983 in Kiryat Bialik, Haifa. According to the website of Gunter Demnig the Stolpersteine of Prague were posed on 8 October 2008, 7 November 2009, 12 June 2010, 13 to 15 July 2011 and on 17 July 2013 by the artist himself. A further collocation occurred on 28 October 2012, but is not mentioned on Demnig's page. The Czech Stolperstein project was initiated in 2008 by the Česká unie židovské mládeže (Czech Union of Jewish Youth) and was realized with the patronage of the Mayor of Prague.
