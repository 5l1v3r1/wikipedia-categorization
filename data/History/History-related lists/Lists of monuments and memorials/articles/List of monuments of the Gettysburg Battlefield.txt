The monuments of the Gettysburg Battlefield commemorate the July 1 to 3, 1863 Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War. Most are located within Gettysburg National Military Park; others are on private land at battle sites in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Together, they represent "one of the largest collections of outdoor sculpture in the world."  The majority of the monuments are listed as contributing structures within Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District. The historic district was approved by the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places on January 23, 2004. As of 2008, the National Park Service unit managed 1,320 monuments and markers, 410 cannons, 148 historic buildings, and 41 miles (66Â km) of roads (8 miles of them, unpaved).  The largest concentration of monuments is at the Gettysburg National Cemetery, where President Abraham Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address. Company: Decherd Marble and Granite Company (Decherd, TN)
