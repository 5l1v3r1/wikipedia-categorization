This is a list of types of funerary monument, a physical structure that commemorates a deceased person or a group, in the latter case usually those whose deaths occurred at the same time or in similar circumstances. The funerary monument differs from a tomb or cemetery in that while it may or may not contain the body of the deceased, its primary purpose is not simply to house the remains, but to serve as a visible reminder of the dead for the living. It often features inscriptions (epitaphs) or funerary art.
