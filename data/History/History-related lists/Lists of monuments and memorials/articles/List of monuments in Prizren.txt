Prizren along with its historical values contributes to not only the city itself, but the entire territory of Kosovo.[a] Numerous data that have remained from the past suggest that this area has been inhabited since ancient times. Among the most valuable assets of Prizren are material values that are inherited from past centuries. Thanks to the suitable geographical position, Prizren is a woven together place where civilizations and different cultures meet. This list includes historical, cultural, religious and natural monuments of the municipality of Prizren, which are listed by the government of the Republic of Serbia, Republic of Kosovo, Municipality of Prizren, International NGOs and Local NGOs. The entire complex was archeologically explored in 1927, and its remains were conserved after the Second World War. During the last decade of the 20th century, work on the reconstruction was continued, and in 1998 it again became an active male monastery. After the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and retreat of the Yugoslav army forces, reconstructed objects were burned and looted in June 1999, by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), after the Kosovo Force (KFOR) arrived. During the 2004 unrest in Kosovo, the monastery was burned and looted again. The entire monastery complex is under protection of the Republic of Serbia, as a Monument of Culture of Great Importance, and today in the monastery lives one priest and the monastery is under constant protection of Kosovo Police and in a special protection zone.
