The Stolpersteine in Latvia lists the Stolpersteine of Latvia. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. Until now in Latvia there has been only one collocation of Stolpersteine — on 28 July 2018 in Riga. The Stolpersteine were collocated by the artist himself. In 1941, the Third Reich attacked the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa and also occupied Latvia. One of the first Nazi crimes was the destruction of the Great Choral Synagogue in Riga. A series of crimes against humanity followed, such as the massacres of Rumbula and Liepāja in November and December 1941. By the end of 1941, over 43,000 Jews were murdered in Latvia.  During the Holocaust, more than 70,000 Latvian Jews were murdered, and another 20,000 Jews deported from Germany and the occupied territories to Riga were also assassinated. Due to the anti-Israeli policy in the Soviet Union, Holocaust study in Latvia were virtually impossible until 1989 as the Sovjet Union did not allow Holocaust events to be considered separately from other Nazi victims. "In total, about 210,000 Jews were killed by German organizations and their accomplices in the Baltic republics."  The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.
