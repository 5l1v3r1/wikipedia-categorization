It lay close behind the German front-line in 1916 and was strongly fortified. On 1 July 1916, the first day on the Battle of the Somme, the village was seized by the British 30th Division in one of the few successful British advances of the day and in the village there is a memorial to the Liverpool and Manchester 'Pals', who, as part of the 30th Division, were the first to reach the village.  Montauban was to remain free until the end of March 1918, when it was retaken by the Germans in their \"Spring Offensive\", to be liberated again in August 1918.

On 12 September 1916, the French Chasseurs Regiment, led by the former Minister of War Messimy, charged and took the German position with fixed bayonets. Their advance was checked the next day following an intense German Artillery bombardment but the French held this line until the end of the Battle of the Somme. They had in fact advanced almost 10 kilometres from their start position at Maricourt on 1 July 1916.    It was the Australians who finally liberated the village on 4 September 1918 .\n<p>There is a statue of Foch in the village. Firmin-Marcelin Michelet was the sculptor.\n</p><p>The French Army had done well in their sector and after the opening day they soon took Frise, H\u00e9rbecourt and Bernafay Wood as well as Assevillers.  The 1st Colonial Corps took Flaucourt on 19 July and soon threatened P\u00e9ronne. Biaches was taken then Barleux and the French Foreign Legion took Belloy-en-Santerre.  Soon the plateau of Flaucourt had been conquered but none of these villages were taken without intense fighting and great loss of life    Bianchee for example  was to change hands several times before being finally taken by the French on 19 July 1916.  Once within sight of P\u00e9ronne however the French had to hold back, conscious that their left flank was exposed given the lack of progress on the British side. Rather than go for P\u00e9ronne and head further northwards they moved in the direction of Chaulnes.\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Statue_Foch.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Statue_Foch.jpg/300px-Statue_Foch.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Statue_Foch.jpg/450px-Statue_Foch.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Statue_Foch.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"450\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Statue_Foch.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Statue of Marshal Foch at Bouchavesnes</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Memorial_to_18th_Division_at_Thiepval\">Memorial to 18th Division at Thiepval</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Memorial to 18th Division at Thiepval\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1000px;\">Memorial to 18th Division at Thiepval\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The British 18th Division had three memorials established in their honour.

Caterpillar Valley was the name given by the army to the long valley which rises eastwards, past \"Caterpillar Wood\", to the high ground at Guillemont. The ground was captured, after very fierce fighting, in the latter part of July 1916.   It was lost in the German advance of March 1918 and recovered by the 38th (Welsh) Division on 28 August 1918, when a little cemetery was made (now Plot 1 of this cemetery) containing 25 graves of the 38th Division and the 6th Dragoon Guards.  After the Armistice, this cemetery was hugely increased when the graves of more than 5,500 officers and men were brought in from other small cemeteries, and the battlefields of the Somme. The great majority of these soldiers died in the autumn of 1916 and almost all the rest in August or September 1918. The cemetery now contains 5,569 Commonwealth burials and commemorations of the First World War. 3,796 of the burials are unidentified but there are special memorials to 32 casualties known or believed to be buried among them, and to three buried in McCormick's Post Cemetery whose graves were destroyed by shell fire.  On 6 November 2004, the remains of an unidentified New Zealand soldier were entrusted to New Zealand at a ceremony held at the Longueval Memorial, France.  The remains had been exhumed by staff of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, Longueval, France, Plot 14, Row A, Grave 27 and were later laid to rest within the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, at the National War Memorial, Wellington, New Zealand.\n<p>On the east side of the cemetery is the Caterpillar Valley (New Zealand) Memorial commemorating more than 1,200 officers and men of the New Zealand Division who died in the Battles of the Somme in 1916, and whose graves are not known.\n</p><p>Both cemetery and memorial were designed by Sir Herbert Baker.\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_(September_2010)_6.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_%28September_2010%29_6.JPG/300px-Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_%28September_2010%29_6.JPG\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_%28September_2010%29_6.JPG/450px-Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_%28September_2010%29_6.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_%28September_2010%29_6.JPG/600px-Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_%28September_2010%29_6.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"1704\" data-file-height=\"2272\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Caterpillar_Valley_Cemetery_(September_2010)_6.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>New Zealand Memorial to the Missing at Caterpillar Valley Cemetery</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Memorial_to_the_38th_.28Welsh.29_Division_at_Mametz_Wood\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Memorial_to_the_38th_(Welsh)_Division_at_Mametz_Wood\">Memorial to the 38th (Welsh) Division at Mametz Wood</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Memorial to the 38th (Welsh) Division at Mametz Wood\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Mametz Wood was to be the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of the opening days of the Battle of the Somme as taking the wood involved advancing uphill and over open ground while facing heavy machine gun fire and artillery.

Australian troops arrived in the area on 14 July and immediately began preparations to attack Pozi\u00e8res. The town was the bastion of the German defensive line and was protected by the formidable 'K' and 'Pozi\u00e8res' trenches in front of the village and two solid trenches behind, designated 'OG' (Old German) 1 and 2. Before the war a windmill had stood to the north-east of the town; it was destroyed early in the fighting but its foundations had been turned by the Germans into a formidable machine gun post.\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg/250px-Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg/375px-Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg/500px-Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"768\" data-file-height=\"1024\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Pozieres_Aussie_Memorial.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Plaque on the Australian 1st Division Memorial at Pozi\u00e8res.

The Germans launched several counter-attacks in a desperate effort to wrest control from the Australians, but all were repulsed. The Germans then switched tactics&#160;: if they couldn't force the Australians out of Pozieres, they would destroy them. They launched one of the heaviest artillery barrages of the war and pounded the Australians incessantly: at the height of the bombardment the shells rained down at the rate of 20 per minute. After three days the 1st Division had lost 5,285 men and the rest were exhausted. The Division was withdrawn and replaced by the 2nd Division. German pressure remained relentless and after 10 days the 2nd Division had lost 6,848 officers and men. It too was withdrawn and replaced by the 4th Division. This cycle continued until 3 September 1916.    Each Division fought until exhausted and was then replaced. When the replacement Division was itself exhausted, the original Division was rotated back into the line. Thus were the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions used as a battering ram against the German strong points at Pozi\u00e8res until they were almost destroyed. More than 50% of the Australians who fought at Pozi\u00e8res were killed, wounded or captured and five Victoria Crosses were won by Australians during the relentless fighting.  When entering today's Pozi\u00e8res one is immediately reminded of the Australian's efforts there and one is greeted by a large painting depicting an Australian soldier (See photograph in \"Gallery of images\").

Behind this is a Ross Bastiaan bronze plaque, similar to those located at other sites of particular significance to the Australian forces.  The plaque, which was unveiled by Lieutenant-General J.C. Grey on 30 August 1993,  gives information about the battle, stating that the Australians went into battle here on 23 July 1916 and fought until they were relieved on 5 September by the Canadians. It also has a relief map of the Somme area.  Behind the bench and bronze plaque is some uneven ground and some concrete remnants can be seen, presumably of the German fortifications on the site of the windmill.\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Mouquet_Farm_at_Pozi.C3.A8res\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Mouquet_Farm_at_Pozi\u00e8res\">The Mouquet Farm at Pozi\u00e8res</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: The Mouquet Farm at Pozi\u00e8res\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1000px;\">The Mouquet Farm at Pozi\u00e8res\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>At the site of Mouquet Farm  there is a Ross Bastiaan bronze and good views towards the Thiepval memorial.

The tower was dedicated by the Primate of All Ireland, the Moderator of the Irish Presbyterian church and the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland. At the time it was described as the most imposing monument on the Western Front; it was certainly one of the earliest.

Of the men commemorated, four won the VC for actions on 1 July 1916; Captain Eric Bell (killed 1 July), Lieutenant Geoffrey Cather (VC awarded for actions on 1 and 2 July, killed 2 July), Private Billy MacFadzean (killed 1 July) and Private Robert Quigg.

The file contains an architect's drawing of the proposed tower signed by J.A. Bowden M.S.A. and Major A L Abbot, architects.  We also learn from the file that the tower was built by Messrs.

The Canadians participated at the Somme from early September to the middle of November 1916, engaging in several of the battles-within-the-battle of the Somme, including actions at Flers-Courcelette, Thiepval Ridge and the Ancre Heights, as well as a small role in providing relief to the First Australian Imperial Force in the final days of the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res. The battles on the Somme were the first in which all four Canadian divisions participated in the same battle, although not together in a cohesive formation. The Canadian divisions suffered over 24,000 casualties.\n<p>Courcelette is located to the north of the main D929 road between Albert and Bapaume and at the beginning of the Somme Battles in July 1916 it was well within German held territory (see map above).   Indeed, it was not until mid-September that the Allies reached Courcelette and on 15 September 1916, the offensive which was to be known as the Battle of Flers-Courcelette was launched.  It was fought on a wide front with the Canadians playing a major role and involved the first use of tanks.  After Courcelette's capture it remained near to the front lines until the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line early in 1917.   In the German's \"Spring Offensive\" they retook Courcelette on 25 March 1918 and five months later it was retaken by the British as they advanced in the final few months of the War.\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:352px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Monument_courcelette.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Monument_courcelette.JPG/350px-Monument_courcelette.JPG\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Monument_courcelette.JPG/525px-Monument_courcelette.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Monument_courcelette.JPG/700px-Monument_courcelette.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3008\" data-file-height=\"2000\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Monument_courcelette.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Memorial at Courcelette</div></div></div></div>\nThe memorial is set within a small park and the inscription commemorates the Canadians part in breaking the German lines from 3 September to 18 November 1916.

Two charges of ammonal (36,000&#160;lbs and 24,000&#160;lbs 60 feet apart) had been set off under a German position called Schwaben Hohe, and the crater originally measured some 300 feet across and 90 feet deep.\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG/300px-Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG/450px-Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG/600px-Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"1024\" data-file-height=\"768\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lochnagar_Crater_Ovillers.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lochnagar Crater</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Memorial_to_the_102nd_and_103rd_Tyneside_Infantry_Brigades_at_La_Boiselle\">Memorial to the 102nd and 103rd Tyneside Infantry Brigades at La Boiselle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Memorial to the 102nd and 103rd Tyneside Infantry Brigades at La Boiselle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1000px;\">Memorial to the 102nd and 103rd Tyneside Infantry Brigades at La Boiselle\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Tyneside Memorial Seat, a memorial to the 102nd and 103rd Tynside Infantry Brigades was unveiled by Foch on 20 April 1922 and commemorates the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish Brigades' efforts to capture the ground either side of La Boisselle.\nThis memorial comprises a seat and bears a central plaque depicting a classical mounted warrior battling a dragon, while a weeping maiden looks on.

Losses among senior officers were particularly heavy, with all four battalion commanders in the Tyneside Scottish Brigade being killed.  In the Tyneside Irish Brigade the Brigade commander was wounded and three of the four battalion commanders were killed or wounded.

This is in the form of the figure of Victory, on a stone plinth, originally holding up a laurel wreath. This memorial was unveiled on 23 May 1923, by Major-General Sir Cecil Nicholson, who had commanded the Division from 25 July 1916 until the end of the war (he had taken over after Major-General Ingouville-Williams was killed).\n<p>The 34th Division's Memorial commemorates the part that the 34th Division had in the heavy fighting in and around the area of La Boisselle in July 1916.  The 34th Division had been raised as part of Kitchener's New Army and the Somme was to be their first battle. Formed for the most part by men from Tyneside it also had two battalions of Royal Scots from Edinburgh (One of which, the 16th was the footballers\u2019 battalion). As part of the great offensive on 1 July 1916, the 34th Division's task was to advance towards Contalmaison \u2013 the next village \u2013 taking La Boiselle, the Schwaben H\u00f6he (Site of the Lochnagar Crater), Sausage Valley and the Sausage Redoubt.   The attacks were met by a hail of fire from German defenders who had been waiting out the week-long bombardment in their shelters.  By the evening when the 19th Division took over the front line, Schwaben H\u00f6he and a foothold on the Sausage Redoubt were the only gains that had been made. La Boisselle was still very much in German hands.\n</p><p>The memorial then features a bronze figure of \"Victory\" atop a plinth and incorporates the Division's chequerboard emblem.  The memorial is said to be located where the Divisional HQ stood in 1916. The Division's units are listed on the side panels; infantry on the left and artillery and engineers on the right. The inscription commemorates the 34th Division (which included the Tyneside Scottish &amp; Irish Brigades referred to earlier, see the Tyneside Memorial Seat). The memorial records that the Division was engaged for the first time in battle near this spot on 1 July 1916. All 12 infantry battalions of the Division were to be involved, in successive waves. In around 10 minutes nearly 80% of the men in the leading battalions had become casualties; mainly caused by German machine-guns. These, once the British barrage lifted, were able to sweep across No Man's Land (often wide here) and catch the advancing soldiers in the open.\n</p><p>There was some success on the extreme right of the 34th Division frontage on 1 July, but in front of Ovillers and la Boiselle the only gains came in between Lochnagar and La Boiselle, where the 21st, 22nd and 26th Northumberland Fusiliers (the first two battalions from 102nd Brigade, the last from 103rd Brigade) started to advance the moment the <a href=\"/wiki/Lochnagar_crater\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lochnagar crater\">mine at Lochnagar</a> was blown.  The troops took German trenches to the north and north-east of Lochnagar crater, around Schwaben Hohe and on the northern slopes of Sausage Valley.  However, there were no reinforcements for the Divisional Commander, Major-General Ingouville-Williams, to deploy, and so the 19th Division were detailed to carry out an attack on La Boiselle after dark. They successfully took the village early the next day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\nOvillers is the village to the north of the D929.   From the main road, there is a good view of the large Ovillers Military Cemetery. This contains the burials of nearly 3,500 soldiers, only 31% of which are identified burials.  The cemetery is located in what was No Mans Land, and from the front of the cemetery, where a bank slopes down to the road, there are clear views of the Albert basilica to the right, of Mash valley in front, and the main road running on the spur ahead. <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Carrington_(British_Army_officer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charles Carrington (British Army officer)\">Charles Edmonds</a>, returning across this area on 16 July described it in \"A Subaltern's War\" <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"A little grass had still room to grow between the shellholes.

This was started around August 1916, and used until March 1917. It was then quite small, less than 150 graves, but the cemetery was increased significantly after the Armistice. This was mainly as a result of bringing in bodies from the local battlefields of Ovillers, La Boiselle, Pozi\u00e8res and Contalmaison.

They had served in Egypt in 1915/16, and then came to the Somme in the Spring of 1916 taking over the trenches opposite Serre.    At 7.30am on 1 July 1916 they were in the first wave of the attack from Mark Copse, and although they suffered heavily crossing No Man's Land, elements of the battalion under the commanding officer, Lt-Col Rickman, did reach the German lines.    By the close of the day, however, they were forced back and had lost 584 officers and men out of 720 who had made the attack that morning. The Memorial was erected in the 1980s in the Sheffield Memorial Park, just behind one of the jumping off trenches from where the Accrington Pals advanced on 1 July. It is made from Accrington brick, and the ruined wall symbolises the ruined village of Serre.\n</p><p>The British 31st Division was a New Army division formed in April 1915 as part of the K4 Army Group and taken over by the War Office on 10 August 1915.

Delville Wood is located off the D20 that runs between Longueval  and Guillemont.   Opposite the South African Memorial there is a large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, the Delville Wood Cemetery. This is the third largest British cemetery on the Somme, with 5,523 graves. Almost all the burials are of casualties from the Somme during the period July, August and September 1916 and a high proportion of the bodies could not be identified.\n</p>\nThe memorial was unveiled in 1926 and its imposing entrance is surmounted by a statue of a horse and two men. This was based on the legend of Castor and Pollux and is an allegory representing the fact that both English South Africans and Boers had fought side by side.  The names of areas where South Africans fought, including locations in France and Flanders, are inscribed on the memorial, and above the entrance arch are the words <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"Their ideal is our legacy, their sacrifice our inspiration\"\n</p></blockquote>\nThe sculptor <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_Turner_(sculptor)\" title=\"Alfred Turner (sculptor)\">Alfred Turner</a> was selected by Sir Herbert Baker to execute the Castor, Pollux and Horse sculpture and this led to his participation in the Cape Town and Pretoria War Memorials which used the same Castor and Pollux work. A plaster cast of \"Dioscuri\", the title of Turner's work, was shown in the forecourt of Burlington House in 1925 before the bronze was despatched to France the next year and unveiled on 10 October 1926 by the widow of General Botha. Two full-size bronze replicas went to South Africa in April 1928, one being erected in front of Capitol Buildings in Pretoria and the other in Cape Town. A bronze model was also placed in the Queen's Hall of the South African Houses of Parliament. 10 October was chosen as the unveiling date for the Delville Wood memorial as this was the date in 1899 when the first shot was fired in the South African War and the date in 1908 of the National Conference which brought the Union of South Africa into being.    In file TGA 8713.1.7 at <a href=\"/wiki/Tate_Britain\" title=\"Tate Britain\">Tate Britain</a> Archive there is a copy of the unveiling ceremony programme of Sunday 10 October 1926.

Those South Africans whose bodies were never identified and were listed as \"missing\" are inscribed on the Thiepval Memorial and other \"Memorials to the Missing\".\n</p><p>Behind the memorial is a museum. This is relatively new, with a stone laid on 7 June 1984 to commence building work and the building itself was opened on 11 November 1986, by Mr. P.W. Botha.   In the \"Gallery of Images\" at the end of this entry there is a photograph of the plaque which commemorates this opening.\n</p><p>The museum is hexagonal in structure, and inside are four large bronze panels on the outer walls. The first (to the left from the entrance) contains 16 friezes depicting various aspects of the 1914\u20131918 war, while the next is devoted to the particular actions at Delville Wood in the six days from 14 to 20 July 1916. The third bronze also deals with the 1914\u20131918 war, while the fourth covers the Second World War. Several of the inner walls contain large windows, and etched on the glass are the battle honours of the South African forces.\n</p><p>Both the memorial and the museum stand within the re-grown wood, and it is possible to walk along the same \"rides\" or tracks that used to exist before and during the war. In the spirit of the time, these were given street names by the soldiers who fought here. For example, there are a number of London street names, such as Rotten Row, while others such as Princes Street and Buchanan Street suggest a link with Edinburgh. A photograph of one such \"marker\" is included in the \"Gallery of Images\". Also included is a photograph of an obelisk which marks the battle Headquarters of the South Africans during the Delville Wood action. To the left rear of the museum is what is believed to be the last original tree to survive from before the war. This is marked by a plaque. The tree is a hornbeam and is situated near the  Prince's Street-Regent Street intersection, behind the Museum.\n</p><p>The Battle of Delville Wood was fought from 14 July to 3 September 1916.  General Douglas Haig, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force planned to secure the British right flank, while the centre advanced to capture the higher lying areas of High Wood in the centre of his line and the Delville Wood battle was part of this effort to secure that right flank.\n</p><p>The battle is of particular importance to South Africa, as it was the first major engagement entered into by the South African 1st Infantry Brigade on the Western Front. The casualties sustained by this Brigade were of catastrophic proportions, comparable to those encountered by Allied battalions on the first day of the Somme. On the Western Front, units were normally considered to be incapable of combat if their casualties had reached 30% and they were withdrawn once this level had been attained. The South African Brigade suffered losses of 80%, yet they managed to hold the Wood as ordered.\n</p><p>The first major objective was to capture <a href=\"/wiki/Longueval\" title=\"Longueval\">Longueval</a> from the Germans but before this could be attempted the Allies had to first clear <a href=\"/wiki/Tr%C3%B4nes_Wood\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tr\u00f4nes Wood\">Tr\u00f4nes Wood</a> as this posed a danger to their right flank as they approached Longueval from the south.  They also knew that they would have to take Delville Wood which bordered the north eastern edge of Longueval as unless this was done Longueval would be difficult to hold as the wood could be used by German artillery to shell Longueval and would also provide ideal cover for the Germans to assemble reinforcements for a counterattack.\n</p><p>To achieve this the 9th Scottish Division were to attack Longueval and the 18th Eastern Division under Major General Ivor Maxse on their right were to clear Tr\u00f4nes Wood. The Division Commander of the 9th Scottish Division, Major-General W.T. Furse ordered that the Longueval attack be led by the 26th Brigade.   The 8th Black Watch and the 10th Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders would lead,  the  9th Seaforth Highlanders would provide support and the 5th Cameron Highlanders would be in reserve. The 27th Brigade would follow, mopping up any bypassed German elements and providing support for the intense fighting which was expected once the leading battalions had entered the fortified town. Once the town had been secured, the 27th Brigade was to pass through the 26th to take Delville Wood. The 1st South African Brigade was to be kept in reserve.\n</p><p>The offensive started at 0325 on 14 July and on a 4 miles (6&#160;km) front but after fierce fighting it became clear to Major-General Furse that to secure Longueval, Delville Wood had to be taken first and as heavy losses were already being incurred he found that he had to commit the 1st South African Brigade to the fray.  Furse ordered Brigadier General <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Lukin\" title=\"Henry Lukin\">Henry Lukin</a> to deploy his 1st South African Brigade to advance and to capture Delville Wood.\n</p>\nThe battle raged for several days, often with hand-to-hand fighting and with both sides incurring heavy losses.  Throughout this period the German artillery pounded the wood from their positions in and around Longueval.  In his 1983 book Ian Uys \"Delville Wood\" he quotes a German officer's words <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"Delville Wood had disintegrated into a shattered wasteland of shattered trees, charred and burning stumps, craters thick with mud and blood, and corpses, corpses everywhere. In places they were piled four deep. Worst of all was the lowing of the wounded. It sounded like a cattle ring at the spring fair\"\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The final German forces were driven from the wood on 3 September 1916 although the South Africans had been withdrawn at an earlier date.   The Allies held the Wood until April 1918 when it was again re\u2013captured by German forces during the \"Spring Offensive\" and held by them until 28 August 1918. On this day the 38th (Welsh) Division captured the wood for the second and last time.

The Germans held on to Guillemont with great tenacity and after major attacks on 30 July and on 8 August, the village was finally taken on 3 September 1916. The 20th (Light) Division was instrumental in taking the village, one of the reasons for the choice of location,  although there is another 20th Light Division Memorial at Langemarck in Flanders.    The 16th (Irish) Division took nearby Ginchy on 9 September and there is a memorial to them near Guillemont. See below.\n</p><p>This memorial is on the linas which was the Division's target when they attacked on 3 September 1916. The road running north-south (which forms the cross-roads with the D20) was taken, as their third objective.\n</p><p>The 20th Division Memorial is in fact a replacement of the original memorial.   The original, a tapering stone obelisk, was unveiled on Sunday 4 June 1922, by Major-General Sir Cameron Shute (who had commanded the 59th Brigade of the 20th Division during the Guillemont actions). He was accompanied by the Mayor of Guillemont and a French Army representative (General Douchy), plus men who had fought with the Division at Guillemont. The original memorial was similar in appearance to the same Division's memorial in Flanders, which was unveiled five years after that at Guillemont. The Flanders memorial can still be seen today at Langemarck. The replacement memorial here at Guillemont was unveiled on 25 April 1995.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:452px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg/450px-Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"278\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg/675px-Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg/900px-Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1636\" data-file-height=\"1012\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The High Street of Guillemont 1916</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Memorial_to_the_16th_.28Irish.29_Division_at_Guillemont\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Memorial_to_the_16th_(Irish)_Division_at_Guillemont\">Memorial to the 16th (Irish) Division at Guillemont</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Memorial to the 16th (Irish) Division at Guillemont\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1000px;\">Memorial to the 16th (Irish) Division at Guillemont\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>This memorial takes the form of a Celtic cross, as did the Division's memorial at Wytschaete in Flanders.

Although already in his mid-thirties, he applied for a commission, and served initially in the Queens Westminsters, then the Grenadier Guards. He had applied to return to the frontline from a staff position shortly before he fought and died near here, and was obviously a brave and intelligent man. So the War, which is said to have touched most families in Britain, touched the lives of the Prime Minister, who lost his eldest son, and Raymond Asquith's own family. He left a wife and three children. From the cemetery there are good views across to the village church, and also Longueval church can be seen further in the distance.

Not far away and as the road drops down towards Lesboeufs is the Guards Cemetery. This is one of three with the name \"Guards Cemetery\" on the Western Front; the other two are at Combles and at Cuinchy. The cemetery is above the level of the road, with a bank and wall with entrance steps at the front.  The cemetery was originally a wartime one; and the early burials are mainly of Grenadier Guards who fell in the area on 25 September 1916, which was when the Guards Division took the nearby village of Lesboeufs. It was a small cemetery, with only 40 graves, but after the Armistice it was increased in size, and now contains 3,136 graves.

Go reverently and slow here./Yea, let your soul go down upon its knees/And with bowed head and heart abased strive hard/To grasp the future gain in this sore loss!/ For not one foot of this dank sod but drank/ Its surfeit of the blood of gallant men/Who, for their faith, their hope,\u2014for Life and Liberty/ Here made the sacrifice,\u2014here gave their lives/ And gave right willingly\u2014for you and me/From this vast altar\u2014pile the souls of men/Sped up to God in countless multitudes:/On this grim cratered ridge they gave their all/ And, giving, won/The peace of Heaven and Immortality/Our hearts go out to them in boundless gratitude/ If ours\u2014then God's: for His vast charity/All sees, all knows, all comprehends\u2014save bounds/He has repaid their sacrifice:\u2014and we\u2014?/God help us if we fail to pay our debt/n fullest full and unstintingly!\"\n</p></blockquote>These are words written by John Oxenham (1852\u20131941) as a Memorial to the 29th Division.\n<p>On the morning of 1 July 1916, as the Battle of the Somme began, the 29th Division was in action on the British Front Line in the location which is now Newfoundland Memorial Park. The division suffered a high number of casualties as a result of the success of the German defence in this sector. Many were cut down before they got anywhere near the German Front Line. Many were killed and wounded as they moved forward from the rear of the Front Line to follow on in the attack.\n</p><p>The 29th Division was formed in the United Kingdom between January and March 1915. In mid March it was sent to Egypt, from where it sailed to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign, landing at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915. After 8 months of fighting in the Gallipoli Peninsula the 29th Division left Gallipoli on 7 and 8 January 1916, as part of the secret, silent evacuation of British troops from this fighting front.  After a few weeks in Egypt the Division was ordered to move to the Western Front.\n</p><p>Passing through the Mediterranean port of Marseilles the 29th Division arrived in the rear of the Somme battle front from 15 to 29 March 1916. From this time the Division was put into the British Front in the area north of the Ancre River, near to the German-held village of Beaumont Hamel. For the following three months the battalions in the Division spent their time doing tours of trenches and training behind the lines to prepare for the large British offensive against the German position planned for the end of June.\n</p><p>Following a 7-day artillery bombardment of the German Front and Rear areas, the battalions of the 29th Division were in position in their Assembly Trenches in the early hours of Saturday 1 July. At 07.20 hours the huge <a href=\"/wiki/Hawthorn_Ridge_Redoubt\" title=\"Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt\">Hawthorn mine</a> was blown on the left of the division's position. The leading battalions in the attack left the British Front Line trench at 07.30 hours.\n</p><p>The Caribou memorial is one of 5 such memorials on the Western Front which commemorate the location where the 1st Battalion of the Newfoundland Regiment was in action. The caribou is the emblem of the Newfoundland Regiment. The sculptor of the bronze caribou was an Englishman called <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Basil_Gotto&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Basil Gotto (page does not exist)\">Basil Gotto</a>\n</p><p>The Caribou Memorial is situated on the high ground at the western side of the park, behind the British July 1916 Front Line, from where the 1st Battalion the Newfoundland Regiment began its advance on 1 July 1916.   The shrubs around the rocks are native plants from Newfoundland.\n</p><p>At the base of the Caribou there are three bronze panels listing 814 names for the Memorial to the Newfoundlanders Missing. These are Newfoundlanders who died on land and at sea in the First World War and who have no known graves.\n</p><p>The other Caribou memorials are at Geudecourt near Bapaume, Harelbeke near Courtrai, Masni\u00e8res near Cambrai and Monchy-le-Preux, near Arras.\n</p><p>There are three cemeteries in the memorial park, the Hawthorn Ridge Cemetery No. 2, Hunter's Cemetery and Y Ravine Cemetery.\n</p><p>The 51st (Highland) Division Memorial is also located in the park as it was on 13 November 1916 that the village of Beaumont Hamel was attacked and captured by the 51st (Highland) Division. This memorial was unveiled in 1924 and is a sculptured statue of a Scottish soldier in his kilt. He looks across the landscape over the Y Ravine and beyond the German Front Line where this successful action broke through.\n</p><p>The sculptor was George Harry Paulin, A.R.S.A., F.R.B.S. (1888\u20131962) and the titlle of the sculpture was \"Bronze Statuette \u2013 Memorial to 51st Highland Division at Beaumont Hamel 1924\". The model for the sculpture was a Company Sergeant Major in the Division.\n</p><p>The German regiment in the line at Beaumont Hamel was the 119 Reserve Infantry Regiment. The regiment had arrived in this sector in late September 1914, at which time it been engaged in a fight with the French Army. In August 1915 the French Army left this sector and the British Army took over. 119 Reserve Infantry Regiment, however, held this part of the German Front Line for 19 months as part of the 26th Reserve Division before the Battle of the Somme began on 1 July 1916.\n</p><p>The German Front Line in the part of the sector at Y Ravine was situated at the bottom of a gentle slope. The British Front Line was situated a few hundred metres away on the higher ground of the slope. In spite of the pounding of the German Line by the 7 day British artillery bombardment before the attack on 1 July, most of the German soldiers had survived the shelling by sheltering in their protective bunkers. German accounts state that their nerves were frayed by the end of the 7 days, but their casualties were relatively light. When the British artillery fire was lifted a few minutes before Zero Hour of 07.30, the German soldiers at the bottom of the hill near Y Ravine were able to get back quickly into their battered trenches and man their machine guns. The British battalions making their way down the slope towards them were plain to see and were fired on by the German defenders as they approached them.\n</p><p>The men of the Newfoundland Regiment moved forward at about 09.00 hours to follow on behind the leading battalion in the advance of 88th Brigade. Many of them were shot down trying to clamber over ground to cover the few yards from where they were in the rear of the British Front Line to start their advance down the hill.\n</p><p>The Danger Tree is a petrified tree and the only original tree in this location to survive the 1914\u20131918 fighting in this location.\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:43px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg/200px-Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg/300px-Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg/400px-Newfoundland_soldiers_1916.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"548\" data-file-height=\"531\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Newfoundland soldiers in St. John's Road support trench, 1 July 1916.

Correspondence in the file runs from 1921 to 1923.   We learn that Alan G Brace designed the memorial and the land on which it stood was purchased for 200 francs from a Madame Maison.  The memorial is in the form of a tall obelisk. There are bronze plaques on the front, the main one explaining that the memorial honours those men of the Royal Naval Division who fell at the Battle of the Ancre during the final phase of the Somme battles, on 13 and 14 November 1916.  When the Royal Naval Division Memorial Committee was seeking to put a monument in place in 1921, Lord Rothermere offered to provide funding, as his son, Lieutenant the Honourable Vere Harmsworth had been killed in the Battle of the Ancre.       He is buried in Ancre British Cemetery.  With the help of this funding, the memorial was unveiled on 12 November 1922. The position it stands on was No Man's Land during the battle, and at the time of the unveiling the land still bore the scars. The unveiling ceremony was performed by General Sir Hubert Gough along with Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, and around 200 officers and men of the Royal Naval Division who had fought there were also present.\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Piper.27s_Memorial_at_Longueval\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Piper's_Memorial_at_Longueval\">The Piper's Memorial at Longueval</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: The Piper&#039;s Memorial at Longueval\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1000px;\">The Piper's Memorial at Longueval\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>At Longueval there is a memorial to all the pipers who fell in the 1914\u201318 War.  It was inaugurated on 20 July 2002 and was sculptured by <a href=\"/wiki/Andy_DeComyn\" title=\"Andy DeComyn\">Andy DeComyn</a>.

Two pipers deserve mention, Pipers Laidlaw and Mackenzie.\n</p><p>On 25 September 1915, the first day of the Battle of Loos, Piper Laidlaw was awarded the Victoria Cross.   At a point where the men of the 7th Kings Own Scottish Borderers were in some confusion, crouched in their trenches when the gas clouds rolled back to engulf them, it was the sound of the pipes played by Piper Laidlaw, heard above the noise of the German guns, and falling shrapnel, which first steadied and then galvanised the line. Piper Laidlaw had jumped onto the parapet, torn of his mask, and begun to play his pipes!   It was as though the Scots had had a massive injection of adrenalin, and soon they poured over the top and massed towards the German Lines, as Laidlaw marched up and down playing \"The Standard on the Braes O\u2019Mar\" and the regimental march, the \"Blue Bonnets\". It was said that Laidlaw had every drone shot off his pipes, and the bag punctured in several places. We can read the exact citation in WO 98 at The National Archives. Loos is of course covered in the Artois section of this article so this is a slight digression.\n</p><p>During the same battle the 6th Battalion Kings Own Scottish Borderers were similarly inspired by the pipes of Pipe-Major Robert Mackenzie. Mackenzie was 60 years of age, and although wounded had continued to play his pipes. He died on 8 October 1915. We can see both Laidlaw and Mackenzie's medal index cards in WO 373 at The National Archives.\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:352px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg/350px-Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"284\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg/525px-Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg/700px-Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"648\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bagpiper_Battle_of_Bazentin_Ridge_14-07-1916_IWM_Q_4012.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Bagpiper in action at the Battle of Bazentin Ridge 14\u201317 July: A piper of the 7th Seaforth Highlanders leads four men of the 26th Brigade back from the trenches after the attack on Longueval.</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"The_McCrae.27s_Battalion_Memorial\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_McCrae's_Battalion_Memorial\">The McCrae's Battalion Memorial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;section=42\" title=\"Edit section: The McCrae&#039;s Battalion Memorial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1000px;\">16th (Service) Battalion, The Royal Scots\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A tribute to <a href=\"/wiki/McCrae%27s_Battalion\" title=\"McCrae&#39;s Battalion\">McCrae's Battalion</a>, the 16th <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Scots\" title=\"Royal Scots\">Royal Scots</a>, is to be found at <a href=\"/wiki/Contalmaison\" title=\"Contalmaison\">Contalmaison</a> where they fought on the opening day of the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme\" title=\"Battle of the Somme\">Battle of the Somme</a>.
