class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Following the various declarations of war which were to lead to the <a href=\"/wiki/First_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First World War\">First World War</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/German_Empire\" title=\"German Empire\">German Army</a> opened the war on her western front by first invading <a href=\"/wiki/Luxembourg\" title=\"Luxembourg\">Luxembourg</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Belgium\" title=\"Belgium\">Belgium</a> and then gaining military control of important industrial regions in <a href=\"/wiki/France\" title=\"France\">France</a>. The German Army forced the Allied armies to retreat until the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Battle_of_the_Marne\" title=\"First Battle of the Marne\">Battle of the Marne</a> was fought, when the tide turned and the German Army was forced to retreat northwards. They did so to the river <a href=\"/wiki/Aisne\" title=\"Aisne\">Aisne</a>, dug in on the high ground there, and fought the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Battle_of_the_Aisne\" title=\"First Battle of the Aisne\">First Battle of the Aisne</a>. This encounter was inconclusive and what historians call the <a href=\"/wiki/Race_to_the_sea\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Race to the sea\">race to the sea</a> followed, during which neither side was able to achieve a breakthrough as they edged to the north and at the conclusion both sides were to dig in along a meandering line of fortified <a href=\"/wiki/Trench_warfare\" title=\"Trench warfare\">trenches</a>, stretching from the <a href=\"/wiki/North_Sea\" title=\"North Sea\">North Sea</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/Switzerland\" title=\"Switzerland\">Swiss</a> frontier with France. This line, the Western Front, remained essentially unchanged for most of the war. A war of movement was over and a type of warfare that no side had planned for was to take its place: a static war of attrition with both sides entrenched on either side of the front line.\n</p><p>Between 1915 and 1917, there were several major offensives along this <a href=\"/wiki/Front_(military)\" title=\"Front (military)\">front</a>. The attacks employed massive <a href=\"/wiki/Artillery\" title=\"Artillery\">artillery</a> bombardments and massed <a href=\"/wiki/Infantry\" title=\"Infantry\">infantry</a> advances. However a combination of entrenchments, <a href=\"/wiki/Machine_gun\" title=\"Machine gun\">machine gun</a> nests, <a href=\"/wiki/Barbed_wire\" title=\"Barbed wire\">barbed wire</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Artillery\" title=\"Artillery\">artillery</a> repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders and as a result, no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun\" title=\"Battle of Verdun\">Battle of Verdun</a> with a combined 700,000 dead, the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme\" title=\"Battle of the Somme\">Battle of the Somme</a> with more than a million casualties, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Passchendaele\" title=\"Battle of Passchendaele\">Battle of Passchendaele</a> or \"Third Ypres\", which saw roughly 600,000 casualties.\n</p><p>Both sides tried to break the deadlock by introducing <a href=\"/wiki/Technology_during_World_War_I\" title=\"Technology during World War I\">new military technology</a>, including <a href=\"/wiki/Poison_gas_in_World_War_I\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Poison gas in World War I\">poison gas</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Aircraft\" title=\"Aircraft\">aircraft</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Tank\" title=\"Tank\">tanks</a> but it was improved tactics that eventually restored some degree of mobility to the conflict. The German <a href=\"/wiki/Spring_Offensive\" title=\"Spring Offensive\">Spring Offensive</a> of 1918 was made possible by the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk\" title=\"Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> that marked the end of the conflict on the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)\" title=\"Eastern Front (World War I)\">Eastern Front</a>. Using the recently introduced <a href=\"/wiki/Infiltration_tactics\" title=\"Infiltration tactics\">infiltration tactics</a>, the German armies advanced nearly 60 miles (97 kilometres) to the west, which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and they very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough.\n</p><p>The Germans could not in the end break the Allied line and now the numerical advantage given the Allies by the volume of soldiers arriving from the United States of America fuelled an inexorable advance by the <a href=\"/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I\" title=\"Allies of World War I\">Allied</a> armies during the second half of 1918. The German Army commanders finally realised that defeat was inevitable, and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice.

It was the New Zealanders' last major action in the war and to this day the town of Le Quesnoy continues to mark the important role that the country played in its history. Streets are named after New Zealand places, there is the New Zealand memorial, and a primary school bears the name of a New Zealand soldier.\n<p>Le Quesnoy was occupied by the German Army for most of the First World War but on 4 November 1918, it was attacked by men of the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Zealand_Rifle_Brigade\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New Zealand Rifle Brigade\">New Zealand Rifle Brigade</a>, who scaled the high walls of the outer ramparts and seized the German Commander and his garrison of over 1,000 men.

On 21 August, the British Army launched the first of a number of attacks on the Western Front in the sectors under its control: Amiens, Albert, Arras and Bapaume. The Allied troops advanced up to the <a href=\"/wiki/Hindenburg_Line\" title=\"Hindenburg Line\">Hindenburg Line</a> which they breached at Saint-Quentin Canal on 5 October and at Le Nord Canal three days later. Lille and Douai were liberated on 17 October, and the British Army pressed on towards the Belgian border while the New Zealand Division was given the job of liberating Le Quesnoy.\nThe 18th century Vauban fortifications protecting the town encouraged the Germans garrisoned there to hold out against the Allied advance; however the precision of the New Zealand artillery disrupted the organization of the German defence. In the general confusion Kiwi soldiers managed to set up a ladder on the south side of the town and enter through a sluice gate. Led by Lieutenant <a href=\"/wiki/Leslie_Averill\" title=\"Leslie Averill\">Leslie Averill</a>, the New Zealanders completely surprised the Germans who, after much fighting in the streets, surrendered the town on the evening of 4 November.

The narrowness of \"<a href=\"/wiki/No_man%27s_land\" title=\"No man&#39;s land\">No man's land</a>\" in this sector of the front, just a few dozen metres, created a strange proximity between the warring parties. Small-scale, but bloody, attacks carried out in the vicinity of Ypres and French Flanders during the month of December 1914 gave way, in some sectors of the front, to spontaneous truces, in particular for the recovery of the wounded and dead lying in the mud of no man's land. On 24 December 1914, some German soldiers erected Christmas trees, complete with candles and paper lanterns, on the parapets of various first line trenches.   Christmas hymns were soon being sung on both sides and soldiers even called out to each other across the front. Similar but much larger events took place on Christmas Day. In some places the warring sides buried their dead at the same time, and some even exchanged little presents, and home addresses, while in other sectors the fighting continued to rage, mostly due to sniper activity. In the British sector the truce was observed by many units at Houplines, Bois-Grenier, Fromelles, Neuve-Chapelle and Richebourg-l'Avou\u00e9. The small village of Frelinghien is situated on the Franco-Belgian frontier just to the north east of Armentieres and a memorial to the Christmas Truce is situated in Frelinghien Park opposite their football ground. There were a number of unofficial truces held along the line that day though the commands of both sides issued orders against fraternisation.\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Sector_1:_Fromelles_.28Fleurbaix.29.2C_Aubers.2C_Neuve_Chapelle_and_Festubert\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sector_1:_Fromelles_(Fleurbaix),_Aubers,_Neuve_Chapelle_and_Festubert\">Sector 1: Fromelles (Fleurbaix), Aubers, Neuve Chapelle and Festubert</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Sector 1: Fromelles (Fleurbaix), Aubers, Neuve Chapelle and Festubert\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>South from Armenti\u00e8res was the front line dominated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Aubers_Ridge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aubers Ridge\">Aubers Ridge</a>.

Corlett based his sculpture on 3101 Sergeant Simon Fraser of the 57th Battalion, a 40-year-old farmer from Victoria who had rescued many men from the battlefield.

A further approximately 400 men were taken prisoner. To illustrate the extent of the losses the 60th Battalion Victoria Regiment started the battle with 887 men and, when the fighting was over, had just 1 officer and 106 men left. It is also estimated that the British Army had 1,547 men killed or wounded and that the German Army lost 1,500 soldiers killed or wounded in the Battle of Fromelles.\n</p><p>The attack at Fromelles was planned as a diversionary attack to the north of the battle raging on the Somme. Fromelles had already seen action in 1915 when British efforts to take Aubers Ridge had been repulsed with heavy losses. The Fromelles attack in 1916 saw the baptism of the Australian Imperial Force to fighting on the Western Front as the units then down on the Somme had yet to be committed to action. As was to be the case at the Somme, the provisional artillery bombardment at Fromelles did not cut the German barbed wire as hoped would be the case, and the German machine guns, with a clear view of the attackers, were able to wreak havoc once the infantry launched their attack.\n</p>\nOne hundred metres from Memorial Park and its tribute to the courage of the Australian Cobber lies the VC Corner Australian Cemetery which was established after the Armistice of 1918.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Neuve-Chapelle_Indian_Memorial\" title=\"Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial\">Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial</a> at Richebourg, near  Neuve Chapelle, commemorates over 4,700 Indian soldiers and labourers who lost their lives on the Western Front during the First World War and have no known graves. It was designed by <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Herbert_Baker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Herbert Baker\">Sir Herbert Baker</a>. The location of the memorial was specially chosen as it was at Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 that the Indian Corps fought its first major action as a single unit. The memorial takes the form of a sanctuary enclosed within a circular wall after the manner of the enclosing railings of early Indian shrines. The column in the enclosure's foreground stands almost 15 feet (4.6&#160;m) high and was inspired by the famous inscribed columns erected by the Emperor Ashkora throughout India in the 3rd century BC. The column is surmounted with a Lotus capital, the Imperial British Crown, and the Star of India. Two tigers are carved on either side of the column guarding the temple of the dead. On the lower part of the column the words \u2018God is One, He is the Victory\u2019 are inscribed in English, with similar texts in Arabic, Hindi, and Gurmukhi. The tigers are the work of the sculptor <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Wheeler_(sculptor)\" title=\"Charles Wheeler (sculptor)\">Charles Wheeler</a>. The memorial was unveiled by the Earl of Birkenhead on 7 October 1927. <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Birkenhead\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lord Birkenhead\">Lord Birkenhead</a>, then Secretary of State for India, had served as a staff officer with the Indian Corps during the war. The ceremony was also attended by the Maharaja of Karputhala, Marshal <a href=\"/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch\" title=\"Ferdinand Foch\">Ferdinand Foch</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling\" title=\"Rudyard Kipling\">Rudyard Kipling</a>, and a large contingent of Indian veterans. An inscription on the wall reads <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"To the honour of the army of India which fought in France and Belgium, 1914-1918, and in perpetual remembrance of those of their dead whose names are here recorded and those who have no known grave.\"\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Indian Army made a huge contribution to the Great War. Their involvement on the Western Front was limited in the main to the years 1914 and 1915 and after this, in recognition of the difficulties for Indians to live and operate in the grim climatic conditions of Northern Europe, they were moved to the Egyptian Theatre of War and other warmer places. India, in the context of the 1914-1918 war, was pre-partition India; the Indian Sub-Continent in 1914 would have embraced present day India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Nepal and Bangladesh. Only days after the British government had declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade of the Indian Army were ordered to mobilise and prepare for overseas service. Units began arriving in France in September 1914, and by late October they were involved in heavy fighting on the <a href=\"/wiki/Messines_Ridge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Messines Ridge\">Messines Ridge</a> in Belgium. It was at <a href=\"/wiki/Mesen\" title=\"Mesen\">Messines</a> on 31 October 1914 that <a href=\"/wiki/Khudadad_Khan\" title=\"Khudadad Khan\">Khudadad Khan</a> performed the act of gallantry for which he was later awarded the <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_Cross\" title=\"Victoria Cross\">Victoria Cross</a>, becoming the first Indian born soldier to be so honoured. The <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Corps\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indian Corps\">Indian Corps</a>, which was composed of the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) divisions, went on to fight in some of the bloodiest battles of the first year of the war, and at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle which ran from 10 to 13 March 1915. Indian soldiers made up half of the attacking force and, despite suffering very heavy casualties, succeeded in capturing important sections of the German line. The officers and men of the Corps further distinguished themselves at St. Julien in the Ypres Salient in April 1915, at Aubers Ridge and Festubert in May of that year, and at Loos in September 1915, before they were redeployed to the Middle East in December. The Indian Cavalry Corps remained on the Western Front until the spring of 1918 and Indian labour companies, which had begun arriving in France in 1917, performed vital and often dangerous logistical work behind the lines until after the Armistice. India sent over 140,000 men to the Western Front \u2013 90,000 serving in the infantry and cavalry and as many as 50,000 non-combatant labourers. They hailed from the length and breadth of British India: from the Punjab, Garwahl, the Frontiers, Bengal, Nepal, Madras, and Burma, and represented an extremely diverse range of religious, linguistic, and ethnic cultures. The officer corps was composed mostly of men of European descent. Of the combatants, over 8,550 were killed and as many as 50,000 more were wounded. Almost 5,000 of the dead have no known grave and are commemorated both on the Menin Gate at Ypres and here at Neuve Chapelle.\n</p>\nIn 1964, a Special Bronze Panel was added to this memorial with the names of 210 servicemen who died during the 1914-1918 war, whose graves at Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery, Germany, had become unmaintainable. Although this plaque still exists, the graves were reinstated in 2005. This site also contains the Neuve-Chapelle 1939-1945 Cremation Memorial. In 1964, the remains of 8 Indian soldiers (including 2 unidentified) were exhumed from Sarrebourg French Military Cemetery Extension and cremated. The names of the 6 identified soldiers are engraved on panels at the Neuve Chapelle Memorial along with the following inscription <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"1939 -  In honour of these soldiers who died in captivity in North-West Europe and whose mortal remains were committed to fire\"\n</p></blockquote>\nFile WO 32/5878 held at The National Archives in <a href=\"/wiki/Kew\" title=\"Kew\">Kew</a> provides further background information on the memorial. This file also covers the memorials to the Indian Army which it was proposed be erected in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Gallipoli and East Africa. The file notes that amongst those remembered at Neuve Chapelle is the Victoria Cross winner, Rifleman Gobar Sing Negi. One interesting point to arise from the National Archive file is a letter from Army Headquarters in Simla dated 26 June 1919. This includes the following  <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\" I may mention that we propose to erect war memorials in villages which have given most men to the Army. These will be selected by Local Governments, on the advice of their local Recruiting Boards, based on the statistics in their possession. In the Punjab, about 130 villages will be so honoured. In other Provinces the number will be less, but in the United Provinces and the N.W.Frontier Province it will be fairly big\"\n</p></blockquote> \n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aubers_Ridge_and_Festubert\">Aubers Ridge and Festubert</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Aubers Ridge and Festubert\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It was on 24 March 1915, several days after the failed offensive at Neuve-Chapelle, that <a href=\"/wiki/General_Joffre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"General Joffre\">General Joffre</a> made an official request for the British Army to take part in a huge offensive he was planning in Artois at the beginning of May.

In three successive waves, ten divisions overwhelmed the two Portuguese divisions which were incomplete, badly organized, and taken by surprise as they were in the process of being relieved. Portuguese losses amounted to 7,500 men on that day. On  the next day, along with the Scottish, the survivors defended La Couture near B\u00e9thune before eventually being forced to retreat. The Germans took Estaires, Armenti\u00e8res and Bailleul but failed to take B\u00e9thune and Hazebrouck. Operation Georgette was called off on 29 April 1918. The Portuguese had suffered heavy casualties in this action and the bodies of many of the men killed were beyond identification. 239 of the graves at Richebourg are marked with the Portuguese word <i>Desconhecido</i> (\"unknown\"). The site of the cemetery/memorial takes up both sides of the road and on one side there is a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima and on the other side, behind an entrance and a wrought-iron gate, is the Portuguese National Cemetery, the final resting place of 1,831 soldiers.\n<p>In 1916, the young Portuguese Republic had entered the war on the side of the Allies.

Joffre\u2019s plans involved a two-pronged attack. The French Army was to launch a major attack in the Champagne area and a Franco-Commonwealth attack was planned on a 32 kilometres (20&#160;mi) line to the north of Arras. Of this 32-kilometre stretch the British were allocated a 10 kilometres (6.2&#160;mi) section running from Givenchy just north of the La Bass\u00e9e Canal and the industrial town of Bully-Grenay in front of Lens; the Gohelle Battlefields.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PB_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PB-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One reason for Haig and French's lack of enthusiasm was that they did not feel that they had fully absorbed the lessons of Second Ypres, Festubert, Neuve Chapelle and Aubers Ridge, the earlier offensives of 1915 and the doomed Gallipoli campaign had diverted precious men and munitions from the Western Front. However, their major concern was that the levels of ammunition available would not support a major offensive as the initial advances by the infantry would have to be supported by a high degree of artillery fire. The French demand was however met and the British Army allocated the 10 kilometre sector mentioned earlier. At this battle the British intended to make their first use of gas and the offensive would give Kitchener\u2019s \"New Army\" a chance to show their mettle.\n</p><p>In fact the offensive failed both in the <a href=\"/wiki/Champagne\" title=\"Champagne\">Champagne</a> and at <a href=\"/wiki/Loos-en-Gohelle\" title=\"Loos-en-Gohelle\">Loos</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Loos_Memorial\" title=\"Loos Memorial\">Loos Memorial</a> at Loos-en-Gohelle commemorates the 20,605 British officers and men who were killed from 25 September 1915 to the end of the war in November 1918 in the little sector between the river <a href=\"/wiki/Leie\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leie\">Lys</a> in French Flanders and the village of Grenay, near Lens, in Artois.

However, the gains, won at such a horrific loss of life, had to be capitalized on quickly and the reserves (mostly inexperienced New Army Divisions) were brought into action too slowly. The Germans counter-attacked and by 27 September the offensive was breaking down and the Germans had retaken both the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8.

It was here in April 1918 that the 55th (West Lancashire) Division defended the village against three German Divisions. In April 1918, the <a href=\"/wiki/6th_Army_(German_Empire)\" title=\"6th Army (German Empire)\">German 6th Army</a> launched the second part of <a href=\"/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff\" title=\"Erich Ludendorff\">General Ludendorff</a>\u2019s strategic plan to win the war before the weight of the rapidly expanding American Army could be brought fully into action. Originally named George, it was later renamed Georgette. The encounter that followed is known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)\" title=\"Battle of the Lys (1918)\">Battle of the Lys</a>. The German attack commenced on 9 April 1918 and the 55th (West Lancashire) Division in front of Givenchy and the 2nd Portuguese Division at Neuve Chapelle took the blunt of the attack.\n<p>Because this sector of the front had been in British hands for years, the various zones of combat forming the 1918 styled defence system was far better prepared than that of Gough\u2019s Fifth Army (who had taken over an unprepared position from the French). However, the Portuguese were suspected to be capable of offering only a weak resistance and the British 40th Division (in front of Fromelles) and 34th Division at Armenti\u00e8res had both been badly mauled in Operation Michael on the Somme only weeks beforehand.\n</p><p>The Lancashire Territorials of the 55th Division found themselves confronted by the 4th Ersatz, 43rd Reserve and 18th Reserve Infantry Divisions on their own front while their immediate left flank was rapidly pushed in by the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division following the faster than anticipated collapse of the Portuguese 2nd Division. As the Germans pushed in and around them the Lancashire men fell back to their line of resistance along the road to Windy Corner, mounted counterattacks, and remained. The front by the following day looped around the top of Festubert and then turned north-west towards Locon. On 11 April, a second attempt was made to break the 55th Division but apart from a few hundred metres on its far left the assault by four German Divisions was repulsed.  Having made greater gains to the north around Merville and the Belgian border, the Germans began to concentrate their efforts in those areas. Ultimately their offensive would fail. The defenders of Givenchy had not ceded a metre.\n</p>\nThe memorial itself is a 30 feet (9.1&#160;m)-high granite cross standing in a small park near Givenchy-l\u00e8s-la-Bass\u00e9e Communal Cemetery.

The 58e Division d\u2019Infanterie were a Reserve Infantry Division and arrived in Cuinchy on 16 October 1914. The Germans had occupied a position along the Vermelles \u2014 Violaines Road opposite them. On the northern side of the canal was the British II Corps (later the Indian Corps). A constant run of battles was taking place trying to secure La Bass\u00e9e and Givenchy with the British and French fighting side by side for much of the time. In these early months of the war the line was still fluid without real trenches and the French managed to advance their line by 700 metres (770&#160;yd). Over the next few days the Germans launched numerous counter-attacks; despite heavy losses the French held the line. As a result of these constant assaults in both directions, the first trenches were constructed in the area, though the word is used loosely because with a very high water table the trenches tended to be built up rather than dug down. On 12 November 1914 the Division received a citation <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"Cette division a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re ligne, a gagn\u00e9 du terrain et n\u2019en a jamais perdu, malgr\u00e9 de fortes pertes et des attaques violentes de l\u2019ennemi\"\n</p></blockquote>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>(\"This division has always been in the front line, has gained ground and never lost, despite heavy losses and violent attacks by the enemy.\")\n</p></blockquote>\nThe 58th Infantry remained responsible for this sector of the line throughout the winter of 1914/1915.

Once the front line had stabilised, Arras was left at the centre of a salient and open to constant artillery bombardment from the high ground to the north and south. The French were always sought to redress this situation and after an offensive in 1914 <a href=\"/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch\" title=\"Ferdinand Foch\">Foch</a> launched the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Artois\" title=\"Second Battle of Artois\">Second Battle of Artois</a> from 9 May to 19 June 1915.

Two spurs of particularly high ground afford magnificent views in all directions. These spurs lie in a north-west to south-east direction and are located north-west of the city of Arras. They are known as the Loretto Heights (Notre Dame de Lorette) and the Vimy ridge.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notre_Dame_de_Lorette_and_the_Second_Battle_of_Artois_from_9_May_to_18_June_1915\">Notre Dame de Lorette and the Second Battle of Artois from 9 May to 18 June 1915</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Notre Dame de Lorette and the Second Battle of Artois from 9 May to 18 June 1915\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:950px;\">Notre Dame de Lorette and the Second Battle of Artois from 9 May to 18 June 1915\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Preparations for the French offensive on Notre Dame de Lorette and Vimy Ridge began on 3 May 1915 with a sustained artillery bombardment which lasted over the following six days and nights. Then at 10 a.m. on 9 May, the 33rd Army Corps under the command of General <a href=\"/wiki/Philippe_P%C3%A9tain\" title=\"Philippe P\u00e9tain\">Philippe P\u00e9tain</a> attacked a 6 kilometres (3.7&#160;mi) section of the German front. In just a few hours the attackers succeeded in overwhelming the German trenches and advancing 3 kilometres (1.9&#160;mi) towards Vimy Ridge; however the reserves were too far back from the front to be able to reach the front lines quickly enough to capitalize on the breakthrough, and the French artillery was unable to provide cover for its foremost troops. The Germans soon reorganized and launched a counter-attack. Fighting on the heights of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette continued for a week with savage encounters but in the end the success of the French offensive was limited: the villages of Carency and Ablain-Saint-Nazaire were taken but Vimy Ridge, and thus the control of the coal basin beyond it, remained in German hands. The human cost of this great offensive, which resulted in no major strategic gain, was enormous for the French Army: it suffered 102,000 casualties, double the losses suffered by the Germans during all the French and British attacks between Arras and Festubert.\n<p>Almost 40,000 men who were killed in the First World War are honoured in the cemetery at Notre Dame de Lorette (<b>Cimeti\u00e8re militaire Notre-Dame-de-Lorette</b> or the <b>N\u00e9cropole nationale de Notre-Dame-de-Lorette</b>). This French military cemetery covers 13 hectares (1,300&#160;a). Almost 20,000 of the soldiers are buried in individual graves while the remains of 19,998 unidentified casualties were laid to rest in seven <a href=\"/wiki/Ossuary\" title=\"Ossuary\">ossuaries</a> within the cemetery grounds. These seven ossuaries contain the remains of French servicemen brought into the cemetery from the Artois battlefields including single burials, burials in civilian cemeteries and small military burial sites within a radius of some 30 miles (48&#160;km) of Ablain St. Nazaire. It was not possible to identify these remains. The ossuaries are named after French military commanders.\n</p><p>Ossuaries Number 1 - 5 are located at the western end of the cemetery.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Ossuary No. 1 named <i>Fayolle</i> contains 1,006 bodies</li>\n<li>Ossuary No. 2 named <i>Franchet d'Esperey</i> contains 1,892 bodies</li>\n<li>Ossuary No. 3 named <i>Joffre</i> contains 1,874 bodies</li>\n<li>Ossuary No. 4 named <i>Lyautey</i> contains 957 bodies</li>\n<li>Ossuary No. 5 named <i>P\u00e9tain</i> contains 1,029 bodies</li></ul>\n<p>There are another two ossuaries on the eastern side of the Lantern Tower.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Ossuary No. 6 named <i>Foch</i> contains 4,563 bodies</li>\n<li>Ossuary No. 7 named <i>Barbot</i> contains 5,649 bodies</li></ul>\n<p>At the base of the Lantern Tower an eighth ossuary contains the remains of another 6,000 soldiers.\n</p><p>There is a plot at the western end of the cemetery for Muslim soldiers, and each grave has a headstone instead of a cross with each headstone facing east. North Africans from the 1st Moroccan Division fought in this area during the battles of 1915 for the high ground of Lorette and the ridge at Vimy.\n</p><p>General Ernest Barbot is also buried in the cemetery. He was Commander of the French 77th Mountain Division and was killed on the Artois battlefield at Souchez on 10 May 1915. This division had fought in the 1914 battles in the Alsace mountains and had been moved to Artois by early 1915. Barbot's grave marker was originally one created by his soldiers as a cross made out of shell casings retrieved from the battlefield but that cross was stolen in 1952 and was replaced with the same simple cross that marks the final resting place of so many of General Barbot's comrades in arms.\n</p><p>After dark the Lantern Tower sends a beacon of light across the surrounding countryside.  It revolves five times each minute and it is reckoned that its ray of light covers a distance of about 45 miles (72&#160;km). This Lantern Tower was designed by <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_Cordonnier\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Louis Cordonnier\">Louis Cordonnier</a> and the first stone was laid on 19 June 1921 by Marshal <a href=\"/wiki/Philippe_P%C3%A9tain\" title=\"Philippe P\u00e9tain\">Philippe P\u00e9tain</a>. The inauguration ceremony was held on 2 August 1925. The tower is 150 feet (46&#160;m) high with 200 steps. Until recently the tower was open to the public to climb to the stop, but now the viewing area at the top has been closed for security reasons. The base of the tower is a square with each side being 35 feet (11&#160;m) long. At the base of the tower there is an ossuary-crypt containing the remains of 6,000 soldiers and a Chapel of Rest. There are 32 coffins located in the Chapel of Rest in four groups of 8 coffins. Three coffins contain the remains of an unknown soldier from the Second World War (laid to rest here in July 1950), a soldier from the North African war (laid to rest here in October 1977), and the remains of a soldier from the Indochina war (laid to rest here in June 1980). A reliquary (a container for relics) was placed in the tower in April 1955, which contains soil and ashes from the concentration camps of World War II. Since 1920 Notre Dame de Lorette has been manned by a Voluntary Guard of Honour which welcomes visitors to the site and rekindles the Eternal Flame every Sunday. The Basilica which stands in the cemetery was constructed in the Byzantine style and is 46 metres (50&#160;yd) long and 14 metres (15&#160;yd) wide. The transept is 30 metres (33&#160;yd) long. The construction of the Basilica was inspired by Monseigneur Eugene Julien, Bishop of Arras, who wanted it dedicated to all those who had fallen in this part of France. The interior of the Basilica, a vast and colourful mosaic, contains on its walls thousands of memorial plaques to both units and individuals who lost their lives for France. Six of the windows were donated by Britain as thanks for all the land given by France for British Cemeteries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:402px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lorette13.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Lorette13.JPG/400px-Lorette13.JPG\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Lorette13.JPG/600px-Lorette13.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Lorette13.JPG/800px-Lorette13.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3072\" data-file-height=\"2048\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lorette13.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Graves at Notre Dame de Lorette</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Images_Notre_Dame_de_Lorette\">Images Notre Dame de Lorette</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Images Notre Dame de Lorette\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:65px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg/200px-Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg/300px-Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg/400px-Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_2.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3648\" data-file-height=\"2736\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>The Byzantine Basilica at Notre Dame de Lorette\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg/187px-Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg\" width=\"187\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg/281px-Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg/375px-Ablain-Saint-Nazaire_-_Notre-Dame_de_Lorette_3.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2736\" data-file-height=\"3648\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>The Lantern Tower which sends a beam of light over the surrounding countryside.\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lorette14.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Lorette14.JPG/166px-Lorette14.JPG\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Lorette14.JPG/250px-Lorette14.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Lorette14.JPG/333px-Lorette14.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"2048\" data-file-height=\"3072\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Interior view of the Basilica\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:73.5px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lorette20.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Lorette20.JPG/200px-Lorette20.JPG\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Lorette20.JPG/300px-Lorette20.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Lorette20.JPG/400px-Lorette20.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3072\" data-file-height=\"2048\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>The eternel flame at Notre Dame de Lorette.

memorial itself<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> is the centrepiece of the 100-hectare (250-acre) preserved battlefield park. The memorial took <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Seymour_Allward\" title=\"Walter Seymour Allward\">Walter Seymour Allward</a> eleven years to build. <a href=\"/wiki/King_Edward_VIII\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"King Edward VIII\">King Edward VIII</a> unveiled the memorial on 26 July 1936, in the presence of the <a href=\"/wiki/President_of_France\" title=\"President of France\">French President</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Albert_Lebrun\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Albert Lebrun\">Albert Lebrun</a>, together with 50,000 or more Canadian and French veterans, and their families. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_II\" title=\"Elizabeth II\">Elizabeth II</a> rededicated the memorial on 9 April 2007 during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle.\n<p>Allward chose the highest point on the Vimy Ridge, Hill 145, as the most suitable location for the memorial. The front wall of the monument is 7.3 metres (24&#160;ft) high and is meant to represent an \"impenetrable wall of defence\". There is a group of figures at each end of this wall next to the base of the steps. One group is entitled \"Breaking of the Sword\" and is located at the southern corner of this wall and at the northern corner is the composition entitled \"Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless\". Collectively these two groups are the \"Defenders\" and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, this to symbolize peace. \"Breaking of the Sword\" depicts three young men, one of whom is crouching and in the act of breaking his sword, this representing the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. The original idea was for one figure to be shown crushing a German helmet with his foot but Allward later decided not to use this because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In \"Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless\", one man representing Canada stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, crouch and kneel around him. The standing man represents Canada\u2019s sympathy for the weak and oppressed; the helpless.\n</p><p>At the top of this front wall stands the figure of a cloaked young female, her head bowed and her eyes cast down. Her chin rests in one hand. Below her and at ground level is a sarcophagus which bears a <a href=\"/wiki/Brodie_helmet\" title=\"Brodie helmet\">Brodie helmet</a>, a sword and is draped in laurel branches. This figure is known as \"Canada Bereft\" or \"Mother Canada\". The young nation of Canada mourns her dead. The statue was carved by the Italian sculptor Luigi Rigamonti. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the <i><span lang=\"la\" title=\"Latin language text\"><a href=\"/wiki/Mater_Dolorosa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mater Dolorosa\">Mater Dolorosa</a></span></i> and presented in a similar style to that of <a href=\"/wiki/Michelangelo\" title=\"Michelangelo\">Michelangelo</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)\" title=\"Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)\">Piet\u00e0</a>, faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved \"Canada Bereft\" from a single 30&#160;tonne block of stone.  The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The twin pylons rise to a height 30&#160;metres above the memorial's stone platform. The twin white pylons, one bearing the <a href=\"/wiki/Maple_leaf\" title=\"Maple leaf\">maple leaf</a> for Canada and the other the <a href=\"/wiki/Fleur-de-lys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fleur-de-lys\">fleur-de-lys</a> for France, symbolize the unity and sacrifice of both countries. At the top of the two pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the \"Chorus\". The most senior figures represent \"Justice\" and \"Peace\". \"Peace\" stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. These two works are in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of \"Truth\" and \"Justice\", located outside the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada\" title=\"Supreme Court of Canada\">Supreme Court of Canada</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Ottawa\" title=\"Ottawa\">Ottawa</a>. The figures of \"Hope\", \"Charity\", \"Honour\" and \"Faith\" are located below \"Justice\" and \"Peace\" on the eastern side, with \"Truth\" and \"Knowledge\" on the western side.   Around these figures are the shields of Canada, Britain and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments and a dedicatory inscription to Canada's war dead, in both French and English, also appear on the monument. At the base of the monument and between the two pylons is the \"Spirit of Sacrifice\" Here a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem \"<a href=\"/wiki/In_Flanders_Fields\" title=\"In Flanders Fields\">In Flanders Fields</a>\" by <a href=\"/wiki/John_McCrae\" title=\"John McCrae\">John McCrae</a>, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.\n</p><p>The \"Mourning Parents\", one male and one female figure, are reclining on either side of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are thought to be based on the four statues by Michelangelo on the <a href=\"/wiki/Basilica_of_San_Lorenzo,_Florence#Cappelle_Medicee\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence\">Medici Tomb</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Florence\" title=\"Florence\">Florence</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Italy\" title=\"Italy\">Italy</a>. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France, and whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format. Allward sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Grierson_Combe\" title=\"Robert Grierson Combe\">Robert Grierson Combe</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_Hobson\" title=\"Frederick Hobson\">Frederick Hobson</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/William_Johnstone_Milne\" title=\"William Johnstone Milne\">William Johnstone Milne</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Spall\" title=\"Robert Spall\">Robert Spall</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-VCs_38-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-VCs-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Images_of_the_Vimy_Memorial\">Images of the Vimy Memorial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: Images of the Vimy Memorial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:80.5px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg/200px-Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"119\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg/300px-Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg/400px-Vimy_Memorial_-_Design_model.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"750\" data-file-height=\"446\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>The winning submission to the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission competition was Walter Seymour Allward's winning maquette.\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:64px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg/200px-Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"152\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg/300px-Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg/400px-Vimy_Memorial_-_carving_of_names.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"750\" data-file-height=\"571\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Masons shown carving the names on the Vimy Memorial\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px\"><div style=\"width: 235px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg/181px-Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg/272px-Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg/363px-Vimy_Memorial_-_Allward_beside_uncarved_statue.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"826\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Walter Seymour Allward himself shown with blocks ready for carving\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Caberet_Rouge_British_Cemetery\">Caberet Rouge British Cemetery</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Caberet Rouge British Cemetery\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:950px;\">Caberet Rouge British Cemetery\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The cemetery, near Souchez, is one of the largest British cemeteries on the Western Front and was begun as a cemetery in 1916. After the armistice it received bodies from small cemeteries and individual graves on the battlefields of Arras and other points in the Artois area. It holds: 6,800 British, 750 Canadian, more than 100 Australian, over 40 South African and 15 Indian graves. The majority are unidentified. The cemetery and the massive domed shelter at the entrance were designed by Frank Higginson. Higginson was a former Canadian Army officer who worked as an architect for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in the 1920s and later acted as Secretary to the Commission; a bronze plaque in his memory is placed on the wall of the shelter building. German forces had seized the village of Souchez and the surrounding countryside as they advanced through Northern France in 1914. German artillery units were able to control this sector of the front from the high ground which flanked the village \u2013 Vimy Ridge to the east, and Lorette to the west. After 12 months of bitter fighting, French forces captured the high ground at Lorette in the autumn of 1915 but when they handed this part of the line to the Commonwealth forces in March 1916, Vimy Ridge was still in German hands. Vimy Ridge was certainly the key to the German defensive system in this sector and it protected an area of occupied France in which coal mines and factories were in full production for the German war effort; the fortified vantage points on the ridge dominated the surrounding battlefields. The Battle of Vimy Ridge formed part of the opening phase of the British-led Battle of Arras which began on 9 April 1917. The Canadian forces managed to capture most of the German positions on the ridge on the first day of the attack, and by 12 April they had occupied the village of Th\u00e9lus and pushed the Germans back to the Oppy-M\u00e9ricourt line. By taking the ridge the Canadians achieved a major tactical success, but in just four days of fighting they suffered over 10,000 casualties, 3,500 of whom were killed.

The Germans had heavily fortified the village with four lines of defence and each of its 150 houses bristled with cannon and machine guns. The labyrinth of trenches at the entrance to the village, flanked with forts and blockhouses, was thought to be impregnable; however slowly but surely French troops gained the position on 17 June 1915 at a cost of thousands of soldiers, many of whom were laid to rest in La Targette Cemetery. The French Army had recovered a Neuville-Saint-Vaast in ruins and taken Lorette Spur but Vimy Ridge still remained in German hands. In March 1916 the British Army relieved the French 10th Army at Arras and Canadian forces took charge at Vimy. Thenceforth began the preparation for an attack on Vimy Ridge which saw the excavation of a vast network of twelve tunnels up to the German lines. On 9 April 1917, in heavy snow, four Canadian divisions launched what was to be a successful attack on Vimy Ridge. The place known as Aux-Rietz was the forward command post for the 2nd Canadian Division and the artillery units who were given the job of providing cover for the soldiers on the ridge.\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:402px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Targette1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Targette1.jpg/400px-Targette1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Targette1.jpg/600px-Targette1.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Targette1.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"700\" data-file-height=\"278\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Targette1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Part of the huge French Cemetery at La Targette</div></div></div></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"The_German_Cemetery_at_Neuville_Saint_Vaast_known_as_.22La_Maison_Blanche.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_German_Cemetery_at_Neuville_Saint_Vaast_known_as_&quot;La_Maison_Blanche&quot;\">The German Cemetery at Neuville Saint Vaast known as \"La Maison Blanche\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=List_of_World_War_I_memorials_and_cemeteries_in_Artois&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: The German Cemetery at Neuville Saint Vaast known as &quot;La Maison Blanche&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:950px;\">The German Cemetery at Neuville Saint Vaast known as \"La Maison Blanche\"\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Maison Blanche or Neuville-Saint-Vaast German War Cemetery was established at the end of the First World War and is the largest German war cemetery in France.

The bodies of the dead were originally buried in small cemeteries close to the Western Front, spread over more than 110 villages in Pas-de-Calais. Most of the soldiers had died in the intense fighting in Artois, on the Lorette Spur (1914-1915) and Vimy Ridge. In 1926, the French Government allowed the German War Graves Commission, the <a href=\"/wiki/Volksbund_Deutsche_Kriegsgr%C3%A4berf%C3%BCrsorge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr\u00e4berf\u00fcrsorge\">Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr\u00e4berf\u00fcrsorge</a> (VDK), to carry out work on the cemetery but under its supervision. The VDK transformed what had until then been just a field into a proper war cemetery. Since 1966 the maintenance of the German War Cemeteries has been the responsibility of the VDK alone. Between 1975 and 1983 the VDK completely redesigned the cemetery and cast-iron crosses replaced the wooden ones, each one engraved with the names of four soldiers, and stone headstones were introduced for Jewish soldiers buried there.

The French High Command's plan was to launch a massive attack (the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nivelle_Offensive\" title=\"Nivelle Offensive\">Nivelle Offensive</a></i>) about 80 kilometres (50&#160;mi) to the south of the British sector in the Aisne region and at Arras the Allied objectives were to draw German troops away from the ground chosen for the French attack and to take the German-held high ground that dominated the plain of Douai. The British effort was a relatively broad front assault between <a href=\"/wiki/Vimy\" title=\"Vimy\">Vimy</a> in the northwest and <a href=\"/wiki/Bullecourt\" title=\"Bullecourt\">Bullecourt</a> in the southeast. After considerable bombardment, Canadian troops advancing in the north were able to capture the strategically significant <a href=\"/wiki/Vimy_Ridge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vimy Ridge\">Vimy Ridge</a> and British divisions in the centre were also able to make significant gains astride the Scarpe river. In the south, British and Australian forces were frustrated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Defence_in_depth\" title=\"Defence in depth\">elastic defence</a> and made only minimal gains. When the battle officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough and the stalemate of the trenches returned.\n</p><p>The Battle of Arras is normally divided into two phases. Phase one would embrace three encounters: the First Battle of the Scarpe which ran from 9 to 14 April 1917; the First Battle of Vimy Ridge from 9 to 12 April 1917; and the First Battle of Bullecourt from 10 to 11 April 1917.\n</p><p>The Second phase would embrace the Battle of Lagnicourt on 15 April 1917; the Second Battle of the Scarpe from 23 to 24 April 1917; the Battle of Arleux from 28 to 29 April 1917; the Second Battle of Bullecourt from 3 to 19 May 1917; and the Third Battle of the Scarpe from 3 to 4 May 1917.\n</p><p>A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties in the first two days and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge.

The 400-strong Kiwi tunnellers, who had undertaken only basic military training, worked to combat the Germans, burrowing under no-man\u2019s land to blow up and destroy the enemy trenches above.\nNew Zealand\u2019s Ambassador to France, Sarah Dennis, who unveiled the memorial said<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"This memorial is a welcome and fitting tribute to the courage and tenacity of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company.

In one tunnel system each cave is named after a New Zealand town \u2013 Russell, Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Dunedin, and finally, just before the German front line, Bluff.\n</p><p>Working parties to assist the tunnellers were sent from the New Zealand Division and included Maori and Pacific Islanders of the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion. Through the winter of 1916, as the town of Arras above was destroyed by German artillery, the underground city grew large enough to accommodate 20,000 men. There was running water, electric lighting, kitchens, latrines, a light rail system and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre. On 9 April 1917, 15,000 men moved through the tunnels to launch the Battle of Arras. The New Zealand tunnelers remained in France, repairing roads, developing other tunnel systems, and building and repairing bridges.

He graduated as a Second Lieutenant on 1 October 1877 and slowly climbed the ranks. In September 1912 he became the Colonel of the 159e RIA (they were known as the 15-9, Quinze-Neuf). By the age of fifty-seven he had lost both his wife and son and would devote the rest of his life to his <i>Grelus</i> as people from the high Alps are called.\n</p><p>Once Italy had declared its neutrality, the 159e RIA was transferred from the Franco-Italian frontier to Alsace and their accomplishments soon brought Barbot to the attention of his senior officers. Having already effectively taken over command of his own brigade he was promoted to G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Brigade on 8 September 1914. To this was added a second brigade, creating what was designated as the Division Barbot. In September 1914 his Division was transferred to the Artois Front and officially designated the \"77e Division d\u2019Infanterie\". In the battle for Arras, Barbot\u2019s convictions and his soldiers\u2019 tenacity were fundamental in saving the town from occupation by the Germans.\n</p><p>As the German line continued to encircle Arras to the north, Barbot and his Division found themselves transferred to the area in front of Souchez \u2013 their Corps was now officially designated the 33e CA and was commanded by G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Philippe P\u00e9tain. As a Colonel Petain had commanded the Arras Regiment (33e RI) and one of his young lieutenants was <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle\" title=\"Charles de Gaulle\">Charles de Gaulle</a>. On 9 May 1915 the 2nd Battle of Artois was launched by the French against the hills of Notre Dame de Lorette and Vimy.\n</p><p>On its right the Moroccan Division stormed across the plain and took Vimy Ridge, 4 kilometres (2.5&#160;mi) away, in a single rush. In the centre, Barbot\u2019s men made superb gains getting as far as Hill 119, Givenchy and the outskirts of Souchez. Hill 119 became known as \"The Pimple\" to the Canadians in 1917 and is the steep hill immediately opposite the site of Barbot\u2019s monument. Unfortunately the speed of their advance proved to be the 77e DI\u2019s undoing and under violent bombardment they were forced to retire from Givenchy, back as far as the Cabaret Rouge on the hill above Souchez. (Near the site of the CWGC Cemetery).\n</p>\nBarbot installed his HQ in a rough trench at Cabaret Rouge despite the fact that the position was still under bombardment. On 10 May 1915 at about 11:00&#160;a.m. while dashing across the open ground to talk to one of his colonels Barbot was hit by shrapnel. With a severe chest wound and a broken arm, he was carried back to Berthonval Wood (just in front of Mont St Eloi) and from there transported by car to the Dressing Station at Villers-Ch\u00e2tel. The surgeons found that they could do nothing for him. General d\u2019Urbal dispatched a staff office to award Barbot the Cross of a Commander of the <a href=\"/wiki/Legion_of_Honour\" title=\"Legion of Honour\">Legion of Honour</a> and he died a short time later. His last words were recorded as <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"Glorious Day. Victory!\"\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Barbot Memorial was designed by Paul Dechin and sculpted by his father <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jules_Dechin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jules Dechin (page does not exist)\">Jules Dechin</a>. Work began in 1935 under a committee headed by General P\u00e9tain, and the monument was inaugurated on Sunday 9 May 1937 in the presence of numerous VIPs and thousands of veterans of the Alpine Division. The statue is not only dedicated to General Barbot himself, as commander of the 77e DI, but also to his men who fell in Artois between 1 October 1914 and 20 February 1916. Dechin depicts Barbot standing with a hand in between two buttons of his greatcoat (like Napoleon) and a gesture of his right hand suggests that he is trying to protect his soldiers who can be seen climbing up out of their trenches in berets \u2014 there were no steel helmets in 1915.\n</p><p>On either side of the monument are two commemorative plaques. One is to General Plessier who had preceded Barbot as commander of the 77e DI and was the first General killed in action (at Alsace on 19 August 1914), the other to General Stirn who took over on Barbot\u2019s death but was himself killed two days later.\n</p>\nA story recounted in the Regimental History and perhaps apocryphal is of an ordinary soldier encountering the elderly Barbot in the trenches. He asked Barbot why on earth he had not been demobilised considering his age and Barbot replied<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"They won\u2019t let me.\n</p><p>Why ever not&#160;?

By 11 a.m. the Division were advancing on the next objective, the Brown Line, and by the end of the day 186 Brigade had reached Graincourt, an advance of around 7,000 yards (6,400&#160;m) from the starting position.\nThe village of Havrincourt was lost in March 1918 during the major German offensive. The 62nd Division again retook the village on 12 September 1918 and held it despite German counter-offensives.

The Battle of Cambrai was launched by the British Army on 20 November 1917, and was to grind to a halt 6 kilometres (3.7&#160;mi) from Cambrai with massive losses suffered on both sides. The subsequent German counter-attack pushed the Allies back to their starting position. This battle is generally regarded as the first major battle of the First World War in which tanks were used. Until then the pattern was for battles to begin with a sustained artillery bombardment to hopefully break through the German barbed-wire defences with the infantry following under cover of smoke barrages. The Cambrai battle began on 20 November 1917 with great initial success, but a halt called for \"rest and reorganisation\" on 22 November 1917 allowed the Germans time to take stock and reinforce. From 23 to 28 November the fighting was concentrated almost entirely around Bourlon Wood and by 29 November 1917, the Germans had mounted a major counter-attack and during fierce fighting over the next five days, succeeded in gaining much of the ground they had lost when the attack was launched. The tank had been no more successful in breaking through the German barbed wire than had been the artillery bombardments on the Somme in 1916 and at other battles.

On the ruins of what was a German bunker stands a bronze caribou which faces a point known at the time of the Great War as \"Infantry Hill\". This is the Newfoundland Regiment Memorial, or \"Caribou\" memorial. Here on 14 April 1917, companies A, C and D of the 1st Battalion Newfoundland Regiment, along with the 1st Essex both of the 88th Brigade/29th Division, were assigned the capture of Infantry Hill. At 5:30&#160;a.m. both battalions advanced behind a creeping artillery barrage. The Newfoundlanders reached the foot of the hill despite heavy German machine gun and artillery fire. As they reached the top of the hill they were met by three German battalions, one in front and one each to the left and right. The Newfoundlanders were virtually surrounded and by 9:00&#160;a.m. the situation was hopeless. The surviving groups of men were forced to surrender. The Newfoundlanders' losses were second only to their casualties suffered on 1 July 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel on the Somme. On 14 April 1917, 166 Newfoundlanders lost their lives, a further 141 men were wounded and 153 captured.
