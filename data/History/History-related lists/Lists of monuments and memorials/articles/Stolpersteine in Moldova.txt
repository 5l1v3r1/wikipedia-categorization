The Stolpersteine in Moldova lists the Stolpersteine of Moldova. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. Until now in Moldova there has been only one collocation of Stolpersteine — on 24 July 2018 in Chișinău. The Stolpersteine were collocated by the artist himself. In the Romanian language they are called: pietre de poticnire. Of the 65,000 Jews in Chişinău in 1939, 53,000 fell victim to the Nazi regime. The Holocaust researcher Matatias Carp (1904-1953) dealt in detail with the Holocaust in Moldova and Romania. The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim. The well known French actor François Berléand is his grandson. Her daughter was also murdered by the Nazi regime. Her son somehow could survive. He filed the reports on the death of his mother and his sister to Yad Vashem. This took place in 2001. At that time, the son lived in New York.  Bunya Bron had at least one grandson, Igor Bron, who also could survive the Shoah. The planned collocation of four Stolpersteine in front of the house Alexei Ściusev 44, where the Bragar once family lived, all murdered in Transylvania in 1941, had to be postponed for technical reasons.
