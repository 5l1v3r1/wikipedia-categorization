The Stolpersteine in Croatia lists the Stolpersteine in the Republic of Croatia. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. Until now in Croatia there has been only one collocation of Stolpersteine—in 2013 in the Adriatic town Rijeka (Croatian pronunciation: [rijěːka], in Italian: Fiume). From 1466, this town was under Habsburg rule for four and half centuries, at last with two-thirds of its inhabitants being of Italian descent. Thereafter, Rijeka was independent for some years. From 1924 to the end of WW2, the city belonged to Italy. The name of the Stolpersteine in Croatian is Kamen spoticanja, and in Italian:  pietre d'inciampo. The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim. His sister Giuseppina and her husband Adolfo Simkovits were also murdered in Auschwitz.  Lipschitz's report on the internment in Campagna was translated by his daughter from Hungarian to Italian and published in 2001 in book form. His report was designated by the Corriere del Mezzogiorno as a particularly relevant historical document.  Excerpts appeared in two anthologies in 2011 and 2015.   Together with her husband, she was arrested in Fiume in March 1944, deported to Risiera di San Sabba, and later to Auschwitz Birkenau concentration camp, where she was murdered by the Nazi regime at an unknown time, as did her husband. The collocation in Rijeka took place on 21 May 2013. For both victims two Stolpersteine were posed, one in Croatian and one in Italian. The planned collocation of a Stolperstein for Branko Lustig in Osijek on 22 May 2013 has probably not taken place.
