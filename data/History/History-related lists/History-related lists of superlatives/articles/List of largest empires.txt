  The following is a list of the largest empires in world history. Rein Taagepera has defined an empire as "any relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign" and its size as the area over which the empire has some undisputed military and taxation prerogatives,  and these are the definitions used by this list. Zbigniew Brzezinski has argued that "The very notion of a globally dominant power is a recent historical development". . The total land area of the Earth is 148,940,000 km2 (57,506,000 sq mi),  and there have been more than 50 empires whose greatest extent exceeded 2% of that area, of which only three exceeded 10% – the British, Mongol, and Russian empires. Empire size in this list is defined as the dry land area it controls.
