 A monarch is the person who heads a monarchy, normally ruling for life, or until abdication or deposition. The reign of some monarchs has been notably short. Many of these monarchs acceded to the throne as a result of being first in an order of succession, while other monarchs claimed the throne as a result of some conflict. The authenticity of some monarchs has been disputed, especially for those monarchs who reigned during conflict. One factor in such debates is whether the monarch held the throne in a symbolic or nominal capacity. An example is King Louis XIX of France, who succeeded upon the abdication of Charles X only to abdicate in favour of Henry V instead of assuming the throne, and Emperor Michael II of Russia, who succeeded on the abdication of Nicholas II only to abdicate in favor of nobody.
