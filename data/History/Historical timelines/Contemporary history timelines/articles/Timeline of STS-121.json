There were also additional \"Get Ahead\" tasks planned for the crew to do at the ISS if they found themselves with more time than planned, one such get ahead task was completed on EVA 2.

Consideration was given to a repair on the pad.  However, this was not done as the heaters are only used in colder weather, and the primary heater was functional.\n</p><p>For the third launch attempt, there was only a 20% chance of weather preventing launch according to NASA.\n</p><p>At 2:37:55 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a href=\"/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery\" title=\"Space Shuttle Discovery\">Space Shuttle Discovery</a> launched from the Kennedy Space Center at <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Canaveral\" title=\"Cape Canaveral\">Cape Canaveral</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a>. This was the third attempt at launch. It was also the first (and only) US <a href=\"/wiki/Space_Shuttle\" title=\"Space Shuttle\">Space Shuttle</a> to launch on the United States' <a href=\"/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)\" title=\"Independence Day (United States)\">Independence Day</a>.\n</p><p>During and after launch much attention was paid to monitoring the external tank for the loss of insulation foam. The shuttle was equipped with a number of new cameras, and video was also taken from spotter planes. Each solid rocket booster contained three cameras - one to monitor the separation, and two focused on the leading edge.  The video from these was not to be broadcast, but recorded for later retrieval from the solid rocket boosters. A further camera was placed on the external tank, as during <a href=\"/wiki/STS-114\" title=\"STS-114\">STS-114</a>, to broadcast live images on NASA TV during launch. The first thing two of the crew from the mid-deck did when the main engines cut out was leave their seats to take photographs and video of the external tank. One of the factors that was potentially affecting the choice of day within the launch window was the lighting conditions for this imagery, as the sun's slightly different angle on the different days affected the location of shadows on the external tank. However, the day to day difference in lighting was determined to be relatively unimportant, particularly as the lighting conditions depended to a great degree on a more unpredictable factor \u2014 the degree to which the external tank tumbles on separation.\n</p><p>During the launch, NASA TV broadcast a view from the external tank camera mounted between the Shuttle and the external tank. Unlike the previous two missions, no foam breakage or foam pieces were easily seen falling off the tank. However, upon close inspection of the many cameras covering the launch NASA has revealed several small pieces of debris were seen jetting away from the tank.  Generally, though, these were seen after the time NASA was most concerned about.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:STS-121_floating_ice.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/STS-121_floating_ice.jpg/200px-STS-121_floating_ice.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"132\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/STS-121_floating_ice.jpg/300px-STS-121_floating_ice.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/STS-121_floating_ice.jpg/400px-STS-121_floating_ice.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3027\" data-file-height=\"1998\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:STS-121_floating_ice.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A piece of ice videoed by Michael Fossum from STS-121.</div></div></div>\n<p>About 23 minutes into the flight, further debris was observed floating beside the orbiter as reported by Mission Specialist Michael Fossum. His transmission was broadcast live on NASA TV. Fossum initially described the debris as a 4\u20135-foot-long piece (1.2\u20131.5&#160;m) with straps attached, a description which would fit a thermal protection system blanket. Such a blanket was noted to be flapping on the previous mission, <a href=\"/wiki/STS-114\" title=\"STS-114\">STS-114</a>, but was not of concern as it protects a section of the vehicle which does not get particularly hot. Analysis of video images on the ground has indicated that the debris observed was strips of ice formed on the outside of an engine nozzle, which sublimated and disintegrated during observation. Very similar ice formations were seen on earlier missions.\n</p><p>Video analysis also revealed a tile shim which came out during main engine start.\n</p><p>The orbital maneuvering system thruster in which a heater failed prior to launch (see <a href=\"#Pre-launch_concerns\">Pre-launch concerns</a>) was warmed by pointing it at the sun; thus it was possible to be used during ISS rendezvous docking operations.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"July_5_.28flight_day_2.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"July_5_(flight_day_2)\">July 5 (flight day 2)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_STS-121&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: July 5 (flight day 2)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>En route to the ISS, the 50-foot (15&#160;m)-long <a href=\"/wiki/Orbiter_Boom_Sensor_System\" title=\"Orbiter Boom Sensor System\">Orbiter Boom Sensor System</a> (OBSS) tipped with two types of lasers and a high-resolution television camera was used to inspect the underside of the shuttle for damage.

There are six focused inspections being carried out, fewer than were required in <a href=\"/wiki/STS-114\" title=\"STS-114\">STS-114</a>.
