Yanukovych's alternative suggestion was a fresh election with neither himself nor Yushchenko as candidates; this was also rejected. The outgoing president Leonid Kuchma announced that he would support holding an entirely new presidential election, not just a re-run of the disputed second round.\n</p><p>On November 29, Yanukovych's <a href=\"/wiki/Campaign_manager\" title=\"Campaign manager\">campaign manager</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Serhiy_Tyhypko\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serhiy Tyhypko\">Serhiy Tyhypko</a>, announced his resignation from both his position in the Yanukovych campaign and his position as the head of the National Bank of Ukraine.

Yanukovych reacted angrily to Tyhypko's move, calling him a \"mischievous cat\".\n</p><p>At the same time, the opposition seemed to suffer a setback as the Ukrainian parliament initially failed to pass a <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence\" title=\"Motion of no confidence\">motion of no confidence</a> in the Yanukovych government.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1_December\">1 December</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Orange_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: 1 December\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Ukrainian parliament passed a <a href=\"/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence\" title=\"Motion of no confidence\">motion of no confidence</a> in the Yanukovych government with 229 votes in favour and voted to create a \"government of national trust.\" The vote urges President Leonid Kuchma to dismiss Yanukovych and appoint a caretaker prime minister, who would probably be parliamentary speaker <a href=\"/wiki/Volodymyr_Lytvyn\" title=\"Volodymyr Lytvyn\">Volodymyr Lytvyn</a>. Kuchma has the option of rejecting the vote but the parliament can override his veto with a new vote that would need to attract a two-thirds majority (301 of the 450 deputies). Although he has not commented publicly on the vote, his aides have reportedly rejected it.\n</p><p>On the same day, the round table talks were resumed. As a gesture of goodwill, Yushchenko agreed to tell his supporters to cease their blockade of official buildings in Kiev so that government work could resume.\n</p><p>Yanukovych's camp submitted a complaint to the Ukrainian Supreme Court protesting alleged irregularities in Yushchenko-supporting regions of Ukraine and Kiev. With both camps now complaining that the election results were falsified and appealing for an annulment, the likelihood of the Supreme Court declaring the results invalid was seen to have increased significantly.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2_December\">2 December</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Orange_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: 2 December\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Presidents Kuchma and Russian President <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Putin\" title=\"Vladimir Putin\">Vladimir Putin</a> met in Moscow to discuss the ongoing crisis. The two presidents issued a statement calling for an entirely new election&#8212;not just a re-run of the disputed second round. This proposal was rejected by Yushchenko's camp, as it would allow Kuchma to stay in power for several more months and could break the momentum of the opposition. Yushchenko declared that he would hold out for an immediate re-run.\n</p><p>President George W. Bush also issued a statement, saying that any new poll should be open, fair and free of foreign influence, and that the will of the Ukrainian people must be known and heard.\n</p><p>Fears were expressed about the damage the crisis could cause to Ukraine's economy. The national currency, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hryvnia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hryvnia\">hryvnia</a>, continued to fall against other currencies and the Ukrainian Central Bank imposed a limit on cash withdrawals on all banks to guard against a run on the currency developing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"3_December\">3 December</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Orange_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: 3 December\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After five days of deliberations, Ukraine's Supreme Court declared the results of the run-off election to be invalid.

The Yushchenko camp attacked in court the validity of the second round only, and therefore the Supreme Court could only annul the results of the second round. For the first round to be also annulled and repeated (as the Kuchma/Yanukovych camp desired), further evidence would have had to be brought in that would challenge the validity of the first vote. Neither side, however, chose to do that. Both sides committed themselves to abiding by the court's decision, which they regarded as final.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, the Parliament voted to ask outgoing President Leonid Kuchma to withdraw <a href=\"/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq#1000_-_5000_soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Multinational force in Iraq\">the country's 1,600 troops</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq\" title=\"Iraq\">Iraq</a>.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Ukraine\" title=\"Socialist Party of Ukraine\">Socialist</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Ukraine\" title=\"Communist Party of Ukraine\">Communist</a> Parties had agreed to vote in favour of the electoral changes if the opposition in turn supported constitutional changes meant to lessen the power of the President in favour of the Prime Minister and the Parliament.

He also said that he was prepared to reform the 15-member Central Election Commission, which had been strongly criticised for apparently colluding in the fixing of the run-off vote. However, he refused to meet demands to sack Yanukovych, potentially setting up a fresh confrontation with the Ukrainian parliament, which had earlier passed a motion of no confidence in the government.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"6_December\">6 December</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Orange_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: 6 December\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Speaking in <a href=\"/wiki/Turkey\" title=\"Turkey\">Turkey</a>, Russia's President Putin strongly warned against foreign interference in Ukraine's new election, accusing Western countries of trying to impose their definition of democracy on Ukraine.\n</p><p>Yushchenko continued to campaign for amendments to the election laws that would ban voting by absentee ballots and voting in people's homes, both of which were seen as being among the most abused election provisions in the first two votes. He also rejected proposals by Kuchma that the powers of the president should be diluted and partially given to the parliament, in which pro-Yanukovych forces are still powerful.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"7_December_-_8_December\">7 December - 8 December</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Orange_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: 7 December - 8 December\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After several days of heated debate, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) agreed reform measures to change the electoral laws and institute changes to the governance of Ukraine. Key elements of the reforms include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Changes to the Central Election Commission and dismissal of some of its members;</li>\n<li>Tighter rules on absentee ballots and home voting to reduce the possibility of ballot fraud;</li>\n<li>Reduced presidential powers, with the president confined to appointing only the prime minister, defence and foreign ministers, subject to the approval of parliament;</li>\n<li>Greater powers for the regions, to reduce tensions between the west and east of the country.</li></ul>\n<p>The reform package received the approval of 402 of the 450 parliamentary deputies (with 21 votes against and 19 abstentions) and was immediately signed into law by President Kuchma. In response, the opposition agreed to end the blockade of government buildings from 1900 (local time) on December 8.\n</p><p>The reforms shift the balance of power within Ukraine, moving from the strong presidential system to a parliamentary system. The outcome is seen as a compromise between the rival camps, as the new election rules will improve Yushchenko's chances of victory but the constitutional changes will enable the Kuchma/Yanukovych camp to exercise influence through parliament and the regions following the election.\n</p><p>Kuchma granted Yanukovych leave of absence to contest the December 26 election, and appointed First Deputy Prime Minister <a href=\"/wiki/Mykola_Azarov\" title=\"Mykola Azarov\">Mykola Azarov</a> to serve as acting prime minister.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"11_December\">11 December</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_the_Orange_Revolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: 11 December\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Times\" title=\"The Times\">The Times</a></i> reported that Austrian doctors had confirmed that Yushchenko's mysterious illness was due to poisoning from a biological or chemical agent.
