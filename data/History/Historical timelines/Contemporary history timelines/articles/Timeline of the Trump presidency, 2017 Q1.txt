  The following is a timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump during the first quarter of 2017.  To navigate between quarters, see Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump. In the first quarter of 2017, the real US GDP increased at an annual rate of 0.7%, the slowest growth since the first quarter of 2014. The growth was primarily caused by an increase in business structures and equipment (such as mining and wells), industrial supplies and materials (like petroleum), and services. This was offset by decreases in motor vehicles and parts, private inventory investment, and government spending.  On March 31, 2017, the U.S. national debt stood at $19.8 trillion  representing a quarterly decline of 0.65%.  According to FiveThirtyEight, President Trump's approval rate at the end of March was 40.5%, down 5% from the start of his presidency.
