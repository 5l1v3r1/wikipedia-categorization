 This is a timeline of actions by the Real Irish Republican Army, also called the Real IRA, an Irish republican paramilitary group. The group was formed in late 1997 by members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army who disagreed with that organisation's ceasefire. The Real IRA is the largest and most active of the dissident republican paramilitaries waging a campaign against the British security forces. The other main republican paramilitary groups are the group which calls itself Óglaigh na hÉireann,  the Continuity IRA and arm na poblachta the newest group. All actions listed took place in Northern Ireland unless stated otherwise. Note: for some of the incidents in 1998, it is unclear whether the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA, or both organisations were responsible.
