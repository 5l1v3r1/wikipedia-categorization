The following is a basic timeline of the Bábí and Bahá'í religions emphasizing dates that are relatively well known. For a more comprehensive chronology of the timeline, see the references at the bottom. 676 Dr. Rev. Austin Wright sent materials of the Báb and a letter/paper about events related to the religion to the American Oriental Society - he wrote the letter February 1851 and it was published June.  The letter/paper was published in June a Vermont newspaper as well.  Some of it was also translated into German by his supervisor, Rev. Justin Perkins, and was thought for many years to have not been published in English though even in its German form Wright had been named as the first person to write a paper on the Bábí-Bahá'í period. :pp.10,73 E. G. Browne, a famed Cambridge orientalist interviewed Bahá’u’lláh and was His guest at Bahjí from 15 April to 20 April 1890. Browne was the only Westerner to meet Bahá’u’lláh and leave an account of his experience. In Browne's 1893 publication entitled A Year Among the Persians, he wrote a sympathetic portrayal of Persian society. After his death in 1926 it was reprinted and became a classic in English travel literature. Browne described Baha'u'llah as, "The face of Him on Whom I gazed, I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one’s very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow… No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain..."
