The Canon of Dutch History is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and  the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands.    The fifty topics are divided into fourteen sections. The Canon of Dutch History was prepared by a committee headed by Frits van Oostrom and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Maria van der Hoeven, on 16 October 2006. A revised version was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007 and in October 2008 it was agreed to include the canon in the school curriculum by 1 August 2009. The canon was designed to provide an overview of "what everyone ought to know, at the very least, about the history and culture of the Netherlands",  as well as providing a framework for the teaching of History in Dutch schools.  Schools are not obliged to teach the canon, in accordance with the Freedom of education principle incorporated in the Dutch constitution (article 23) that guarantees the right of parents to have their children educated in accordance with their religious and other views. The website entoen.nu is responsible for developing the canon for use in schools and in society in general.
