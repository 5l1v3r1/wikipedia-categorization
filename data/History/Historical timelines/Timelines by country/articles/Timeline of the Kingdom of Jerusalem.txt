The timeline of the Kingdom of Jerusalem presents important events of the history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in chronological order. The kingdom was a crusader state, established during the First Crusade in Palestine in 1099. Its first ruler, Godfrey of Bouillon, was never crowned. He acknowledged the claim of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Daimbert, to sovereignty. Godfrey's brother and successor, Baldwin of Boulogne was crowned the first king of Jerusalem in 1100. He subjected the Latin patriarchs to his rule and achieved that the rulers of other crusader states—the County of Edessa, the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch—obey to his commands. Fleets from Pisan, Genoese and Venice supported Baldwin I and his successors to capture all the towns on the coast. The crusaders (or Franks) also contolled the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. The polarisation of the Muslim world enabled the Franks to consolidate their rule in Palestine. They could also appeal to the Popes and the European rulers for help. Baldwin III and Amalric maintained a close alliance with the Byzantine Empire, but they could not prevent Nur ad-Din from uniting the Muslim states in Syria in the 1150s. Nur ad-Din also began the unification of Syria and Egypt, and the process was completed by Saladin in the 1180s. Amalric's successors, the leper Baldwin IV and the unpopular Guy of Lusignan could not hinder the disintegration of the kingdom. Saladin annihilated the crusader army in the Battle of Hattin on July 4, 1187 and captured most towns (including Jerusalem) during the following months. An Italian crusader, Conrad of Montferrat, saved Tyre and Guy of Lusignan laid siege to Acre in 1189. The Third Crusade secured the survival of the kingdom and Saladin acknowledged that most coastal towns remained under Frank rule in his truce with Richard I of England.
