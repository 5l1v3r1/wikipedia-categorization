This table is under construction. This timeline lists all Asian sovereign nations, both current and defunct, of the second and third millennia. Vassal states, unrecognized states or states with limited recognition throughout history are generally not included unless they evolved at some point into a sovereign state. Territorial changes that don't consume whole nations or produce new ones are not considered.
