The timeline of the Tanakh can be estimated using the ages given in Genesis and Jubilees. Starting with the creation of Adam and adding the information when his son was born, the age of his son, etc. this gives a timeline from Adam's creation to the death of Jacob 2255 years later (according to the Masoretic text, the Septuagint timeline is significantly longer). These timelines are used by some biblical scholars to estimate the age of the earth by counting back the number of years associated with each of the biblical patriarchs and adding the years together.
