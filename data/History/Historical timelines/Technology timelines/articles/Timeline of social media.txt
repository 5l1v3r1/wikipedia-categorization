This page is a timeline of social media. Major launches, milestones and other major events are included. Bulletin board systems (BBS) and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) were popular during this time period, and IRC is still widely used today.   With advances in smartphone technology, almost all social media services now have their own mobile apps.  An example of a popular IRC client today is mIRC. (*) Such launches are not initial launches, but rather re-launches.
