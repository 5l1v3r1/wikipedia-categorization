Timeline of Russian Innovation encompasses key events in the history of technology in Russia, starting from the Early East Slavs and up to the Russian Federation. The entries in this timeline fall into the following categories: This timeline examines scientific and medical discoveries, products and technologies introduced by various peoples of Russia and its predecessor states, regardless of ethnicity, and also lists inventions by naturalized immigrant citizens. Certain innovations achieved by a national operation may also may be included in this timeline, in cases where the Russian side played a major role in such projects. Lapta Zvonnitsa Anbur script The alphabet was introduced by a Russian missionary, Stepan Khrap, also known as Saint Stephen of Perm (Степан Храп, св. Стефан Пермский) in 1372. The name Abur is derived from the names of the first two characters: An and Bur. The alphabet derived from Cyrillic and Greek, and Komi tribal signs, the latter being similar in the appearance to runes or siglas poveiras, because they were created by incisions, rather than by usual writing. The alphabet was in use until the 17th century, when it was superseded by the Cyrillic script. Abur was also used as cryptographic writing for the Russian language. 1376 Sarafan Bardiche Boyar hat Gulyay-gorod Ukha Russian oven Rassolnik c. 1430 Russian vodka Kokoshnik (architecture) 1510s Tented roof masonry 1530 Middle Muscovite Russian abacus 1550 Streltsy 1552 Battery-tower 1561 Saint Basil's Cathedral  1566 Great Abatis Line  1586 Tsar Cannon  Bochka roof Gorodki Roller coaster Bird of Happiness Dymkovo toy Troika 1630 Late Muscovite Russian architecture characterized by many large cathedral-type churches with five onion-like cupolas, surrounding them with tents of bell towers and aisles. 1659 Khokhloma 1679 Circle of fifths 1685 Tula pryanik 1688 Balalaika Glass-holder  1693  Table-glass 1704 Decimal currency 1717 Metal lathe compound slide 1718 Yacht club 1725 Rebar 1732 Cast iron cupola / Lightning rod  1733 Peter and Paul Cathedral  1735 Tsar Bell  1739 Ice palace 1741 Quick-firing gun 1754 Coaxial rotor / Model helicopter  1756 Law of Mass Conservation 1757 Licorne (Russian field gun) 1761 Atmosphere of Venus 1762 Off-axis reflecting telescope 1770 Amber Room  1770 Thunder Stone  1776 Orenburg shawl 1778 Russian samovar The Transportation of the Thunder-stone in the Presence of Catherine II.
