In theory, solar energy has been used by humans as early as 7th century B.C. when our ancestors discovered how to light fires using glass as a magnifier. Another early use for solar energy is in 1776, when Horace de Saussure, a swiss physicist, invented the first solar oven. The solar oven used sunlight to heat meals and no electricity was required. Later on, in the 19th century, it is observed that the sunlight striking certain materials generates detectable electric current. This discovery has laid the foundation of solar cells. Solar cells have gone on to be used in many applications. They have historically been used in situations where electrical power from the grid was unavailable.
