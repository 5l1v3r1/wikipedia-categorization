The <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Auto_Club\" title=\"United States Auto Club\">United States Auto Club</a> bans gasoline and switches all cars to methyl alcohol (methanol), a rule which would stay for 41 years before ending after the 2005 race.</li>\n<li>During the <a href=\"/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War\" title=\"Nigerian Civil War\">Nigerian Civil War</a> of <b>1967 to 1970</b>, Engineers in the breakaway republic of  <a href=\"/wiki/Biafra\" title=\"Biafra\">Biafra</a> resorted to powering vehicles with alcohol. Initially, alcohol was used to supplement the crude oil refining capacity which the fledgling state had under its control, but as the Soviet and UK backed Nigerian army seized the oil producing regions, and with the Nigerian embargo beginning to bite, alcohol became the dominant source of fuel for the economy.</li>\n<li>In <b>1971</b>, the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nebraska_Agricultural_Products_Industrial_Utilization&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Nebraska Agricultural Products Industrial Utilization (page does not exist)\">Nebraska Agricultural Products Industrial Utilization</a> Committee (or \"Gasohol\" Committee) is formed to find new uses for surplus grain. The commission tests ethanol-gasoline blends in thousands of cars over millions of miles, proving that ethanol can be used as an octane-boosting additive to replace leaded gasoline.</li>\n<li>In <b>1973</b>, Arab oil embargo creates a worldwide energy crisis, leading to intensified search for alternative energy sources.</li>\n<li>In <b>1979</b>, President <a href=\"/wiki/Jimmy_Carter\" title=\"Jimmy Carter\">Jimmy Carter</a>'s administration creates federal incentives for ethanol production. Federal and state subsidies for ethanol amount to about $11 billion between 1979 and 2000, as compared to about $150 billion in tax credits for the oil industry (from 1968\u20132000), according to the General Accounting Office.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>By the <b>mid-1980s</b>, over 100 new corn alcohol production plants are built and over a billion US gallons of ethanol for fuel were sold per year. The ethanol program is controversial for several reasons, not the least of which was that the ethanol industry was dominated by one company \u2013 Archer Daniels Midland of Peoria, Ill.</li>\n<li>In <b>1984</b>, the number of ethanol plants peaked at 163 in the U.S., producing 595&#160;million US gallons (2,250,000&#160;m<sup>3</sup>) of ethanol that year.</li>\n<li>In 1988, the <a href=\"/wiki/George_H._W._Bush_administration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George H. W. Bush administration\">George H. W. Bush administration</a> proposes a cleanup of \"air toxics\" in gasoline, focusing on replacing benzene octane boosters with ethanol. The proposal leads to one part of the 1990 <a href=\"/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)\" title=\"Clean Air Act (United States)\">Clean Air Act</a>.</li>\n<li>In the late <b>1980s</b> and <b>1990s</b>, an oil surplus drives gasoline prices down as low as $12 per barrel, driving most of the ethanol industry into bankruptcy.</li>\n<li>In <b>1990</b> and <b>1992</b>, Congress passes amendments to the Clean Air Act encouraging the use of ethanol and other oxygenated fuels as replacements for benzene, <a href=\"/wiki/Toluene\" title=\"Toluene\">toluene</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Xylene\" title=\"Xylene\">xylene</a> octane boosters. <a href=\"/wiki/MTBE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MTBE\">MTBE</a> becomes the oil industry's favorite additive, but as water pollution problems were recognized, MTBE is banned in California. Ethanol production rises to the 4-billion-US-gallon (15,000,000&#160;m<sup>3</sup>) level.</li>\n<li>Between <b>1997</b> and <b>2002</b>, three million U.S. cars and light trucks are produced which could run on <a href=\"/wiki/E85\" title=\"E85\">E85</a>, a blend of 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline. Almost no gas stations sell this fuel however.</li>\n<li>In the early <b>2000s</b>, the <a href=\"/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq\" title=\"2003 invasion of Iraq\">invasion of Iraq</a> makes Americans aware of their dependence on foreign oil. This and worry over anthropogenic <a href=\"/wiki/Climate_change\" title=\"Climate change\">climate change</a> causes leading alternative energies like <a href=\"/wiki/Biofuel\" title=\"Biofuel\">biofuel</a>, solar and wind to expand 20 to 30% yearly.</li>\n<li>In <b>2003</b>, California is the first state to ban MTBE. Several other states start switching soon afterward. California consumes 900&#160;million US gallons (3,400,000&#160;m<sup>3</sup>) of ethanol a year, about a third of all the ethanol produced in the United States.</li>\n<li>In <b>2004</b>, <a href=\"/wiki/Crude_oil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crude oil\">Crude oil</a> prices rise by 80%. Gasoline prices rise 30% in the U.S. <a href=\"/wiki/Diesel_fuel\" title=\"Diesel fuel\">Diesel fuel</a> rises almost 50%. These rises are caused by <a href=\"/wiki/Hurricane\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hurricane\">hurricane</a> damage to oil rigs in the <a href=\"/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico\" title=\"Gulf of Mexico\">Gulf of Mexico</a>, attacks on <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq\" title=\"Iraq\">Iraqi</a> oil pipelines, disruptions elsewhere, and rising demand for gasoline in <a href=\"/wiki/Asia\" title=\"Asia\">Asia</a>, as Asians buy more cars. Alcohol fuel prices are much closer to the price of gasoline. The ethanol industry in the USA makes 225,000 barrels (35,800&#160;m<sup>3</sup>) per day in August, an all-time record. Some conventional oil fuel companies are investing in alcohol fuel. <a href=\"/wiki/Oil_reserves\" title=\"Oil reserves\">Oil reserves</a> are forecast to last about 40 more years. Total use (demand) of ethanol is 3.53&#160;billion US gallons (13,400,000&#160;m<sup>3</sup>).</li>\n<li>In <b>2005</b>, E85 sells for 45 cents (or 30-75 cents wholesale) less than gasoline on average in the United States. More than 4 million <a href=\"/wiki/Flexible_fuel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flexible fuel\">flexible-fuel</a> (capable of running on E85 as well as gasoline) vehicles exist in the United States. About 400 filling stations exist in the US that sell E85 fuel, mostly in the Midwest. Gasoline prices rise as ethanol prices stay the same, due to rapidly growing ethanol supply and federal tax subsidies for ethanol. Wholesale ethanol prices drop nearly 30% between January and April, or $1.75 to $1.23 per gallon in the U.S.</li>\n<li>In <b>2005</b>, the earliest-documented test of driving a car designed solely for gasoline use, long-distance solely on 100% <a href=\"/wiki/Butanol_fuel\" title=\"Butanol fuel\">butanol fuel</a> occurs as American motorist David Ramey drove from <a href=\"/wiki/Blacklick,_Ohio\" title=\"Blacklick, Ohio\">Blacklick, Ohio</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/San_Diego,_California\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"San Diego, California\">San Diego, California</a> using 100% butanol in an unmodified 1992 <a href=\"/wiki/Buick_Park_Avenue\" title=\"Buick Park Avenue\">Buick Park Avenue</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>In <b>2006</b>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Indy_Racing_League\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Indy Racing League\">Indy Racing League</a> switches to a 10% ethanol-90% methanol fuel mixture, as part of a phase-in to an all-ethanol formula in 2007. <a href=\"/wiki/Bill_Gates\" title=\"Bill Gates\">Bill Gates</a> buys a quarter of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Ethanol_Inc.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pacific Ethanol Inc.
