 This is a timeline of the history and development of Serer religion and the Serer people of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania. This timeline merely gives an overview of their history, consisting of calibrated archaeological discoveries in Serer countries, Serer religion, politics, royalty, etc. Dates are given according to the Common Era.  For a background to these events, see Roog, Serer religion, Serer creation myth, Serer prehistory, Lamane, States headed by Serer Lamanes, Serer history and Serer people. Many of the Serer village and town names they have founded still survives today. Godfrey Mwakikagile,  This era marks the exodus of the Serers of Tekrur. Those who survived the wars and refused to convert migrated southwards to what later became known as the Serer Kingdoms of Sine, Saloum and previously Baol, rather than convert to Islam. In the south, they were granted asylum by their distant Serer relatives, endorsed by the Great Council of Lamanes, the highest court in Serer country. Trimingham notes that, Tekrur was the first in the region to adopt Islam but lost completely its Serer identity.  War Jabi died in 1040 and was succeeded by his son Leb (or Labi), also a major ally of the Almoravids.  Leb is reported to have been fighting for the Almoravids in 1056  probably as a result of the subjugation of Tekrur by the Almoravids in 1042 and a well enforced Sharia law.  Economically, the Kingdom of Tekrur benefit with the introduction of Islam.  It also created political ties with the North. Many Fulanis/Toucouleurs were part of the Almoravid army that conquered parts of Europe.
