The Lausanne School of economics, sometimes referred to as the Mathematical School, refers to the neoclassical economics school of thought surrounding LÃ©on Walras and Vilfredo Pareto. It is named after the University of Lausanne, at which both Walras and Pareto held professorships. The central feature of the Lausanne School was its development of general equilibrium theory. Polish economist Leon Winiarski is also said to have been a member of the Lausanne School.
