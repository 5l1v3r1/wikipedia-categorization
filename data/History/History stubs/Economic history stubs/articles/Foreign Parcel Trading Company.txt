The All-Union Association Vneshposyltorg (All-Union Foreign Mail Order Trade Association) was an organization in the Soviet Union which handled trade in imported goods for hard currency.  It was mostly known for its chain of shops Beryozka. Vneshposyltorg sold consumer goods to foreigners with an option of delivery within the Soviet territory. In this way foreigners had an opportunity to send gifts to their friends and relatives in the Soviet Union.  In 1984 cancelled forwarding the parcels from foreign firms to Soviet addresses.  With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the introduction of the conversion of rubles into hard currency the organization lost its importance and was privatized.  In 1992 it was merged with Vostokintorg to create Vneshintorg.
