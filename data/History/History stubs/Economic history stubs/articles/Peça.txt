A Peça (Portuguese) (also boa peça, peça da India, and pieza de India – Piece of India, Spanish) was a unit of value in the slave trade in West Africa through the Cape Verde Islands during the 16th to 18th centuries. A peca was the value of a healthy male or female slave between 15 and 25 years of age. Slaves between 25 and 35, and between 8 and 15 years were valued at 2/3 peça. Slaves outside this age range and those infirm were valued lower. The peça was used to establish quotas and tariffs. "Peça". Sizes, grades, units, scales, calendars, chronologies.
