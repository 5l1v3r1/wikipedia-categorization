The uncia (plural: unciae) was a Roman unit of length, weight, and volume. It survived as the Byzantine liquid ounce (Greek: ουγγία, oungía) and the origin of the English inch, ounce, and fluid ounce. The Roman inch was equal to ​1⁄12 of a Roman foot (pes), which was standardized under Agrippa to about 0.97 inches or 24.6 millimeters. The Roman ounce was ​1⁄12 of a Roman pound.
