El ladrillo (English: The Brick) is a study considered the base of many of the economic policies followed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990.  El ladrillo was finished just a few weeks before the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat. This study became known to the public in 1992 when it was published by the Centro de Estudios PÃºblicos, a think tank associated with the Chicago Boys, and with a prologue written by economist Sergio de Castro. Emilio Sanfuentes was the coordinator of the team of economists who researched the different topics.
