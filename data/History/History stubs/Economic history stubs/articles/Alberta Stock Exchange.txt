The Alberta Stock Exchange (ASE) was a stock exchange based in Calgary, Alberta, established in 1913.  It featured mostly mining, resource exploration, and oil sands stocks.  The ASE was the original listing exchange for Bre-X, one of the biggest corporate frauds in Canadian history.  On November 29, 1999, the ASE was merged into the Canadian Venture Exchange (CDNX), along with the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE) and the minor-cap stocks from the Bourse de Montr√©al (MSE). The corporate headquarters of the new CDNX remained in Calgary.
