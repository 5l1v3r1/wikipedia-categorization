Architectural History is the main journal of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain (SAHGB).  The journal is published each autumn and usually comprises around 400 pages. The architecture of the British Isles is a major theme of the journal, but articles can consider all places and periods. All articles are double peer-reviewed, anonymously; acceptance is dependent on satisfactory referees' comments and revision. All members of the SAHGB receive the journal, as do subscribing institutional libraries. Older issues from its inception in 1958 onwards are available online through JSTOR.  The lead editor, Dr Alistair Fair, is a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge.
