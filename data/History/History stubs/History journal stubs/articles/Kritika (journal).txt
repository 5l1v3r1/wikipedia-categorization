The journal currently publishes a mixture of reviews and original research, in contrast to its predecessor Kritika: A Review of Current Soviet Books on Russian History, published as a collection of reviews by Harvard University between 1964 and 1984. This original "Kritika" was the brainchild of Harvard history professor, Richard Pipes, who conceived it as an outlet for his numerous graduate students to review recent Soviet books on Russian history.
