Minerva, The International Review of Ancient Art and Archaeology, is a bi-monthly magazine publishing features on exhibitions, excavations, and museums, interviews, travelogues, auction reports, news items, and book reviews.  Minerva was established in 1990 by Jerome Eisenberg. The magazine is published by Clear Media, a division of the Media Circus Group. It contains articles by experts on the ancient art and archaeology of Egypt and the Middle East, the Graeco-Roman world and the Mediterranean, the Near East, the Far East, Scandinavia, and North and South America. Since Minerva was purchased in 2009 by the Mougins Museum of Classical Art, its subject matter has expanded to include art and the arts influenced and inspired by the ancient world, including architecture, opera, music, film and literature.
