 Revolutionary History was a British academic journal covering the history of the far left. It was established in 1988 by Sam Bornstein and Al Richardson and maintained an editorial board representing many strands of British Trotskyism.  In its articles, it also covered other anti-Stalinist communist traditions. Most issues are themed and consist of either documents which have never appeared in English or have been out of print for many years, together with contextual and introductory materials. Some issues however consist of original studies of episodes of revolutionary struggle or studies of specific individuals or organisations. The journal appeared approximately once a year. Most of the published books are online on the website.
