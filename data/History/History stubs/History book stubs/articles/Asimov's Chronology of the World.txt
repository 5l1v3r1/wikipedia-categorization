Asimov's Chronology of the World is a 1991 book by Isaac Asimov, in which the author explains in chronological order important events that happened from the Big Bang until the end of World War II.  Each chapter covers a certain time period.  The chapter is then broken down into headings for each important empire or country of the time and describes the events that happened there during that chapter's time period. The book is mostly a literary and comprehensive summary on historic people, events, and their connection and influence in historical and geographical context. Unlike most history books it gives insights rather than account of facts. The length and detail vary wildly. A substantial part of the book is dedicated to prehistory. The rest of the book is mostly European centric and most accurate in this regard. The book does have a lot of historical accounts on other parts of the world, but it is not as complete in scope or detail. An abridged version appeared as The March of the Millennia.
