The National Dream is a 1970 Canadian non-fiction book by Pierre Berton describing the planning and commencement of the Canadian Pacific Railway between 1871 and 1881. Following the book's success, a 1971 sequel (The Last Spike) described the construction phase between 1881 and 1885. Both books formed the basis for the TV miniseries The National Dream.
