The Canadian Centenary Series  is a nineteen volume authoritative history of Canada published between 1963 and 1986 as an extended Canadian Centennial project. The collection resulted from the initiative of W. L. Morton and  D. G. Creighton.  The series traces Canada's history from the early voyages of the Vikings to the 1967 Canadian Centennial year. Individual volumes are written by leading Canadian historians and each contains a bibliography. Universities worldwide consider this collection to be the appropriate starting point for any research in Canadian history.
