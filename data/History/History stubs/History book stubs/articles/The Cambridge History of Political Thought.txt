The Cambridge History of Political Thought is a series of history books published by Cambridge University Press covering the history of Western political thought from classical antiquity to the twentieth century. J. G. A. Pocock has noted that the series' volume on the early modern period focuses on a specific, "coherent and idiosyncratically Latin and Western" understanding of political thought.
