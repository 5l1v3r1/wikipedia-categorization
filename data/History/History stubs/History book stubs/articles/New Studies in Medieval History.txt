New Studies in Medieval History was a series of undergraduate level books on medieval history published by Macmillan between 1973  and the mid-1990s. French and Italian history notably featured in the list of volumes with Chris Wickham's Early Mediaeval Italy (1981), Edward James's The Origins of France (1982), and Roger Collins's Early Medieval Spain (1983) forming a trilogy that was described by Paul Fouracre in Teaching History in 1986 as being "required reading for undergraduates studying the early middle ages".  Margaret Gibson, in The English Historical Review in 1988, described the series as having a "reputation for thorough, reliable scholarship".
