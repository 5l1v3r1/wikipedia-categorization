The March of the Millennia (Walker and Company, 1991) is a history book by Isaac Asimov and Frank White, although the copyright was held by Asimov only, and White's name is in smaller letters on the cover. In his posthumous autobiography I. Asimov: A Memoir, Asimov says that he completed the book by himself (under the working title The Next Millennium).  The book is a history of the world from 8000 BC to the present day, millennium by millennium, with a further chapter speculating about what life is likely to be like in the year 3000 AD. This idea was suggested by editor Beth Walker in 1989.  Most of the book (at 196 pages) is an abridgement of Asimov's larger (675-page) book Asimov's Chronology of the World (which ends in 1945).
