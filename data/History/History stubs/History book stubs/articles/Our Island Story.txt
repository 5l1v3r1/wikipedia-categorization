Our Island Story: A Child's History of England is a book by Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall, first published in 1905 in London by T. C. & E. C. Jack.  It covers the history of England from the time of the Roman occupation until Queen Victoria's death, using a mixture of traditional history and mythology to explain the story of British history in a way accessible to younger readers.  Prime Minister David Cameron chose Our Island Story when asked to select his favourite childhood book in October 2010:  The book depicts the union of England and Scotland as a desirable and inevitable event,  and praises rebels and the collective will of the common people in opposing tyrants, including kings like John and Charles I.
