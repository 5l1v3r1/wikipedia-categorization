France and England in North America (ISBNÂ 1-425-56179-9) is a multi-volume history of the European colonization of North America written by Francis Parkman between 1865 and 1892, which highlights the military struggles between France and Great Britain. It was well regarded at the time of publication, and continues to enjoy a reputation as a literary masterpiece. While it is still useful in a limited capacity as an historical study, Parkman took many liberties in describing unknown and unknowable details. This has led some critics to categorize Parkman's work as belonging in the purgatory between history and historical fiction.  The separate volumes, and the dates of first publication, are: A single-volume condensed version, edited by John Tebbel, was published in 1948 as The Battle for North America. A two-volume unabridged version, with notes by David Levin, was published in 1983 by the Library of America as France and England in North America.
