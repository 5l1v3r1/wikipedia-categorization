The spatharokoubikoularios (Greek: σπαθαροκουβικουλάριος, "sword-chamberlain") was a Byzantine court dignity reserved for eunuch palace officials. He was a ceremonial sword-carrier assigned to the personal guard of the Byzantine emperor.  It later became a simple court rank, being the third-lowest dignity for eunuchs, coming after the ostiarios and before the koubikoularios.  According to the Klētorologion of 899, the insigne of the rank was a gold-handled sword.
