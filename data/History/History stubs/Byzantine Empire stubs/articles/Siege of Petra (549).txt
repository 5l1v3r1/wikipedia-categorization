Lazic War The Siege of Petra took place in 549 when the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, under Emperor Justinian I, besieged the town of Petra in Lazica, held by the Sasanians. The Sasanians successfully defended the town against the Roman attack.  The reason behind the Roman failure at Petra was reportedly due to failed mining operations.  Nevertheless, the Roman archery was very efficient during the siege; as they suppressed the defenders of the town, the sappers were able to approach the walls of Petra.  A year later, in 550, the Romans finally managed to retake the town from the Sasanians.
