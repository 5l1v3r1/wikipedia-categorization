The Monastery of the Transfiguration of Christ the Saviour (Greek: Μονή Μεταμορφόσεως Σωτήρος Χριστού), commonly known as the Soteros or Saviour Monastery (Μονή Σωτήρος, Turkish: Aya Sotiri manastırı) or as the Batheos Rhyakos Monastery (Μονή του Βαθέως Ρύακος), was a Byzantine-era monastery near modern Tirilye in Turkey (medieval Trigleia in Bithynia). The complex now lies ruined, although some buildings are used as animal shelters. Coordinates: 40°23′00″N 28°48′00″E﻿ / ﻿40.3833°N 28.8000°E﻿ / 40.3833; 28.8000
