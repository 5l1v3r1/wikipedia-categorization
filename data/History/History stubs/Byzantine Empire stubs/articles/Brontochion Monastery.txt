Brontochion Monastery (Greek: Βροντόχιον, Μονή Βροντοχίου) is a monastery in Mystras, Greece.   The abbot Pachomius incorporated into it the small church of the Hodegetria, or "Aphentikon", as the monastery's catholicon.    The church was reconstructed and completed around 1310, with some scholars giving 1308-1312 as the construction dates and others 1310-1322.
