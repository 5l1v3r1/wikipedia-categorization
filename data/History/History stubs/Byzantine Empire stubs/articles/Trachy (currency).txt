The term trachy (Greek: τραχύ), plural trachea (τραχέα), meaning "rough" or "uneven", was used to describe the cup-shaped (incorrectly often called "scyphate") Byzantine coins struck in the 11th–14th centuries.  The term was properly applied to coins of electrum, billon, or copper, and not to the gold hyperpyra.
