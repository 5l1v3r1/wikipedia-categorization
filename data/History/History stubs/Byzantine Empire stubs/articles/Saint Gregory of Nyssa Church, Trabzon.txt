After 1665, St Gregory became the cathedral of the city of Trabzon.  The church is dedicated to Saint Gregory of Nyssa (c. 330-395), a Christian bishop and saint. Nyssa (current day Nevşehir) is a city located in Cappadocia. In 1863 the Metropolitan Constantius of Trabzon rebuilt the church. In 1930 the church was dynamited to make way for the City Club.
