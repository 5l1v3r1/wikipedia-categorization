Hieria (in Greek variously Ἱερεῖα, Ἱερία, Ἡρία), modern Fenerbahçe, was a suburb of Byzantine-era Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey). It is prominent in the city's history as the site of an imperial palace. The name derives from Heraion akron (Greek: Ἡραῖον ἄκρον, "Cape of Hera"), which was given in antiquity to a small promontory on the Asian shore of the Bosporus, opposite Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy).  The Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) built a palace here, which included a harbour and a church dedicated to St. Mary.  The palace, which survived at least until 1203, served as a summer residence for a number of Byzantine emperors, including Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) and Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886), who added a chapel dedicated to the Prophet Elijah.  Due to its location on the Asian side of the Bosporus, the palace often served as a reception point for triumphal returns of the Byzantine emperors from campaigns in the East.  The iconoclastic "Council of Hieria" took place in the palace in 754.  Only a few traces of the original palace complex (the harbour breakwater, a cistern and funerary inscriptions) survive.
