The Battle of Svindax (Georgian: სვინდაქსის ბრძოლა) was fought during the spring of 1022 between the Byzantine army of Emperor Basil II and the Georgian army of King Giorgi I. The battle was fought at Svindax (a medieval Georgian chronicler knew it as სვინდაქსი, Suindaksi) in the Phasiane province (Basiani, Basian, or Basean). Ultimately, the Byzantines won a decisive victory. In the aftermath of the conflict, George of Georgia was forced to negotiate a peace treaty ending the Byzantine-Georgian wars over the succession of the Georgian curopalates in Asia Minor.
