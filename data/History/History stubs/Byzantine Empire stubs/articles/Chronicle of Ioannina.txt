The Chronicle of Ioannina is a prose chronicle written in Greek about the history of Ioannina during the rule of Thomas Preljubović, the Serb Despot of Epirus, who was based in Ioannina in the second half of the 14th century. The Chronicle was first attributed to the monks Proklos and Komnenos, and was therefore initially known as the Chronicle of Proklos and Komnenos. The Chronicle is deeply prejudiced  and hostile against Preljubović.  It portrays Thomas Preljubović as a ruthless and despotic tyrant, while his wife Maria Angelina Doukaina Palaiologina is described with more flattering words. The Chronicle of Ioannina is an invaluable source of information on the history of the Epirus region during the late Middle Ages. Among other information, it mentions a naval landing in Lake Pamvotis on February 26, 1379, by Albanian, Bulgarian and Vlach raiders.
