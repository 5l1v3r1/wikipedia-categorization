The klivanion or klibanion (Greek: κλιβάνιον) was a Byzantine lamellar cuirass made of metal plates (scales or lamellae) sewn on leather or cloth, with plates protecting the shoulders and the back. It is said that the name derives from the Greek klivanos (κλίβανος), meaning " oven", because this cuirass tended to get unbearably hot when worn in the sun. It was part of the armour of the Byzantine heavy cavalry.
