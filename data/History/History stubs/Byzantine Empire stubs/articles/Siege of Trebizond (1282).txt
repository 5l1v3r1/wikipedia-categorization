The Siege of Trebizond in April 1282 was an unsuccessful siege of Trebizond, the capital of the namesake empire, by the Georgian king David I of Imereti.  Little is known about the attack, but it may have relied on support within the Trapezuntine aristocracy, which opposed the rapprochement of Emperor John II of Trebizond (reigned 1280â€“1297) with the Palaiologan Byzantine court at Constantinople. Though King David failed to take the city, the Georgians occupied several provinces,  including theme of Lazia.
