The Siege of Theodosiopolis occurred in August 502, during the opening stages of the Anastasian War. The Sassanid ruler Kavadh I laid siege to the city of Theodosiopolis, a major Byzantine stronghold in western Armenia. The city was ungarrisoned by troops and its walls were weak, and surrendered after brief resistance, perhaps assisted by elements of the local population. The citizenry was treated well by the Persian king, but Constantine, the governor of the city, was taken with him as a captive. After the successful siege Kavadh I besieged other Byzantine cities such as Martyropolis and Amida. Coordinates: 39°54′00″N 41°16′00″E﻿ / ﻿39.9000°N 41.2667°E﻿ / 39.9000; 41.2667
