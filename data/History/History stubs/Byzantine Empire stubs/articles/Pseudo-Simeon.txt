Pseudo-Simeon or Pseudo-Symeon is the title given to the anonymous author of a late 10th-century Byzantine chronicle which survives in the Codex Parisinus graecus 1712. It describes world history from the Biblical creation of the world to the year 963.  For the years up to 812, the author uses Theophanes the Confessor and George Hamartolos as his sources. For later years, he uses parts of an anonymous chronicle of Leo the Armenian and Joseph Genesius. George Kedrenos used it as the model for his own chronicle up to the year 812.
