The Siege of Nisibis took place when the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, under Emperor Justin II, besieged the Sasanian city of Nisibis in 573. The Sasanians successfully defended the city and defeated the Roman force.  In line with "Justinianic model", the Romans mobilized garrisoned engineers for the attack, and ordered them to perform a "very complex siege".  The reason behind the Roman rout at Nisibis was reportedly due to quarreling amongst the Roman officers.  After the siege was lifted, the Sasanians used the Roman trebuchets that were left behind at the successful siege of Dara, later that year.
