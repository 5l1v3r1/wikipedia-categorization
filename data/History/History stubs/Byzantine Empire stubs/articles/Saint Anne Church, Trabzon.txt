The Church of Saint Anne (Greek: Ἁγία Άννα) is one of the oldest churches in Trabzon, Turkey.  The building is a Byzantine-style building, with a barrel vaulted nave and aisles,  and a sancturary flanked by side-chamber, formed from three curved apses.  Spolia is used in the building, with a classical sarcophagus used to form a tympanum over the main entrance door, showing a standing warrior and a winged Nike.  It is possible the church was built around the 6th or 7th centuries AD. On a relief slab above the south door there is an inscription stating that St. Anne was restored during the joint reigns of Basil I, Leo VI and Alexander in 884/85.
