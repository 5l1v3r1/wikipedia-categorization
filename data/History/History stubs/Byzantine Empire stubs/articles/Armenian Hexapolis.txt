The Hexapolis (Greek: Ἑξάπολις) was a district in Armenia Minor, mentioned in the early Byzantine period (7th–8th centuries). It comprised the cities of Melitene, which was the district capital, Arka, Arabissos, Kukusos, Komana and Ariaratheia. It formed part of the Roman province of Armenia Secunda, renamed to Armenia Tertia after Justinian I's provincial reorganization in 536.
