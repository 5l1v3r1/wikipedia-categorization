Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu ("Our Lady of Mesumundu") is a religious building in the territory of Siligo, Sardinia, Italy. Located in the archaeological complex with the same name, it was built in the 6th century, during the Byzantine domination of the island, over a pre-existing Roman structure (2nd century AD). The Byzantines re-used part of the walls of the Roman building, as well as the aqueduct. The edifice could have been used as a baptistery. However, it is also possible that it was used for the purification of ill people through an immersion rite.  In 1063, the structure was donated by the Giudice (duke) Barisone I of Torres to the Abbey of Montecassino. When monks came from the Italian religious community, they adapted the building for Roman Catholic use, adding an apse and a new entrance (demolished in 1934). For the work, they used materials from the nearby Roman ruins and  the nuraghe Culzu. Coordinates: 40°21′04″N 8°26′41″E﻿ / ﻿40.3510°N 8.4447°E﻿ / 40.3510; 8.4447
