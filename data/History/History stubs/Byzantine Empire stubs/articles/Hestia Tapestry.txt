The Hestia Tapestry is a Byzantine-era pagan tapestry, made in Egypt during the 6th century AD. It is now in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection in Washington DC. The tapestry is a late representation of the goddess Hestia, who it identifies in Greek as “Hestia Polyolbos" (Hestia full of Blessings)  (Greek: Ἑστία Πολύολβος). Its history and symbolism are discussed in Friedlander (1945).
