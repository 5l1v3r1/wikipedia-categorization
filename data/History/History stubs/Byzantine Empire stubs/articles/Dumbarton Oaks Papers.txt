Dumbarton Oaks Papers (DOP) is an academic journal founded in 1941 for the publication of articles relating to civilizations of the late antique, early medieval, and Byzantine periods. Publication was suspended during World War II, resuming in 1946 irregularly at first, and eventually published annually by the mid-1950s.
