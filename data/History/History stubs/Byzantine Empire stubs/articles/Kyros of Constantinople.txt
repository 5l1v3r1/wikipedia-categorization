Kyros or Cyrus (Greek: Κύρος), (? – 8 January 712) Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 705 to 712.  He is regarded as a saint in the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, which had set his feast for January 7 in Roman Catholic Church and January 8(21) in Orthodox Church. Cyrus was placed on the patriarchal throne in 705 by Emperor Justinian II, as a replacement for the deposed Patriarch Callinicus I.  Soon after Justinian's fall in December 711, Kyros was replaced by the new Emperor Philippicus with Patriarch John VI, who shared Philippicus' Monothelite sympathies.
