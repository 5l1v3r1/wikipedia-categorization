Yeremferden (died 1419), also known as Jabbar Berdi, was a khan of the Golden Horde from 1417 to 1419. He was one of the sons of Tokhtamysh who struggled for power after their father's death. His reign was marked by relative peace save for occasional struggles with Vytautas against Edigu and what would become the Nogai Horde. Following his death, control over the Horde was split between Dawlat Berdi, his son, and Ulugh Muhammad, his nephew.
