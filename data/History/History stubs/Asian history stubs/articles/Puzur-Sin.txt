Puzur-Sin was an Assyrian vice regent who was responsible for driving out Asinum the Amorite vassal king of the Babylonians from Assyria, and allowing the native Ashur-dugul to seize the throne.   A period of civil war followed this event which ended Babylonian and Amorite influence in Assyria by 1720 BC.
