The Joint Communiqu√© of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China was signed in Beijing on 29 September 1972. This established diplomatic relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China and resulted in the severing of official relations between Japan and the Republic of China (Taiwan).  Specifically, the treaty ended the "abnormal relations between Japan and China," recognized the People's Republic of China as the "sole government of China" and renounced any claim for war reparations from World War II. It firmly maintains its stand under Article 8 of the Potsdam Declaration.
