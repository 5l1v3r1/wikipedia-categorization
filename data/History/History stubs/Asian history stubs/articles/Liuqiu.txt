Liuqiu or Lewchew (Chinese: 流求,琉求, or琉球; pinyin: Liúqiú) is the name historically given by Chinese writers to a territory in the region of the East China Sea, sometimes in mythical or legendary contexts. The name is currently used for the Ryukyu Islands. A detailed description of an island kingdom called "Liuqiu" may be found in the Book of Sui.  The Book of Sui places the report on Liuqiu second to last within the chapter on "Eastern Barbarians" (Dongyi), following the report on Mohe and preceding the report on Wa (Japan). The text describes the territory of Liuqiu and its people as follows: There is no scholarly consensus on what specific territory "Liuqiu" refers to in the Book of Sui and History of Yuan. Bi-yu Chang notes that "Some scholars believe that the record of 'Liuqiu' referred to Taiwan, while some say it was a reference to what are now the Ryukyu Islands ... and others suggest that it was a general term referring to islands in the East China Sea and nearby waters".  In his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan clearly used "Liuqiu" as a name for Taiwan or the part of it near to Penghu.  In later works, the name refers to the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú. After Shō Hashi unified the three kingdoms on Okinawa, the Yongle Emperor gave him the title "King of Liuqiu" in 1428.
