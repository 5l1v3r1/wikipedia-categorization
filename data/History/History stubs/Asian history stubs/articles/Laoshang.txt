Laoshang (Chinese: 老上; r. 174–160 BCE), whose proper name was Jiyu (Chinese: 稽粥), was a Chanyu of the Xiongnu Empire who succeeded his father Modu Chanyu. During his reign the expansion of Xiongnu power expanded; the Yuezhi were defeated, and the Xiongnu thus gained control of the Hexi Corridor. In 177 or 176 BCE, following direction from his father Modu (Mao-tun), Lao-sheng was "to put an end to the danger of the Yueh-chih, make their king's skull into a drinking cup, chasing them from Kansu, and force them emigrate westward."  Laoshang in Chinese means "old and elevated' and is probably a translation from a Xiongnu title, but might represent an attempt to phonetically represent a Xiongnu word.  In 162 BCE, the Xiongnu defeated the Yuezhi for the fourth time.   After this defeat, the majority of the Yuezhi (referred to by the Chinese as the Da Yuezhi) fled to the northwest and settled in the region of the Ili River, while a smaller group (referred to by the Chinese as the Xiao Yuezhi = "Lesser" or "Smaller" Yuezhi) fled into the southern mountains and settled amongst some of the Qiang tribes. The Shiji chap. 110 says: "Shortly after this, Maodun died and his son Jizhu was set up with the title of Old Shanyu. When Jizhu became Shanyu [in 174 BCE], Emperor Wen sent a princess of the imperial family to be his consort, dispatching a eunuch from Yan named Zhonghang Yue to accompany her as her tutor.
