Junchen (Chinese: 軍臣; r. 161–126 BCE) was a Chanyu of the Xiongnu, the successor to Laoshang Chanyu. During his long reign Junchen outlived the Han emperors Wen (r. 180–157 BC), Jing (r. 157–141 BC), and died during the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC). All three Chinese emperors confirmed the heqin peace and kinship treaty with the Xiongnu. The treaty generally held during the reign of Junchen Chanyu, however, the Chinese annals note that the mutual relations were imperiled on a number of occasions, which included appeals of the Chinese contenders for the Xiongnu's assistance and protection, the Xiongnu's retaliatory raids as punishments for violation of the treaty terms, and one direct Chinese assault against the Chanyu. The Xiongnu were especially sensitive about unimperiled trade relations, which were one of the terms of the heqin treaty, and the Chinese annals specifically note a number of instances of the border trade opening, implying that the border trade was at times banned. The ambush happened in the 133 BCE, when Junchen Chanyu was lured inside the border, and he almost run into an ambush of a 300,000 strong Chinese army. Only a disclosure by a Chinese officer about the planned ambush saved the Chanyu. After the failed ambush, the treaty was practically abrogated, the relations soured, the border traders were assaulted, in 127 BC the Chinese army attacked and expelled the Xiongnu tribes Loufan and Bayan (白羊王) from the Ordos, and then built fortifications and forts to retain the captured territory. The next winter, 126 BCE, Junchen died; his younger brother, a Eastern Luli-Prince Ichise (or Ichisye) ascended the Chanyu throne (r. 126-114 BCE).
