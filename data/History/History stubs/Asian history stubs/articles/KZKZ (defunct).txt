KZKZ (729Â kHz AM) was the second radio station in the Philippines. It began broadcasting in 1922 and was founded by Henry Hermann, the owner of the Electrical Supply Company in Manila. The station was upgraded in 1924 to a 100-watt station and its call letters KZKZ were adopted. Later that year, the station was sold to the Radio Corporation of the Philippines.  The first radio broadcast in the Philippines was made in 1922 from Nichols air field by using a five-watt transmitter. In 1926, the organization began work on constructing two of the largest radio stations in Asia with the idea of maintaining direct Manila-San Francisco service.
