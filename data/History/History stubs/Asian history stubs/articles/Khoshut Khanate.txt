Timeline · History · Rulers ·  Nobility The Khoshut Khanate was an Oirat khanate based in the Tibetan Plateau in the 17th and the 18th centuries. It was established in 1642 by Güshi Khan, a Khoshut prince and leader of the Upper Mongols. He was enthroned by the Dalai Lama as Khan and protector-ruler of Tibet. With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. This Tibetan government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang. the Ganden Phodrang government lasted until the 1950s, when Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China. The Khoshut Khanate was conquered by the troops of the Dzungar Khanate in 1717, who deposed Yeshe Gyatso, a pretender to the position of the Dalai Lama promoted by Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of the Khoshut Khanate. The Dzungars were in turn expelled by the expedition forces of the Qing dynasty from Tibet in 1720.
