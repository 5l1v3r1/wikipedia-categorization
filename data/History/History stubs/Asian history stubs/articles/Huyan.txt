The Huyan (Chinese: 呼延; Wade–Giles: Hu-yen) was a noble house that led the last remnants of the Northern Xiongnu to Dzungaria during the second century after the Battle of the Altai Mountains. The House of Huyan is an earlier maternal lineage name subsequently replaced by Xubu, much as the Ashina and Yujiulu (郁久閭).    Mongolian Khiyad tribe's name is probably derived from Huyan.  By the 3rd century BCE, the upper stratum of the Xiongnu was made up of five aristocratic houses, Luandi (house of the Chanyu and the Tuqi King of the east and west), Huyan, Xubu, Qiulin and Lan. Both the Huyan and Xubu settled in the east, Qiulin and Lan in the west and Luandi at the center of Mongolia.
