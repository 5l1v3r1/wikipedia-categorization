The Dr Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail (Chinese: 孫中山史蹟徑) was set up in November 1996 by the Central and Western District Council to commemorate the 130th birthday of Sun Yat-sen. It includes 15 spots in the areas of Central and Sheung Wan in Hong Kong, related to the life of Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries in the late Qing era. Originally the Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail, it was renovated and renamed and two spots (now the 1st and the 7th spots) were added to it when Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum was opened in 2006.
