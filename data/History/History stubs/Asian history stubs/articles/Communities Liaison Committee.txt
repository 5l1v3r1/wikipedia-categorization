 The Communities Liaison Committee (CLC) was established in 1949  by the British rulers of Malaysia, comprising the top echelon of Malayan politicians from different communities, to address sensitive issues, especially those related to ethnicity. Compromises on a number of issues, including citizenship, education, democracy, and Malay supremacy, were agreed on and set the stage for Malayan independence.  The CLC was chaired by Malcolm MacDonald, the British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.  The Communities Liaison Committee was a prototype for multiracial political cooperation.
