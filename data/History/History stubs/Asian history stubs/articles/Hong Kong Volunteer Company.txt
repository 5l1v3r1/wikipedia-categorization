Hong Kong Volunteer Company (Chinese: 香港志願連) was a company that served in India and Burma during the Burma Campaign in World War II. Following the Hong Kong surrender, a number of British-Chinese soldiers made their escape to China and volunteered to go to India to join the British Army and fight the Japanese. They were originally attached to the Chindits Force and later deployed to Japanese-occupied Malaya conducting special reconnaissance behind enemy lines.
