Ukrainian Venezuelans are Venezuelans of Ukrainian heritage. The Ukrainian diaspora increased after 1945 due to a second wave of political emigrants. In the latter half of the 1940s and early 1950s, these Ukrainians were resettled in many different countries creating new Ukrainian settlements in Australia and Venezuela. In Venezuela the population is estimated to be around 10,000 Ukrainians.
