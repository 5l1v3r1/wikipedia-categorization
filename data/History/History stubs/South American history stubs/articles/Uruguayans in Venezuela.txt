Uruguayan Venezuelans are people born in Uruguay who live in Venezuela, or Venezuelan-born people of Uruguayan descent. Modern estimates put the figure of Uruguayans in Venezuela at ca. 9,000.  There are lots of Uruguayan-born persons living in Venezuela, for a number of reasons. Both countries share the Spanish language; the historical origins of both nations is common (part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century); Venezuela has a bigger economy, which attracted Uruguayans in search of opportunities; and, from the political point of view, during the civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985) Venezuela stayed a democratic country, so there were several Uruguayans that went exiled to Venezuela. But in recent years of Chavismo, some of them are going back to Uruguay.  Uruguayan residents in Venezuela have their own institutions, for instance, the Uruguayan-Venezuelan Center  and the Consultative Council in Caracas.
