Uruguayan Ecuadorians are people born in Uruguay who live in Ecuador, or Ecuadorian-born people of Uruguayan descent.  There are lots of Uruguayan-born persons living in Ecuador, for a number of reasons. Both countries share the Spanish language; the historical origins of both nations is common (part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century).  Uruguayan-style pizza and asado can be found on selected places in Ecuador.
