Oyapoc was a short-lived English settlement in Guyana, which was established in 1620 under Governor Roger North and abandoned in the same year. Most of the area was dominated by the Dutch with two colonies; they added a third in the mid-eighteenth century. Britain took over the region in 1796, during hostilities with France, which then occupied the Netherlands. After rule was passed back and forth, Britain took final control in 1814.
