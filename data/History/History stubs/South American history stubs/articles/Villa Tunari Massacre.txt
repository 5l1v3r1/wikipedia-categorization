The Villa Tunari Massacre' or Battle of Villa Tunari was a 27 June 1988 mass killing committed by UMOPAR (Rural Patrol Mobile Unit) troops against peasants and cocaleros in the town of Villa Tunari in Chapare Province, Bolivia. The cocalero movement had mobilized since late May 1988 in opposition to coca eradication under Law 1008, then on the verge of becoming law.  The attack killed 12 people and injured over a hundred.     Bolivian president Evo Morales recalls being present at the confrontation: "I was a witness to how the gringos from the DEA fired upon us and the Villa Tunari massacre was made. Later, we recovered cadavers drowned in the river and others with bullet wounds. It was all for the defense of the coca leaf against Law 1008."  The massacre helped bring about the consolidation of Chapare unions into the Coordinadora of the Six Federations of the Tropic of Cochabamba.  16 people were killed in an attempt to overrun the UMOPAR outcamp at Villa Tunari, many by running off a cliff into the river below.
