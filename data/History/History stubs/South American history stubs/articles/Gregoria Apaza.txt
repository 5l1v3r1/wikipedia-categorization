Gregoria Apaza (1751â€“1782), was an indigenous leader in 18th century Bolivia. In 1781, she participated with her brother Julian Apaza (Tupac Katari) and sister-in-law Bartolina Sisa in a major indigenous revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Bolivia. These Aymara leaders laid siege to the cities of La Paz and Sorata before being defeated and executed.
