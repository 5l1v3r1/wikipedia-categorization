Uruguayan Bolivians are people born in Uruguay who live in Bolivia, or Bolivian-born people of Uruguayan descent. There are lots of Uruguayan-born persons living in Bolivia, for a number of reasons. Both countries share the Spanish language; the historical origins of both nations is common (part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century); both countries are members of MERCOSUR, there is no need of special migration documents, and geographical vicinity makes circulation easy. In the decade of the 2010s there have been several Uruguayan investors purchasing productive land in Bolivia.  There is an Association of Uruguayan Residents in Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
