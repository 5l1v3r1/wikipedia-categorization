A Spanish Venezuelan is a Venezuelan citizen of Spanish origin or descent. There are many Venezuelans of Spanish origin, especially from the Canary Islands (known as Isle√±os). Most Venezuelans have some Spanish ancestry. Spanish immigration to Venezuela begins with the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and it continued during Colonial Venezuela and after independence (1830). Further immigration has taken place since, particularly following World War II. In addition, as of 2010, there were around 200,000 Venezuelans residing in Spain.  As of January 2016, there were 188,025 Spanish citizens in Venezuela.  Most Venezuelans in Spain have Spanish nationality.
