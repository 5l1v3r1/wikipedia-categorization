In Latin American history, republiquetas were independence-seeking guerrilla groups in the period 1811-1825 in Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia). After the defeat of the auxiliary Argentine armies in the Battle of Huaqui, an amalgam of urban republicans, campesinos, and Argentine agents effectively occupied vast, generally rural areas. The largest cities were occupied only for brief periods and eventually nearly all of these guerrilla movements were defeated by royalist forces before Sucre became a part of Upper Peru.
