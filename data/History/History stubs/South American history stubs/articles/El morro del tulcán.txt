El Morro del Tulcán (lit. Tulcán Hill) is an Indian pyramid in Popayán, Colombia. The pyramid dates to at least 1535, as the Spanish Empire found it abandoned when they arrived in that year.  Research suggests that the individuals buried there came from the very top of the social classes of their society.  The pyramid was constructed in the pre-Columbian period, approximately between 1600 - 500 BC; the period which is now known as "the Delayed Cacicales Societies". On this pyramid a statue dedicated to the Conquistador Sebastián de Belalcázar exists today; he carried out the Spanish foundation of Popayán. The location of the statue of the Conquistador on an indigenous monument is controversial. El Morro del Tulcán is the main archaeological site of Popayán.
