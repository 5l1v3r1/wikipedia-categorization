Carlos Clarens (1930â€“1987) was a film historian and writer on the cinema particularly noted for his sensitive, pioneering Illustrated History of the Horror Film (1967, revised 1968). Having left Havana in his younger years, he made his mark in both Paris and New York, providing subtitles in the five languages with which he was fluent. Upon his death, tributes were held at New York's Little Theatre at the Public Theater, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Paris' Cinematheque.
