Muhammad al-Khushanī, or Al-Khushanī of Qayrawān (Kairouan, unknown date - Córdoba, 971), was an Arab historian, jurist and judge.   After the rise of the Fatamid conquest in Tunisia, al-Khushani fled to the Umayyad court in Cordoba in 923 AD, like other Maliki scholars did at the time. He is famous for his collection of documents, titled Kitāb al-qudā bi-Qurtuba, where he fills documents of the Andalusian archives, oral tradition and biographical information about the qadi of Córdoba. He also wrote extensively on the various madhabs in his time, including the Hanafi and Ismaili.  He died in 971 AD.
