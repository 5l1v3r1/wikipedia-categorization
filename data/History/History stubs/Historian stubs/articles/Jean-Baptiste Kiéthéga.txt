Jean-Baptiste Kiéthéga is an archeologist and historian from Upper Volta, currently Burkina Faso. Kiéthéga was born on May 10, 1947, in Yako. He is considered to be one of the first archeologists of West Africa. In course of his career, he was honored with a Prince Claus Award yet in 1998 for his progressions in archeology. At that time he had trained around 40 young scholars in this field, and has taken care that his research was made public in the academic world, as well as to the public via for instance museums.  According to Kiéthéga archaeological research in a developing country like Burkina Faso should not be seen as luxury. He views culture as a dynamic concept.  Since 2005 he is a professor at the University of Ouagadougou.
