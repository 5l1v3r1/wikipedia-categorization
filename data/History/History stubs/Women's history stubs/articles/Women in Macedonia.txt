Women in Macedonia are women who live in or are from the Republic of Macedonia. They live in a Macedonian society that is customarily patriarchal. Being in a country that was ravaged by internal conflict known as the Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian women played roles in peacebuilding during time periods classified as the pre-conflict period, the conflict period, and the post-conflict period.  Traditionally, the women of Macedonia perform domestic work. In the field of academics, some Macedonian women focus in the study of Humanities. Some women in Macedonia hold positions of authority.  Women receive "inheritance" through the dowry system, because inheritance is traditionally transferred to male heirs. Some modern-day women receive inheritance that is divided among siblings by their parents. The traditional way women greet each other involves exchanging kisses. Traditional medicine is handled by some  women of the older generation, who act as faith healers, healing people against illnesses caused by the so-called "evil eye."
