The Women's Liberal Federation was an organisation that was part of the Liberal Party in the United Kingdom. The Women's Liberal Federation (WLF) was formed on the initiative of Sophia Fry, who in 1886 called a meeting at her house of fifteen local Women's Liberal Associations.  The establishment of a national organisation was agreed, and this occurred in 1887, when members of forty associations met in London.   It was reported that the federation membership was about 6,000,  but this grew rapidly, reaching 75,000 in 1892.  By 1904 there were 494 affiliated associations and a membership of approximately 67,600.  Until 1892, the group was divided between supporters of women's suffrage and those who stated that they were neutral on the matter.  That year, William Gladstone wrote a letter opposing votes for women, and the group held a three day debate to establish a firm position.  At the close of the debate, delegates votes to support suffrage; this led between 50 and 60 branches which did not support the policy to leave, consisting of 7,000 to 10,000 members.  They formed the rival Women's National Liberal Association.  As of 1905, the WLF's objectives included promoting just legislation for women, through the introduction of votes for women at local and parliamentary elections, on the same basis as men.  In 1988, when the Liberal Party merged with the SDP to form the Liberal Democrats, the WLF was wound up. The WLF President was elected annually, and served for a one-year term.
