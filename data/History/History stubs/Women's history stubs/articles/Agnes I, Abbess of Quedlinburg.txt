Agnes I (born c. 1090; died 29 December 1125 in Quedlinburg) was Abbess of Gandersheim and Quedlinburg. She was the second daughter of Judith of Swabia and Władysław I Herman. She was the granddaughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. Agnes became abbess at Gandersheim Abbey, place of several famous women, such as Hroswitha of Gandersheim, recorded by Conrad Celtes. She was Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1110 until 1125. She was excommunicated by Pope Calixtus II for her loyalty to her paternal uncle, Henry V, the King of the Romans in 1119.
