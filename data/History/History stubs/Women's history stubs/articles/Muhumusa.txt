Muhumusa (died 1945) was a feared leader of the east African Nyabingi spiritual practice  which was influential in Rwanda and Uganda from 1850 to 1950.  She organized armed resistance against German colonialists and was eventually detained by the British in Kampala, Uganda, from 1913 to her death in 1945. Muhumusa was said to have been possessed by the spirit of a legendary Africa goddess of Nyabinghi.  She was described by the colonial governments as "an extraordinary character."  The Niyabinghi Theocracy Government, a Mansion of Rastafari, was named after the cult founded by Muhumusa.
