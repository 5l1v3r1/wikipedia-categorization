He had been bequeathed the kingdom to Navarre.  His right to be King of Navarre had been recognised by the Cortes; but his mother Blanche died in 1441, her husband King John II of Aragon had seized the kingdom to the exclusion of his son. Charles and Agnes had no children.   Agnes died on 6 April 1448, aged only 25 or 26. After Agnes' death, her husband decided to remarry with his choice being Infanta Catherine of Portugal.
