Ada of Caria (Ancient Greek: Ἄδα) (fl. 377 – 326 BC)  was a member of the House of Hecatomnus (the Hecatomnids) and ruler of Caria in the 4th century BC, first as Persian Satrap and later as Queen under the auspices of Alexander III (the Great) of Macedon. Ada was the daughter of Hecatomnus, satrap of Caria, and sister of Mausolus, Artemisia, Idrieus, and Pixodarus. She was married to her brother Idrieus, who succeeded Artemisia in 351 BC and died in 344 BC. On the death of her husband Ada became satrap of Caria, but was expelled by her brother Pixodarus in 340 BC. Ada fled to the fortress of Alinda, where she maintained her rule in exile. When Alexander the Great entered Caria in 334 BC, Ada adopted Alexander as her son and surrendered Alinda to him. In return, Alexander accepted the offer and gave Ada formal command of the Siege of Halicarnassus.  After the fall of Halicarnassus, Alexander returned Alinda and made Ada queen of the whole of Caria.  Ada's popularity with the populace in turn ensured the Carians' loyalty to Alexander. According to Turkish archaeologists, the tomb of Ada has been discovered, although this claim remains unresolved. Her remains are on display in the archaeological museum of Bodrum.  Suzanne Bernert played her role in  2018 Indian television series  Porus.
