Onomaris was a Galatian woman who is described in Tractatus De Mulieribus. According to that source, her people, suffering from scarcity and needed to flee their land, offering to obey anyone willing to lead them. When no man accepted the offer, Onomaris pooled their resources and led the emigration. She crossed the Ister and ruled over the land after defeating the local inhabitants in battle.  She is estimated to have lived at around the 4th century BC.  The name Onomaris appears to be a compound, with variants the "-maris" element appearing in several Celtic languages, meaning "great".  It may also mean "mountain ash",  or possibly "like a great mountain ash or rowan tree".
