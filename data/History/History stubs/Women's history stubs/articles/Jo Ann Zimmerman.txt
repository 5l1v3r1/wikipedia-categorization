Jo Ann McIntosh Zimmerman (born December 24, 1936) is an American politician who served as the 42nd Lieutenant Governor of Iowa from 1987 to 1991.  A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman to serve in the office of Lieutenant Governor in Iowa history. Zimmerman was born on December 24, 1936, in Van Buren County, Iowa as the eldest of three children. In 1982, Zimmerman won election to the Iowa House where she advocated various health issues, and won the 1986 election for Lieutenant Governor of Iowa, separately from Governor Terry Branstad.  As Lt. Governor, Zimmerman advocated for the removal of her own office (as it was considered a figurehead position) and championed other progressive causes in her position. Zimmerman briefly entered the 1990 gubernatorial election to unseat incumbent governor Branstad, but dropped out to run on the Iowa Democratic Party ticket as Lt. Governor with Donald Avenson (who subsequently lost to Branstad). She left office in 1991 and has since continued to advocate on behalf of healthcare, farming, and human rights issues.
