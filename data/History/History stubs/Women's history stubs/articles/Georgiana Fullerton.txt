Lady Georgiana Fullerton (23 September 1812 – 19 January 1885) was an English novelist. Georgiana Charlotte Leveson-Gower was the daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville and his wife Lady Harriet Cavendish, and a sister of Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, a prominent statesman.  In 1833 she married in Paris an attaché of the embassy, Alexander George Fullerton, who came from Ireland. She converted to Roman Catholicism in 1846 and wrote  The Life of St. Frances of Rome, and Others. She wrote several novels, some of which were very successful. They include Ellen Middleton (1844), Grantley Manor (1847), Lady Bird (1852), Life of St.Francis of Rome (1855), The Countess of Bonneval (1858), Rose Leblanc (1861), Laurentia, a Tale of Japan (1861),  Too Strange Not to Be True (1864), Constance Sherwood (1865), A Stormy Life (1867), Helpers of the Holy Soul (1868), Mrs. Gerald's Niece (1869), Life of Louisa de Carvajal (1873), A Will and a Way (1881), and Life of Elizabeth Lady Falkland (1883). She also published two volumes of verse. She founded Saint Walburga's School, in Bournemouth, which survives, albeit on a new site, and a Blue Plaque to commemorate her Catholic activities can be found on the Sacred Heart church in Bournemouth. In a margin note in his copy of Ellen Middleton, Edgar Allan Poe wrote: A remarkable work, and one which I find much difficulty in admitting to be the composition of a woman. Not that many good and glorious things have not been the composition of women — but, because, here, the severe precision of style, the thoroughness, and the luminousness, are points never observable, in even the most admirable of their writings.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cousin, John William (1910).
