Yelizaveta Palmenbach (1761–1832) was an Imperial Russian pedagogue, the principal of the Smolny Institute in Saint Petersburg from 1797–1802.  She was the daughter of Baron Aleksandr Ivanovich Cherkasov and Hedvig Elizabeth von Biron (1727–1797), sister of Peter von Biron. She was educated at the Smolny Institute, where she graduated in 1779, and was a lady-in-waiting prior to her marriage to Yevstafi Palmenbach in 1793, with whom she had three daughters. In 1796, she became assistant director of Sophie Lafont, and replaced her as principal in 1797. She was also the governess of the Grand Duchesses.
