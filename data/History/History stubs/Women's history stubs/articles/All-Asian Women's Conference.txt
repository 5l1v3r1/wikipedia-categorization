The All-Asian Women's Conference (AAWC) was a women's conference convened in Lahore in January 1931, the first pan-Asian women's conference of its kind. Dominated by Indian organisers, "the AAWC was a vehicle for Indian women to voice their ideas and vision of an Indian-centred Asia".  Margaret Cousins, together with Indian activists who had taken part in the 1927 All Indian Women's Conference, set up the AAWC. Signatories to the circular which invited delegates included Sarojini Naidu, Muthulakshmi Reddi, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Lady Abdul Qadir, Rani Lakshmibai Rajwade and Hilla Rustomji Faridoonji.
