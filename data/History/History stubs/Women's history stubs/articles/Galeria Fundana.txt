Galeria Fundana (c. 40 â€“ aft. 69) was a Roman empress of the 1st century CE, the second wife of Roman emperor Vitellius. Suetonius tells us that Galeria was the daughter of an ex-praetor, and bore two children during her marriage, a son and a daughter.   Gwyn Morgan adds that she was related to Publius Galerius Trachalus, "Otho's alleged speechwriter".   Tacitus, who writes unfavourably about Vitellius, claims that Galeria was a woman of "exemplary virtue" who "took no part in [Vitellius's] horrors."  Her son Vitellius, renamed Germanicus by his father in 69, was killed after supporters of Vespasian took control of Rome, together with Vitellius himself. Galeria's life was spared and she was allowed to bury her husband. Her daughter, Vitellia was helped by a generous Vespasian to make a good marriage.
