Elizabeth Booth (born 1674) was a resident of Salem, Massachusetts Bay Colony, who became one of the accusers during the Salem Witch Trials.   At 18, Booth was a member of the “outer circle” of girls who  supposedly afflicted by witchcraft, and she participated in examinations, inquests, and trials.  Booth lived near John Proctor and his wife Elizabeth Proctor, and most of her court proceedings referenced the Proctors.   Booth's testimony helped lead to the hangings of John Proctor and Wilmot Redd, the pressing to death of Giles Corey, and the imprisonment and death sentence of the pregnant Elizabeth Proctor. In October 1692, she married Jonathon Pease.
