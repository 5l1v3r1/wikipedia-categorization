The Women's Party (Arnat Partiiat) was a feminist political party in Greenland.  At the 2002 legislative elections the party won 2.4% of the popular vote and no seats.  On November 6, 1999, in response to the still much lower representation of women in politics, a group of women formed the party. Several members ran for the parliamentary election in 2002. The Women's Party was in short of votes. The party was dissolved in the spring of 2008.
