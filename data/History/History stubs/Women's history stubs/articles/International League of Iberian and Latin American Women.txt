International League of Iberian and Latin American Women (Liga Internacional de Mujeres Ib√©ricas e Hispanoamericanas) is an international organization of Latin American and Iberian women. It was formed in 1921 by liberal feminists from both regions. Early on the league was led by Paulina Luisi of Uruguay, while Carmen de Burgos of Madrid served as its first president, and Elena Arizmendi Mejia was the founding vice president. During the 1920s, national chapters emerged.  The league served as a national alternative to the US-dominated Inter-American Commission of Women (IACW) of the Pan-American Union into the 1930s.
