Ghislaine Marie Françoise Dommanget (13 October 1900 – 30 April 1991) was a French actress and the Princess consort of Monaco from 1946 to 1949. Dommanget was the daughter of Colonel Robert Joseph Dommanget (1867–1957) and his wife, Marie Louise Meunier (1867–1957). She married Paul Diey (1863–1931) in 1923  and subsequently André Brulé, an actor. She divorced Brulé and married the reigning Prince of Monaco, Louis II, on 24 July 1946 — the first bride of a member of the House of Grimaldi without a dowry. Following Louis II's death on 9 May 1949, and the accession of her step-grandson, Rainier III, she became Dowager Princess of Monaco, a title she held until her death.
