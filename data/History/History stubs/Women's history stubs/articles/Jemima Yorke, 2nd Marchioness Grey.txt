Jemima Yorke, 2nd Marchioness Grey and Countess of Hardwicke (9 October 1723 â€“ 10 January 1797) was a British peeress. She was a daughter of John Campbell, 3rd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland and Lady Amabel Grey. Her maternal grandparents were Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, and his first wife, the former Jemima Crew. On 22 May 1740, she married Hon. Philip Yorke (later Earl of Hardwicke) and they later had two daughters: On 5 June that year, she succeeded as Marchioness Grey by a special remainder upon the death of her maternal grandfather, the Duke of Kent, who held the title. As she had no male heirs, the title later became extinct upon her own death in 1797, but her elder daughter was later created Countess de Grey in her own right.
