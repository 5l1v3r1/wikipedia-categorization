Claribel Kendall (January 23, 1889 â€“ April 17, 1965) was an American mathematician. Born in Denver, Colorado, Kendall earned a BA and B.Ed. in 1912 and an MA in 1914 from the University of Colorado.  Her master's thesis was called "Preassociative syzygies in linear algebra". She taught at the university from 1913 until her retirement in 1957. She earned her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1922, writing her doctoral thesis, "Congruences determined by a given surface", under Professor Ernest Julius Wilczynski.   The work, about a surface defined by two differential equations, was published in the American Journal of Mathematics the following year.  Kendall was a member of the Christian Science Church. She was secretary of the UC chapter of Phi Beta Kappa for over 30 years and the chapter gives out awards in her name. Kendall received the Robert L.
