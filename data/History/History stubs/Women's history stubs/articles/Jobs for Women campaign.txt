The Jobs for Women campaign was a public campaign waged during the 1980s to win the right for women to work at the Port Kembla steelworks in Wollongong, Australia.  The campaign won a historic court case under the Anti-Discrimination Act and set a precedent for the employment of women in non-traditional areas of work.    The Port Kembla steelworks was owned by Australian Iron & Steel, a subsidiary of BHP, the largest company in Australia at the time.  AI&S employed around 20,000 people, but women were routinely told there were no jobs for them.  In 1980, 34 women lodged complaints with the newly-created NSW Anti-Discrimination Board. As a result, 150 women were hired by AI&S to work as ironworkers. When an economic recession hit two years later, most of the women were retrenched based on the rule of "last hired, first fired". The same women then lodged a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Board and argued that if they had been hired when they first applied for a job years before, they would not have lost their job in the latest round of retrenchments.  In 1989, the High Court ruled that AIS employment practices amounted to unlawful directand indirect discrimination, awarding the women $1.4 million.  Former Sex Discrimination Commissioner Sue Walpole described the case as “the most important piece of discrimination litigation that has occurred in this country”.  The campaign took 14 years, making it the longest-running sex discrimination claims in Australia.
