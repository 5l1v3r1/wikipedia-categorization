  Ada Roe (née Giddings; 6 February 1858 – 11 January 1970)   was a British supercentenarian. She was born in Islington, England, and moved to Lowestoft, Suffolk over 60 years before her death with her husband, who died shortly afterwards.  Roe was the oldest recognised living person between 4 May 1969 and her death aged 111 years 339 days at Lowestoft, England.   She ran a dairy shop in Lowestoft for over 75 years, continuing to help at the age of 110.  She attributed her longevity to a good childhood.  She lived 12 days longer than Anglo Irish botanical artist and aristocrat Katherine Plunket, hence breaking the record for the oldest lived person in the United Kingdom, a record that the latter held for 38 years.
