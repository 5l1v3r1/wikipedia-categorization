The Dublin Women's Suffrage Association was an organisation for women's suffrage which was set up in Dublin in 1874. Its first secretaries were Anna Haslam and Miss McDowell.   It changed its name several times: first to the Dublin Women's Suffrage and Poor Law Guardian Association, when women won eligibility as poor law guardians, then formally to the Dublin Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association when they gained all local government franchises and eligibility for election as district councillors, and in 1898 to the Irish Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association as the suffrage movement expanded coming up to the turn of the century.   As well as campaigning for women's suffrage, it sought to advance women's position in local government. Prominent members of the association in the 20th century were Lady Margaret Dockrell, Bridget Dudley Edwards and Mary Hayden.  Prominent supporters included Charles Cameron (physician), Sir Andrew Reed, William Redmond MP, and William Field MP.  Following the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act (1919) Lady Dockrell was one of the first Women Justices of the Peace to be appointed.
