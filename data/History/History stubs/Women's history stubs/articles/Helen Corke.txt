Helen Corke (1882â€“1978) was an English writer. As a schoolteacher in Croydon, she became acquainted with D. H. Lawrence, and her diary served as the inspiration for Lawrence's second novel The Trespasser.  She also became a close friend of Lawrence's lover Jessie Chambers, and later published a memoir about her entitled D.H. Lawrence's Princess. Well into her 90s, she wrote an autobiographical work In Our Infancy which won the 1975 Whitbread Award.
