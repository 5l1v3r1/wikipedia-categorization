Ahfad University for Women is a private women's university in Omdurman, Sudan.  that was founded in 1966, by Yusuf Badri, son of the Mahdist soldier, Babiker Badri. The University began with only 23 students and 3 teachers. It was the first Sudanese women's college.  The current president is Dr. Gasim Badri, Yusuf Badri's son.  The Ahfad University for Women was founded in a familial tradition of educating girls in Sudan. After the battle of 1898 when Sudanese National Forces were defeated by the Anglo-Egyptian Army, Babiker Badri--a Sudanese survivor--traveled to and settled in the village of Rufu'a. It was there that he opened up a secular school for boys. In 1904, he asked British authorities for permission to open an elementary school for girls--who he believed also needed to be educated. His request was denied twice before it was granted by James Currie, the Director of the Educational Department of the British in Sudan. In 1907, Babiker Badri opened up his secular school for girls in a mud hut with nine of his own daughters along with eight neighborhood girls.    The Badri family carried on this tradition of private education for three generations in Sudan. Babiker's son, Yusuf established Ahfad in 1966. The university began with only 23 students and three faculty members, including Yusuf.   The university was granted full university status in 1995 by the Sudan National Council for Higher Education due to its expansion of curriculum and student body. It is now the oldest and largest private university in Sudan to date.  The university has the following undergraduate schools: It offers graduate programs in: AUW's medium of instruction is English.
