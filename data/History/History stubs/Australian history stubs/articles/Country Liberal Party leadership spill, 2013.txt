 Terry Mills Adam Giles A leadership spill of the Country Liberal Party (CLP) in the Northern Territory occurred on 13 March 2013, less than a year after the Terry Mills-led CLP opposition defeated the Paul Henderson-led Labor government at the 2012 election, winning 16 of 25 seats. Transport Minister Adam Giles officially replaced Mills as Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and leader of the CLP on 14 March 2013 with 11 votes to 5.  The events occurred while Mills was on a trade mission in Japan.  Giles became the first indigenous head of government of an Australian state or territory.   Resulting from the 2015 CLP leadership ballot on 2 February, the possibility of a confidence motion being put to the assembly was raised by Willem Westra van Holthe to take over the leadership from Giles, however Giles managed to retain the leadership and continued to govern.  Multiple defections saw the CLP reduced to minority government a few months later.   The 2016 election was held on 27 August.
