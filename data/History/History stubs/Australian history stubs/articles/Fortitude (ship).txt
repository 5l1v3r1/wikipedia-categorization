  Fortitude was a sailing ship.  In 1848-9, she was the first of three ships chartered by the Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang to bring free immigrants to Brisbane, Australia, arriving on 21 January 1849; the other ships being the Chaseley (arriving on 1 May 1849) and the Lima (arriving on 3 November 1849).  Captained by John Christmas, with the medical superintendent Henry Challinor, she departed Gravesend on 14 September 1848, arriving Moreton Bay on 21 January 1849.     Fortitude Valley (where many of the immigrants settled) is named in her honor.
