The 1948 Queensland railway strike was a strike which lasted nine weeks, from 3 February to 5 April, 1948, over wages of workers at railway workshops and locomotive depots in Queensland, Australia. As head of the Commonwealth Security Services in Queensland, Bob Wake played an active role in watching the activities of the Communist Party of Australia during the strike.
