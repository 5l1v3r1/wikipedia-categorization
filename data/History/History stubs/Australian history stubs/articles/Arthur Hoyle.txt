  Arthur Robert Hoyle (1922 – 2 May 2012)  was an Australian historian and biographer. Born in Sydney, Australia, in 1922 to Arthur Hoyle (1896–1971) and Gertrude Underwood (1895–1972), he served in the Royal Air Force as a navigator during World War II with 460 Squadron  and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.  The aerial bombing war over Germany (in which 460 Squadron participated) was controversial - being considered by some to be a war crime,  because it involved direct targeting of heavily populated civilian areas. [better source needed] Despite this, Hoyle made no apology about the squadron's role in any of his writings. Hoyle returned to Australia and married Moira Peisley (1924–1998). He had four sons, Arthur Marshall Hoyle (who in 2017 was convicted of rape and other charges of indecent assault against University students he taught),  Phillip, Warwick and Andrew (dec). He served in the Australian Public Service and later taught Administration at the University of Canberra. He held the degrees of BA (Hons) and Dip Ed (University of Sydney) and M.SocSci (University of Birmingham).  Although an academic for much of his life, Hoyle never obtained a Doctorate, in which regard his son, Arthur, similarly did not obtain that qualification. He is best known for his biographies.  He died on 2 May 2012 at Calvary Retirement Community Canberra.
