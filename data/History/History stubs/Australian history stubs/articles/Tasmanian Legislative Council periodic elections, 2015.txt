Gaffney re-contested the seat against Vivienne Gale, a businesswoman from Launceston, who stated she would move to Devonport in the electorate if elected.  Windermere has been held by independent MLC Ivan Dean since 2003. Dean re-contested the seat against Vanessa Bleyer (for the Tasmanian Greens), Jennifer Houston (for the Labor Party) and former union official Scott McLean (independent).
