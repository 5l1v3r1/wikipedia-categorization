 The Victorian Secondary Teachers Association (VSTA) was a Victorian trade union organisation which existed from 1953 to 1995. It was established as a breakaway from the Victorian Teachers' Union, originally as the Victorian Secondary Masters' Professional Association in 1948, becoming the VSTA in 1953. By 1995 the VSTA amalgamated with the Federated Teachers' Union of Victoria to become the Victorian Branch of the Australian Education Union.
