The soldiers burned women and children , raped and massacred a total amount of 432 Albanians. The report was compiled for the Kosovo Committee in exile by two priests who handed it to the British Brigadier General George Fraser Philips, head of the British Military Control Commission in Albania and Montenegro, in Shkodra. The survivors fled into the Gjakova Highlands in Albania.
