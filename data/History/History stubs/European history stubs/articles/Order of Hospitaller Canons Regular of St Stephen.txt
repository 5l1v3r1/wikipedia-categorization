The Order of Hospitaller Canons Regular of St Stephen or Stephanites was a religious institution set up by King Géza II of Hungary (1141–1162). The order was organized around a hospital that the king had earlier established in Esztergom (at that time an important station on the inland pilgrim route to the Holy Land) in honor of King St Stephen I of Hungary. They also administered a hospital at Budafelhévíz.
