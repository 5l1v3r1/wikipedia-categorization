Arsinoe (Greek: Ἀρσινόη) was an ancient city in northwestern Cyprus built on top of the older city, Marion  (Greek: Μάριον);  some ancient writers conflate the two cities. Ptolemy I Soter destroyed the town of Marion in 312BC and removed some inhabitants to Paphos.  The city was refounded by Ptolemy Philadelphus and named after his sister/wife Arsinoe. According to Strabo there was a grove sacred to Zeus.   Cyprus, from its subjection to the kings of the Lagid family, had more than one city of this name, which was common to several princesses of that house; see Arsinoe for other cities so named.
