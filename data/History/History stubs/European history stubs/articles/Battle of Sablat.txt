The battle was fought between a Roman Catholic Imperial army led by Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy and the Protestant army of Ernst von Mansfeld. When Mansfeld was on his way to reinforce general Hohenloe, who was besieging Budějovice (German: Budweis),  Buquoy intercepted Mansfeld near the small village of Záblatí (German: Sablat), about 25 km (16 mi) km NW of Budějovice, and brought him to battle. Mansfeld suffered defeat, losing at least 1,500 infantry and his baggage train. As a result, the Bohemians had to lift the siege of Budějovice.
