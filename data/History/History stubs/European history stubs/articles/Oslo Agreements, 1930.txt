The Oslo Agreements or Convention of Economic Rapprochement of 22 December 1930 were an economic agreement between the countries which had already agreed upon the Dutch-Scandinavian Economic Pact (Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) earlier that year and the countries of the BLEU, Belgium and Luxembourg. Finland would join the agreement in 1933. The countries promised not to raise tariffs between them without first notifying and consulting the other signatory powers. As with the Dutch-Scandinavian Economic Pact, the Oslo Agreements were one of the regional responses to the Great Depression.
