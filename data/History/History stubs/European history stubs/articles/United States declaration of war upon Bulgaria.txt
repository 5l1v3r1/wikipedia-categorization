On June 5, 1942, the United States Congress declared war upon Bulgaria. Bulgaria was neutral during 1939-1941, but on March 1, 1941, Bulgaria signed the Tripartite Pact and officially joined the Axis bloc. Following this, the Bulgarian government declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on December 13, 1941. The United States officially declared war on Bulgaria on June 5, 1942. The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, and other Bulgarian cities, were bombed by Allied aircraft in 1943 and 1944. As of  2018[update], the declarations of war against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania are the last formal declarations of war by the United States Congress, which in the era of collective security has largely ceded the war power to the President.
