The Hirvepark meeting was held in Estonia on 23 August 1987, the anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. It was attended by 2,000 to 5,000 people, and was one of the first organized public demonstrations against the Estonian Communist Party.  It sparked a wave of anti-Soviet activity and mass protests in support of independence.
