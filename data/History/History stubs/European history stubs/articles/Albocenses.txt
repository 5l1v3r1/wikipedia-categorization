Albocenses (Latin: Albocenses/Albocensii) was a Dacian tribe  that inhabited the area of Banat (Serbia, Romania) with the towns of Kovin (Contra Margum), Trans Tierna, Ad Medias II, Kladovo (Ad Pontes), Apu, Arcidava, Centum Putea, Ram (Lederata) and Praetorium I. They lived between the Timi≈ü River (Tibiscus) and north of the Saldenses, south of the Biephi.  It is believed that the tribe migrated to Spain in Roman times. Maximus of Moesia, the governor of Moesia under Emperor Valens, approached the lands of the Albocense prior to the Gothic Wars.
