A ewery was the office in a medieval household responsible for water and the vessels for drinking or washing of the person. The word comes from "ewer", a sort of pitcher. This office was not responsible for laundry, which was handled by the offices of laundry and napery (table linen). The three offices did work closely together, however, and could be concurrent in smaller households.
