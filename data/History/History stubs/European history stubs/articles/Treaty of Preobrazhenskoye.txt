The Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye (or the Treaty of Preobrazhenskoe) was negotiated by Johann Patkul and signed on 22 November 1699 in Preobrazhenskoye (now a part of Moscow), a favoured residence of the tsar Peter the Great. It followed an informal meeting of Peter and Augustus at Rava (Rawa, Rava-Ruska, Rava-Ruskaya) in August 1698. The treaty called for the partition of the Swedish Empire among Denmark, Russia, Saxony and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the treaty, the Great Northern War began.
