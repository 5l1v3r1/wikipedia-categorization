 The Lordship of Berat was a county created by despot Andrea II Muzaka of the Muzaka noble family with its capital at Berat. In 1385, during the Battle of Savra, the Ottomans captured Berat from Bal≈°a II, together with Kroje and Ulcinj. They soon retreated from all of thos towns keeping only Castoria under their permanent control.  Some sources explain that Ottomans probably remained in Berat with intention to use it as foothold to capture Valona.  By 1396 Muzaka family took over control of Berat.  In 1417 Berat became a part of the Ottoman Empire.
