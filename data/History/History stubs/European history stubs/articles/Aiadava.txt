 Aiadava (Aiadaba or Aeadaba, Greek: Αἰάδαβα ) was a Dacian town in the Remesiana region,  present day Bela Palanka, Serbia. After the Romans conquered Moesia in the 75 BC, the new castrum (imperial domain with estates) and municipium was known initially as Ulpianorum and then Remesiana (Moesi) and laid on the Via Militaris road, between Naissus and Serdica. Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565) had following strongholds in the district of Remesiana: Brittura  Subaras  Lamponiana  Stronges  Dalmatas  Primiana  Phrerraria  Topera  Tomes  Cuas  Tzertzenutzas  Stens  Aeadaba Destreba  Pretzouries  Cumudeba  Deurias  Lutzolo  Rhepordenes  Spelonca  Scumbro  Briparo  Tulcoburgo  Longiana  Lupophantana  Dardapara Burdomina  Grinciapana  Graecus  Drasimarca  The patron saint of Romania, Nicetas of Remesiana, was a 4th-century bishop at Remesiana, of possible Dacian descent.
