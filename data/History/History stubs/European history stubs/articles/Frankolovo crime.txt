Frankolovo crime is one of the worst Nazi war crimes in the territory of present Slovenia during World War II. On February 12, 1945 members of Wehrmacht killed one hundred Slovene civilians at Graben (»ditch«) in Stranice near Frankolovo. The crime was committed as revenge for a Slovene partisan's ambush in Tesno gorge, when on February 2, 1945 one of the most important local Nazi officers Anton Dorfmeister was mortally wounded, dying the next day in Celje hospital. As a revenge for his life, Nazis gathered one hundred hostages from prisons of Maribor, Celje, and Trbovlje and hung them on trees along the road.
