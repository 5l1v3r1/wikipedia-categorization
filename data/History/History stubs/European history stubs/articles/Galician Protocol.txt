The Galician Protocol was a secret agreement created in Berlin. First mentioned in a letter from Austrian Foreign Minister Count Czernin to Ambassador Prince von Hehenlohe in March 1918. This agreement was to be part of a treaty of peace with Ukraine. Ukraine was obligated to send over one million tons of grain to the Central Powers before July 1918. There were only to be two copies of the treaty, and Berlin would destroy its copy if Ukraine did not supply its duties.
