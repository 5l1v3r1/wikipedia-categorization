The Foch Line was a temporary demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania proposed by the Entente in the aftermath of World War I. The line was proposed by Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch and was accepted by the Conference of Ambassadors in 1919. With small adjustments the line formed the basis of the inter-war Polish-Lithuanian border.  The line left Vilnius (Wilno) on the Polish side.  After World War II only its westernmost part, close to the town of Suwa≈Çki, remains true to the original concept of the line. For a map with the Foch Line and some context see:
