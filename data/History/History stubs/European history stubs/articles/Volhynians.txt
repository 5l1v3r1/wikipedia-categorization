The Volhynians (Ukrainian: Волиняни, Volyniany, Polish: Wołynianie) were an East   Slavic tribe of the Early Middle Ages and the Principality of Volhynia in 987–1199.  They are mentioned in the Primary Chronicle and lived in the region of Volhynia that covered present-day sections of eastern Poland, western Ukraine and southern Belarus. They are one of the groups which went on to form the modern Ukrainian ethnicity. Some historians believe that the Volhynians are descendants of the Dulebes.  A few historians claim the name comes from Celtic tribes known as Bolihii before the arrival of Slavic tribes in the 6th century. Their main cities were Volyn’ and Volodymyr (Volodymyr-Volynsky). According to archeological studies, the Volhynians had well-developed agriculture and various handicrafts such as blacksmithing, casting, and pottery. In 981 prince Vladimir the Great subjugated the Volhynians under Kievan Rus. At the end of the 10th century, the principality of Volodymyr-Volynsky gained dominion over the lands of Volhynians, and later Roman the Great conquered Halych to create the principality of Halych-Volhynia.
