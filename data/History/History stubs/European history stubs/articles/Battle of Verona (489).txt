The Battle of Verona was fought on 30 September 489 between the Ostrogothic leader Theoderic the Great and the Germanic King of Italy Odoacer. Theoderic personally led his troops in battle, and achieved a decisive victory. Odoacer was subsequently forced to flee to Ravenna, and Theoderic was free to capture Pavia and Milan.
