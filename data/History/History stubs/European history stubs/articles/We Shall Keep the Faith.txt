"We Shall Keep the Faith" is a poem penned by Moina Michael in November 1918. She received inspiration for this poem from "In Flanders Fields".   The "poppy red" refers to Papaver rhoeas.  Oh! you who sleep in Flanders Fields, Sleep sweet - to rise anew! We caught the torch you threw  And holding high, we keep the Faith With All who died.  We cherish, too, the poppy red That grows on fields where valor led; It seems to signal to the skies That blood of heroes never dies, But lends a lustre to the red Of the flower that blooms above the dead In Flanders Fields.  And now the Torch and Poppy Red We wear in honor of our dead. Fear not that ye have died for naught; We'll teach the lesson that ye wrought In Flanders Fields.   By Moina Michael,1918
