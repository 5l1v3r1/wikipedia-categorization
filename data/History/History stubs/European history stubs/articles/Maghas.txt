Maghas or Maas — more properly, Mags or Maks — was the capital city of Alania,  a medieval kingdom in the Greater Caucasus. It is known exclusively from Islamic sources and and its location is uncertain, with some authors favouring North Ossetia and others pointing to Arkhyz in modern-day Karachay–Cherkessia, where three 10th-century churches still stand. The destruction of Maghas is ascribed to Batu Khan, a Mongol leader and a grandson of Genghis Khan, in the beginning of 1239. Some Russian geographers, like D. V. Zayats, point to a location in Ingushetia.
