The liard was a subdivision of the kronenthaler, the currency of the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). There were 216 liards to a kronenthaler. Following the French occupation of the Austrian Netherlands in 1794, the kronenthaler was replaced by the French franc. Today, in Walloon dialects, des liards is still a synonym of "money" in general. The liard was also a French coin, worth three deniers, which appeared under Louis XIV and was the smallest in use in the period prior to the Revolution.
