The third Peace of Pressburg (also known as Treaty of Pressburg ) was a peace treaty concluded in Pressburg (then known as Pozsony in Hungarian and now as Bratislava, Slovakia).  It was signed on 30 December 1626 between Gabriel Bethlen of Transylvania, the leader of an uprising against the Habsburg Monarchy from 1619â€“1626, and Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. The agreement put an end to the revolt by confirming the Peace of Nikolsburg (31 December 1621). In return, Bethlen agreed not to fight against the emperor anymore, nor would he ally with the Ottoman Turks.
