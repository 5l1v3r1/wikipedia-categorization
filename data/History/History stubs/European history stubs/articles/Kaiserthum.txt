Kaiserthum or modern German, Kaisertum (lit.â€‰Kaiser-dom), is a German word for Empire in its meaning as a state ruled over by an Emperor, used in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It is most known as a description of the Empire of Austria after its creation in 1804.  A later used German term for it is "Kaiserreich", a term that was first used officially in German in 1915, to describe the Empire of Austria.
