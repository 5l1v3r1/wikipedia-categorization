A sympathetic alphabet was a supposed form of communication used in the 17th century by Rosicrusians and Magnetisers.  Two parties would remove a section of skin from their arms or hands and mutually transplant it while still fresh. It was believed that the transplanted piece of flesh kept a close sympathy with the original limb so that its owner was still aware of any injury done to it. On the transplanted flesh was tattooed an alphabet whereby, by pricking the letters with a magnetic needle, the users believed they could communicate instantaneously across great distances.    A novel titled "Le nez d'un notaire" by Edmond About, and later a television series,  is based on the concept of a sympathetic alphabet.
