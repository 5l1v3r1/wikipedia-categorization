The Conventionsthaler was a standard silver coin of the Holy Roman Empire. It was introduced in 1754 and contained one tenth of a Cologne mark of silver or about 23.39 grams. The Conventionstaler was used as a standard in most of the Empire, with a variety of subdivisions being used, including the Reichsthaler, Austro-Hungarian Gulden, South German Gulden, Groschen, Pfennig and Heller. The Conventionstaler replaced as standard the Kronenthaler which contained one ninth of a mark. During the early 19th century, the Conventionstaler was superseded by a Thaler containing one fourteenth of a Cologne mark of silver, based on the Prussian Thaler.
