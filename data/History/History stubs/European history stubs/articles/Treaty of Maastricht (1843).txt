The Treaty of Maastricht, signed in 1843 by Belgium and the Netherlands, established the border between the two countries. It resulted in a very complicated frontier in parts that passes through houses and has tiny enclaves  due to land ownership dating back to the 12th century.  Part of the left bank of the Meuse, near Maastricht, came back to the Netherlands.  This treaty was signed four years after the Treaty of London.
