The Abrincatui were a Gallic tribe (Plin. iv. 18), not mentioned by Julius Caesar, whose frontier was near the Curiosolites. Their town Ingena, called Abrincatae in the Notitia dignitatum, has given its name to the modern Avranches; and their territory would probably correspond to the division of Avranchin. The Abrincatui became a client tribe of the Venelli until the Roman occupation in BC 49, when they were separated.
