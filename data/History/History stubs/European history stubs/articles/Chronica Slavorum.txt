Chronica Sclavorum or Chronicle of the Slavs is a medieval chronicle which accounts the pre-Christian culture and religion of Polabian Slavs, written by Helmold (ca. 1120 – after 1177), a Saxon priest and historian. It describes events related to North-West Slavic tribes known as the Wends up to 1171.  It is a continuation of Deeds of bishops of the Hamburg Church by Adam of Bremen and was continued by Arnold of Lübeck's Chronica Slavorum.
