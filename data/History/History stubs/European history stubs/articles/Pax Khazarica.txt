Pax Khazarica (Latin for "Khazar Peace") is a historiographical term, modeled after the original phrase Pax Romana, applied to the period (roughly 700-950 AD) during which the Khazar Khaganate dominated the Pontic steppe and the Caucasus Mountains. During this period, Khazar dominion over vital trans-Eurasian trade routes facilitated travel and trade between Europe and Asia by such groups as the Radhanites and the early Rus. The originator of the term is unknown but it was in use by scholars as early as the nineteenth century.
