The battle was a Moravian victory. The battle is part of the Thirty Years' War. Budweis (České Budějovice) was one of the three towns which remained loyal to the Austrian emperor when Bohemia revolted. After the Austrian victory at Sablat, the Bohemians were forced to raise the siege of České Budějovice. On 15 June 1619, Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim  retreated to Soběslav where he awaited reinforcement by Count Heinrich Matthias von Thurn. After taking control of the strong places of southern Bohemia, emperor Ferdinand II  sent a force under Dampierre to Moravia, which had chosen the side of the Bohemian rebels. However, Dampierre was defeated at Dolní Věstonice (German: Wisternitz) by Moravian forces under von Tiefenbach (brother of Rudolf von Tiefenbach) and Ladislav Velen ze Žerotína in August 1619, which left Moravia in the Bohemian camp.
