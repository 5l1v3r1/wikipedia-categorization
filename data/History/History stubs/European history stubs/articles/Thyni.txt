The Thyni /ˈθaɪˌnaɪ/ (Greek: Θυνοί) were a Thracian tribe that lived in south-eastern Thrace, later they, along with the Bithyni, migrated to the lands that would later be known as Thynia and Bithynia. Each respective region got its name, presumably, from the Thracian tribe that was more prominent in the area. Xenophon (Anabasis VII, 2) praises the Thyni: "Teres, with a large army, was said to have had his baggage train taken from him by the natives, who are called Thyni and are supposed to be the most dangerous of all the tribes, especially at night fighting." The Thyni included clubs amongst their weapons. The Thyni often joined the ranks of organized armies as mercenaries or volunteers.
