The Diploma of the Joannites, or Diploma of the Knights of St. John, was a grant issued in 1247 by King BÃ©la IV of Hungary, to Master Rembald of the Knights Hospitaller. It allowed the Knights to settle in Severin, in what is today Romania, where they could defend the Hungarian borders against Cuman invaders.
