Hermeticism is a historiographical term describing the work that attempts to reconstruct the mode of thought held by 17th century scientists.  It primarily traces out the connections of Renaissance (16th century) modes of thought with those of the Scientific Revolution (17th century).   This type of analysis began with English historians of science in the 1960s.  This category of history of science work has largely subsumed earlier academic philosophers' work on the problem of transition from Aristotelianism to 17th century science.
