David S. Adams is a Professor of Biology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. In 1995, he was the first person to successfully replicate Alzheimer's Disease in a mouse. His work in the field suggests that an over-abundance of protein production causes the disease, as opposed to "twists" in neurons, as is alternately argued. The finding remains one of the most significant discoveries in Alzheimer's research to date. Adams lectures multiple biology classes at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, notably Cell Biology, Virology, and Advanced Cell Biology. He is an avid supporter of abolishing textbooks for upper classes, due to his belief that memorization does not contribute to a greater understanding of biology.
