The Faraday Society was a British society for the study of physical chemistry, founded in 1903 and named in honour of Michael Faraday.  It merged with several similar organisations in 1980 to form the Royal Society of Chemistry. It published Faraday Transactions from 1905 to 1971, when the Royal Society of Chemistry took over the publication. Of particular note were the conferences called Faraday Discussions, which were published under the same name. The publication includes the discussion of the paper as well as the paper itself. At the meeting, more time is given to the discussion than to the author presenting the paper as the audience are given the papers prior to the meeting. These conferences continue to be run by the Royal Society of Chemistry.
