Samuel John Galton Jr. FRS (18 June 1753 - 19 June 1832), born in Duddeston, Birmingham, England. Despite being a Quaker he was an arms manufacturer. He was a member of the Lunar Society and lived at Great Barr Hall. He also built a house at Warley Woods, and commissioned Humphry Repton to lay out its grounds.  He married Lucy Barclay (1757–1817), daughter of Robert Barclay Allardice, MP, 5th of Urie. They had the eight children: Galton owned 300 acres (120 ha) of land at Westhay Moor, Somerset, which he had drained, by constructing Galton's Canal.  Galton Bridge at Smethwick is named in his honour, and he is remembered by the Moonstones in Birmingham and a tower block in the centre of that city.
