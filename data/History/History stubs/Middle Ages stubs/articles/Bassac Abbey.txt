Bassac Abbey (French: Abbaye Saint-Étienne de Bassac) is an 11th-century Romanesque style abbey in Bassac, Charente and part of the Ancient Diocese of Saintes . The church was founded in 1002 by Wardrade Loriches, count of la Marche and first known Lord of Jarnac. It was built to 1015 by Angel de Grimoard, Bishop of Angoulême, and his brother Iso, Bishop of Saintes. In 1095 it was made subservient to the Abbey of Saint-Jean-D'Angely by Pope Urban II;  it regained its independence in 1246.  Bassac Abbey was largely reconstructed under Guillaume de Vibrac, Abbot from 1247 to 1286.
