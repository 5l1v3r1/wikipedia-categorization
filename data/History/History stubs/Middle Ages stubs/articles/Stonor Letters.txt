The Stonor Letters are one of the significant collections of 15th century correspondence that have survived; the other two major collections from this period are the Paston Letters and the Cely Letters.    Like the Paston family, the Stonor family was founded by a royal judge; his name was John Stonor.  The Stonors did not participate in the Wars of the Roses;  but Sir William Stoner was nevertheless attainted in 1483, and his papers seized by the crown, as well as his lands. Though the latter were restored, the papers remained in crown ownership - hence their subsequent survival.  Although the letters do not discuss political issues, Charles Lethbridge Kingsford has said that they "do not fall short" for content about English society and social life during the period. Subjects discussed in the letters include local office, estate management, legal business, social and domestic life, marriage and the wooltrade. . The collection includes nearly 400 documents.
