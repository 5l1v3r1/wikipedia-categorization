 Iran and the West is the name of a three-part British documentary series shown in February 2009 on BBC Two to mark the 30th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution.  The first episode was shown at 9:00pm on Saturday 7 February with parts two and three shown on consecutive Saturdays. The documentary looks at the relationship between Iran and the countries of the west and features interviews with politicians who have played significant roles in events involving Iran, Europe and the United States since 1979.  The series is produced by Norma Percy, whose previous series include The Death of Yugoslavia and Israel and the Arabs: Elusive Peace.  Like her previous series, Iran and the West relies extensively on interviews with key players involved in the issue.  It won a Peabody Award in 2009 "for its eminently watchable and historically invaluable examination of one of the worldâ€™s most intractable hotspots."
