The production delves into multiple historical figures who may have contributed to Arthurian legend as early as the third century and as late as the 9th.  It cites as our primary source of the legend the writings of Sir Thomas Mallory.  Other writings and sources, many used by Mallory, are cited for their specific contributions to the legend.
