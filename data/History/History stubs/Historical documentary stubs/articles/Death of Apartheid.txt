  Death of Apartheid (US title: Mandela's Fight For Freedom) is the name of a three-part documentary series about the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa and the first fully democratic election that followed. The series was first broadcast in May 1995, and produced by Brian Lapping Associates  (now part of Ten Alps company) for the BBC, and co-produced by the Dutch broadcaster VPRO, the South African broadcaster SABC, and the Japanese broadcaster NHK.   The series was largely written and researched by Allister Sparks, who also narrated it. The series was accompanied by a book by Sparks, named Tomorrow Is Another Country.
