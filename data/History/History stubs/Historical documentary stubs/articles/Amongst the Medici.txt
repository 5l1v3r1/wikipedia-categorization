Amongst the Medici is a radio documentary series by historian Bettany Hughes. The series aired in three parts on BBC Radio 4 between February-March 2006. The series was billed as "a three part re-evaluation of one of the most creative and complicated partnerships in the western world" and examined the history of the Medici family during the Italian Renaissance, between 1397 (the founding of the Medici Bank) and 1497 (the Bonfire of the Vanities).
