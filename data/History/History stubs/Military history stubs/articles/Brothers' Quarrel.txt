The Brothers' Quarrel (German: Bruderzwist) was a conflict between Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and his brother, Matthias in the early 17th century.   Their other brothers—Maximilian III and Albert VII—and their cousins—especially Ferdinand II and Leopold V—were also deeply involved in their dispute.  The family feud weakened the Habsburgs' position and enabled the Estates of their realms to win widespread political and religious concessions.  The 19th-century Austrian writer, Franz Grillparzer, dedicated a play to the events.
