Ras Sedr massacre (in Hebrew: טבח ראס סודר) is a claimed mass murder of dozens of Egyptian prisoners of war that reportedly took place immediately after a paratrooper unit of Israel Defense Forces conquered Ras Sedr (also known as Ras Sudr) during the Six-Day War.  In June 2000, Egypt's Al-Wafd newspaper reported that a mass grave was discovered in Ras sedr, containing remains of 52 prisoners of war killed by Israeli forces during the war. The report said that some of the skulls had bullet holes in them, "which proves that the soldiers were executed."    In April 2009, Haaretz reported that Israeli television director Ram Loevy had heard about the massacre shortly after the war, from fellow paratroopers in his unit. After testifying in Metzah, he was removed from the unit.  Coordinates: 29°35′30″N 32°42′20″E﻿ / ﻿29.59167°N 32.70556°E﻿ / 29.59167; 32.70556
