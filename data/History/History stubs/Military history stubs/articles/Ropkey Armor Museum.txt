Ropkey Armor Museum was a military history museum in Crawfordsville, Indiana.  The Ropkey Armor Museum closed July 29, 2017.  The collection was sold off to other museums.   http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2017/08/16/military_museum_closing_triggers_memories/ The museum was privately owned by the Ropkey family. It stemed from the founder Fred Ropkey's interest in military history and his past career as a tank platoon leader in the U.S. Marine Corps during the early 1950s.  The museum collection was primarily of AFVs. These ranged from such rarities as a First World War M1917 to a contemporary M109 self-propelled howitzer. Other exhibits were soft-skin military vehicles, aircraft and a Vietnam war-era PBR. The aircraft include an Antonov An-2  and the unique Bell X-14B. This aircraft was used for early research into VTOL until it was written off in a landing accident in 1981. It was being restored by the museum.
