Deolali transit camp was a transit camp established in 1849 for British troops in Deolali, India, notorious for its unpleasant environment, boredom and the psychological problems of soldiers that passed through it. Its name is the origin of the phrase "gone doolally" or "doolally tap", a phrase meaning to 'lose one's mind'.   This term had originated in the 19th century.
