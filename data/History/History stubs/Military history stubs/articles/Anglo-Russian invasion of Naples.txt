The Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples was an invasion of the Kingdom of Naples in 1805 by British and Russian forces during the War of the Third Coalition. It ended in early 1806 with Napoleon I of France's conquest of the kingdom.  It followed a cooperation in July 1799 between Horatio Nelson and Admiral Ushakov in the reconquest of Naples and suppression of the Parthenopaean Republic.
