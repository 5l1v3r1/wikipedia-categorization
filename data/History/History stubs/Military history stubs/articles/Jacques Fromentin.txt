Jacques Pierre Fromentin (2 August 1754 – 19 October 1830) led a French division during the Flanders Campaign of 1793–1794. Having served in the French Royal Army for ten years, he was appointed lieutenant colonel of a volunteer battalion in 1791. The mass emigration of aristocratic generals, and suspicion of those who stayed, left the First French Republic desperate to create new general officers, preferably from non-nobles. After leading his battalion at Hondschoote, Fromentin was very rapidly promoted to general of division in September 1793 and led a division at Wattignies the following month. In 1794, he led a combat division at Le Cateau, Beaumont, Grandreng, Erquelinnes and Gosselies. By this time, it was plain that he had only modest military ability and he was replaced. He served as a fortress commandant in 1794 and 1795 before retiring from the army in 1799.
