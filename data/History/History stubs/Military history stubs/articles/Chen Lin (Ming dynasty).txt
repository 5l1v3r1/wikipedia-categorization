Chen Lin (Chinese: 陳璘; 1543–1607), courtesy name Chaojue (朝爵), was a Chinese general and admiral of the Ming dynasty. Chen Lin was a native of Shaoguan, Guangdong province. He quelled the 1562 uprisings in Chaozhou and Yingde in Guangdong and was subsequently promoted to the Shoubei of Guangdong. Chen participated in various campaigns in Southern China against rebels and peasant uprisings thereafter. Chen Lin was dispatched in 1598 to help repulse the Japanese in Hideyoshi's Invasions of Korea with the Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin. The aid was in response to a request by the Joseon Dynasty. After campaigning in Korea, Chen was promoted and gained control of troops in Hunan and Guangdong. He led troops against the Miao (Hmong) peoples in Zunyi, Guizhou province and quelled the Miao uprising. Chen Lin died of natural causes. His descendants are spread out across Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces. Chen Lin is also the founder of one of the Korean clans, Guangdong Chen clan, as one of his grandsons, Chen Yongsu, settled in Korea.
