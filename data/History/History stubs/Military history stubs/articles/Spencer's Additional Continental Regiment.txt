Spencer's Additional Continental Regiment or 5th New Jersey Regiment was an American infantry unit that served for four years in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The Continental Congress authorized the unit in January 1777 and it assembled at Monmouth Court House, New Jersey in the spring. Commanded by Colonel Oliver Spencer, the regiment consisted of one Pennsylvania and seven New Jersey companies. It transferred into the 3rd Pennsylvania Brigade in May 1777 and fought at Brandywine and Germantown in the late summer and fall of 1777. The unit went through the winter at Valley Forge and was present at the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778. The regiment absorbed Forman's Additional Continental Regiment and part of Malcolm's Additional Continental Regiment in April 1779. Spencer's Regiment went on the Sullivan Expedition in the summer of 1779 where it fought together with the New Jersey Brigade. The unit was transferred to the Highland Department in September 1780 and disbanded in January 1781.
