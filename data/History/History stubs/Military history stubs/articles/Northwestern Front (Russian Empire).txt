The Northwestern Front (Russian: Се́веро-За́падный фронт) was an army group of the Imperial Russian Army during the First World War. It was established in August 1914 and existed for one year prior to being divided into the Northern Front and Western Front.  The armies subordinated to the Western Front took part in the Russian invasion of East Prussia at the beginning of the war.
