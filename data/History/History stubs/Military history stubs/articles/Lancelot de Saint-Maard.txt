Lancelot de Saint-Maard (died 1278) was the fourteenth marshal of France at the time of the Eighth Crusade in 1270.  Lancelot followed Louis IX to Africa with five knights in that year. He distinguished himself in the assault on Carthage. He conducted the siege and led the charge. During a mêlée, his helm was broken and he was saved by his fellow great officer Imbert de Beaujeu, the constable of France.
