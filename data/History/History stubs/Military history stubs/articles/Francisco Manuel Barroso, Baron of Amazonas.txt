It was the commander who led the Imperial Navy to victory in the Battle of Riachuelo during the Paraguayan War. :33 As a consequence of this victory, there was an expressive reduction in the Paraguayan naval capacity, since that nation, from then on, adopted to adopt defensive strategies until the end of the conflict. Barroso was decorated with the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross and received the noble title of Baron of Amazonas in 1866, in honor of the flagship ship that commanded in the Battle of Riachuelo.
