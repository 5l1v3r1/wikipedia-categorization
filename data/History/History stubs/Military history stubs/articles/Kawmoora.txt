Kawmoora (Burmese: ကော့မူးရာ) is a large flat sandbank which is linked to Myanmar through a narrow strip of land that is fortified by a 50 meter long border wall. It is completely surrounded by Thailand. Kawmoora was originally established as a stronghold for the Karen National Union and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army, until it was captured by government forces on 21 February 1995.
