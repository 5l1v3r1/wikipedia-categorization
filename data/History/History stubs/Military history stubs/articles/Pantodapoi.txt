Pantodapoi were native auxiliary soldiers used in the armies of the Diadochi, the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire. Because the Diadochi were reluctant to allow native troops serve mainstream Hellenic units for fear of revolt, they formed their own corps and were used in a support role, for flanking enemy troops and skirmishing. They gave decent accounts of themselves in many battles, but were the first Seleucid line to break at the battle of Raphia against the Ptolemaic Kingdom, another successor kingdom.
