Pentakosiarch (Greek: πεντακοσιάρχης, pentakosiarches in Modern Greek usually πεντακοσίαρχος, pentakosiarchos), meaning "commander of 500", is a Greek military rank, first adopted in the infantry of the Army of Macedon (cf. Aelianus Tacticus and Plutarch, Life of Alexander, 76). The pentakosiarch commanded a pentakosiarchy (πεντακοσιαρχία, or pentakosiarchia) of 512 men, composed of two syntagmata of 256. Two pentakosiarchies in turn formed a chiliarchy and were commanded by a chiliarch. The rank was revived for the irregular forces of the Greek rebels during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829). On 14 December 1868,  a Royal Decree authorized the creation of thirty independent pentakosiarchies of volunteer light infantry (αὐθύπαρκτοι πεντακοσιαρχίαι ἑλαφροῡ πεζικοῡ ἐξ ἐθελοντῶν), intended to serve as a militia. Numbering consecutively from 1 to 30, each was in turn composed of four hecatontarchies of 150 soldiers and 10 officers and NCOs each. With the pentakosiarchy commander and six other soldiers, including a flag-bearer, each pentakosiarchy numbered a total of 647 men.
