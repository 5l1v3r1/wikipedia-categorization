Second Phase (1972-1979) Related incidents The Oberholzer murder occurred on 4 July 1964, when members of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) murdered Pieter Johan Andries (Andrew) Oberholzer, who worked as a foreman of the Silverstreams Wattle Company.  On 4 July 1964, ZANU terrorists ambushed and murdered a white foreman from Silverstreams Wattle Company, Andrew Oberholzer, while he was traveling with his wife and family one night on the main road. After murdering Mr Oberholzer, the terrorists tried to set his body and car alight in front of the man's family. However, they were driven off by the arrival of another car on the scene. Most of the gang was subsequently eliminated in follow-up operations. The killing had a lasting effect on the small, close-knit white community, even though it was an isolated incident.    The Smith administration subsequently moved to detain the ZANU and ZAPU political leadership in August 1964. The major political leaders imprisoned were Ndabaningi Sithole, Leopold Takawira, Edgar Tekere, Enos Nkala and Maurice Nyagumbo. The remaining military leaders of the ZANLA Dare ReChimurenga were Josiah Tongogara and the barrister Herbert Chitepo. Operating from bases in Zambia and later from Mozambique, militants subsequently began launching attacks against Rhodesia.
