Amasis was a Persian of the tribe of the Maraphii, who was sent by Aryandes, the governor of Egypt under Cambyses, at the head of an army to assist Pheretima, the mother of Arcesilaus III, king of Cyrene. In one of his works, philologist Edward Pococke associates the Maraphii with the Berhi-pae of Kartakeyu.   He took Barca by stratagem and treachery, and made an unsuccessful attempt upon Cyrene. He was then recalled by Aryandes. On its march back the Persian army suffered severely from the Libyans and a little later it is claimed they appointed the soon to be Egyptian king Amasis II as their leader.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
