The Medusa-class of submarines were eight submarines built for Italy from 1911â€“1912. They displaced 305 tons while submerged, and could travel as fast as eight knots. The class consisted of the Vellella, Medusa, Argo, Jalea, Espadarte (built for Portugal), Fisalia, Zoea, Salpa, and Jantina. The Medusa was torpedoed by the German submarine U-15, and the Jalea hit a mine and sank. The other five Italian submarines were stricken in 1918, and the Espadarte operated until 1931.
