Lieutenant colonel general or sub-colonel general (Serbo-Croat: генерал-потпуковник or general-potpukovnik) is a general officer rank in a number of Balkan armed forces. Its literal meaning is "sub-colonel general". The rank of lieutenant colonel general represents a rationalisation of the situation in some armies of a lieutenant general outranking a major general, when a major outranks a lieutenant general.  In the Serbian Army, the rank of "sub-colonel" (potpukovnik / потпуковник) is used rather than "lieutenant colonel" (poručnik pukovnik / поручник пуковникin). In the Serbian Army and Air Force (генерал-потпуковник or general-potpukovnik), it is the rank immediately below colonel-general. The rank of lieutenant colonel general corresponds to command of a division.  A lieutenant colonel general in the Republic of Macedonia (генерал потполковник) and Slovenia (generalpodpolkovnik) is the rank above major general and below general, equivalent to a lieutenant general.
