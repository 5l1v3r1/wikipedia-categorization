The Uqair Protocol or Uqair Convention  was an agreement at Uqair on 2 December 1922 which defined the boundaries between Iraq and the Sultanate of Nejd (modern Saudi Arabia) and between Kuwait and Nejd. It was imposed  by Percy Cox, the British High Commissioner to Iraq, in response to Bedouin raiders from Nejd under ibn Saud. Cox met ibn Saud and Major John More, the British Political Agent to Kuwait. The boundaries included a Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone and a Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone. Kuwait was not permitted any role in outcome of the Uqair agreement when the Saudis and British decided Kuwait's modern boundaries. Kuwait lost more than two thirds of its territory as a result of the agreement  and anti-British sentiment grew in Kuwait due to the loss of territory.
