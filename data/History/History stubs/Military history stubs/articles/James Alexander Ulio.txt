He was the son of Major James Ulio (1836–1912), an immigrant from Ireland, whose birth name was James Graham, a veteran of the American Civil War and a Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Ulio enlisted in the 10th Infantry Regiment on September 1, 1900 and was appointed as a battalion sergeant major in the 2nd Infantry shortly before he was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the Infantry branch on October 5, 1904.  Ulio was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment and served in the Philippines from 1906 to 1908.  Following his promotion to first lieutenant, he served in Hawaii from 1912 to 1916.  Ulio was promoted to captain in 1916 and served in the 23rd Infantry.    Following the United States entering World War I, he received a temporary promotion to major in 1917 and was assigned on August 15th as the division adjutant of the 29th Division until February 26th, 1918.  He then attended the Army General Staff College of the American Expeditionary Force until May 31, 1918.

In 1919 he received the Distinguished Service Medal for his service in this last assignment as well as honors from several allied governments.  After the Armistice was signed in November 1918, he served with the Army of Occupation in Germany.   In April 1920 Ulio reverted to his permanent rank of captain but was promoted to major in July.  He served in the Office of the Adjutant General of the Army from 1926 to 1929.  He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1928.

In December 1939 Ulio was appointed as the Assistant Adjutant General of the United States Army with the rank of brigadier general and, in March 1942 became the Adjutant General with the rank of major general.  As adjutant general during World War II, he had overall responsibility for the personnel administration for over 10 million soldiers in the Army, to include tens of millions of promotions and reassignments, millions of awards, and over 250,000 death notifications.  Due to Ulio's position, his name appeared on tens of millions of official documents – possibly more than any other individual in history. In September 1942 he attended the national convention of the American Legion and accepted the Legion's Distinguished Service Medal on behalf of General Douglas MacArthur, who was serving in Australia at the time.   General Ulio retired from the Army in January 1946, five months after the surrender of Japan and shortly before he reached the mandatory retirement age of 64.
