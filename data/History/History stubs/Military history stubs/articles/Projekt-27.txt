Projekt 27, usually referred to as P-27, was a secret intelligence gathering unit of the Swiss Armed Forces between 1981 and 1990. It was part of the Swiss military intelligence service UNA and tasked with the "gathering of intelligence under unusual and dangerous conditions". It was dissolved in 1990 after its existence was made public in the wake of the secret files scandal.
