 The Scipion was a French warship of the 18th century, lead ship of her class. Scipion took part in the American War of Independence, notably sailing at the rear of the French squadron at the Battle of the Chesapeake. In the Action of 18 October 1782, under Captain Nicolas Henri de Grimouard, Scipion fought gallantly against two British ships of the line of 90 and 74 guns. Through good sailmanship, she managed to damage HMS London and escape, but was destroyed the next day after she was chased and ran aground.
