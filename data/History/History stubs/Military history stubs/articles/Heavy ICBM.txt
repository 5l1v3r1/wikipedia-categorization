Heavy ICBM is a term that was created in the 1970s to describe a class of Soviet and Russian ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles).  They were characterized by a heavy throw-weight of 5 to 9 metric tons, several times that of an LGM-30 Minuteman, and a length of over 35 meters, and were thus capable of delivering a large number of warheads in a single MIRV missile. This term usually refers to R-36 / "SS-9 Scarp",  R-36M (SS-18) variants / "SS-18 Satan",   and the RS-28 Sarmat / "SS-X-32 SNOWFLAKE" missiles. RS-28 Sarmat is called a "superheavy" ICBM.  The SS-9 was a silo-launched missile capable of delivering warheads of 5–18 megatons, with a range of up to 15,500 km.  These were then replaced by the similar SS-18, with payloads of 18–25 megatons. The silos used for launching were the same for both, once modified.
