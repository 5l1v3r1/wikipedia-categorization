The goal of the offensive was to split the Iraqi 3rd Army Corps and 4th Army Corps near Basra. It was fought between the Pasdaran, Basij and the Iraqi Army. In the early phase, a force of an estimated 500,000 Pasdaran and Basij, using small boats and then on foot, moved to within a few kilometers of the strategic Basra–Baghdad waterway. The Iranians lacked artillery, air support and armored protection, while the Iraqis were well equipped.  The armies inflicted severe casualties on each other and the Iranians failed to achieve their objective. This operation was the biggest of the Dawn operations.
