  The Rotunda on Woolwich Common, in south-east London, is a former artillery museum which was established in 1820. The building was originally a very large bell tent erected in St. James's Park in 1814 for a special exhibition  and temporary victory reception of the allied sovereigns in the Napoleonic Wars but its architect John Nash turned it into a permanent structure with a lead roof and central supporting pillar. In 1973 the Rotunda was designated as a Grade II* listed building.  Since most of its exhibits were transferred to the Firepower museum at the Royal Arsenal in 2001, the Rotunda has ceased to be open to the public, except by special arrangement. The building is now used as a boxing ring by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, housed in the nearby Napier Lines Barracks.
