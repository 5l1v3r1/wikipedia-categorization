The ten-lanced nobles (Hungarian: tízlándzsások), also Szepes lancers or Spiš lancers, were group of conditional noblemen living in the Szepes region of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Spiš in Slovakia).  They received their privileges from King Béla IV of Hungary in 1243.  They were obliged to equip ten knights or lancers.  Initially, they formed about 40 families, but their number decreased to less than 20 families by the 16th century.  They lost their special status in 1804.
