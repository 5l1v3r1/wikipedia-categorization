Borovitsy (also Borovitsi, Polotsk Northwest, and Borovtsy) is an air base in Belarus, located 16Â km northwest of Polatsk.  It is a Cold War air base with sprawling taxiway area and pads for about 40 aircraft.  During the 1960s it was probably home to attack aircraft regiments, but by the 1980s it was served only by the 276 BVP (276th Combat Helicopter Regiment) flying Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters.
