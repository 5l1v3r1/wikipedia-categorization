"Operation Ardennes was an excellent starting point for future joint operations with 2nd Brigade, 8th Iraqi Army Security Forces," said Staff Sgt. Clifton Talley, the fire support noncommissioned officer for C Company, from Cookeville, Tenn.  "Working with this platoon was a great experience for Coalition Forces and Iraqi Security Forces alike." Operation Ardennes yielded two suspected insurgents wanted for their potential involvement in targeting Iraqi and Coalition Forces with improvised explosive devices and for their involvement in sectarian violence. No US deaths were reported during the operation, however four US soldiers were wounded during the operation.
