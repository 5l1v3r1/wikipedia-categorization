The Cherry cannon (Bulgarian: черешово топче, chereshovo topche) is a wooden cannon, first used by Bulgarian anti-Ottoman revolutionaries in the April Uprising. It was used to arm the under-equipped Bulgarian rebels against the Ottoman army. Balance scale masses and pieces of metal were used as ammunition for the cherry cannon.  It has now become a common symbol throughout Bulgaria despite the fact that it backfired and killed its user during its first shot. It is often used in town seals of villages that were key during the uprising such as Koprivshtitsa.  It is also popular as a piece of decorative furniture in front of historic buildings and Mehanas (traditional restaurants that serve Bulgarian cuisine).
