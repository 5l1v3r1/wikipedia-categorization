The Dinassaut (French:Â [dinaso], Division Navale d'Assaut, "Naval Assault Division") was a type of riverine military unit employed by the French Navy during the first Indochina War.   The 'Dinassaut' were created by General Leclerc in 1947. Ten groups were created.  Each Dinassaut consisted of approximately 12 craft, often American landing craft modified with armour and using tank turrets as weapons.  Other craft carried 81mm mortars to be employed as riverine artillery.
