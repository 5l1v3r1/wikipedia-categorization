Â Pakistan Army The Battle of Tololing was a pivotal battle in the Kargil War between India's armed forces and troops from the Northern Light Infantry who were aided by Pakistan-backed irregulars in 1999. The Tololing is a dominant position overlooking the Srinagar - Leh Highway (NH 1D) and was a vital link. Much of the Indian Army losses had to do with the nature of the terrain as World War I style frontal charges had to be mounted to reclaim the peaks to dislodge the intruders. The three-week assault finally culminated with India taking control of the peak and changing the course of the war. Major Rajesh Adhikari (posthumously) and Digendra Kumar were awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India's second highest military honour for their daring actions on the peak. Col Ravindranath was awarded Vir Chakra.
