 Plan Totality was a nuclear[dubious  â€“ discuss] plan established by U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower in August 1945 on the direction of President Harry S. Truman, after the end of the Potsdam Conference. The plan envisioned a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union with 20 to 30 atomic bombs. It earmarked 20 Soviet cities for obliteration in a first strike: Moscow, Gorky, Kuybyshev, Sverdlovsk, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Saratov, Kazan, Leningrad, Baku, Tashkent, Chelyabinsk, Nizhny Tagil, Magnitogorsk, Molotov, Tbilisi, Stalinsk, Grozny, Irkutsk, and Yaroslavl.  However this plan was actually a disinformation ploy; it was only in 1946 that the United States could boast even nine atomic bombs in its inventory, along with twenty-seven B-29s capable of delivering them.  Plan Totality was part of Truman's 'giant atomic bluff' aimed primarily (and unsuccessfully) at the Soviet Union.
