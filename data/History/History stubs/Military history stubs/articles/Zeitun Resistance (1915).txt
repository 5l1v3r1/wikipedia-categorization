The Armenian militia of Hunchaks (Social Democrat Hunchakian Party) of the city Zeitun (Süleymanlı) had resisted on two armed conflicts, first from August 30 to December 1, 1914, and second on March 25, 1915, to the Ottoman Empire. The first resistance, which lasted three months from (August 30, 1914, to December 1, 1914), was reported that Armenians defeated all the Ottoman troops.  60 Armenian militia died during the first conflict in a report.  They helped fight and resist the impending massacre of the local Armenian civilian population.   It is reported that on March 25, 1915 Zeitun was captured by the Ottoman Army. The date for the beginning of the conflicts is not known, but in a report from the Ambassador in Constantinople (Wangenheim) to the Reichskanzler (Bethmann Hollweg) it was claimed that the fighting was going "past few weeks"   There is no number of casualties given but 69 grandes, 612 gun, 21 hand-gun, 70 horses was listed.  The authorities most likely presume that the Armenians from Zeitun have also been agitated by foreign subversive activities to put up armed resistance to the government. It cannot be denied that the Armenian movement has taken on a worrying character over the past few weeks, which has given the government cause to introduce severe repressive measures
