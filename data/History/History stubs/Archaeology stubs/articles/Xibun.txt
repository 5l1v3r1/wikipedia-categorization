Xibun is an alternate Mayan spelling of Sibun that appears on some Spanish colonial-period maps of the region, and is sometimes used to refer to: Xibun may denote the ancient and historic Maya inhabitants of the Sibun River valley.  The Sibun River meanders through a Karst topography containing countless Maya cave sites. A significant contribution of archaeological research in the area has been the documentation of the ritual use of caves by the Xibun Maya.  Of particular note, a pattern of speleothem breakage was documented in caves that was explained by their incorporation into public architecture at prehistoric settlements located across the river.
