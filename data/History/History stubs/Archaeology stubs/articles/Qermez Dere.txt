Qermez Dere is an early Neolithic settlement in the northwestern edges of Tal Afar in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq. This Archaeological site was discovered in 1980s during a rescue operation.  It covers an area of about 100 metres (330 ft) x 60 metres (200 ft) and forms a 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall tell. The buildings were made of primitive Mudbricks, which is not a perennial material, and are mostly destroyed, however archaeologists have excavated a one-room structure in good shape. The room's corners are rounded, showing the care that went into its construction.    Also vestiges of non-structural clay columns have been found, suggesting primitive instances of furniture.  Radiocarbon dating has estimated that Qermez Dere was built between c. 8500 BC and 7900 BC.
