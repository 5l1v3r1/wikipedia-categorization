Aqui Esta Burial Mound (98CH68), also referred to as the Alligator Creek or Punta Gorda Mound, is a prehistoric sand burial mound located in Punta Gorda, Florida, United States. The multi-use burial mound, associated with the Calusa, was first excavated by Wainwright; [verification needed] his measurements of the mound were: 24.4 m wide by 42.7 m long and 2.1 m high (80.1 × 140.1 × 6.9 ft.  Wainwright excavated five burials.  Turbeyfill excavated the burial mound in 1930 and recovered approximately 100 burials.  The mound is unique in that it contained one extended burial with grave goods, many secondary burials and a mass burial of 35-40 individuals.  State archaeologist James Miller excavated ceramic and other artifacts from the mound site in 1975.  What Miller's efforts produced has made the Aqui Esta one of the most significant sites in peninsular Florida. Approximately 45 rare shell cups, along with exotic incised ceramics vessels from Fort Walton and St. John, both 200 miles (320 km) to the north, were excavated.  The most recent discovery by the ceramics curator for the Florida Museum of Natural History, in 2005, were examples of Safety Harbor ceramics that employed a paste containing mica, a mineral found closest in the Appalachians in Georgia. [verification needed] Luer concluded that the site correlates with the Safety Harbor Culture, 1000–1200 A.D.  Recent[when?] discoveries and theories by Martin  Byers concerning the Hopewell Culture and Mississippian Culture indicate that Aqui Esta was a jointly created and maintained earthwork site used by trans-regional cult members.  The mound therefore may date to the period assigned by Byers, 200 B.C.
