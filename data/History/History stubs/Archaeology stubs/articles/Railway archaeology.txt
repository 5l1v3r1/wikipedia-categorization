Railway archaeology is the study and enjoyment of relics from past eras of rail transportation (including railways and tramways of all gauges and sizes). The aim of railway archaeology is to learn about the history and see images of the previous appearance of a defunct rail system that became redundant or abandoned and to enjoy searching out these remains and exploring them. Railway archaeology comes under the general ambit of the study of the industrial past and therefore is a sub-set of Industrial archaeology.

Light Railway Research Society of Australia is an Australian-based society that was formed in 1961 to promote interest in special-purpose railways. Much of its members' work would fall into the category of Railway archaeology.
