Vegesela in Byzacena was a Roman Era town tentatively identified with ruins at Henchir-Recba in modern Tunisia.  The town was in the Roman province of Byzacena. The ancient town was also the seat of an ancient Christian Bishopric, which survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.  Ren√© Coba Galarza is the current Bishop.   The diocese effectively ceased to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. Today the diocese of Vegesela in Byzacena (Latin: Dioecesis Vegeselitana in Byzacena) is a suppressed and titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.   There are only six documented bishops of Vegesela in Byzacena.
