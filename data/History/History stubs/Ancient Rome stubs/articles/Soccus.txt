A soccus, meaning slipper in Latin, is a loosely fitting shoe that has no ties,  a sole without hobnails, and a separate leather upper. They were worn by the Ancient Romans, at first especially by comic actors (compare the cothurnus for tragic actors).  Later it became popular with the general public, with several types being described in the Edict of Diocletian.
