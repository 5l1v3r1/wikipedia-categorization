The diribitorium was a public voting hall situated on the campus Martius in Ancient Rome. In this building, the votes cast by the people were counted by election officials. Construction of the building was started by Marcus Agrippa but finished by Augustus in 7 BC.  According to Cassius Dio, the diribitorium was among a number of public buildings that were destroyed by fire in 80 AD, and subsequently rebuilt by emperor Titus.
