Blatobulgium was a Roman fort, located at the modern-day site known as Birrens, in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Blatobulgium is recorded in the Antonine Itinerary. The name derives from the Brittonic roots *blāto- 'bloom, blossom' or *blāto- (from earlier *mlāto-), 'flour' and *bolgo-, 'bag, bulge'. The name may mean 'flowery hillock' or 'flowery hollow'. However, as there are granaries at the fort, Blatobulgium may be a nickname meaning 'Flour Sacks'.  The fortress formed the northern terminus of the Roman-era Watling Street, Route 2 of the Antonine Itinerary. It was located in the territory of the Selgovae. There have been more inscribed and sculptured stones found at Birrens than anywhere else in Scotland.  An altar stone dedicated to the Celtic goddess Ricagambeda was found at Birrens.
