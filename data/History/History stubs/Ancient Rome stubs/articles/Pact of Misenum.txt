The Pact of Misenum was a treaty to end the naval blockade of the Italian Peninsula during the Sicilian revolt. The pact was signed in 39 BC between Sextus Pompeius and the members of the Second Triumvirate. The triumvirs allowed Sextus Pompeius to retain his control of Sicily and Sardinia and also granted him control of Corsica and the Peloponnesus. They also promised him a future augurate and consulship for 33BCE. In exchange, Pompeius agreed to end his blockade of Italy, supply Rome with grain and halt his piracy.  The pact later fell apart when a triumvir, Mark Antony, refused to cede control of Achaea. Pompeius then resumed hostilities against Rome before being defeated at the naval Battle of Naulochus by the Republican general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.
