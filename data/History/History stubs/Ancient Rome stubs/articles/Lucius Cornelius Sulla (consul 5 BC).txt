Lucius Cornelius Sulla was a Roman senator of the Augustan age. Perhaps he was a son of Publius Cornelius Sulla, designated consul for 65 BC, which made him a grandnephew of the Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Lucius Cornelius Sulla was consul (together with the emperor Augustus) in 5 BC. His sons were Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus and Lucius Cornelius Sulla Magnus, both of whom became senators in Emperor Tiberius's reign.
