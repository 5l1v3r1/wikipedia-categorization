Stridon (Latin: Strido Dalmatiae) was a town in the Roman province of Dalmatia. The town is known as the birthplace of Saint Jerome. From Stridon also came the priest Lupicinus of Stridon. Although Domnus of Pannonia, a bishop who took part in the First Council of Nicaea, is often said to have hailed from or been bishop of Stridon, he was in fact bishop of Sirmium. In 379 the town was destroyed by the Goths. Jerome wrote about it in his work De viris illustribus:  "Hieronymus patre Eusebio natus, oppido Stridonis, quod a Gothis eversum, Dalmatiae quondam Pannoniaeque confinium fuit...". The exact location of Stridon is unknown. It is possible Stridon was located either in modern Croatia or Slovenia. Possible locations are the vicinity of Ljubljana,  Starod (Slovenia), Sdrin, Štrigova, Zrenj, Zrin (Croatia) and many others in both countries.    However, according to others, like Frane Bulić and his work "Stridon (Grahovopolje u Bosni) rodno mjesto Svetoga Jeronima: rasprava povjesno-geografska" (1920), and geographical map of the Roman Empire in 395 CE from "Historical Atlas" (1911) by William R. Shepherd, Stridon, which was the seat of a bishopric, is placed at 44.2N, 17.7E, in today's Bosnia, in Grahovsko polje (bs), near the town of Grahovo
