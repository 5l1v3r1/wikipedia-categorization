The Horti Liciniani  were a set of gardens in ancient Rome originally belonging to the gens Licinia. In the third century, these were owned by the Emperor Gallienus,  himself a member of the gens. The gardens were probably on the Esquiline Hill, at the top of which Gallienus erected a colossal statue of himself.  The 4th-century domed nymphaeum that survives, long miscalled a "Temple of Minerva Medica", is believed to have been part of the gardens.
