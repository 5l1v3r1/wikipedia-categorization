Edistiana  was an ancient Roman–Berber city in the province of Africa Proconsularis and in late antiquity of Byzacena. It was located in the modern Tunisia.  It was a former Catholic diocese. Edistiana was a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church.    Only one bishop of Edistiana is known, Miggin, a Donatist, at the Council of Carthage (411). Today Edistiana survives today as a titular bishopric;     the current titular bishop is Johannes Kreidler of Rottenburg–Stuttgart.
