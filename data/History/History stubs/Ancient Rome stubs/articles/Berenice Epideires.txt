Berenice Epideires (Greek: Βερενίκη ἐπὶ Δειρῆς, Steph. B. s. v.; Strabo xvi. pp. 769, 773; Mela, iii. 8; Plin. vi. 34; Ptol. viii. 16. § 12), or "Berenice upon the Neck of Land", was a town on the western shore of the Red Sea. It was located near the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, in modern-day Djibouti. The settlement's position on a sandy spit or promontory was the cause of its distinctive appellation. Some authorities, however, attribute the name to the neighborhood of a more considerable town named Deire (or Deira); but the precise situation of the latter is unknown.
