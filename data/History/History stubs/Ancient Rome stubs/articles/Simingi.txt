Simingi was a Roman era civitas (town) of the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis. The town was the seat of an ancient bishopric, suffragan of the Archdiocese of Carthage.   Only two bishops of this diocese are documented.  In modern times Simingi became a titular bishopric. Simingi's bishop is Galo Fern√°ndez Villaseca of Santiago, Chile.
