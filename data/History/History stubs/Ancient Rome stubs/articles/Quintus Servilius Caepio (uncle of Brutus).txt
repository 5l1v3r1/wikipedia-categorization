Quintus Servilius Caepio (died 59 BC), was the son of Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger and Livia, and the full brother to Servilia, mother of Caesar's assassin Marcus Junius Brutus. Caepio served as a tribune in the Third Servile War, and in his will he adopted Marcus Junius Brutus, the son of his sister Servilia.  For a period of time, Brutus used the name Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus to honor his uncle.
