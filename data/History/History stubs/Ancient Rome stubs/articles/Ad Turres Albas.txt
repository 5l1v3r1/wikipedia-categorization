Ad Turres Albas was an ancient city of Latium.  Ad Turres Albas originally belonged to the Volsci, and stood on the coast and on the Via Severiana, 9 miles from Circeii and 9 miles from Astura.  The location of Ad Turres Albas is not precisely known: the editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World place it at near the modern Lago di Caprolace in the Province of Latina, Lazio, Italy.
