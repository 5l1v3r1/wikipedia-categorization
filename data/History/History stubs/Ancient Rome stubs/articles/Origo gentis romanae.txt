The Origo Gentis Romanae ("The origins of Roman Race") is a short historiographic literary compilation. It narrates the origins of the Roman people. It starts with Saturn and finishes with Romulus. The work was earlier associated with Aurelius Victor, but it is no longer believed to be by his hand.
