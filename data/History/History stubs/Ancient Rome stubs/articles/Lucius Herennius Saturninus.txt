Lucius Herennius Saturninus was a Roman senator active during the reign of Domitian and Trajan (c. AD 81–117). He was suffect consul for the nundinium of May–June AD 100, with Pomponius Mamilianus as his colleague.  The cursus honorum of Saturninus is incomplete; only the two governorships he held are known. The first province he governed, as a proconsul, was Achaea in 98/99 before his consulship.  The other province was Moesia Superior, after his consulship from 102 to 106.  During his governorship, Trajan's Second Dacian War erupted. It is unclear how Saturninus was involved in this conflict, but his name is one of three legates mentioned in "Hunt's Pridianum", a papyrus document from an archive of a Roman auxiliary unit stationed along the Danube. This suggests he was involved in this war to some degree.
