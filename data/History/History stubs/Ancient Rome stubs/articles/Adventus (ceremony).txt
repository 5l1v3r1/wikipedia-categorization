IMP C M Q TRAIANVS DECIVS AVG ADVENTVS AVG This coin was struck to the occasion of emperor's return (adventus) to Rome. The adventus was a ceremony in ancient Rome, in which an emperor was formally welcomed into a city either during a progress or after a military campaign, often (but not always) Rome. The term is also used to refer to artistic depictions (usually in relief sculpture, including coins) of such ceremonies.   Its 'opposite' is the profectio.  For comparable ceremonies in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, sometimes employing consciously 'Roman' iconology, see Royal entry.
