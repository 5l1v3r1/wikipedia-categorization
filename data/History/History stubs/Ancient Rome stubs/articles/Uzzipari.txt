Uzzipari was a Roman town of the Roman Empire during late antiquity.  An exact location for the town has been lost to history  although that it was in the Roman province of Africa Proconsolaris means it must have been in northern Tunisia. In antiquity the town was also the seat of a Christian bishopric,   suffragan of the Archdiocese of Carthage. There are three documented bishops of this diocese.  Today Uzzipari survives as a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church and the current Bishop is Thomas Chakiath of Ernakulam-Angamaly.
