Atrans is the Roman name for Trojane, a town in Central Slovenia.  It was on the border between Italy and the province of Noricum. Ancient Romans built a road spanning Aquileia, Emona, Atrans and Celeia. This was a very important road, military, post and market place, and the town was surrounded by a defensive wall. The archaeological remains of Atrans can be still seen. Coordinates: 46°11′18″N 14°53′2″E﻿ / ﻿46.18833°N 14.88389°E﻿ / 46.18833; 14.88389
