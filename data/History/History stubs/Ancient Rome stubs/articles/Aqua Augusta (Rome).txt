The Aqua Augusta was a short aqueduct in Rome. Owing to severe drought, the Emperor Augustus built the Aqua Augusta in or around 33 BC in order to supplement the Aqua Marcia, and then later the Aqua Claudia when required.  However, the aqueduct was poorly designed and most of it collapsed in 27 BC. Coordinates: 41°53′12″N 12°28′10″E﻿ / ﻿41.88667°N 12.46944°E﻿ / 41.88667; 12.46944
