Aïn Tebernoc is a former Catholic diocese and archaeological site in Tunisia. Aïn Tebernoc has numerous Roman era ruins and is tentatively identified as the site of the ancient city of Tubernuca,  a municipum of the Roman Province of Africa Proconsolare Numerous inscriptions in situ confirm the name and status of the Roman city.  Following the Reconquista of Spain, a group of Andalusian Moors settled in its ruins at the end of the 15th century.  Ancient Tubernuca was also the seat of an ancient Catholic Bishopric.  It was a suffragan of Carthage, which survives today as a titular Bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church. On one bishop from antiquity is known to us, Repositus, a correspondent with Cyprian.  The current bishop of the Bishopric is Rubén Gonzalez Tierrablanca of Turkey who replaced Alberto Jiménez Iniesta of Spain in 2016.
