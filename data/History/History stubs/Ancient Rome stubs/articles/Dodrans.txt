The dodrans (from Latin de-quadrans: "less a quarter") or nonuncium (from Latin nona uncia: "ninth twelfth") was an Ancient Roman bronze coin produced during the Roman Republic. The dodrans, valued at three-fourth of an as (9 unciae),  was produced only twice: Dodrans as a unit may refer to a time span of forty-five minutes or a length of nine inches. It has also been used to refer to the metrical pattern ¯˘˘¯˘¯, which constitutes the last three-quarters of the glyconic line. Also called the choriambo-cretic, the pattern is common in Aeolic verse.
