Colonia Junonia (sometimes Iunonia) refers to an Ancient Roman colony established in 122 BC under the direction of Gaius Gracchus.  It is significant as it was the first 'transmarine' Roman colony.  The colony was located at the site of the destroyed city of Carthage, a reason for its widespread unpopularity with Romans.  Those superstitious about the site spread reports of ill omens, including a claim that wolves had carried off the boundary stakes.   The colony would only last 30 years. Julius Caesar later advised the construction of a city on the site on 45 BC, but his death stopped the creation of the new Roman colony after the first veterans moved in. The new Carthage was built by his adopted-son Augustus and named Colonia Julia Carthago.
