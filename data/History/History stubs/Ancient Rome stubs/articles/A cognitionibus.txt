In Ancient Rome, a cognitionibus was one of the four offices in the chancellor's Imperial Rome office that helped the emperor in his judicial function.    It was a formal office function, like the ad legationes.  With the restoration in Hadrian's era, it is possible that the office a libellis dominated the other three: a cognitionibus, a studiis and a censibus.  A studiis was a documentation office, and a cognitionibus was the office that studied the process of the emperor's appeal.  A correspondance office (ab epistutis) and an office that controlled the Roman Empire's finances (a rationibus) existed.   In the Third century the offices of a libellis and a censibus or a libellis and a cognitionibus were merged.  Marcius Agrippa was a cognitionibus and ab epistulis of Caracalla.  The a cognitionibus appears in works of Cassius Dio and Philostratus performing a job that arranges the order of cases before the emperor and summoning litigants into the auditorium.
