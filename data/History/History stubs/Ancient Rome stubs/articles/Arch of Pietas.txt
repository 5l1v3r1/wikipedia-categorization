The Arch of Pietas (Latin : Arcus Pietatis) was an ancient Roman triumphal arch to the north of the Pantheon on the Campus Martius in Rome. It may have been included in the portico surrounding the court in front of the Pantheon, between the baths of Nero and the temple of Matidia. The Mirabilia mentions it as being linked to the temple of Hadrian and near the churches of Santa Maria in Aquiro and the Maddalena.
