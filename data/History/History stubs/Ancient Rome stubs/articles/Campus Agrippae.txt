The Campus Agrippae is the area within the boundaries of ancient Rome named after Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. A number of construction projects were developed within its perimeters, including the Porticus Vipsania, built by his sister, Vipsania Polla, and finished by Augustus,  which ran along the western perimeter, against the Via Lata. There was also a race course. In 7 BCE, Augustus declared the Campus open to the public. In the Porticus Vipsania Augustus had a world map engraved on marble, following the descriptions given in Agrippa's geographical work, the Commentarii.
