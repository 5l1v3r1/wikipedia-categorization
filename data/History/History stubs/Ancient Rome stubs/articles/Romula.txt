Romula or Malva was an ancient city in Roman Dacia, later the village of Re≈üca, Dobrosloveni Commune, Olt County, Romania.  It was the capital of Dacia Malvensis, one of the three subdivisions of the province of Dacia. The Roman city of Romula lay on an earlier Dacian settlement called Malva. It received the title of municipium during the rule of Hadrian (117-138) and the title of colonia during that of Septimius Severus (193-211). The city had two belts of fortifications and two castra, where soldiers of the Legiones VII Claudia and XXII Primigenia were temporarily stationed, alongside a permanent unit (numerus) of Syrian archers.
