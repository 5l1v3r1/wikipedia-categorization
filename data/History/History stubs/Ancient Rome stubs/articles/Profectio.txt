The profectio ("setting forth") was the ceremonial departure of a consul in his guise as a general in Republican Rome,  and of an emperor during the Imperial era.  It was a conventional scene for relief sculpture and imperial coinage.  The return was the reditus  and the ceremonial reentry the adventus.
