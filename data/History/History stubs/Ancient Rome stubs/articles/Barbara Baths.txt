The Barbara Baths (German: Barbarathermen) are a large Roman bath complex in Trier, Germany. It is the largest Roman bath north of the Alps. It is designated as part of the Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St. Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier UNESCO World Heritage Site. For preservation, the baths are closed to visitors as of 2014. The Barbara Baths were built in the second century. The extensive ruins were used as a castle in the Middle Ages, then torn down and recycled as building material until the remains were used for constructing a Jesuit College in 1610. Only the foundations and the subterranean service tunnels have survived, but the technical details of the sewer systems, the furnaces, the pools, and the heating system can be studied better than in the other two baths of Trier.
