Trabea (plural trabeae) is the name of various pieces of Roman clothing. A distinct feature of all trabeae was their color - usually in red or purple. They were formed like a toga and possibly in some cases like a mantle piece and worn by more distinguished members of Roman society. Such clothing, known as the trabea triumphalis was worn commonly by consuls in Late Antiquity. When Emperor Justinian II formally abolished the title of consul as a separate entity from the Emperor himself, the trabea triumphalis was developed into the loros, which was the worn by the imperial family and senior administrative officials only. When emperor Leo VI formally abolished the ancient title of consul altogether, the loros persisted until the end of the empire as formal, ceremonial dress of the emperors
