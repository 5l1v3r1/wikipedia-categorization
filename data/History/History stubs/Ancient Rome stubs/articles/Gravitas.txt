Gravitas was one of the Roman virtues,  along with pietas, dignitas, and virtus, that were particularly appreciated in leaders. Evidence shows that it was most likely influenced by the Greek virtue of Arete. It may be translated variously as weight, seriousness, dignity, and importance and connotes a certain substance or depth of personality. It also conveys a sense of responsibility and commitment to the task.  In the British education system, gravitas was seen as one of the pillars of the moral formation of the English gentleman during the Victorian and Edwardian eras.   In the UK House of Commons, the quality is known as "bottom".
