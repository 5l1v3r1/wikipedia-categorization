A parmularius was any of the various types of gladiator who used a small shield called a parma.  Due to having a small shield parmularii would wear shin armour (ocreae) on both shins.  This armour would be larger than the single ocrea worn on the right shin by a scutarius who carried a larger shield. Scutarii and parmularii are mentioned by Marcus Aurelius in his Meditations as two factions at the gladiator fights.
