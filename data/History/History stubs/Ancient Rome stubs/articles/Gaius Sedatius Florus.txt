Gaius Sedatius Florus (Latin: C. Sedat. Florus;[I 1] fl. early 2nd-century AD)  was a lawyer and secretary for the administration of Portus Namnetum (modern Nantes) with Marcus Gemellius Secundus sometime in the early second century. A member of the Sedatii family, Florus could have been a relative, albeit a poor relation, to the senator Marcus Sedatius Severianus; he might have even been a client of Severianus, or even an emancipated slave.  According to an inscription found in Nantes,[I 1] Florus and Gemellius were prosecutors representing the people of the port and used their own money to establish a tribunal in the market place. The inscription is dated to the first half of the 2nd-century.
