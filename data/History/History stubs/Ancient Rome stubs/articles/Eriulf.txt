Eriulf (? - 391) was a Gothic warlord. He was a leader of the Thervingi, who under emperor Theodosius I had been settled as foederati along the lower Danube in 382. In the year 391, some of the these Thervingi rebelled against Roman rule. Eriulf was the leader of these rebels, and was opposed by the fellow Thervingi Fravitta, who remained loyal to the Romans. He was murdered by Fravitta in 391 at a banquet with Theodosius.
