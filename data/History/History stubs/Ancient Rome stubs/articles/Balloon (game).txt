Balloon, balloon-ball or wind-ball was a game similar to the modern game of volleyball in which a leather ball would be batted by the fist or forearm to prevent it from touching the ground.  The game was played in ancient Rome where it was known as follisâ€” the Latin word for a leather bag.  Such a ball made of leather was quite heavy and so protection might be used such as a leather gauntlet or wooden bracer.   Once rubber became available, modern players in Great Britain played the game with lighter balls of inflated rubber, so that younger children could play too.
