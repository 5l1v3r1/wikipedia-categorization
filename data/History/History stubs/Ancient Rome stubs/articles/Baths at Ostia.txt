The Baths at Ostia, otherwise known as the Thermae Gavii Maximi, are named after the mayor/ city prefect Gavias Maximus, who was the city prefect for 20 years. They were for public use in Ostia, Italy, and like many other Roman Thermae, created as a gift to the public and were therefore free. They were built during the reign of Emperor Antonius Pius and Septimius Severus (193-225AD).  The Baths were in the city centre and were the largest and grandest of all Ostia baths. Although very little remains today, archaeologists have found remains of arches which could be a connecting aqueduct which once provided the baths with water. However, it is also possible that the baths were run by a slave-driven wheel.
