Dorcon (Greek: Δορκων) is a character in the ancient Greek novel Daphnis and Chloe by Longus. A cow-herder and the would-be suitor of Chloe, Dorcon dies when pirates raid the country. Dorcon approaches Chloe's father to ask for her hand in marriage, trying to convince Dryas with a gift of noble cheeses. He tries to assuage his love for Chloe in a variety of ways, including one scene where he clothes himself in a wolf skin and hides in a bush. As he waits to sneak up on Chloe, he is attacked by Daphnis and Chloe's herding dogs. When Daphnis and Chloe discover the cause of commotion in the bush, they come to Dorcon's aid and assume he was playing some "pastoral trick."
