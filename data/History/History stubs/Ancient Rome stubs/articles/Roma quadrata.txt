Roma quadrata (Latin, "Square Rome") was an area, or perhaps a structure, within the original pomerium of the ancient city of Rome.  It apparently dated to the earliest stage of the city's formation.  The original meaning had already become obscure to both Latin and Greek historians by the late Roman Republic (2nd century BC).
