Mediolanum Aulercorum was a Roman town of Northern Gaul, attested in the 4th century AD. The name means "the central town of the Aulerci", the tribe that then inhabited the area; Mediolanum was a small regional center of Normandy, then in the Roman province of Lugdunensis. The name of the modern town, Ã‰vreux, derives from that of the sub-tribe Eburovices.
