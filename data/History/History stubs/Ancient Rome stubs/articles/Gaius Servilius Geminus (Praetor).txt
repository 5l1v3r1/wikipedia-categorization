Gaius Servilius Geminus (Latin: Caius Servilius P. F.) was a Roman magistrate. He served as land commissioner before being captured by the Boii in 218 BC. He was held as a prisoner of war in Cisalpine Gaul for 15 years until being freed by his son of the same name.  He was a member of gens Servilia, a patrician family.
