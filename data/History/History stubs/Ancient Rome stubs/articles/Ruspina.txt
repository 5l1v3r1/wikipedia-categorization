Ruspina (current location of Monastir, Tunisia) was a Punic-Roman city. It was the site of the Battle of Ruspina in 46 BC in which Pompey's ally Titus Labienus was able by mere force of numbers to inflict a slight check upon Julius Caesar. The exact location of the city is uncertain. Nathan Davis believes it was located at modern day Monastir. Multiple tombs and ruins have been discovered in this city that may have been part of Ruspina.  Coordinates: 35°46′10″N 10°49′31″E﻿ / ﻿35.7694°N 10.8253°E﻿ / 35.7694; 10.8253
