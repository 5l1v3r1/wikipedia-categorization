The Baths of Nero (Thermae Neronis) or Baths of Alexander (Thermae Alexandrinae) were a series of complex baths on the Campus Martius in ancient Rome, built by Nero in 62 and rebuilt by Alexander Severus in 227 or 229. They covered an area of about 190 by 120 metres. Their extent is shown by the modern-day piazza della Rotonda, via del Pozzo delle Cornacchie and via della Dogana Vecchia, all now on their site. It was initially supplied by the Aqua Virgo, which already supplying the neighbouring Baths of Agrippa, then (on its restoration in the 3rd century) by the Aqua Alexandrina. According to Sidonius Apollinaris, it was still in use in the 5th century. It was probably the first "imperial-type" complex of baths.
