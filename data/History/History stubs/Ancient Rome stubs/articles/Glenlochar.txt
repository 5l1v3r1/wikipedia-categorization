Glenlochar (Gd: Gleann Lochair) is a small hamlet on the western bank of the River Dee in the parish of Balmaghie, Dumfries and Galloway.  Glenlochar is located one and a half miles south of Balmaghie Kirk and three miles (5 km) north of Castle Douglas. The Glenlochar Barrage on the River Dee is part of the Galloway Hydro Electric Scheme.  The buried remains of a large Roman fort exist on the eastern bank of the River Dee, opposite Glenlochar. The fort was built in 81 AD by the Governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola and enclosed an area roughly 7 acres (28,000 m2).  Abbey Yard is the local name for the area containing the fort remains; this reflects the incorrect identification on Ordnance Survey maps prior to the 1940s as the site of an abbey.  During World War II Glenlochar was used as a training camp for the construction of Bailey bridges. The concrete slab foundations of the camp are still visible. An unexploded bomb shell was found at the site and a controlled explosion was conducted in 2002 . Glenlochar has a small community centre and a car park that used to be a local school.
