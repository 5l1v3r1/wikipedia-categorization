Carinae refers to the western end of the southern spur of the Esquiline hill in Rome. This district likely incorporated the earlier Fagutal, the northern tip of the Oppian Hill on its western side;   it extended between the Velian Hill and the Clivus Pullius. Its outlook was southwestern, across the swamps of the Palus Ceroliae toward the Aventine. According to Servius the name of this district comes from the fact the certain buildings standing near the temple of Tellus represented the keels (carinae) of ships.  The Murus Terreus also crossed the Carinae.  Florus named the Carinae as the "most celebrated part of the city" (celeberrima pars urbis).
