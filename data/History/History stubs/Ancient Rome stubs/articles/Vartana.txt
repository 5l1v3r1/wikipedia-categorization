Vartana (Vertare[n]sis) was a Roman-Berber town in Byzacena, Africa Proconsulare. It is identified with stone ruins in the area of Sr√¢a-Ouartane, Tunisia. The city of Vartana (also known as Vertara ) was also the seat of an ancient Catholic diocese. Only one bishop is known to us from antiquity. Since 1933 the diocese has been reestablished in name at least and a bishop has been appointed there ever since.  Bishop Vetalis is recorded as attendee to a Church Council in 314.  Bishop Leo Hale Taylor became the first of the new bishops on February 26, 1934. The current bishop is Giovanni Moretti (9 Sep 1971 Appointed - ), who succeeded bishop Carlo Minchiatt (1969 - 1971).
