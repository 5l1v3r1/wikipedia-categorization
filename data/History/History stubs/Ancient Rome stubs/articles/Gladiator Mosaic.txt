The Gladiator Mosaic is a famous mosaic of gladiators measuring about 28 meters,  dated to the first half of the 4th century. It was discovered in 1834 on the Borghese estate at Torrenova, on the Via Casilina outside Rome.  The antiquities which reinvigorated the Borghese Collection after it had shrunk following the sale of much of the collection to Napoleon I. The name of each gladiator depicted is given in inscription next to the figure, with a Ø symbol (possibly the Greek letter Θ, theta nigrum, for θάνατος "dead")  marking the names of gladiators who died in combat. The inscription is listed as CIL VI 10206.
