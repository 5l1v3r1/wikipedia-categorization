Thenae was a Roman-Berber town tentatively identified with Henchir-Tina in modern Tunisia.   Remains include a bath house, domus, city walls and housing. The town is on the Mediterranean coast.  In the ruins are the remains of an early Christian basilica. According to the Life of St. Fulgentius of Ruspe, a council was held at Tene (Thenitanum concilium). Thenae was the seat of a Christian Bishopric through late antiquity. There are six documented bishops of this ancient diocese.  Today Tene survives as a titular bishop's seat; the current titular bishop is Marian Du≈õ, former auxiliary bishop of Warsaw. The town was from antiquity the seat of a Christian bishopric which survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.
