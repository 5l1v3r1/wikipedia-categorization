The 1856 Djijelli earthquakes occurred on August 21 and 22 near the coastal area of northern Algeria. The magnitude of the two shocks are unknown, but each had a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). Each of these high intensity shocks were felt as far as Genoa in northern Italy and were followed by a tsunami that affected the Mediterranean Sea. Three people were killed as a result of the second event. Sources
