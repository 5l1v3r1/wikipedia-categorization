Seismologists sometimes refer to a pair of similarly sized earthquake shocks that occur relatively closely spaced in time and location as an earthquake "doublet."  This occurrence is distinct from the normal pattern of earthquake aftershocks. Aftershocks gradually diminish in magnitude and generally come from the same origin as a mainshock, whereas doublet earthquakes originate from a place other than the original earthquake rupture area.  The first earthquake can be a considerable distance and time away from the second earthquake. The magnitude of the second quake may even be slightly larger than the first.   Earthquakes identified as doublets occur once or twice globally every year, making them far rarer than more typical earthquake patterns. In earthquake prone regions officials do not plan for doublet earthquakes occurring because they are so rare.  However, when they do occur, they have a high disaster potential.  Some large earthquakes may be closely spaced doublet earthquakes, where the shaking from the rupture of the first fault or fault section overlaps with shaking from the rupture of a second fault section nearby.  The two separate sources for these earthquakes are usually only identified by seismologists after extensive analysis, not in real time. Closely spaced doublet earthquakes could enhance tsunami risk or complicate tsunami warning efforts.
