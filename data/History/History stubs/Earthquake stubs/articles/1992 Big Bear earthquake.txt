 The 1992 Big Bear earthquake occurred at 08:05:33 PDT on June 28 in Big Bear Lake, California, with a moment magnitude of 6.5 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) and caused landslides in the San Bernardino Mountains.  This earthquake occurred three hours after the 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake, which was centered 22 miles (35 km) to the east.  The closely timed occurrence of these earthquakes is an often-cited example of a regional earthquake sequence.  Both earthquakes had occurred significantly close to the southern portion of the San Andreas Fault, and the Landers event may have reduced the compressional stress in that area.
