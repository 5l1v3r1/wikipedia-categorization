The 1967 Caracas earthquake  occurred in Caracas, Venezuela, and La Guaria, Vargas on July 29 at 8:05 p.m (UTC-4 at that time). Its epicenter took place in the litoral central (20Â km from Caracas) and lasted 35 seconds. It heavily affected areas such as Altamira, Los Palos Grandes, and Litoral Central. After the earthquake, there were several aftershocks of lower intensity. The earthquake had a magnitude between 6.5 and 6.7  on the Richter scale. It left a toll of 2,000 injured, 236 dead, and cost more than 10 million United States Dollars in property damage. Damage was extensive in the Altamira and Los Palos Grandes sections of Caracas where four major apartment buildings, 10 to 12 stories high, collapsed.  Many additional structures were severely damaged and several had to be razed and reconstructed. Huge sections of walls fell from buildings, flattening cars below and leaving large portions of structures exposed. Rescue workers used cranes and bulldozers to search through the rubble for survivors or victims of the earthquake. A week after the shock, in Caraballeda, rescue operations continued for persons believed trapped beneath the floors of Mansion Charaima, an apartment building across the street from the Macuto Sheraton (which was also damaged). Maracay, about 50 miles west of Caracas, reported five deaths and 100 injuries. Several additional towns reported structural damage.
