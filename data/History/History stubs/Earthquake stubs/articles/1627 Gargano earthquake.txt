The 1627 Gargano earthquake struck Gargano, southern Italy, at about mid-day on 30 July 1627. A "very large earthquake" caused a major tsunami, the largest seismic event ever recorded in the Gargano region,  which "produced severe damage in the whole promontory", killing about 5000 people.  Four aftershocks were documented. The most extensive damage was noted between San Severo and Lesina.
