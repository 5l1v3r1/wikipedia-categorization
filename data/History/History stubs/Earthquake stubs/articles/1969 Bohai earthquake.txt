The 1969 Bohai earthquake occurred on July 18, 1969, at 13:24 local time. The epicenter was located in the Bohai Sea, off the coast of Shandong Province, China. The magnitude of this earthquake is Ms 7.4. Areas of maximal intensity were mainly distributed around the estuary of the Yellow River. Ground cracks and sand boils were reported. The earthquake could be felt in Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu. Ten people were reported dead.  This earthquake caused ground surface subsidences of about 15.1 cm ~ 15.8 cm in the Yellow River Delta region.  The mechanism of this earthquake was of dextral strike-slip faulting.   Although it was located near the Tancheng-Lujiang fault zone (郯庐断裂带), some researchers think that this earthquake was dominated by the seaward extending part of the Huanghekou-Liaocheng seismotectonic zone (黄河口-聊城地震构造带).
