 On 23 January 2018, at 13:34:50 Western Indonesian Time (06:34:54 UTC), an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Java near the city of Lebak. The earthquake, measured 5.9 on the Mww, occurred approximately 40 kilometres south of the village of Binuangeun at a depth of 43.9 kilometres. The earthquake was categorized as a strong and shallow earthquake.  Strong shaking were widely reported across Banten, Lampung, West Java, Central Java and Jakarta. The tremor in Jakarta was much harder than in other recent quakes. By the virtue of its distance from the Indo-Australian plate, the capital normally does not experience strong tremors.  Two people were indirectly killed by the earthquake. Property damage was reported in West Java and Banten. 2,760 and 3,669 buildings were reported damaged in Lebak and Sukabumi respectively.  Two people died from heart attack in Lebak and Sukabumi and 35 others were injured.
