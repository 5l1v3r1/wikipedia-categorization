The Ammiyya  (Arabic: ʿĀmmiyya‎) was a revolt against Ottoman rule in Syria in 1889–1890. The peasants sought to curb the abuses of local sheikhs, restricting them to ⅛ of the communal land. They also wanted to partition the rest of the communal land into individual plots outside the sheikh's control, ending their ability to evict poor farmers.  Druze opposition was led by the Atrash family.  The revolt was largely successful in its aims, restricting the sheikhs to ⅛ of the village land  and establishing the system of land tenure which continued in Syria through the Assad regime.  Desire to placate the locals also prompted the concessions to French and Belgian companies that led to the DHP, the area's first railway.
