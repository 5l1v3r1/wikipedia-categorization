Family of the Athenian nobility of the late Byzantine and Ottoman years. The name of the family seems to originate from the usual title of the members of the local governing councils of the Greek communities during late medieval and early Ottoman years (Gerontes, meaning the "Elders", or Dimogerontes). Several Prokritoi (local governors) of Athens during the Ottoman era were members of this family. After the Greek War of Independence the family has given several prominent members of the Athenian society (mayors of the city, scientists, lawyers, writers, poets, translators).
