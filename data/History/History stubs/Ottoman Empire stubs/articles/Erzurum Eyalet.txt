The Erzurum Eyalet (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت ارضروم; Eyālet-i Erżurūm‎)  was an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. It was established after the conquest of Western Armenia by the Ottoman Empire. Its reported area in the 19th century was 11,463 square miles (29,690 km2).  The eyalet was established in 1533.  Early in the 17th century, the eyalet was threatened by Iran and the revolt by the province governor Abaza Mehmed Pasha. This revolt was combined with Jelali Revolts (the uprising of the provincial musketeers called the Celali), backed by Iran and lasted until 1628. It was one of the first Ottoman provinces to become a vilayet after an administrative reform in 1865, and by 1867 it had been reformed into the Erzurum Vilayet.
