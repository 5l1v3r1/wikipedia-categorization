Deliler (Turkish: Deli , Ottoman Turkish: دلی‎, Delü), meaning "daring, brave, fearless, audacious, intrepid, valiant , plural: deliler) was an Ottoman irregular light cavalry unit. Their main role was to act as shock troops on the front lines by using guerrilla tactics, and to put opposing army in a state of confusion and shock also acting as personal guard of high level Ottoman officials in the Rumeli during peace time. The unit is first established in Rumelia Eyalet around middle of 15th century to create a force to protect the borders of the empire in the Balkans and coming to full power around 16th century. The unit is usually confused in historical records with the Akinji, both being light cavalry units and being part of Eyalet soldiers, although they were not related. Sultan Mahmud II abolished the unit on 1829, like Disbandment of Janissaries, while trying to reform the army and establish one in the Western model.
