Trebizond Eyalet (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت طربزون; Eyālet-i Ṭrabzōn‎)  or Trabzon Beylerbeyliği was an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. Established in 1598,  it remained a primarily Christian region into the 17th century, well after the rest of Anatolia had been converted to Islam.  Its reported area in the 19th century was 10,507 square miles (27,210 km2).
