The Treaty of the Pruth was signed on the banks of the river Pruth between the Ottoman Empire and the Tsardom of Russia on 21 July 1711, ending the Russo-Turkish War of 1710â€“1711. The treaty was a political victory for the Ottoman Empire.  The Treaty stipulated the return of Azov to the Ottomans, Taganrog and several Russian fortresses were to be demolished, and the Tsar pledged to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which the Russians increasingly saw as under their sphere of influence.
