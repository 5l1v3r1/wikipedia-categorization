 A kadiluk, in some cases equivalent to a kaza, was a local administrative subdivision of the Ottoman empire, which was the territory of a kadı, or judge.  There could be several kadiluks in a sanjak. The kadı's duties extended beyond those of a modern judge; in addition to law enforcement, kadiluks were involved in matters such as taxation and conscription.   Although every kaza had a kadı, not every kadı was in charge of a kaza; a kadı's position moved, over time, with demographic and political changes.  In the Tanzimat reforms of 1864, kadiluks were decoupled from kazas.
