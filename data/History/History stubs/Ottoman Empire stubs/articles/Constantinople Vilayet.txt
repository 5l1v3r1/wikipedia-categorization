Ethnic Groups in Constantinople Vilayet The Vilayet of Constantinople  or Istanbul was a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire, encompassing the imperial capital, Constantinople (Istanbul). It had a special organisation, as it was placed under the immediate authority of the Minister of Police (Zabtiye Naziri), who filled a role equivalent to the governor (wali) in other vilayets.  It included Istanbul and the quarters of Eyüp, Kassim Pacha, Pera and Galata, and all the suburbs from Silivri on the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea on the European side, and from Ghili on the Black Sea to the end of the Gulf of İzmit on the Asiatic side.  In 1878, a provincial structure, with a governor (wāli) and provincial officers, was established  to perform the same functions within Istanbul that provincial authorities performed elsewhere in the Empire.
