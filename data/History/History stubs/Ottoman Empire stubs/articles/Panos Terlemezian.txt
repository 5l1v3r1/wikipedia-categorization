His role in liberation movement that had been carried in Western Armenia is important. He continued education and majored in fine arts.

Terlemezian also befriended, painted, and roomed with Komitas Vardapet during Komitas's  years in the Ottoman Empire. In 1909, Panos Terlemezian was elected as a mayor of Van.
