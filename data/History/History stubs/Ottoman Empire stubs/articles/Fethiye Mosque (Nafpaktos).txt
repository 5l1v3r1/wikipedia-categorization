The Fethiye Mosque (Greek: Φετιχιέ τζαμί; Turkish: Fethiye Camii, "Mosque of the Conquest") is an Ottoman mosque in Nafpaktos, Greece. It was built in the orders of Sultan Bayezid II immediately after the capture of the city from the Venetians in 1499, and was the city's main mosque throughout the Ottoman period. It was also known after its founder as the Bayezid-i Veli Mosque. The mosque has been extensively restored and now functions as an exhibition hall.
