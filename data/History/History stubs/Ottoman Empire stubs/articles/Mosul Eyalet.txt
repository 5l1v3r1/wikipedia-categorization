Mosul Eyalet (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت موصل; Eyālet-i Mūṣul‎)  was an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. Its reported area in the 19th century was 7,832 square miles (20,280 km2).  The eyalet was largely inhabited by Kurds.  Sultan Selim I defeated the army of Shah Ismail at the Battle of Çaldiran, but it wasn't until 1517 that Ottoman armies gained control of Mosul, which remained a frontier garrison city until the 1534 capture of Baghdad.  The eyalet was established in 1535.  Mosul then became one of three  Ottoman administrative territorial units of ‘Irāk.
