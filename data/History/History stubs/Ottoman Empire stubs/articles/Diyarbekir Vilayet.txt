Ethnic Groups in Diyarbekir Vilayet based on 1914 population statistics for the Ottoman Empire The Vilayet of Diyâr-ı Bekr (Ottoman Turkish: ولايت ديار بكر‎, Vilâyet-i Diyarbakır)  was a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire, wholly located within what is now modern Turkey. The vilayet extended south from Palu on the Euphrates to Mardin and Nusaybin on the edge of the Mesopotamian plain.  After the establishment of Republic of Turkey in 1923, the region was incorporated into the newly created state. At the beginning of the 20th century, it reportedly had an area of 18,074 square miles (46,810 km2), while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 471,462.  The accuracy of the population figures ranges from "approximate" to "merely conjectural" depending on the region from which they were gathered.  The vilayet of Diyarbakir was created in 1867. In 1879–80 one part of the vilayet, which included Malatya, was made the vilayet of Elazig.  Sanjaks of the vilayet:
