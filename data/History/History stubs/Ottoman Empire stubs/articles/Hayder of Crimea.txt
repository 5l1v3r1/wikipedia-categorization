Hayder Khan Girai, Hayder (Crimean Tatar: Hayder, حيدر‎‎) (d. about 1487) was a Crimean Khan in 1456, and a son of Hacı I Giray. In 1456, he rebelled against his father and occupied the throne for a short time until the failure of the rebellion. During the reign of his brother, Meñli I Giray, Hayder was captured and imprisoned in the Genoese fortress of Soldaia. After the Ottoman conquest of Crimea (1475), Hayder and his brother Nur Devlet fled to Kiev in the Polish Kingdom. In about 1479, he moved to Muscovy under protection of the grand duke Ivan III, who later banished Hayder to exile to Northern Muscovy (for reasons that remain unknown). He died about 1487 in Beloozero, Vologda oblast.
