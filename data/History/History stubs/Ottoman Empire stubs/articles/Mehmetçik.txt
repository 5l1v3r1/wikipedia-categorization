Mehmetçik (literally: Little Mehmet) is a general term used affectionately to refer soldiers of the Ottoman Army and Turkish Army. It is similar to the colloquialisms Tommy Atkins, Doughboy, and Digger used for the British, U.S., and Austrialian armies.   Although it is used for especially infantryman (foot soldier),  terms such like Piyade Mehmetçik (Infantryman Little Mehmet) and Süvari Mehmetçik (Cavalryman Little Mehmet), Topçu Mehmetçik (Artilleryman Little Mehmet) have occasionally been seen.  It is considered that "Mehmetçik" was coined after Ottoman Army Sergeant Bigalı Mehmet Çavuş (1878–1964), who fought during the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I.
