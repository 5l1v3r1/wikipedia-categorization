The Yemen Eyalet  (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت یمن, Eyālet-i Yemen‎)  was an eyalet (province) of the Ottoman Empire. In 1872, most of it became Yemen Vilayet after a land reform in the empire. In 1516, the Mamluks of Egypt annexed Yemen; but in the following year, the Mamluk governor surrendered to the Ottomans, and Turkish armies subsequently overran the country. They were challenged by the Zaidi Imam, Qasim the Great (r.1597–1620), and by 1636, the Zaydi tribesmen had driven the Ottomans out of the country completely.
