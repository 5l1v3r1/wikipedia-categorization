The Treaty of Saint Petersburg was concluded on January 29, 1834 between the Ottoman Porte and Russia. This treaty, by promising the evacuation of the Principalities, and reducing the Turkish payments to one-third of the stipulated amount, relieved the Porte from some engagements enforced on it by the Treaty of Adrianople (the treaty which ended the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829).
