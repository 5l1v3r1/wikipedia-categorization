The Aslan Pasha Mosque (Greek: τζαμί Ασλάν Πασά) is an Ottoman-built mosque in the city of Ioannina, Greece. The mosque was built in 1618 in the city's castle, replacing the Church of Saint John, which was torn down after the failed anti-Ottoman revolt of 1611 led by Dionysius the Philosopher. Since 1933 it houses the Municipal Ethnographic Museum of Ioannina. Coordinates: 39°40′24.8″N 20°51′36.9″E﻿ / ﻿39.673556°N 20.860250°E﻿ / 39.673556; 20.860250﻿ (Aslan Pasha Mosque)
