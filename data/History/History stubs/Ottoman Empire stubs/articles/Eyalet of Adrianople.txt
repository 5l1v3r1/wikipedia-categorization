The Eyalet of Adrianople or Edirne  or Çirmen  (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت ادرنه; Eyālet-i Edirne‎)  was constituted from parts of the eyalets of Silistra and Rumelia in 1826.  It was one of the first Ottoman provinces to become a vilayet after an administrative reform in 1865, and by 1867 it had been reformed into the Vilayet of Adrianople.  The eyalet comprised almost all of the historical geographical region of Thrace, and comprised the following subdivisions (sanjaks or livas):   The sanjaks were further subdivided into 50 kazas or prefectures.
