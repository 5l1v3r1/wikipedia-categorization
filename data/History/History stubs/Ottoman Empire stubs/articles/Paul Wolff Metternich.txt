Paul Graf Wolff Metternich zur Gracht (December 5, 1853 – 1934) was a Prussian and German ambassador in London (1901–1912) and Constantinople (1915–1916). He was a prominent German opponent of Turkish actions in the Armenian Genocide. Count Metternich held early diplomatic postings in London, Brussels and South America. He was appointed Envoy Extraordinary from the German Empire to the Court of St. James's in September 1901, in the absence due to illness of the Ambassador, Count von Hatzfeldt.  He was formally appointed German Ambassador in November the same year, when Count Hatzfeldt resigned shortly before his death. King Edward VII received his credentials at Marlborough House 2 December 1901.  He wrote in a report to Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg on July 10, 1916, "In a realisation of their plan to resolve the Armenian Question by destroying the Armenian race, the Turkish Government is not stopped neither by our representatives, nor by the public opinion of the west."
