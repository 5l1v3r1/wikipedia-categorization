The Armenian Patriotic Society of Europe was founded in 1885 by Garabed Hagopian and Mekertich Portukalian. Its goal was to facilitate the Armenian Diaspora in providing aid in their native land, both financially and politically due to their oppressed condition. Its headquarters were in Chesilton Road, Fulham.
