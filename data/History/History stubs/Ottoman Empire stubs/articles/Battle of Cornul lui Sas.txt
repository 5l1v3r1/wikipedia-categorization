The Battle of Cornul lui Sas took place on 9 July 1612 between the forces of the principality of Moldavia, (supported by the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate) and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It resulted in a clear victory of the Moldavians, under the command of Ștefan IX Tomșa.   The former voivode of Moldavia Constantin Movilă was taken prisoner by the Crimean Tartars, with the intent to ransom him, but he drowned while they were crossing the Dniester.
