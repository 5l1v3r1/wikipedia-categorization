Vekil was an Ottoman term meaning "legal representative", "proxy", or "delegate". It was used for a large variety of instances, e.g. for the representative of a woman before a court, or for the representatives of millet communities at the Ottoman court. In the same vein, the viziers were considered "absolute delegates" (vekil-i mutlak) of the Ottoman Sultan.
