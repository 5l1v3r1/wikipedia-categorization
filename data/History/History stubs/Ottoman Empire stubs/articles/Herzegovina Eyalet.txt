The Eyalet of Herzegovina (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت هرسك; Eyālet-i Hersek‎)  was an Ottoman eyalet from 1833 to 1851. Its last capital was Mostar. In 1831, Bosnian kapudan Husein Gradaščević occupied Travnik, demanding autonomy and the end of military reforms in Bosnia.  Ultimately, exploiting the rivalries between beys and kapudans, the grand vizier succeeded in detaching the Herzegovinian forces, led by Ali-paša Rizvanbegović, from Gradaščević’s.  The revolt was crushed, and in 1833, a new eyalet of Herzegovina was created from the southern part of the eyalet of Bosnia and given to Ali Agha Rizvanbegović as a reward for his contribution in crushing the uprising.  This new entity lasted only for a few years: after Rizvanbegović's death, it was reintegrated into the Bosnia eyalet. The Pashaluk of Herzegovina was formed from following counties:  Prijepolje, Pljevlja with Kolašin and Šaranci with Drobnjak, Čajniče, Nevesinje, Nikšić, Ljubinje-Trebinje, Stolac, Počitelj, Blagaj, Mostar, Duvno and half of the county of Konjic which is on southern side of Neretva.
