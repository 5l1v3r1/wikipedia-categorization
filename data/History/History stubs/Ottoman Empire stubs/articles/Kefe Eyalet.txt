The Eyalet of Kefe or Caffa (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت كفه; Eyālet-i Kefê‎)  was an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. The eyalet stretched across the northern coast of the Black Sea with the main sanjak (Pasha sanjak) being located in the southern coast of Crimea. The eyalet was under direct Ottoman rule, completely separate from the Khanate of Crimea.  Its capital was at Kefe, the Turkish name for Caffa (modern Feodosiya in Ukraine). The city of Caffa and its surroundings were first made an Ottoman dominion after the Turks overran the Genoese in 1475, after which a sanjak centred on Caffa was created.  The Eyalet of Kefe was formed in 1568 as a beylerbeylik.  By the 17th-century accounts of Evliya Çelebi, its sanjaks were "ruled by Voivodas immediately appointed by the Ottoman Sultan and not by the Khans".  The eyalet was annexed to a briefly independent Khanate of Crimea as a result of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774.  The Khanate itself would be annexed by Russia in 1783.  The administrative divisions of the beylerbeylik of Kefe between 1700-1730 were as follows:
