Ferik was a military rank of the Ottoman Army. It is translated as Lieutenant General (Korgeneral).  It was senior to a Mirliva (Major General, modern Tümgeneral in the Turkish Army) and junior to a Birinci Ferik (General, modern Orgeneral in the Turkish Army). The collar mark (later shoulder mark) and cap of a Ferik had three stripes and two stars during the early years of the Turkish Republic. The Ottoman Army and pre-1934 Turkish Army had three general ranks (similar to the British ranking system), while the current Turkish Army has four general ranks (similar to the American ranking system), with the inclusion of Brigadier General (Tuğgeneral) as the fourth and most junior general rank.  The title of Ferik was abolished with Act No. 2590 of 26 November 1934 on the Abolition of Titles and Appellations such as Efendi, Bey or Pasha.
