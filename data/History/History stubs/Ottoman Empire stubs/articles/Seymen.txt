Seymen (Turkish: seÄŸmen, Persian segban - "Dog sitter") was a rank in the Seljuk military, introduced at the time of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . After their triumph, they became protectors of Turkic tribes which had started to settle all around Anatolia.  They were used as a police force in Konya for a time, but were shortly disbanded after the Mongol Invasion, to be introduced by the Ottoman Empire in the 13th century.  In Ottoman society, the Seymen tradition continued to exist as a paramilitary youth organization. They were known for their unique uniforms and arms.  During the Turkish Independence War, Seymens took up arms once again and fought against the invading forces. Ankara, the stronghold of Seymens, ultimately became the capital of the new Turkish republic. Today, it is a kind of tradition in Anatolia, in which there are men wearing costumes of bandits. The traditional Seymen dance, also associated with the province of Ankara, is known as Misket. Seymen is also a Turkish personal name, as well as a toponym.
