Ouranoupoli (Greek: Ουρανούπολη, formerly Ouranopolis, en. "City of Heaven") is an ancient city and a modern village in Chalcidice. It was founded by Cassander's brother Alexarchus in the late 4th century BC.  The village is today called Ouranoupoli. The village of Ouranoupoli is situated on the coastline in the northwest part (the very beginning) of the Athos peninsula, part of the bigger Chalkidiki peninsula. It is the last settlement before the border with the monastic state of Mount Athos (the Holy Mountain). The village houses the Christian Chalkidiki Exhibition at the old tower. The city of Thessaloniki is about 140 Km from Ouranoupoli.
