Oesyme or Oisyme (Attic Greek: Οίσύμη, Doric Greek: Οίσύμα, Homeric Greek: Αίσύμη) was an ancient Greek  polis located in Thrace and later in Macedonia. It was within the region of Edonis between the river Strymon and the river Nestos. It was founded by colonists from Thasos perhaps at 650 BC. It was later renamed (Ancient Greek: Ημαθία) after its occupation by Phillip II of Macedon.  It was considered a polis and an emporion at the same time. It is the only city of the Thasian peraia mentioned by Homer (as Ancient Greek: Αίσύμη). Oisyme joined  Brasidas after he captured Amphipolis along with Myrkinos and Galepsus. The location of the ancient city is identified with the fortified citadel on cape Vrasidas south of the village of Nea Peramos  in the southern part of the bay of Eleutherai.
