Kotthybos (Greek: κότθυβος) was a type of Macedonian armor. The name originally referred to a metallic cooking pot used by Macedonian soldiers to prepare their own food.  The term appears to be a variant of terms such as Kossymbos, Kosymbe,  perizoma aigyption, "Egyptian girdle" (Egyptians were known to have used linen armor), Cretan or small shield, bandage, hairnet and outward ornamental garment explained by Hesychius.
