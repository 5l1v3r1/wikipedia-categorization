Harpina is said to have been founded by a son of Ares, Oenomaus, who gave it the name of his mother, a nymph who was daughter of Asopus. The ruins of the town were seen by Pausanias.  According to Strabo, Harpina stood upon the stream Parthenius;  according to Pausanias, upon one called Harpinates.   The site of Harpina is tentatively located among ruins lying north of the village of Miraka.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
