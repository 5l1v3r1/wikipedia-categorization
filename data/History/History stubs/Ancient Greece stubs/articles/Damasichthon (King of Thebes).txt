In Greek mythology, Damasichthon, King of Thebes, was son to Opheltes of Thebes, purported to be son to Peneleos (regent of Thebes), the son of Hippalcimus, son of Itonus, son to Boeotus. As Autesion, king of Thebes, left the city in obedience to an oracle, Damasichthon was designated as his successor. Damasichthon was the father of Ptolemaeus, who took over the government after him.
