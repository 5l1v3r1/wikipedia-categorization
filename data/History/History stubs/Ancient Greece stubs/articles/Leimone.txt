Leimone (Λειμώνη) or Leimonis (Λειμωνίς)  was, in an Ancient Athenian legend, the daughter of Hippomenes, a descendant of King Codrus. When her father caught her having illicit sex, he killed her lover and locked her in an empty house together with a horse. The animal eventually came to be starving and devoured Leimone. The remains of that house were still extant in the times of Aeschines, and the place was known as "At the Horse and the Maiden".
