Livy relates that the retreat of Philip V of Macedon after the Battle of the Aous (198 BC) allowed the Aetolians to occupy much of Thessaly, and these latter devasted Angeia and its neighbour, Ctimene.  Modern scholars identify the site of Angeia with the modern village of Loutropigi (el).    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed. (1854–1857).
