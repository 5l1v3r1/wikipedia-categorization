Eordaea (Greek: Ἐορδαία) was an ancient kingdom and later an administrative region of the kingdom of Macedon. It was part of the ancient geographical region of Upper Macedonia and was located south of Lynkestis, west of Emathia, north of Elimiotis and east of Orestis.  The modern province and municipality Eordaia were named after the ancient kingdom and region. The capital of Eordaea was the city of Eordaea (el) (Greek: Εορδαία, κείμενη της λίμνης), which was mentioned by many historians and geographers of the antiquity. The history of Eordaea can be found stretching long before 2000 BCE when the first Greeks known as the Mycenean Greeks began to inhabit this area. Remnants of the exploited copper mines from 2700 up until 1200 BCE indicate strongly that the Greeks inhabited Eordaea for many years. Iron mines have also been exploited in the Eordean region. Within a 50-year period, paleontologists and archaeologists have made many discoveries due to the industrial development of the Eordean countryside. In particular, the skeletal fossils of a prehistoric mammoth, a prehistoric elephant, and Stone Age tools have all been found within the province of Eordaea. These finds add to knowledge on the variety of animal species and human artifacts from the region of Western Macedonia.  Many ancient towns of Eordaea are mentioned and many archaeological sites have been examined on the past decades, certainly around the Vegoritida lake, but it is difficult to distinguish their names. The most significant towns, according to Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Greek writers, were: Coordinates: 40°30′00″N 21°40′00″E﻿ / ﻿40.5000°N 21.6667°E﻿ / 40.5000; 21.6667
