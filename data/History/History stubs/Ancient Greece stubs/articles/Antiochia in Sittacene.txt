Antiochia in Sittacene (Greek: Αντιόχεια ή Σιτακηνή) was an ancient city founded in the Hellenistic period, possibly by Antiochus I.  Pliny in his Natural History, Book 6, § 206, describes it as an important town in the western part of the ancient region of Sittacene, between the Tigris and Tornadotus rivers.  Its present site is in Iraq.
