Meliboea or Meliboia (Ancient Greek: Μελίβοια) was a town of Histiaeotis in ancient Thessaly.  It was located near Aeginium and Tricca.  William Martin Leake conjectured that its site was at the present town of Vasiliki,  and modern scholarship still leaves the site as unknown.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
