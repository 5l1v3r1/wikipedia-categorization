Kakodaimonistai (ancient Greek κακοδαιμονισταί, singular κακοδαιμονιστής, worshippers of the evil deamon) was the name of a dining club in ancient Athens. They chose the name to ridicule the gods and Athenian custom.  One of the ways in which they did this, was by dining on unlucky days (ἡμέραι ἀποφράδες) to test the gods.
