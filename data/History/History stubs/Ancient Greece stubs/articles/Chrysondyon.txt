Coordinates: 40°52′N 20°11′E﻿ / ﻿40.867°N 20.183°E﻿ / 40.867; 20.183 Chrysondyon (Greek: Χρυσονδύων; acc. Χρυσονδύωνα ) was an ancient Greek   city of the Dassaretae   to the north of Mount Tomor in Chaonia at the border of the region of Epirus  with Illyria. The earliest coins yielded by excavation are of Philip II of Macedon;  the massive circuit wall with a fine gateway dates probably to the late 4th century BC. Names are preserved on tile stamps and amphora seals; weapons, tools, and fibulas were found. Kodrion figured in the wars between Macedon and Rome.  It was in the general vicinity of Antipatreia and Gertous. The name could also be found as Codrio or Codrion in Latin.  It is probably located in the district of Gramsh, modern Albania.
