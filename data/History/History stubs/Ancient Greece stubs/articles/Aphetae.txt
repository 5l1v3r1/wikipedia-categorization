Coordinates: 39°08′27″N 23°16′27″E﻿ / ﻿39.1408°N 23.2743°E﻿ / 39.1408; 23.2743 Aphetae (Ancient Greek: Ἀφεταί  or Ἀφέται ) was a port of Magnesia in Ancient Thessaly, said to have derived its name from the departure of the Argonauts from it. The Persian fleet occupied the bay of Aphetae, previous to the Battle of Artemisium in 480 BCE, from which Aphetae was distant 80 stadia, according to Herodotus.  Modern scholars tentatively place the site of Aphetae in a place called Kato Yeoryios (el) near the modern village of Platania (Πλατανιάς).   The modern village of Afetes, at some distance to Kato Yeoryios, was renamed to reflect this ancient port.  This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
