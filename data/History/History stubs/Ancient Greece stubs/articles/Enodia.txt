Ennodia (also Enodia and Einodia) (Greek: Ἐννοδία, the one in the streets) was an ancient Greek goddess, identified in certain areas or by certain ancient writers with Artemis, Hecate or Persephone. Timarete of Corinth, who died in Pella, Macedonia in the late 5th century BC, is the only attested priestess of this Goddess.
