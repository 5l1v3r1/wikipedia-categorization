Livy relates that the retreat of Philip V of Macedon after the Battle of the Aous (198 BC) allowed the Aetolians to occupy much of Thessaly, and these latter, after sacking Xyniae took Cypaera.  It has been located at a site called Palaia Yannitsou within the territory between the modern villages of Kaitsa (Λουτρά Καΐτσης) and Makrirrachi (Μακρυρράχη), in the municipal unit of Xyniada.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
