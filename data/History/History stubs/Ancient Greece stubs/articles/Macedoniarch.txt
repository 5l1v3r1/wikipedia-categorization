Macedoniarch (Greek: μακεδονιάρχης)  was a Roman-era title for the president of the Koinon of Macedonians. The title was only given to 11 people. The Macedoniarch was the president of the Koinon of Macedonians,  and sometimes also the chief priest of Roman Macedonia.  The earliest record of a Macedoniarch to come from Thessalonike is from 219 AD.  The title was only held by 11 people, six of which are believed to be of Roman descent, based upon them having a cognomen.
