Kamilari is a village on the island of Crete, Greece, with 379 inhabitants. There is an archaeological site of an ancient Minoan cemetery nearby. The origin of the name 'Kamilari' is Byzantine. It is derived from the word 'kamilaris' meaning 'the one who rides a camel'. Kamilari is built on the top of three hills: The Minoan tholos tomb is on a low hill 1.9 kilometers southwest of Hagia Triada. East of the tomb were five rooms, probably added during Middle Minoan IIIA, and an area for offerings north of these rooms.  Here, 500 vases were found upside down.  Another 250 vases were found inside the tholos tomb. Three clay models were found in the Late Minoan IIIA burials.  One is of a group of dancers, another is two people standing in front of four seated people, and the third is of a banquet including the Minoan horns "of consecration" and doves.  These artefacts are on display at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum.  There are numerous villas and rooms to rent. There is a supermarket with a traditional butcher's shop. Fairs are held during the feast-days of the village on 27 July and 6 August.  Coordinates: 35°01′59″N 24°47′24″E﻿ / ﻿35.033°N 24.790°E﻿ / 35.033; 24.790
