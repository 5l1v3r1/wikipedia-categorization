The Kanianitis (Greek: Κανιανίτης) is a river in Phocis, central Greece. It receives its water from the mountains Oeta and Giona. It flows through the villages Kastellia, Gravia and Mariolata, and flows into the Cephissus near the village Lilea in the municipality of Parnassos. In antiquity, it was called Pindos or Pindus (Ancient Greek: Πίνδος).  The Pindus was a river of ancient Phocis and Doris. The cities Lilaea and Pindus were situated on the river.
