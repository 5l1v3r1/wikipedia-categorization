Myrkinos (Ancient Greek: Μύρκινος) or Myrcinus  was an ancient Greek city located in Macedonian Thrace, in the region of Edonis between the Strymon and the Nestos Rivers. It was within the territory of the Edonians, a Thracian tribe,  and was founded as a polis by colonists from Miletus in 497 BC.  The colonists were led by Histiaios  (already a Tyrant of Miletus), whom Darius had allowed to build a city in reward for his help. Myrkinos joined Brasidas after he captured Amphipolis, Oisyme and Galepsus in 422 BC.  During the Byzantine empire it was known as Doxompos (Δοξόμπος) or Doxompus (Δοξόμπους).
