Andron (Greek: ἀνδρών andrōn),  or andronitis (ἀνδρωνῖτις andrōnitis),  is part of a Greek house that is reserved for men, as distinguished from the gynaeceum (γυναικεῖον gynaikeion), the women's quarters.  The andron was used for entertaining male guests.  For this purpose the andron held several couches, usually an odd number to allow space for the door, tables which could be tucked under the couches, artwork and any other necessary paraphernalia. Not all classical Greek houses were large enough to have a dedicated andron, and even those that did might have used the room for mixed-gendered events and women receiving female guests, as well as men hosting symposia.   In excavations at Olynthus, rooms identified as andrones contained items identified with female activities, as in the rest of the house.
