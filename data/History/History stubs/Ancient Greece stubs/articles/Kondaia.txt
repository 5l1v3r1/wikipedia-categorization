Kondaia or Kondaea or Condaea (Ancient Greek: Κονδαία) was a city and polis (city-state) in the district of Pelasgiotis of ancient Thessaly.  It is mentioned by Herodotus like the birthplace of Cineas, king of Thessaly who sent a thousand horsemen in aid of the Peisistratids of Athens in the face of an attack by the Spartans, at the end of the sixth century BCE.  Its location is doubtful. A settlement near the current Falani and another near Bakrina, two places of Pelasgiotis have been suggested as possible sites of the city,  with the Bakrina location (39°47′55″N 22°23′48″E﻿ / ﻿39.798543°N 22.396606°E﻿ / 39.798543; 22.396606) the more likely candidate.
