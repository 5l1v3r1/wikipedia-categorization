Alope (Ancient Greek: Ἀλόπη, translit. Alópē) was a town of Opuntian Locris on the coast between Daphnus (modern Agios Konstantinos) and Cynus (modern Livanates). Its ruins have been discovered by William Gell on an insulated hill near the shore in the modern village of Melidoni (el).    Concerning the history of the city, it should be noted that the Locrians were defeated by the Athenians under Kleopompos in 431 BCE nearby,   and the city was taken.  It suffered greatly from the terrible earthquake of 426 BCE, according to Demetrius Callatianus quoted by Strabo.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
