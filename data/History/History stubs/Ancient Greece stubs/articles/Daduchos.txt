Daduchos or Daduchus, or Dadouchos (Ancient Greek: δᾳδοῦχος "torch-bearer", from δᾶις+ἔχω) is an epithet of Artemis, and notably of Demeter seeking her lost daughter (Persephone) with a torch. It was also the title of the second priest (ranking after the Hierophant) at the Eleusinian Mysteries, an office inherited in several families of Athens.
