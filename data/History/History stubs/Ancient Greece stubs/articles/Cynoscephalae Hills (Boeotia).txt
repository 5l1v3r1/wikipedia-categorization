Cynoscephalae (Ancient Greek: Κυνὸς κεφαλαί) was the name of a range of hills in ancient Boeotia between Thebes and Thespiae.  Near them, or on them, was a village of the same name, which is mentioned by the biographers of Pindar as the birthplace of the poet.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
