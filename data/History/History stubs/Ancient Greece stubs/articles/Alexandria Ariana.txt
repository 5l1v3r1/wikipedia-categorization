The third largest Afghan city, Herat, is the city's modern name.   In 330 BC, the Greek armies of Alexander moved the capital of the satrapy of Aria  from Artacoana to the new site.  In doing this, he expanded an existing Persian fortress. The location of this town is difficult to determine due to the sparsity of ancient sources. However: Alexandria in Ariana is listed on the Parthian Stations Itinerarium and is also shown on the Tabula Peutingeriana.
