It is mentioned by Herodotus in his account of the terrible storm which the fleet of Xerxes I experienced off this part of the coast.  It was from this town that the chesnut tree, which still abounds on the eastern side of Mt. Pelium, derived its name in Greek and the modern languages of Europe.   Its location is at the modern village of Keramidi.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed. (1854–1857). "Casthanaea".
