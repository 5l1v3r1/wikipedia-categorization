The Lindos Chronicle (or Lindian Chronicle) is an inscription from Lindos, Rhodes, dated to 99 BC. It records dedications made in the temple to Athena at Lindos prior to the destruction of the original temple in 392/1.  The chronicle is one of the longest surviving Hellenistic inscriptions.  It was excavated early in the 20th century by a Danish expedition, which found it used as paving block of the Byzantine church of Saint Stephen, near the theatre of Lindos. It contains decrees of Lindians, as well report on previous dedications of rulers and generals to Athena Lindia. The chronicle is inscribed on a marble slab, approximately eight-by-three feet, which is now broken into two pieces.   The catalogue of dedications contains about forty-five entries, though only thirty-seven are still legible. Additionally, the chronicle contains four miracle stories about Athena, of which only one is still totally legible, and two more are fragmentary.  The chronicle was first edited and published in 1912 by Christian Blinkenberg.  The first English translation to be published was by Carolyn Higbie in 2003.
