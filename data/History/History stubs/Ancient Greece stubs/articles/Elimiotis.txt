Elimiotis or Elimeia (Ancient Greek: Ἐλιμιώτις or Ἐλιμία or Ἐλίμεια) was a region of Upper Macedonia that was located along the Haliacmon river. It was bordered by Orestis and Eordaea in the north, Pieria in the east, Perrhaebia/Thessaly in the south and Parauaea in the west,  and was inhabited by the Greek tribe of Elimiotes (Ancient Greek: Ἐλιμιῶται). In earlier times, it was independent and the Derdas family ruled the local kingdom from its capital Aiane. However, later it lost its independence and by 355 BC, Elimiotis was part of the Kingdom of Macedon.
