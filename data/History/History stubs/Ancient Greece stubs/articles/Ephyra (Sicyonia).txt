Ephyra (Ancient Greek: Ἐφύρη) was a village of Sicyonia, in the north of the Peloponnese, mentioned by Strabo, along with the river Selleeis, as situated near Sicyon.  Ludwig Ross conjectures that some ruins situated upon a hill about 20 minutes southeast of Suli represent the Sicyonian Ephyra,  but modern writers say it is unlocated.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
