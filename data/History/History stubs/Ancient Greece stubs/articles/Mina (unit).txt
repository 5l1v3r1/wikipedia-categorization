The mina (also mĕnē, Aramaic; Hebrew: מנה‬)  is an ancient Near Eastern unit of weight, which was divided into 50 shekels. The mina, like the shekel, was also a unit of currency. In ancient Greece, it originally equalled 70 drachmae and later was increased to 100 drachmae.  The Greek word mna (μνᾶ) was borrowed from Semitic; compare Hebrew māneh, Aramaic mĕnē, Syriac manyā, Ugaritic mn, and Akkadian manū. However, before it was used as currency, a mina was a unit of measurement, equal to 1.25 pounds (0.57 kg). From earliest Sumerian times, a mina was a unit of weight. At first, talents and shekels had not yet been introduced. By the time of Ur-Nammu, the mina had a value of 1/60 talents as well as 60 shekels. The value of the mina is calculated at 1.25 pounds (0.57 kg)  .  Evidence from Ugarit indicates that a mina was equivalent to fifty shekels.  The prophet Ezekiel refers to a mina ('maneh' in the King James Version) as sixty shekels, in the Book of Ezekiel.  Jesus of Nazareth tells the "parable of the minas" in Luke 19:11-27. From the Akkadian period, 2 mina was equal to 1 sila of water (cf. clepsydra, water clock). Mina of Athens. Mina of Chios. Mina of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Mina of Antioch.
