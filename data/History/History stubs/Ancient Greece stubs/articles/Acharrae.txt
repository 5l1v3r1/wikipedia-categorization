Livy relates that the retreat of Philip V of Macedon after the Battle of the Aous (198 BC) allowed the Aetolians to occupy much of Thessaly, and these latter gained Acharrae by surrender, whereas nearby Theuma and Celathara were plundered.  Acharrae minted bronze coins at least from the fourth century BC with the inscription «ΕΚΚΑΡΡΕΩΝ».   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
