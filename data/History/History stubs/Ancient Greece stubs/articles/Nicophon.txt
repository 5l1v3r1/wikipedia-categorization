NICOPHON (Greek: Νικοφῶν, also Nicophron, Greek: Νικοφρῶν ), the son of a certain Theron, was an Athenian comic poet, a contemporary of  Aristophanes in his later years. Athenaeus  states that he belonged to Old Comedy, but it is more likely that he belonged to Middle Comedy. We learn from the argument of the Plutus of Aristophanes that he exhibited one of his plays, called Ἄδωνις Adonis, in 388 BC, the date Aristophanes exhibited his Plutus. 27 lines of his plays have survived.
