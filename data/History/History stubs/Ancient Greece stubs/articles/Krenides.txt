Krenides (Ancient Greek: Κρενίδες) was an ancient Greek  city located in Thrace, located in the region between the river Strymon and the river Nestos.It was founded by colonists from Thasos at 360BC. Krenides was close to Mount Pangaion with its rich gold veins and to another Thasian colony, Datos.The two colonies provoked the Thracians but at the same time gave Phillip II of Macedon the justification for penetrating the area and founding Philippi in 356 BC.Phillip  intervened to protect the city when it was threatened by Thracians under Kersobleptes.
