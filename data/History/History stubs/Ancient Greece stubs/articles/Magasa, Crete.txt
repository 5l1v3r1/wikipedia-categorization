Magasa (Greek: Μαγκασά) is a Neolithic settlement on the eastern part of the island of Crete  in present-day Greece. Magasa is notable as a Neolithic Cretan settlement for some use of large room sizes in its multi-roomed residences.   The ben-and-but style of housing design with some use of mud-dried brick has been noted as similar to that found in Neolithic Knossos.
