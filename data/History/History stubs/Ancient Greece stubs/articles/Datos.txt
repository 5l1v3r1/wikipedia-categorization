Datos (Ancient Greek: Δάτος) was an ancient Greek city  located in Thrace, located in the region between the river Strymon and the river Nestos.It was founded by colonists from Thasos at 360 BC.Datos was founded with the help and support of the Athenian exiled orator, Callistratus of Aphidnae.  Datos was close to Mount Pangaion with its rich gold veins and to another Thasian colony, Krenides.The two colonies provoked the Thracians but at the same time gave Phillip II of Macedon the justification for penetrating the area and founding Philippi in 356 BC.
