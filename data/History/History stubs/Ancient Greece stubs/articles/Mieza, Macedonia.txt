Mieza (Greek: Μίεζα), "shrine of the Nymphs", was a village in Ancient Macedon, where Aristotle taught the boy Alexander the Great between 343 BC and 340 BC.  The site where Mieza once stood is the modern Lefkadia, near the modern town Náousa, Imathia, Central Macedonia, Greece, and has been the subject of archeological excavations since 1954.  Mieza was named for Mieza, in ancient Macedonian mythology, the daughter of Beres and sister of Olganos and Beroia. It was the home of Alexander's companion Peucestas. Aristotle was hired by Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon, to teach his son, and was given the Temple of the Nymphs as a classroom. In return, Philip re-built and freed the citizens of Stagira, Aristotle's hometown, which he had razed in a previous conquest across Greece and Macedon.  Students educated at Mieza include Hephaestion, Ptolemy I Soter, Cassander, and Cleitus the Black.
