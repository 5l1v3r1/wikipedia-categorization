Metropolis (Ancient Greek: Μητρόπολις) was an ancient town in the southern part of Phrygia, belonging to the conventus of Apamea.  That this town is different from the more northerly town of the name in northern Phrygia, is quite evident, even independently of the fact that Stephanus of Byzantium mentions two towns of the name of Metropolis in Phrygia, and that Hierocles.  and the Notitiae speak of a town of this name in two different provinces of Phrygia.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
