In Procopius the name occurs in the corrupt form of Lossonus.  Several Greek inscriptions have been found concerning the city of Oloosson. In a votive inscription from the first half of the fourth century BCE that is dedicated to Apollo Pythius are also the names of some people together with various demonyms from Perrhaebia.  In another inscription dated in the 1st century BCE, election procedures of magistrates are mentioned.  Ancient Oloosson was located at a site called Panayia in the modern town of Elassona.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed. (1854–1857).
