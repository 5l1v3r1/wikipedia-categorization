The Massaliote Periplus or Massiliote Periplus is a theoretical reconstruction of a sixth century BC periplus, or sailing manual, proposed by Adolf Schulten.    Schulten believed a Massiliote Periplus had been versified in the lines of the Ora Maritima by Avienus. Schulten dated it to the 6th century BC. It describes a voyage from Oestrymnis, modern Pointe du Raz, to Massalia, modern Marseille.  Its existence has been denied by other scholars.
