The Decree of Aristoteles was a decree passed by the Athenian Assembly in February or March 377 BC.  The decree is preserved as the inscription on a stele; this is the most important epigraphical source for the Second Athenian Confederacy.  The decree, often known as the "Charter of the Second Athenian Confederacy", formalised earlier Athenian diplomacy inviting states to join Athens and her allies in a permanent alliance.  The inscription of the decree was first published in 1852,  and it has received much attention from scholars since then.
