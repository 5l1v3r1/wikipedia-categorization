Acharnae (/əˈkɑːr.niː/; Ancient Greek: Ἀχαρναί) was a deme of ancient Attica. It was part of the phyle Oineis.  Acharnae was according to Thucydides, the largest deme in Attica.  In the fourth century, 22 of the 500 members of the Athenian council came from Acharnae, more than from any other deme.  Acharnae was located in the west-northwest part of the Attic plain, south of Mt. Parnes in the general vicinity of the modern suburbs of Acharnes and Ano Liosia,  about 10 km (6 mi) due west of Athens.  The Acharnians chiefly grew cereals, grapes, and olives. Acharnae was the centre of the Athenian charcoal-burning industry, and the chorus of Aristophanes' comedy The Acharnians is made up of charcoal-burners.  Pindar characterizes them as notably brave. A tholos tomb at Menidi suggests Acharnae was once an independent entity; a temple to Ares was later moved to the Athenian Agora. Coordinates: 38°05′N 23°44′E﻿ / ﻿38.083°N 23.733°E﻿ / 38.083; 23.733
