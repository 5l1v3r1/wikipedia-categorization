The town is mentioned by Ptolemy. Thucydides calls the surrounding district Elaeatis (Ἐλαιατις) and indicates that Ephyra was in the territory of Elaea.  Its port was Elaias Limen, literally the "Bay of Elaea", which the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax asserts was the main port of Thesprotia.  Coins ascribed to the town, with the inscription "ΕΛΕΑΤΑΝ" or "ΕΛΕΑΙ", have been found that have been dated c. 360-335 BCE.   The town's site is identified as near Khrysavgi,   where archaeological exploration has taken place.
