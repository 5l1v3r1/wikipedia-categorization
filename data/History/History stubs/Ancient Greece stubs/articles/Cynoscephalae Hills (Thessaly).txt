Coordinates: 39°25′N 22°34′E﻿ / ﻿39.417°N 22.567°E﻿ / 39.417; 22.567 Cynoscephalae (Ancient Greek: Κυνὸς κεφαλαί, meaning "dog's head") was the name of a range of hills in ancient Thessaly, a little to the south of Scotussa, in whose territory they were situated. They are described by Polybius as rugged, broken, and of considerable height;  and are memorable as the scene of two battles: Battle of Cynoscephalae (364 BC), between the Thebans and Alexander of Pherae, in which Pelopidas was slain; and Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC), of still greater celebrity, in which the Philip V of Macedon was defeated by the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus.       This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
