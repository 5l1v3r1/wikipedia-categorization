Galepsus or Galepsos (Greek: Γαληψός) was an ancient Greek city located in the region of Edonis in Thrace and later in Macedon.  It was located east of Phagres and about 17 km from Amphipolis.  It belonged to the Delian League and it was founded as a colony of Thasos.  After the conquest of Amphipolis it was occupied by Brasidas in 424 BC, but recovered by Cleon in 423. Perseus of Macedon, fleeing the Romans who had defeated him at Pydna, sailed the mouth of the Strymon, and towards Galepsus, staying there before moving on to Samothrace.
