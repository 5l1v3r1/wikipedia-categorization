Gonoessa (Greek: Γονόεσσα) was a city in ancient Achaea, Greece. The location of the city has not been found, but it is assumed to lie in the northwesternmost part of present Corinthia. Gonoessa was mentioned by Homer in his Iliad.   It was a settlement of the city-state of Pellene with a port from which a fleet under the command of Agamemnon departed during the Trojan War. Homer said that the combined fleet with Pellene and Hyperesia totaled 100 ships. It has been suggested that the town was founded by the Pelasgians, the proto-Greek that arrived from Asia Minor and settled the whole Achaea.
