Melpeia (Ancient Greek: Μέλπεια) was a village in ancient Arcadia, situated on the mountain Nomia, which is a part of the mountain Lykaion.  There was a sanctuary of the Nomian Pan, who is said to have discovered the pan flute here. According to the Arcadians, the name "Melpeia" was derived from the nymph Melpeia. It was situated near Lycosura.  The exact location of the settlement has never been found. The present villages Kato Melpeia and Ano Melpeia in northern Messenia were named after Melpeia.
