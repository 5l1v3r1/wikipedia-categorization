Strabo says that it received a Spartan colony, headed by Praxander.  He adds, that it was situated opposite to the town of Nagidus, in Cilicia, and possessed a harbour and docks.  It was situated in the north of the island, on a river of the same name, with a district called Lapethia (Λαπηθία).   In the war between Ptolemy I Soter and Antigonus I Monophthalmus, Lapathus, with its king Praxippus, sided with the latter.  The name of this place was synonymous with stupidity.   The site of ancient Lapathus has been located near the village of Lampousa in the town of Karavas.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
