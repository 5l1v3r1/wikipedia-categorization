To its south lay Mount Oeta. To distinguish it from the city of the same name in Phocis (now Boeotia), the Thessalian Antikyra was often distinguished as Malian Antikyra.  Both were famed for their black and white hellebore, a prized herb in ancient Greek medicine.  The editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World tentatively identify the site of Anticyra at the modern village of Kostalexis (Κωσταλέξης) in the municipality of Lamia.
