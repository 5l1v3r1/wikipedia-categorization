Chalcis is one of the five Aetolian towns spoken of by Homer, who gives it the epithet of ἀγχίαλος (anchialos, "near the coast"), in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad.  It continued to be mentioned in the historical period, by Thucydides,  Polybius,  and Strabo.  Its site is identified as near the modern Kato Vasiliki.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed. (1854–1857). "Chalcis".
