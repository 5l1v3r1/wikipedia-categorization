A citharode  (Greek: κιθαρῳδός; Latin: citharoedus) or citharist,  was a classical Greek professional performer (singer) of the cithara (or sometimes lyre), as one who used the cithara to accompany their singing. Famous citharodes included Terpander and Arion. (The spellings "citharede" and "citharoede" are also sometimes used.) "Citharode" or "Citharede" was also an epithet of Apollo (Apollo Citharede), and the term is used to refer to statues which portray Apollo with his lyre.
