It is mentioned by Hesiod as the "vine-bearing Amyrus."  The surrounding country is called the Amyric plain (τὸ Ἀμυρικὸν πέδιον) by Polybius.  Modern scholas identify the location of Amyrus at a place called Palaiokastro (old fort) at the modern village of Gerakari.    This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
