The Sultanate of Muscat was a maritime empire during the 18th Century, which in 1820 unified with the Imamate of Oman to form the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.  In 1743, Nader Shah took Muscat.  When Nader Shah was assassinated in 1747 his empire disintegrated, and so the Sultanate of Oman regained independence from the Afsharid dynasty.
