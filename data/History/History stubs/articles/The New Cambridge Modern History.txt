The New Cambridge Modern History replaced the original Cambridge Modern History in an entirely new project with all new editors and contributors. It was published by Cambridge University Press in fourteen volumes between the 1950s and the 1970s.  It introduced a wide range of new scholarship on traditional themes as well as included more coverage of science, technology, political ideas, the arts, intellectual history, and the art of warfare.  The Shifting Balance of World Forces 1898â€“1945 brought the chronology down to 1945.  The chair of the editorial board was Sir George Norman Clark.  The New Cambridge Modern History has been described as "a comprehensive examination of the political, economic, social, and cultural development of the world from 1493 to 1945".  The final volume is a new Historical atlas. Some volumes have appeared in revised editions. George Richard Potter  & Denys Hay, eds. Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, ed. R. B. Wernham, ed. J. P. Cooper, ed.
