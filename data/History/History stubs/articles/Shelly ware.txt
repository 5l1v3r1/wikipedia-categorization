Shelly ware is a type of pottery made with shell powder used as a temper. The Mississippian culture pottery used shell-tempering agents in the clay paste. Shelly-sandy ware, found in the UK, used both sand and ground-up shell as temper. Medieval shelly-sandy ware has a date range 11th to 15th century. The fabric is always dark grey with brown oxidised surfaces.
