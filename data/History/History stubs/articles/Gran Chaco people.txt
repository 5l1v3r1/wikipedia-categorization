The indigenous Gran Chaco people consist of approximately thirty-five tribal groups in the Gran Chaco of South America.  Because, like the Great Plains of North America, the terrain lent itself to a nomadic lifestyle, there is little to no archaeological evidence of their prehistoric occupation.  Contributing to this near-absence of archaeological data is the lack of suitable raw material for stone tools or permanent construction and soil conditions that are not conducive to the preservation of organic material.   The actual cultural area of the Gran Chaco peoples differs from that of the geographic Gran Chaco.
