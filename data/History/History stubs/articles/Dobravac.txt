Dobravac (Serbian Cyrillic: Добравац; fl. 1280) or Dobravec (Добравец) was a Serbian nobleman serving in the crown land of Hum, with the title of tepčija. He is mentioned in a document dated 1280 as serving the countess of Hum (Moysa serviens Dobraveçi tepçi domine comitisse de Chelmo).  He had a clerk or assistant, Mojše, who sold two of his bondmaids in Ragusa (Dubrovnik) that year.  Although Dobravac's jurisdiction is unknown from the quotation, he was not a veliki tepčija (serving the king directly); his office was limited to the Hum land, but his type of work was the same as that of the veliki tepčija.  The tepčija had executive authorities; his otroci (sing. otrok), were servants, lesser in rank but not slaves.  The name is an old Serbian name,  found in medieval epigraphy.
