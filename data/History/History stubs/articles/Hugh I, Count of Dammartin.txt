Hugh I (d. after 1093), Count of Dammartin and Seigneur de Bulles, son of Manasses, Count of Dammartin, and Constance of France.  Hugh’s maternal grandfather was Robert the Pious, King of France, and his paternal great-grandfather was Hilduin I, Count of Montdidier. Hugh married Rohese, sister of Ascelin, Seigneur de Bulles, and they had four children: Lancelin, though never Count of Dammartin, was known as Lord of Dammartin and joined other petty barons in alliance with Hugh of Crecy and Theobald II, Count of Champagne, against Louis VI the Fat and, later, Louis VII of France. Hugh was succeeded as Count of Dammartin by his son Pierre. Mathieu, J.
