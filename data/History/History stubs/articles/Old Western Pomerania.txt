Old Western Pomerania  (German: Altvorpommern or Alt-Vorpommern) was that part of Western Pomerania that went to Prussia under the terms of the Treaty of Stockholm in 1720.  The name Old Western Pomerania was first used when that area of Swedish Pomerania that had been remained with Sweden after the Treaty of Stockholm, later transferred to Prussia under the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and was named New Western Pomerania.  Whilst New Western Pomerania enjoyed a  special legal status within the Prussian state after 1815, this was not the case for Old  Western Pomerania or Eastern Pomerania. Nevertheless, the Pomeranian Provincial Parliament, also formed in 1823, was elected separately by New Western Pomerania, Old Western Pomerania and Eastern Pomerania (Hinterpommern).  Whilst New Western Pomerania was given its own Regional Parliament (for New Western Pomerania and RÃ¼gen) in 1823, a joint Regional Parliament for Old Western Pomerania and Eastern Pomerania was formed.  Both regional parliaments continued to exist until 1881.  With the gradual loss of New Western Pomerania's special status, the names New and Old Western Pomerania also fell out of use.
