Englishman John Stringfellow produced a number of aircraft designs. The aerial steam carriage was designed by Stringfellow and William Samuel Henson in 1848, and is often considered to be the first practical design for a powered and manned flying machine, although only a model was ever flown. The machine had a basic design that was much closer to later commercial construction than many later experimental types. Stringfellow exhibited a steam-powered model triplane at the Aeronautical Society Exhibition, Crystal Palace, London, in 1868.
