  The Pencersaete or Pencersæte (Old English: /Pe:nt͡ʃersæte/) (dwellers of the Penk valley) were a tribe or clan in Anglo-Saxon England living in the valley of the River Penk in the West Midlands of England and remaining around Penkridge throughout the existence of the Kingdom of Mercia.  They took their name from a hill near Penkridge, Brythonic penno - head and cruc - mound or hill.  An Anglo-Saxon charter of 849 describes an area of Cofton Hackett in the Lickey Hills south of Birmingham as "the boundary of the Tomsæte and the Pencersæte",.
