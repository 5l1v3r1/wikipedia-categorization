Pitassa is an as-yet undiscovered frontier city in western Anatolia, mentioned in Bronze Age archives at Hattusa. Its name seems Luwian, and it occasionally formed the border between Hatti and various iterations of Arzawa. Madduwatta wrested Pitassa from Arnuwanda I in the late 15th century BC. Decades later Suppiluliuma I retook it. Mashuiluwa of Mira then incited it to revolt c. 1310 BC, after which Mursili II moved upon it and resubjigated it. This may be the city of Abydos on the Hellespont.
