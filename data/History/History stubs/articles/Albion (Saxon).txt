Albion (or Abbion shortend to Abbio or Abbi) was a Germanic leader of the Saxons in the times of Charlemagne. (exact dates remain unknown) Together with Widukind he opposed the aggressive east expansion of the Carolingian Empire. 785 after being defeated in the Saxon wars he was baptized together with Widukind, possibly in Attigny, with Charlemagne as his godfather.   He was possibly married to Giesela (or Hasela), a daughter or sister to Widukind, and therefore closely related to him.   Albion was said to be the fabulous ancestor of the House of Ascania.
