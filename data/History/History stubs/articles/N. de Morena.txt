N. de Morena or N. de Morera, name given to him by his contemporary Fray Juan de Torquemada  and by most authors,     was a European ship pilot who reportedly was left at New Albion by Sir Francis Drake in 1579 and then walked to Mexico.  In doing so, he likely was the first European to see San Francisco Bay and likely established the incorrect idea that California was an island.   In only few and non-contemporaneous references, the name is given as "N. de Morena."
