Many other monks have also got salvation; especially on the holy mountains of Girnar and Shatrunjaya. The Jain councils were held in Vallabhi c. 5th century CE.  Their canonical scriptures were written down during this council. King Vanaraja Chavda (c. 720-780 CE) of the Chavda dynasty was brought up by a Jain monk named Shilaguna Suri.
