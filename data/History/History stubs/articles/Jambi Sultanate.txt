The Sultanate of Jambi was a region ruled by a sultan in northern Sumatra. The Dutch conquered the sultanate and killed the sultan in 1904. The sultanate has since been restored in recent years.[when?] The original sultanate was centered in the modern-day province of Jambi in Indonesia. In 1682 it was disputed as a vassal state between the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) and the Kingdom of Siam.  In the late 19th century the sultanate was slowly annexed by the Dutch, with the sultan degraded to a puppet ruler. By 1907 the last vestiges of indigenous rule had been abolished.
