Christian History is a magazine on the history of Christianity. It was established by Ken Curtis in 1982 and published by the Christian History Institute. It began as a series of resource guides designed to supplement films about major figures in the history of the church, transitioning from an "occasional" publication to a quarterly magazine in 1984.  In 1989, it was sold to Christianity Today International, which changed the name of the magazine to Christian History & Biography in 2004. In 2008 publication ceased after issue 99. Christian History Institute reclaimed custody of the title and revived the publication in 2011 with an issue on the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible.  The magazine is published in electronic and print formats on a donation basis.  The magazine covers diverse topics from the entire history of the Christian church, including Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox.  Each issue covers one specific event, person or topic of the history of Christianity.  Recent topics include the spread of early Christianity through major cities, the persecution of the church through the ages, and people like Charlemagne and Martin Luther, and the history of specific Protestant denominations such as the Methodists and Baptists. In 2017 the magazine completed a four-issue series on the history of Reformation in honor of the 500th anniversary of Luther's 95 Theses.
