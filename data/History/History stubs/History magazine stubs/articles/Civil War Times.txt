Civil War Times (formerly Civil War Times Illustrated) is a history magazine published bi-monthly which covers the American Civil War. It was established in 1962 by Robert Fowler due to centennial anniversary interest in the Civil War in the United States. It focuses on both battlefield strategy and tactics and the social and economic conditions of the time, as well as the aftermath of the Civil War on the present.  Civil War Times, along with its sister publication America's Civil War, is published in Leesburg, Virginia, by the Weider History Group.     Civil War Times has a number of recurring departments, including: Fowler first introduced the publication at a Civil War re-enactment being staged near the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Many of the re-enactors wanted to take a copy with them, but declined--they did not want to have anything in their possession that wasn't authentic to the period of the war itself. That passion and commitment re-enforced Fowler's belief in his enterprise and helped set the stage for its long-running success.
