Military History Monthly is a monthly military history magazine, published by Current Publishing. The magazine was established in October 2010 as Military Times and obtained its current title in November 2011.  The first issue of Military History Monthly was published in October 2010 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.  The magazine is edited by Neil Faulkner. It covers all aspects of military history, from battles of the ancient world, up to more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In celebration of its 50th issue in November 2014, and to commemorate the centenary of World War I, Military History Monthly and the Royal United Services Institute brought together four military history experts for "The Great War Debate". The speakers included politician and author Patrick Mercer.
