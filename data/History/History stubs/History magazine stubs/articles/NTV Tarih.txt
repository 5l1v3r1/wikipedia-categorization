NTV Tarih (English: NTV History) was a weekly Turkish history magazine owned by Doğuş Media Group. It was established in February 2009.  It was closed down in mid-2013 by its owners in response to the magazine's coverage of the 2013 protests in Turkey, with Doğuş refusing to distribute the final edition. The magazine's staff published the edition online and sought to continue the magazine independently.
