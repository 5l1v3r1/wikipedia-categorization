Preservation, the magazine of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, launched in 1952 as Historic Preservation.  In 1998, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for General Excellence under its then-editor, Robert S. Wilson.  The magazine's launching point is architecture, but it is also, as the judges of the National Magazine Award write, about "politics, art, history, places, and people â€¦ Preservation tells the stories of extraordinary buildings and sites all over the world."  The headquarters of the magazine is in Washington DC.
