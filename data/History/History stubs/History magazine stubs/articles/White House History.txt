White House History is a quarterly periodical published by the White House Historical Association, a private, non-profit organization whose mission is to enhance the public's understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of the White House. The White House is the official home and principal workplace of the President of the United States. White House History features articles on the White House, typically relating to the house's use and life on the premises. White House History is not a political forum, although at times political history is within its subject matter. White House History serves a varied readership including historians, and professionals and lay people in the areas of American political and cultural history, architecture, fine and decorative arts, and landscape design. First published in 1983, White House History was issued twice each year from in 1997 until 2015 when it became a quarterly publication. The first 30 issues are available in bound collection sets.  More recent issues are available individually. Topics have included such themes as inaugurations, architecture and renovations, White House kitchens, presidential retreats, presidential portraiture, White House grounds and gardens, transportation and travel, fashion, presidential kin, the White House neighborhood, and the White House and the movies. Several issues focus on a particular presidential administration. They include the John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Martin Van Buren, James Polk, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower, and John Kennedy administrations. Topics of future issues planned include the Presidential Libraries, White House flora and fauna, first ladies, the French influence on the White House, public and ceremonial visits to the White House, death in the White House, the Secret Service, social secretaries, the presidents and sports, and presidential cartoons. White House History is sold by subscription;  single copies as well as bound collection sets of back issues are also available.
