Dig was a children's archaeology magazine, published by Cricket Media  and associated with the Archaeological Institute of America. The magazine targeted children aged nine to fourteen.   Dig was founded in 1999.  It had its headquarters in Peterborough, New Hampshire.  In 2001 the magazine was acquired by Cobblestone Publishing.  The magazine was published several times per year.  Each issue is 48 pages, and most of the issues were theme-based, on archaeological finds from various countries. It illustrated what archaeologists have found, and also explored the cultural, scientific, and architectural accomplishments of the societies that left these artifacts. Themes included "Who Were the First Americans?" in April 2007, and "Australia: Land of the Unknown" (April 2006), and "Machu Piccu" (Nov. 2005).  In other issues, the theme might be a broad cultural constant between several ancient civilizations.  Examples of this included "For the Love of Money" in March 2007, "Disaster" in Feb. 2007, and "High Fashion" in May 2006.    Most issues also included puzzles and hands-on projects. Dig ceased publication in 2014 and was replaced by Dig into History, which combined both Dig and Calliope magazines.
