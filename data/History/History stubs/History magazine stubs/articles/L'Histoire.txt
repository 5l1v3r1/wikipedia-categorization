 L'Histoire is a monthly mainstream French magazine dedicated to historical studies, recognized by peers as the most important historical popular magazine (as opposed to specific university journals or less scientific popular historical magazines). L'Histoire was founded by Michel Winock. Jean-NoÃ«l Jeanneney, president of the National Library of France since 2002, and Jean-Michel Gaillard are part of the editorial board. Many historians who write for L'Histoire also teach at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, better known as Sciences Po.
