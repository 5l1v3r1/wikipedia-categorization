 The Appendix is an online magazine of "narrative and experimental history." It was co-founded in fall of 2012 by Benjamin Breen, Felipe Cruz, Christopher Heaney, and Brian Jones. A stated goal of the journal is that "scholarly and popular history need to come together."  The journal features articles from historians, anthropologists, artists, journalists, and other writers. The journal has been praised by Lapham's Quarterly,  The Public Domain Review,  Dan Cohen (academic),  the blog of the American Historical Association,  and novelist Midori Snyder, who called it "a terrific highly interstitial journal, that combines in a unique fashion history and narrative."  Material from The Appendix has been featured on the websites of The Atlantic,  Slate,  Jezebel,  and the Smithsonian Magazine.
