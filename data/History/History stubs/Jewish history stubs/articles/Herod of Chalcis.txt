Herod of Chalcis (d. 48-49 AD), also known as Herod V, listed by the Jewish Encyclopedia as Herod II,  was a son of Aristobulus IV, and the grandson of Herod the Great, Roman client king of Chalcis. He was the brother of Herod Agrippa I and Herodias. His first wife was his cousin, Mariamne.  She bore him a son named Aristobulus, who also eventually became ruler of Chalcis. After Mariamne's death, he married his niece Berenice, with whom he had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus.  Around 41 AD, at the request of his brother, Herod Agrippa, emperor Claudius granted him the rule of Chalcis, a territory north of Judaea, with the title of king.  Three years later, after the death of his brother, he was also given responsibility for the Temple in Jerusalem, as well as the appointment of the Temple's High Priest. During the four years in which he exercised this right he appointed two high priestsâ€”Joseph, son of Camydus (44-46), and Ananias, son of Nedebeus (ca. 47-52).  He died in 48 AD. After his death the kingdom was given to Herod Agrippa II.
