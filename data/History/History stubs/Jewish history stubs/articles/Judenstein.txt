Judenstein (Meaning "Jew stone") is a district of the village Rinn, Austria. In 1671, the blood libel cult of Anderl von Rinn emerged, and a church was built around a rock where the child allegedly had been murdered. There is a large stone within the nave of the church which has probably been brought in from elsewhere as there are no other large freestanding stones in the immediate neighbourhood. The church is lavishly decorated with paintings and mouldings in Rococo style that is said to have been carried out in 1730/40. The same style of elaborate decoration can be seen in a number of churches in the area, for example nearby Rinn which is even more elaborate and notably in Innsbruck.
