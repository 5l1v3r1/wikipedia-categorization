The Lwów pogrom (Polish: pogrom lwowski, German: Lemberg pogrom) was a pogrom of the Jewish population of the city of Lwów (since 1945, Lviv, Ukraine) that took place on  September 27, 1914 during the World War I. Following a reported robbery, or shots, involving Russian military in the Lviv's Jewish neighbourhood, Russian Cossacks assaulted nearby Jewish civilians, resulting in about 40 civilian casualties and a number of injuries. In the aftermath, no Cossacks were persecuted, but several Jews were arrested, through released shortly afterward.
