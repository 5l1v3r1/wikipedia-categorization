The Battle of Ma'aleh Levona was the first hand-to-hand combat battle fought between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Empire in 167 BCE. The Jewish forces were led by Judah Maccabee and the Seleucid army force was under the command of Apollonius.  After the Maccabean Revolt started, Judah relocated his guerrilla combat units at the northern part of Samaria. Apollonius, governor of Samaria, was sent with the local Samarian armies to link up with Seleucid forces from Jerusalem. Maccabaee gained the element of surprise by ambushing the enemy army at Wadi Haramia and successfully destroyed the much larger Syrian Greek army, personally killing its commander.    Another force was soon sent against Maccabaee, which led to the Battle of Beth Horon.  Coordinates: 32°03′16″N 35°14′27″E﻿ / ﻿32.05444°N 35.24083°E﻿ / 32.05444; 35.24083
