The Jewish presence in Taiwan began in the mid-20th century and was never numerous. The first sizable presence began in the 1950s, when religious services were held in the United States military chapel, to which civilians also had access. In 1975, Rabbi Ephraim Ferdinand Einhorn (Hebrew: אפרים פרדיננד איינהורן‎; Chinese: 艾恩宏; pinyin: Ài Ēnhóng) arrived to serve as the island's sole rabbi.  Since then, the Taiwanese Jewish community has been largely made up of foreign business executives and their families, with services also frequently attended by visitors to the island. For many years Rabbi Einhorn officiated at Sabbath and holiday services at the Landis Hotel and later the Sheraton Taipei. In 2015 the venue for the services moved to space in an office building provided by one of the community members. Attendance peaks around the High Holy Days, numbering between 60 and 100.    Because the state of Israel has full diplomatic relations with mainland China, it cannot fully recognize the government of Taiwan, which China considers separatist. Nevertheless, Israel maintains the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO). In 2006, there was $1.3 billion worth of bilateral trade between Israel and Taiwan. In 2002 a Holocaust Museum was opened in Bao'an, Rende Township, Tainan County (now part of Tainan City).  It was founded by Chou Chou An (Chinese: 卓枝安; Pinyin: Zhuó Zhī'ān), a Taiwanese priest who follows Messianic Judaism, considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity. Chou Chou An received his religious education in Japan. The Kyoto Holocaust Museum has donated several artefacts to the Holocaust Museum in Tainan. In the summer of 2011, upon the coming of the new Chabad emissaries, Rabbi Shlomi and Racheli Tabib, the Chabad Taiwan, also known as the Taipei Jewish Center, was founded.  According to recent statistics, there are about 300 Jewish residents in Taiwan. 90–95% of them reside in Taipei.
