Berenice was the daughter of Salome I, the sister of Herod the Great. She married her cousin Aristobulus  who was executed by his father in 6 BC; she was accused of complicity in his murder. By Aristobulus she was the mother of Herod Agrippa I, Herod of Chalcis, Herodias, Mariamne III and Aristobulus Minor. Her second husband, Theudion (brother of Herod I's first wife Doris, and thus uncle of Antipater), was put to death for conspiring against Herod. Subsequently she went to Rome and enjoyed the favor of the imperial household.
