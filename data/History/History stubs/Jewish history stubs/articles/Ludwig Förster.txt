Ludwig Christian Friedrich (von) Förster (October 8, 1797 in Ansbach – June 16, 1863 in Bad Gleichenberg, Styria) was a German-born Austrian architect. Ludwig Förster studied in Munich and Vienna. He founded the Allgemeine Bauzeitung in 1836. From 1842 to 1845 he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. From 1839/40 he worked as a freelance architect, Otto Wagner, among others, was a member of his studio. 1846–52 Förster worked with his son-in-law Theophil Freiherr von Hansen. He contributed to the Ringstraße. Berlin-educated Ignaz Wechselmann became his friend and assistant and superintended the construction of the Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest, which along with the Leopoldstädter Tempel and the Synagogue of Miskolc is Förster's most important work. 1861–63 he was a member of the Viennese city council (Gemeinderat). Förster's sons, Heinrich and Emil, were also architects.
