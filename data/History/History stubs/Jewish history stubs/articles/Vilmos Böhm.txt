As Secretary of State,  he invited the war hero Aurél Stromfeld to the military chief of staff. He actively participated in the unification congress of the Social Democrat Party and the Communist party.  In April Böhm became the commander-in-chief of the Red Army. In May 1919 he resigned, but his resignation was not accepted by government. Böhm remained a member. In July 1919,  he was appointed to a position of Viennese ambassador. He is supposedly mentioned in the Venona telegrams as an information source of the soviets during the war.  After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet republic, he was forced to emigrate and became the leader of a group of emigrant social democrats ("Light Group"), together with Zsigmond Kunfi and Sándor Garbai.

Stripped from Hungarian citizenship on June 3, 1949, he died on October 28, 1949. According to one researcher, Wilhelm Agrell, he was a soviet spy, a statement which has been contested in a trial, after Agrell was sued by Böhm's grandchildren Thomas and Stefan Böhm for defamation of the deceased. According to Sweden's liberal laws Agrell was acquitted, although he could not produce any other evidence than the mentioning of Vilmos Böhm in the Venona telegrams, where many state leaders and politicians were mentioned under aliases.
