Kobersdorf (Hungarian: Kabold, Croatian: Kobrštof) is an Austrian market town in Oberpullendorf, Burgenland. Kobersdorf is located in Middle Burgenland and is divided into the districts of Kobersdorf, Lindgraben, and Oberpetersdorf. The municipality lies at the foot of the Pauliberg, the last extinct volcano in Austria in the middle of the Naturpark Landseer Berge. Like the rest of Burgenland, Kobersdorf belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary until 1920-21. After the end of the First World War, the western border area of Hungary was awarded to Austria by the Treaties of St. Germain and Trianon. Since 1921, the town has belonged to the newly founded State of Burgenland. Kobersdorf was one of the Jewish Siebengemeinden of Burgenland. Its synagogue, built in 1860, is the only one in the seven communities that still stands. Since its restoration, it has been used for memorial services. Kobersdorf has been a market town since 1973 (through a recently reissued VO 5). Kobersdorf's mayor is Klaus Schütz of the SPÖ. Vice-Mayor Johann Binder is a member of the ÖVP. The Chief Officer is Hans Helmut Tremmel. The mandate assignments in the Municipal Council (21 seats) are SPÖ 11, ÖVP 7, FPÖ 0, Grüne 0, and other lists 3. Kobersdorf Palace (German: Schloss Kobersdorf Schloss Kobersdorf) is famous for the plays that take place there every July. Since 2004, they have been led by Wolfgang Böck, and before that the director was Rudolf Buczolich. In the 2006 season, the production was The Threepenny Opera.
