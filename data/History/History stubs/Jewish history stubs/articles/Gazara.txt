Gazara was, according to the Bible, a fortress of great strength in Judea that figures often in the Maccabean wars. To this place  Judas pursued Gorgias (1 Maccabees 4:15).  It was fortified by the Greek general Bacchides (1 Maccabees 9:52; Ant, XIII, i, 3).  It was captured by Simon Maccabeus, who turned out the inhabitants and purified the city. He built here a palace for himself, and appointed his son, John, commander of his army (1 Maccabees 13:43).  A different account of this occurrence is given in 2 Maccabees 10:32, where the capture is attributed to Judas. The fortress is identical with Tel Jezer, the ancient Gezer.  Recent excavations have uncovered the ruins of Simon's palace.
