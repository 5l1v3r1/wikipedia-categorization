The history of the Jews in Innsbruck, Austria, includes a number of communities such as the Israelite Community of Tyrol and Vorarlberg (German: Israelitische Kultusgemeinde f√ºr Tirol und Vorarlberg) that are located in Innsbruck.  The original centre of the Israelite Community was in Hohenems, although since the 13th century Jewish people lived also in Tyrol. In 1617 Count Kaspar von Hohenems established the legal basis of a Jewish community and hoped for economical benefits. Although in the 17th and 18th century Jews were banished, the Jewish community had built a synagogue and a Jewish cemetery among others. In 1914 Rabbi Josef Link moved from the Jewish community in Hohenems to Innsbruck, where the community was larger. During Kristallnacht in 1938 four members of the Jewish Community were murdered by the Schutzstaffel. By 1939 most of the Jews were banished or deported to Vienna. In 1952 the Israelite Community of Tyrol and Vorarlberg was re-established. In 1993 a synagogue was built. In 2001, there were 60 Jews living in Innsbruck.
