The Kunmadaras pogrom was a post-World War II anti-Semitic pogrom in Kunmadaras, Hungary.  The pogrom resulted in the killing of two and wounding of fifteen Jews on 22 May 1946.  According to JTA , four Jews died.  The riot started in the marketplace as a spontaneous protest against a suspected profiteer. Since  traditional occupation of the Jews in the area was trading, the image of a profiteer was conflated with that of a Jew. Therefore the riot grew into an anti-Jewish pogrom. The frenzy was further instigated by the rumors that the Jews were stealing Christian children. The historian PÃ©ter Apor made a peculiar observation about the subsequent trial of the pogromists: "The People's Tribunal managed to produce a narrative of an anti-Semitic pogrom without involving the Jewish victims." The pogrom was portrayed as a resurgence of fascism pitched against the nascent people's democracy.
