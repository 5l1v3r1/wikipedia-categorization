Kayla, or Kayliñña (Ge'ez: ካይላ kāylā, for the people, Ge'ez: ካይልኛ kāylññā, Kayla, Amharic, and Tigrinya for the language) is one of two Agaw dialects formerly spoken by a subgroup of the Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews). It is a dialect of Qimant. The name Kayla is sometimes also used as a cover term for both Beta Israel dialects.  It is known only from unpublished notes by Jacques Faitlovitch written in the Ge'ez alphabet, recently studied by David Appleyard. It is preserved by the Beta Israel today.
