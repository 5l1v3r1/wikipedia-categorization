Lipót Baumhorn (Hungarian: Baumhorn Lipót, German: Leopold Baumhorn, December 28, 1860, Kisbér - July 8, 1932, Kisbér) was a Hungarian architect. Baumhorn studied in Vienna under Freiherr von Ferstel, who was the designer of the Votive Church there. He set up a practice after further study under Ödön Lechner. His style ranged from historicism to those inspired by the rising nationalism of the times. He designed over twenty synagogues.
