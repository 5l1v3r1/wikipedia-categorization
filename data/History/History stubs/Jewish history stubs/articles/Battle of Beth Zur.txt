The Battle of Beth Zur was fought between the Maccabees led by Judah Maccabee and a Seleucid Greek army led by Viceroy Lysias in 164 BC.  Maccabee won the battle, and was able to recapture Jerusalem soon after. The Jews did not fight in open terrain; they used guerrilla and hit and run tactics to slowly beat back the Seleucid army and eventually rout it. According to 1 Enoch chapters 83-90 (the Animal Apocalypse), the battle was joined on the side of the Maccabees by an angel who had been recording the event.
