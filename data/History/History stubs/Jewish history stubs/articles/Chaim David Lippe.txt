Chaim David Lippe (December 22, 1823, at Stanisławów,  Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria – August 26, 1900, at Vienna) was an Austrian Jewish publisher and bibliographer. For some time he was cantor and instructor in religion at Eperies, Hungary, but he left that town for Vienna, where he conducted a Jewish publishing-house, which issued several popular works. He himself edited a bibliographical lexicon of modern Jewish literature ("Ch. D. Lippe's Bibliographisches Lexicon der Gesammten Jüdischen Literatur der Gegenwart und Address-Anzeiger", Vienna, 1881; 2d ed. 1900).  This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Isidore Singer, Emil Jelinek (1901–1906).
