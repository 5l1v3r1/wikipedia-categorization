Newspaper Yidishes tageblat (יידישעס טאגעבלאט) was founded in 1906 by Zionist Shmuel Yankev Yatskan, a former contributor to the Hebrew language paper Ha-Tsefirah.  In 1908 Yidishes tageblat changed its name to Haynt and quickly established itself as the premier Yiddish newspaper in the Congress Poland.
