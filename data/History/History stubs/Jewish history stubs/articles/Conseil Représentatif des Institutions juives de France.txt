 Conseil Repr√©sentatif des Institutions juives de France (CRIF) (English: Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions) is an umbrella organization of French Jewish organizations. It is the official French affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organization of Jewish communities, and of the European Jewish Congress.  It opposes antisemitism and policies that they perceive to be antisemitic. It generally supports Zionist goals and the state of Israel, although CRIF denounced Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's 2004 characterization of antisemitism in France and his calls for all French Jews to emigrate to Israel. On 20 November 2004, it accused the French government of failing to protect citizens from broadcasts by Hezbollah's al-Manar TV, which includes films that CRIF claims are antisemitic and incite Muslims to attack Jews. (Reuters-Haaretz) Al-Manar was blocked by the CSA. It has opposed the beatification of Pius XII, stating that a majority of independent historians did not agree with the position that Pius worked ceaselessly to save Jews.
