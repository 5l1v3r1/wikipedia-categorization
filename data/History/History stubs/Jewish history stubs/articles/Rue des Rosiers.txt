The Rue des Rosiers, which means "street of the rosebushes," is a street in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, France.  It begins at Rue Malher and proceeds northwest across Rue Pavée, Rue Ferdinand Duval, Rue des Écouffes, and Rue des Hospitalières Saint-Gervais before it ends at Rue Vieille du Temple. Rue des Rosiers lies at the center of the Jewish quarter unofficially called "the Pletzl" (Yiddish for "little place"). Officially, this street is in the Marais district, which extends along the Rue de Rivoli a short distance away, and some refer to the area as "Saint Paul" because of the proximity of the Place Saint-Paul. During the last ten years, the Rue des Rosiers has become notable for fashion. The quaint boutiques of days-gone-by have given way to gleaming minimalist showrooms for some of Europe’s trendiest labels. Not following the Western holiday schedules, Rue des Rosiers shops have become the meeting point for Parisians who want to eat out and shop on Sunday, Christmas, or during any off days.
