Archipheracite was the name of the ministers of Jewish synagogues, who were charged with reading and interpreting the perakim, where the titles and chapters of the law and the prophets are found. The archipheracite was not the same as the archisynagogus, as Grotius and other have mistakenly believed, but rather the chief or principal of these appointed to read, explain, and profess the law in their schools. As the name shows, it is formed of the Greek ἀρχός, "chief", and the Hebrew or Chaldee פרק, "pherak", division or chapter.
