Kohlit is a place, possibly a hill, mentioned several times in the Copper Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Kohlit has become something of a modern-day El Dorado. It is the area given where the second Copper Scroll, containing a more detailed list, is buried.  Kohlit is also an area east of the Jordan River where Alexander Jannaeus had military campaigns. It is unknown whether this is the same Kohlit as the city.
