African Sources for African History is a book series published by Brill that aims to make available critical editions of indigenous African narrative sources from sub-Saharan Africa.  The series aims to expand the sources available to historians of Africa, and to rectify bias that may have been introduced into the writing of African history through an over-reliance on sources written by Europeans. The first in the series was the 2001 Somono Bala of the Upper Niger, an epic story of fishing people, translated into English from the Maninka language for the first time.
