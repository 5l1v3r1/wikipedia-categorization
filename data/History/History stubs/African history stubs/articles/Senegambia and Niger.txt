Senegambia and Niger was a short-lived administrative unit of the colonial French West Africa possessions, in the region of present-day Niger, Mali and Senegal.  It was formed in 1902, and reorganized in 1904 into Upper Senegal and Niger. Despite its brief existence, the French government still managed to issue postage stamps for the administrative unit, in the form of a version of its Navigation and Commerce series, inscribed "SENEGAMBIE / ET NIGER".
