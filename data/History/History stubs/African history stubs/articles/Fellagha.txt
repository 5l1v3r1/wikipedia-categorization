The Fellagha, an Arabic word literally meaning "bandit" , but also comes from "fellah" or farmer , and "fallaq" or blow up , refers to groups of armed militants affiliated with anti-colonial movements in French North Africa.  It most often is used to refer to armed Algerian nationalists who adopted violent means in order to push the French out of Algeria as well as those same fighters in Tunisia or those who did the same. They were particularly important during the Algerian War (1954â€“1962) led by the National Liberation Front.
