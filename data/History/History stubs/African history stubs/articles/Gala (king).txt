Gaia (Berber languages: Gaya, ⴳⴰⵢⴰ; died 207 BCE) was an ancient Berber king of the Massylii,  an eastern Numidian tribe in the Ancient Algeria of North Africa. Gaia reigned during the Second Punic War of ancient Rome. He was the father of King Masinissa,  and the brother of Oezalces.  Greco-Roman authors give his name as "Gala", but an inscription in Dougga indicates it may have instead been "Gaia".
