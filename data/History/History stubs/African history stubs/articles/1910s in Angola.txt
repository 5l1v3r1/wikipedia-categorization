In the 1910s in Angola the colonial government transitioned from a monarchy to republican rule following a coup d'état in October 1910. The Portuguese First Republic, the new state, re-abolished slavery.  Republicans overthrew King Manuel II in 1910. Slaves in Moçâmedes, among other cities in Angola, campaigned for abolition and manumission. In some areas slaves declared strikes, hoping the economic slowdown would force political changes. Carvalhal Correia Henriques, the new governor of Moçâmedes, supported the slaves' cause and directed labor complaints his way. The Portuguese slave owners whose businesses depended on the slaves used their political clout to lobby the Portuguese government to fire Henriques. The government complied, dismissing him in January 1912.
