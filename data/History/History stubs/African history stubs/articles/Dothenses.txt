 Dothenses  was a population of ancient Numidia whose location is unknown, but it could be located near the cave of Djebel-Taya and Thibilis, in Guelma (Algeria). The existence of this city is known thanks to numerous votive inscriptions dedicated to god  Bacax recorded on the walls of the cave of Djebel-Taya. In five of these inscriptions is mentioned about the Dothenses community, that would be responsible for conducting the annual offerings to the deity in the spring months.
