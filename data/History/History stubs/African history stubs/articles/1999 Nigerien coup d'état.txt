The 1999 Nigerien coup d'état occurred on 9 April 1999 and resulted in the death of President Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara and the installation of Daouda Malam Wanké as President on 11 April. Maïnassara was killed at a military base, possibly by members of the Presidential Guard.  Maïnassara, a career soldier, had seized power himself in a coup d'état in January 1996. In doing so, he removed democratically elected President Mahamane Ousmane. Wanké led a transitional government towards democratic elections, which were held in October and November 1999. The elections saw Mamadou Tandja become President of Niger in December 1999.
