Tongaland, or Amatongaland, existed in southeast Africa, lastly as a district of Zululand, forming the northern neck of Zululand.  Bordered on the west by the Lebombo Mountains,  the area comprised 1280 mi² (2060 km²).  The inhabitants were the Amatonga, a part of the Zulu people. The possession of Tongaland was strongly desired by the Boers since it furnished them an outlet to the sea and a safe haven, too.  In order to disrupt that plan, Great Britain placed Tongaland under British protection on 11 June 1895; it was annexed to Zululand on 27 December 1897, and  promptly annexed to Natal along with Zululand three or four days later.
