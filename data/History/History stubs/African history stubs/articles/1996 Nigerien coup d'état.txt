The 1996 Nigerien coup d'état was a military coup d'état which occurred on 27 January 1996 in Niamey, Niger. It ousted Niger's first democratically elected president, Mahamane Ousmane after nearly three years in power and installed General Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara as head of state. Prime Minister Hama Amadou was arrested in the coup and several soldiers and presidential guard were killed in the fighting.  Maïnassara stayed in power following the coup until January 1999, when his regime was overthrown in the 1999 Nigerien coup d'état.
