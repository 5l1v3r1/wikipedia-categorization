The underground town of Agongointo-Zoungoudo is located approximately 9Â km from Abomey, in central Benin.  The city was discovered in 1998 by the Danish company DANIDA. It consists of a series of bunkers and other housing structures around 10m deep underground, built in an apparent effort to provide dwelling as well as protection for warriors.  These houses appear to have been built in the 16th century under the reign of King Dakodonou, the second King of Abomey.  This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on June 19, 1998, in the Cultural category. It was added to the list because it reunited two criteria: UNESCO World Heritage Center.org: Agongointo-Zoungoudo Underground Town (Village souterrain d'Agongointo-Zoungoudo) UNESCO World Heritage Center.org: Criteria
