The Republic of Martyazo (French: RÃ©publique de Martyazo) was a secessionist state proclaimed by Hutu rebels in Burundi on 1 May 1972.  The state was located inside the mountainous Vugizo commune, between the Makamba and Lake Nyanza. On 9 May 1972, forces of the Tutsi-dominated government of Michel Micombero occupied the region, ending the rebellion and the existence of Martyazo. Academics have dubbed the state "mysterious"  and "ephemeral"  because of a lack of reliable information on it. Due to its life span of little more than a week, no formal government structures were ever established in Martyazo. However, Antoine Serukwavu was said to have been president of the state. The creation of Martyazo and the killing of Prince Ntare V of Burundi were two events that together marked the beginning of the 1972 civil war and genocide.
