The Masaesyli were a Berber tribe of western Numidia  and the main antagonists of the Massylii in eastern Numidia.  During the Second Punic War the Masaesyli initially supported the Roman Republic and were led by Syphax against the Massylii, who were led by Masinissa. After Masinissa threatened to unite all Numidians in a confederacy against Rome, the Masaesyli turned against Rome and undertook the siege of Carthage. Syphax was defeated, however, and spent the remainder of his days in Roman captivity, while his tribe was assimilated into the kingdom of Masinissa.
