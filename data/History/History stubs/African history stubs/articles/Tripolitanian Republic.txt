After World War I, an Arab republic, الجمهورية الطرابلسية‎ al-Jumhuriyat at-Trabulsiya, or the "Tripolitanian Republic", declared the independence of Tripolitania from Italian Libya. The proclamation of the Tripolitanian Republic in autumn 1918 was followed by a formal declaration of independence at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The idea began in the city of Misrata following a meeting of Sulayman al-Baruni, Ramadan Asswehly, Abdul Nabi Belkheir and Ahmad Almarid. This was the first formally declared republican form of government in the Arab world, but it gained little support from international powers and disintegrated by 1923. Italy managed to establish full control over Libya by 1930. Originally administered as part of a single colony, Italian Tripolitania was a separate colony from 26 June 1927 to 3 December 1934, when it was merged into Libya.
