The People's Republic of Angola (Portuguese: Rep√∫blica Popular de Angola) was the self-declared socialist state which governed Angola from its independence in 1975 until 1992, during the Angolan Civil War. The regime was established in 1975, after Portuguese Angola was granted independence from Portugal through the Alvor Agreement.   This was akin to the situation in the People's Republic of Mozambique.  The newly-founded nation had friendly relations with the Soviet Union, Cuba, and the People's Republic of Mozambique.  The country was governed by the People's  Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which was responsible for the transition into a Marxist-Leninist one-party state. The group was backed by both Cuba and the Soviet Union. An opposing group, known as the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi, sparked a civil war with the MPLA, with the backing from both apartheid South Africa and the United States.  In 1991, the MPLA and UNITA signed the peace agreement known as the Bicesse Accords, which allowed for multiparty elections in Angola. In 1992, the People's Republic of Angola was constitutionally succeeded by the Republic of Angola and elections were held.  However, the peace agreement did not last, as Savimbi rejected the election results and fighting resumed across the country.
