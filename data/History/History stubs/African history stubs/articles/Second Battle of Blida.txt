Algerian resistance The Second Battle of Blida was a battle between France and the local Algerian popular forces. It began on 17 November 1830 and ended eight days later on 25 November. After the failure of France in the First Battle of Blida, de Burman was relieved of his duties and General Bertrand Clausel was appointed on 17 November 1830 for a major campaign on Blida and Médéa. Bertrand Clausel conducted a massive campaign with 17,000 soldiers to invade Blida and Médéa. . The inhabitants of Blida refused to allow the French army into the city and a fierce battle broke out in which hundreds were killed or wounded. The French army burned the orchards surrounding the city and the inhabitants were forced to flee into the mountains. Before his departure from Blida, General Bertrand Clausel left a French garrison under the command of Colonel Roulhières  and headed towards Médéa. He was ambushed by the Popular Resistance in a mountainous strait near Mouzaïa, and 27 French soldiers were killed. Before General  Clausel returned from Médéa, the French garrison in Blida managed to eliminate a French contingent of 100 soldiers near Boufarik on 25 November 1830.[clarification needed] In the face of a great resistance, General Clausel was forced to take over Médéa and withdraw completely from Blida.
