The Kingdom of Jarin was an early medieval kingdom centered in Northeast Africa. According to Al-Yaqubi, it was one of six Beja polities that existed in the region during the 9th century. The kingdom's territory was located between Aswan and Massawa.  Cities within the Kingdom of Jarin's territory included Suakin and â€˜Aydhab. However, both towns were independent of the polity and were also under the protection of Egypt.
