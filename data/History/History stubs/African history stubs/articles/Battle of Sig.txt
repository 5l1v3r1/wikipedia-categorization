The Battle of Sig took place from 26 to 27 June 1835 in the forest of Moulay Ismael near Wadi Sig and opposed French forces, assisted by the Douair and Smela tribes, to Algerian resistors led by Emir Abdelkader. The fighting lasted two days. Unable to resist the Algerian assaults, the men of General Camille Alphonse Trézel retreated. A further withdrawal was also initiated at Arzew, but Trézel's forces were swiftly overtaken. The Algerian cavalry, faster, more mobile and above all more numerous, blocked the French at the Macta. The Foreign Legion succeeded in containing their attackers and repelling them, but the Algerians continued their attacks. The next day, they ambushed the French at the Macta marshes, formed by the confluence of the Sig and the Habra, between the river and the forest. The heavy wagons of the convoy were destroyed and the wounded from the previous night's battle slaughtered, while the troops of the escort were annihilated. The Foreign Legion again stepped in; they freed the way toward Arzew, but the attack by the Algerian horsemen cost the French forces  52 men killed and 189 wounded.
