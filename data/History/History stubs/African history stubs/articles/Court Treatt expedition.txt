The Court Treatt expedition was the first successful trip by "road" from Cape Town to Cairo.  It took place in 1924 using two Crossley cars   , and was led by Major Court Treatt.  The party also included his wife Stella Court Treatt.  As traffical roads generally did not exist at that time, the journey was necessarily slow.  Part of the purpose of the trip was to map out a route.
