  Hereroland was a bantustan in South West Africa (present day Namibia), intended by the apartheid government to be a self-governing homeland for the Herero people. It was set up in 1968 and self-government was granted two years later. Hereroland, like other homelands in South West Africa, was abolished in May 1989 at the start of the transition to independence.
