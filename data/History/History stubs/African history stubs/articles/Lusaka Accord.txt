1970s Aftermath The Lusaka Accord (Portuguese: Acordo de Lusaka) was signed in Lusaka, Zambia on 7 September 1974, between the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and the Portuguese government installed after the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon.  In the agreement, Portugal formally recognized the right of the Mozambican people to independence and agreed with FRELIMO the terms of the transference of powers. The agreement established that independence would be proclaimed after a transition period when administration of the country would be shared between the two parties. Mozambique became independent on 25 June 1975.
