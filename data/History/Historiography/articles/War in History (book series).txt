War in History (Krieg in der Geschichte, KRiG) is a German non-fiction book series established in 1999. Published by Verlag Ferdinand Schöningh, it focuses on the latest research in military history. The editors include historians Stig Förster (de) of the University of Bern, Bernhard R. Kroener (de) of the University of Potsdam, Bernd Wegner of the Helmut Schmidt University and Michael Werner (historian) (de) of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. The War in History series includes collections of essays or individual monographs, mostly in German (occasionally in English). Many of the works have been written as dissertations at German universities or research facilities, such as the Center for Military History and Social Sciences of the Bundeswehr. The publication in the series often explore the relationship between war and peace, as well as military and political means. For the editors of this series, investigations into the history of war cannot be carried out solely by "military considerations". Rather, historiographical diversity between foreign and domestic politics as well as society, economy and technology should be taken into account.
