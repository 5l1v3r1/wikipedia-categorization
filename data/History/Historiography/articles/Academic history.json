The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of <i>natural</i> history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different <i>phyla.</i> Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge\" title=\"Cambridge\">Cambridge</a> on <a href=\"/wiki/Greco-Roman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Greco-Roman\">Greco-Roman</a> history, and that of <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford\" title=\"Oxford\">Oxford</a> on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century.  \n</p><p>What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be <i>definitive</i> even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not <i>objective</i>. When the volume on the <a href=\"/wiki/English_Regency\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English Regency\">Regency</a> was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Lewis_Bernstein_Namier\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lewis Bernstein Namier\">Lewis Namier</a> on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the <i>Oxford History</i> volumes to appear outdated.\n</p><p>It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any <a href=\"/wiki/Marxian_economics\" title=\"Marxian economics\">Marxian</a> content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th, there weren't any more academic histories. History is no longer subdivided in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. \n</p><p>However, the project of <a href=\"/wiki/Globalization\" title=\"Globalization\">globalization</a> has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic, in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Academic_history&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Academia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Academia\">Academia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/History_of_scholarship\" title=\"History of scholarship\">History of scholarship</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1256\nCached time: 20180912031055\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.048 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.084 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 149/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 8616/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 25/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.027/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 1.28 MB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   67.568      1 -total\n 51.86%   35.040      1 Template:About\n 40.24%   27.188      1 Template:Unreferenced\n 37.57%   25.386      2 Template:Ambox\n  7.69%    5.193      1 Template:Original_research\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1214033-0!canonical and timestamp 20180912031054 and revision id 768302620\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Academic History","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_November_2007"},{"sortkey":"Academic History","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Academic History","hidden":"","*":"Articles_that_may_contain_original_research_from_October_2009"},{"sortkey":"Academic History","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_that_may_contain_original_research"},{"sortkey":"Academic History","*":"Historiography"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from November 2007"},{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles that may contain original research from October 2009"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Academia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cambridge"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cambridge Modern History"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"English Regency"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Globalization"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Greco-Roman"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"History of scholarship"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"History of science"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lewis Bernstein Namier"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Marxian economics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Oxford"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:No original research"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:About"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Original research"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:About"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Hatnote list"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Pagetype"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Pagetype/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg","Ambox_important.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Academic_history","byteoffset":3316,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Academic history","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Academic History"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4671275"}]}}
