Allen, a little-known preacher at the Second Baptist Church in Boston, gave an emotional sermon in December 1772 that played upon colonial fears and prejudices.  Though Allen was not a particularly notable thinker or writer, and his arguments were not always accurate or consistent, his <i>Oration</i> went through seven printings (five editions) published in four different cities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Allen argued that England and America were separate judicial spheres and one could not interfere with the other.  He addressed his message to <a href=\"/wiki/William_Legge,_2nd_Earl_of_Dartmouth\" title=\"William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth\">Lord Dartmouth</a> and portrayed the actions of colonials as merely self-defense, not rebellion\u2014an important distinction for his reading audience in early 1773.

The reactions (and overreactions) of the Imperial government in 1774 preoccupied patriot presses and later historical narratives.  Forever afterwards the <i>Gaspee</i> episode has remained of minor concern to those who recounted the events leading up to April 1775.

Many romanticized it as a \"Golden Age\" and de-emphasized its revolutionary character, especially in light of disturbing revolutionary events in France, Haiti, and Latin America.  Others sought to interview aging survivors of the Revolution, even tracking down those who had fled to Canada or London.  Three colonial participants from the attack on the <i>Gaspee</i> documented their memories of that night: Dr. John Mawney, the doctor who tended to the Lieutenant\u2019s wounds; Ephraim Bowen, who provided Joseph Bucklin with the firearm used to shoot the British Lieutenant; and Aaron Biggs, an indentured servant who gave contemporary testimony that he was an eyewitness to the events of 9\u201310 June 1772.  The colonial government and patriot press worked hard to discredit his deposition.  Biggs was retained on a British vessel for his own safety.  Bowen was only 19 in 1772, but later achieved the rank of Colonel and went on to run a successful rum distillery in <a href=\"/wiki/Pawtuxet_Village\" title=\"Pawtuxet Village\">Pawtuxet Village</a>.  In 1839 at age 86, two years before his death, Bowen attempted to recall the events of that night 67 years earlier.  Confident that everyone else who was involved was dead, he named as many individuals as he could remember.  While Mawney\u2019s and Bowen\u2019s accounts contain a few errors in detail, they are the only detailed eyewitness narratives from the colonial side.  They tell us that the men convened at Sabin\u2019s Tavern, that <a href=\"/wiki/John_Brown_(Rhode_Island)\" title=\"John Brown (Rhode Island)\">John Brown</a> organized a flotilla of eight boats, and that Abraham Whipple identified himself to the <i>Gaspee</i> lookouts as the Sheriff of Kent County.

In 1845, Rhode Island Judge William R. Staples published what remains the most accessible (reprinted in 1990), detailed, and best-known work on the <i>Gaspee</i>, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://gaspee.org/StaplesForwardIntro.htm#Top\"><i>Documentary History of the Destruction of the Gaspee</i></a>.  First appearing in the <i>Providence Daily Journal</i>, his account later appeared as a substantial pamphlet.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Staples\u2019s work contained 56 pages of contemporary correspondence surrounding the events of 1772-73.  He graduated from <a href=\"/wiki/Brown_University\" title=\"Brown University\">Brown University</a> in Providence, studied law, and was admitted to the bar.  Later he served on Rhode Island\u2019s <a href=\"/wiki/Rhode_Island_Supreme_Court\" title=\"Rhode Island Supreme Court\">Supreme Court</a> and ultimately became Chief Justice.  He helped found the <a href=\"/wiki/Rhode_Island_Historical_Society\" title=\"Rhode Island Historical Society\">Rhode Island Historical Society</a>, where he served in the roles of secretary, librarian, and vice-president.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Staples\u2019 work is peppered with brief notes of commentary, allowing his own <a href=\"/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)\" title=\"Whig Party (United States)\">Whig Partygish</a> interpretation of the events to shine through.  But he supplies little narrative or analysis in <i>Documentary History</i>.  Staples let the historical actors speak for themselves.  When he did speak, Staples did not hide his sympathies ascribing just motives to the colonials and sinister ones to royal representatives.  When Staples\u2019 work was republished in 1990, Richard M. Deasy wrote an introduction reflecting on the <i>Gaspee</i> and the lasting contribution of Judge Staples\u2019 compilation of documents. Deasy mentioned other maritime attacks on British government property as well as the Dockyards Act of 1772 (see <a href=\"/wiki/Arson_in_royal_dockyards\" title=\"Arson in royal dockyards\">Arson in royal dockyards</a>), but he explained the reaction of the Crown to the <i>Gaspee</i> as \"simply the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Fifteen years after Staples, in 1860, <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_G._Arnold\" title=\"Samuel G. Arnold\">Samuel G. Arnold</a> produced a brief treatment of the <i>Gaspee</i> in his <i>History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</i>.  He dedicated ten pages to the arrival of the <i>Gaspee</i> in <a href=\"/wiki/Narragansett_Bay\" title=\"Narragansett Bay\">Narragansett Bay</a>, to early troubles with Lieutenant Dudingston, and to the destruction of the vessel, the Commission of Inquiry, and Ephraim Bowen\u2019s account of that night.  Arnold wrote up the <i>Gaspee</i> incident as a chronological narrative with the year, month, and day displayed in the margins (as he did for all of Rhode Island\u2019s history).  Arnold celebrated the triumph of liberty over tyranny throughout the section on the American Revolution and described Lieutenant Dudingston\u2019s wounds as \"the first British blood shed in the war of independence.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At about this same time, from 1856 to 1865, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Russell_Bartlett\" title=\"John Russell Bartlett\">John Russell Bartlett</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Rhode_Island\" title=\"Secretary of State of Rhode Island\">Secretary of State of Rhode Island</a>, published <i>Records of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England</i>, a ten-volume set. In 1862, volume 7, which covered the years 1770\u20131776 was released.  Here, 136 pages covered the <i>Gaspee</i> affair, which included a few additional pages of correspondence (not found in Staples) surrounding the destruction of the <i>Gaspee</i>.  <a href=\"/wiki/George_Bancroft\" title=\"George Bancroft\">George Bancroft</a> assisted Bartlett by securing copies of documents in London.  A year earlier, Bartlett had published exactly the same pages under the title <i>A History of the Destruction of His Britannic Majesty\u2019s Schooner</i> Gaspee, <i>in Narragansett Bay, on the 10th June, 1772</i>.  Almost identical to Staples\u2019s work in content and layout, Bartlett provided more analysis and commentary than had the judge.  He offered more comments in the footnotes, and laid out the text in one column instead of two, making it a 141-page book.  In the introduction Bartlett justified the release of a book similar to Staples\u2019s work, not because the latter was found wanting, but because it was scarce and out of print.  Given the Whig view of the American Revolution shared by these two prestigious Rhode Islanders and most of their readers, they had sufficiently covered the topic for their era and no full-length treatment for an adult readership of the <i>Gaspee</i> was published thereafter.  Their work reflected the more celebratory and confident attitude of the earlier part of nineteenth century, they did not seem to struggle with living in the shadows of the accomplishments of their parents and grandparents, as so many others of their generation did.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Imperial_School\">Imperial School</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Historiography_of_the_Gaspee_affair&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Imperial School\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Unreferenced\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section <b>does not <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\">cite</a> any <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">sources</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historiography_of_the_Gaspee_affair&amp;action=edit\">improve this section</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.

A great deal of creative energy went into writing about the perceived causes of the Civil War and narratives recalling minute details of every battle.  Many of these histories were disconnected from longer developments and large secular changes of the nineteenth century, giving them an antiquarian flavor.  Academic historians, on the other hand, were busy professionalizing their discipline.  It was during the decades following the Civil War that historical associations (like the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Historical_Association\" title=\"American Historical Association\">American Historical Association</a> in 1884) were founded and many prestigious American universities implemented Ph.D. programs, largely modeled after German institutions.  The publication of scholarly journals rose in quantity and quality.\n</p><p>At this same time, more professional and academic American historians were following in the footsteps of <a href=\"/wiki/Jared_Sparks\" title=\"Jared Sparks\">Jared Sparks</a> (1789\u20131866) and George Bancroft (1800\u20131891) by visiting European archives to uncover the information that British officials in London had at their disposal and how they made decisions that affected the North American colonies.  Their work, later known as the \"Imperial School\" of historical interpretation, was more sympathetic to the British and their American loyalists allies.  These scholars had more intellectual, political, and chronological distance from the events on the late eighteenth century; but writing during a time of massive immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe, Anglo-Saxonism tainted their writings.  <a href=\"/wiki/George_Louis_Beer\" title=\"George Louis Beer\">George Louis Beer</a> (1872\u20131920) and <a href=\"/wiki/Herbert_L._Osgood\" title=\"Herbert L.

Following the <a href=\"/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\" title=\"Seven Years&#39; War\">Seven Years' War</a>, Britain returned some sugar islands to the French but retained Canada.  This marked a shift in colonial administration, where new and emerging markets were valued more highly than mere resource extraction.  Controlling, regulating, and collecting the revenues of colonial markets, these scholars explained, would become divisive points of contention in the 1760s and 70s.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Early_twentieth_century_and_.22progressive.22_interpretations\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_twentieth_century_and_&quot;progressive&quot;_interpretations\">Early twentieth century and \"progressive\" interpretations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Historiography_of_the_Gaspee_affair&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Early twentieth century and &quot;progressive&quot; interpretations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Consequently, it was only at the beginning of the twentieth century that educational leaders expressed an interest in teaching Rhode Island school children about the <i>Gaspee</i>.

The attack on the ship was no oppressed class uprising.  Rather, it was the well-heeled merchants of Providence and Newport and their shipmasters challenging the revenue enforcement of the London government.  These merchants had numerous family and commercial ties to the colonial legislature and to the Governor\u2019s office.

In the years leading up to the Great Depression, Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard published and re-published their massive, 800-page <i>Rise of American Civilization</i> college textbook.  They made only a one-sentence reference to the <i>Gaspee</i>, but they allotted five pages to the Boston Tea Party, even making analogies between trade privileges granted to the <a href=\"/wiki/East_India_Company\" title=\"East India Company\">East India Company</a> in the eighteenth century with those given to <a href=\"/wiki/Standard_Oil\" title=\"Standard Oil\">Standard Oil</a> in the nineteenth.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Not wanting to repeat the painful experiences following World War I, many Americans wanted to return to a post-war America that would be homogeneous and unified.  Portrayals of the revolutionary period by historians reflected this cultural shift, inasmuch as  post-1945 historical writing emphasized the constructive nation-building done by thoughtful elites in the late 1780s, and downplayed the fiery rhetoric of patriotic hotheads in the 1770s.  All of this made the revolution seem not very \"revolutionary\" at all.  Oliver M. Dickerson placed the blame for friction in the colonies not on the <a href=\"/wiki/Navigation_Acts\" title=\"Navigation Acts\">Navigation Acts</a>, which he argued were, by every assessment, functioning well; rather he accused the new Board of Customs Commissioners of acting like pirates.  Dickerson portrayed the English colonies of the new world as prosperous, highly desirable places to live.

Royal authority was deeply rooted in the mid-eighteenth century in the English colonies of North America.

Despite all the varieties and differences among the Patriot leadership, Morgan argued that they had a consensus at a more basic, world-view level.

They broke windows, \"pulled-down\" houses, and sometimes burned their victims in effigy.  Mobs usually acted and reacted close to their homes.  Thompson indicated that as more and more of the English economy came under the control of \"unseen\" market forces, the traditional \"paternalistic\" protectors of the economy were coming under scrutiny for not \"protecting\" people from these forces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the colonies, Maier noted that three kinds of uprisings pointing toward the revolution that have attracted attention from historians because they directly challenged British authority:  restrictions on the use of white pine trees, naval impressments, and customs-related conflicts.  These conflicts did not merely engage those on the periphery of colonial society\u2014seafarers, Blacks, and servants\u2014rather, colonial elites participated in these protests.  Charles Dudley, the customs collector in Newport, was attacked in 1771 not by the \"lowest class of Men,\" but by the merchants and shipmasters of the port.  In 1772 members of the leading merchant family of Providence planned the attack on Lieutenant Dudingston and the <i>Gaspee</i>.  In keeping with colonial patterns for local uprisings, the local sheriff immediately identified himself and claimed that he was carrying out his duties by seeking to arrest Dudingston.  Some of the attackers may have blackened their faces, another trait of some colonial mobs.  Maier noted that the Brown's actions were carried out only as a last resort and after all legal means had failed.  Rhode Island merchants and shipmasters had pressed their grievances during the spring of 1772 through civil and military channels to no avail.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Uprisings were meant to show weaknesses in the government, \"areas for improvement,\" places where laws needed enforcement.  In the case of the <i>Gaspee</i>, the uprising was meant to show where enforcement had been excessive.  The desired response from the Crown would have been to relax the enforcement of customs in a colony that depended so much upon navigation.  Dudingston was tried and convicted of illegal seizure in a Rhode Island court and the customs board in Boston paid his fine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Maier\u2019s work revealed the function the colonial mob served in a society where the government and police presence was small.

Franklin Wickwire wrote an article in 1963 that examined the British perspective on the <i>Gaspee</i> more thoroughly than anyone before or since.  Here he examined the transition from <a href=\"/wiki/Wills_Hill,_1st_Marquess_of_Downshire\" title=\"Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire\">Lord Hillsborough</a> to Lord Dartmouth as <a href=\"/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies\" title=\"Secretary of State for the Colonies\">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a> in 1772.  Dartmouth was not as experienced in colonial affairs as Hillsborough.  He relied heavily on one of his undersecretaries, John Pownall, the younger brother of colonial governor of Massachusetts <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Pownall\" title=\"Thomas Pownall\">Thomas Pownall</a>.  By 1772, Pownall had thirty years of experience with American colonial affairs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Dartmouth, and later <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_North,_Lord_North\" title=\"Frederick North, Lord North\">Lord North</a>, relied on Pownall to the point that this subminister was not merely carrying out administrative duties, he was writing policy for the Colonies.  From humble beginnings, Pownall had risen to the high councils of the British government that ultimately brought about the undoing of the first British Empire.\n</p><p>When the Privy Council ordered the attorney and solicitor general to draft the commission and the King\u2019s proclamation for the <i>Gaspee</i>, Dartmouth left for his country home, assigning these duties to Pownall, who wrote much of the copy, forwarding important documents to Dartmouth merely for his signature.  Wickwire\u2019s view of the <i>Gaspee</i> incident showed a British ministry where important directives and orders were delegated to subministers.  While dedicated and competent administrators, they had little knowledge about what was actually happening \"on the ground\" in the American colonies.  Most had never visited the eastern seaboard of North America and were not in a good position to judge how their directives were going to be received on the other side of the Atlantic.  While John Pownall certainly understood the political culture of the colonies better than many of his superiors, repeatedly London\u2019s officials failed to anticipate policy implications and outcome.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Alfred F. Young, in an introduction to a collection of essays by self-styled radical historians, distinguished between \"internal radicals\" and \"external radicals.\"  Those who were the most anti-British in the years leading up to 1776 were radical because of their unwillingness to work within the Imperial system.  Apart from independence, they were not seeking drastic changes to the social order.  Internal radicals, sometimes known to contemporaries as \"levellers,\" may or may not have been interested in patriot grievances against the ministry.  They sought a re-ordering of colonial hierarchies that would allow the \"outsiders\" in.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Jesse Lemisch portrayed sailors as the quintessential \"outsiders.\"  While they were not interested in the re-ordering of society, like blacks and slaves, they were treated like children by the civil codes of British America.  Lemisch argued that impressment of sailors (and especially capture of those colonials who were not mariners) was a key grievance understated by previous authors.  This abuse of power by naval authorities made a mockery of Britons as \"free people.\"<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

DeVaro.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>  Writing most of his chapters in the early 1970s, he was heavily influenced by Bernard Bailyn\u2019s <i>The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution</i>.  DeVaro argued that the <i>Gaspee</i> had a greater impact in Britain than in America.  Where Patriots saw Crown actions as a conspiracy to subvert their court system and trial in the vicinage, ministry officials saw the attack on the <i>Gaspee</i> as a conspiracy to weaken royal authority in New England.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Previous attacks, even ones in Rhode Island, were not considered treason.  While some rewards had been posted in the past for information leading to an arrest, none was followed by a Royal commission like the <i>Gaspee</i>.  Exaggerated and erroneous reports were taken to London that overestimated the number of participants, the seriousness of Dudingston\u2019s wounds, and misidentified the location of the attack.  These reports made it difficult for the commission to properly execute its duties.  Even as they did go about their inquiry, local residents overestimated the power delegated to the commissioners.  The historian David Lovejoy, using the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Newport_Mercury\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Newport Mercury\">Newport Mercury</a></i>, showed how many residents in Providence and Newport were expecting the worst possible outcome from the commission.  The Newport pastor <a href=\"/wiki/Ezra_Stiles\" title=\"Ezra Stiles\">Ezra Stiles</a>, indicated to Reverend <a href=\"/wiki/Elihu_Spencer\" title=\"Elihu Spencer\">Elihu Spencer</a> that, \"no one justifies the burning of the <i>Gaspee</i>.

New information provided includes the revelation that John Brown's boat, <i>The Hannah</i>, was newly returned from a voyage to Africa and that the attack had occurred concurrently with a major decision in the British Parliament regarding the abolition of slavery, emphasizing that the colonists were greatly concerned that the freeing of Africans would result in violent retribution on the part of freed slaves.  Horne also dedicates several pages to re-telling the attack from the point of view of Aaron Briggs, and indentured Afro-Indian who later attempted to testify against the attack party so to gain manumission from his servitude.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Historiography_of_the_Gaspee_affair&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">David A.
