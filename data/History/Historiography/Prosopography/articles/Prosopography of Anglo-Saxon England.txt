The Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England (PASE) is a database and associated website that aims to collate everything that was written in contemporary records about anyone who lived in Anglo-Saxon England, in a prosopography.  The PASE online database  presents details (which it calls factoids) of the lives of every recorded individual who lived in, or was closely connected with, Anglo-Saxon England from 597 to 1087,  with specific citations to (and often quotations from) each primary source describing each factoid. PASE was funded by the British Arts and Humanities Research Council from 2000 to 2008 as a major research project based at King's College London in the Department of History and the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, and at the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge.    The first phase of the project was launched at the British Academy on the 27 May 2005 and is freely available on the Internet at www.pase.ac.uk.  A second phase (PASE2), released on 10 August 2010, added information drawn chiefly from the Domesday Book to the database.
