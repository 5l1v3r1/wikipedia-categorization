The book is an analysis of the widely believed, but historically inaccurate, <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_legend\" title=\"Urban legend\">urban legend</a> that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-war_movement\" title=\"Anti-war movement\">antiwar protesters</a> upon returning home from the <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam_War\" title=\"Vietnam War\">Vietnam War</a>. The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the \"spat-upon image\" through Hollywood movies and fiction literature, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and antiwar movement has come to be represented.\n</p><p>Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by antiwar activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and antiwar forces.  The book documents the efforts of the Nixon Administration to drive a wedge between military servicemen and the antiwar movement by portraying democratic dissent as betrayal of the troops, effectively redirecting blame for failure in Vietnam onto protesters.  Coupled with American society's exaggeration of medical conditions like <a href=\"/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder\" title=\"Posttraumatic stress disorder\">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) and drug abuse among veterans to the point of broadly vilifying the Vietnam veteran as mentally unfit, emotionally volatile and a \"loser\" and \"victim\", the collective memory about Vietnam has been refocused onto the veteran and away from the war. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the antiwar movement and veterans with the similar <a href=\"/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth\" title=\"Stab-in-the-back myth\">'stab in the back' myths</a> propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Lembcke details the resurrection of this myth of the spat-upon veteran by later administrations during subsequent Gulf War efforts as a way of silencing public dissent.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Origins\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Origins</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Synopsis\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Synopsis</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Reception_and_influence\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reception and influence</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Online_debate_and_investigation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Online debate and investigation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Reviews\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reviews</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Further_reading\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further reading</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins\">Origins</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Spitting_Image&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Origins\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A persistent but unfounded criticism leveled against <a href=\"/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Opposition to the Vietnam War\">those who protested</a> the United States's involvement in the <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam_War\" title=\"Vietnam War\">Vietnam War</a> is that protesters spat upon and otherwise derided returning soldiers, calling them \"baby-killers\", etc. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, years after the war in Vietnam ended, the proliferation of these spitting stories increased greatly. As both a Vietnam veteran and a member of the antiwar movement, Lembcke knew this criticism ran counter to what he personally experienced and witnessed. To the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the period's antiwar movement was its support for the troops in the field and the affiliation of many returning veterans with the movement. Lembcke was motivated to look further into the truth and origins of this spat-upon veteran myth, and the contradiction between historical fact and popular collective memory. Other observers had already noticed the proliferation of stories and questioned whether the spitting stories even made sense. In 1987, columnist <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Greene\" title=\"Bob Greene\">Bob Greene</a> noted: \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even during the most fervent days of anti-war protest, it seemed that it was not the soldiers whom protesters were maligning.  It was the leaders of government, and the top generals\u2014at least, that is how it seemed in memory. One of the most popular chants during the anti-war marches was, \"Stop the war in Vietnam, bring the boys home.\" You heard that at every peace rally in America. \"Bring the boys home.\" That was the message. Also, when one thought realistically about the image of what was supposed to have happened, it seemed questionable.  So-called \"hippies,\" no matter what else one may have felt about them, were not the most macho people in the world. Picture a burly member of the Green Berets, in full uniform, walking through an airport.  Now think of a \"hippie\" crossing his path.  Would the hippie have the nerve to spit on the soldier?  And if the hippie did, would the soldier\u2014fresh from facing enemy troops in the jungles of Vietnam\u2014just stand there and take it?</p></blockquote>\n<p>By 1992, the Director of the Connelly Library and curator of the Vietnam War Collection at <a href=\"/wiki/La_Salle_University\" title=\"La Salle University\">LaSalle University</a> listed the spitting myth as one of the \"Top Six Myths\" from the Vietnam era, and observed the myth \"derives from the mythopoeic belief that returning GI's were routinely spat upon at some time during their repatriation to the USA. This particular round of tales has become so commonplace as to be treated reverently even among otherwise wisely observant veterans.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In 1994, scholar Paul Rogat Loeb wrote, \"to consider spitting on soldiers as even remotely representative of the activist response is to validate a lie\", and noted that myths like that of antiwar activists spitting on soldiers have rewritten or \"erased history\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> An academic study into the making and shaping of a collective memory found that evidence of antiwar activists targeting troops was virtually nonexistent. Instead, it found popular memory was manipulated by national security elites and a complicit news media by frequently labeling resistors to U.S. war efforts as \"anti-troop\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> As observed by <a href=\"/wiki/Clarence_Page\" title=\"Clarence Page\">Clarence Page</a> after interviewing Lembcke and Greene, \"the stories have become so widely believed, despite a remarkable lack of witnesses or evidence, that ironically the burden of proof now falls on the accused, the protesters; not their accusers, the veterans. Antiwar protesters must prove the episodes didn't happen, instead of the veterans having to prove they did.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-JWR_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-JWR-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Given this complete lack of evidence that spitting occurred, but acknowledging that it is impossible to prove something never happened, Lembcke set out:<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>to show how it is possible for a large number of people to believe that Vietnam veterans were spat upon when there is no evidence that they were. In effect, my strategy was to set aside the question of whether or not such acts occurred and to show why even if they did not occur it is understandable that the image of the spat-upon veteran has become widely accepted. Indeed, given the manipulation of information and images that began with the Nixon administration and continued at the hands of filmmakers and the news media during the 1970s and 1980s, it would be remarkable if a majority of Americans had not come to believe that Vietnam veterans were abused by the antiwar movement.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Synopsis\">Synopsis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Spitting_Image&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Synopsis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At the time he wrote <i>The Spitting Image</i>, Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported \"spitting on soldiers\" scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt \"spat upon\" by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future antiwar activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against antiwar protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by antiwar protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the \"baby-killer\" and \"murderer\" components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President <a href=\"/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson\" title=\"Lyndon B. Johnson\">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a>, like \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\"\n</p><p><i>The Spitting Image</i> asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by antiwar demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close. Lembcke attributes part of the legend's growth to films relating to Vietnam, notably <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rambo_(film_series)\" title=\"Rambo (film series)\">Rambo</a></i>, in which a \"spat-upon veteran\" image is popularized. He writes that the myth of the spat-upon veteran was later revived by President <a href=\"/wiki/George_H._W._Bush\" title=\"George H. W. Bush\">George H. W. Bush</a> as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the <a href=\"/wiki/Gulf_War\" title=\"Gulf War\">Gulf War</a> to the American people. Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the <a href=\"/wiki/Yellow_ribbon#United_States\" title=\"Yellow ribbon\">yellow ribbon</a> <i>Support our Troops</i> campaign, as it implies that for one to support the troops, one must also support the war. It conflates the ideas of antiwar sentiment and anti-troop sentiment, despite a common antiwar chant being \"Support the Troops: Bring them Home!\"\n</p><p>The \"spat-upon veteran\" meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe. In 1989, Bob Greene's book <i><a href=\"/wiki/Homecoming:_When_the_Soldiers_Returned_from_Vietnam\" title=\"Homecoming: When the Soldiers Returned from Vietnam\">Homecoming</a></i> reprinted letters he had solicited, asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon.<sup id=\"cite_ref-JWR_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-JWR-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Greene's book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting, and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam, among other stories. Greene admits he couldn't validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received, but he did believe spitting must have occurred, stating, \"There were simply too many letters, going into too fine a detail, to deny the fact.\" Greene concluded, \"I think you will agree, after reading the letters, that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be, that does not detract from the overall story that is being told.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> \"Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief\", says Lembcke, who cited Greene's book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Lembke said, \"These stories have to be taken very seriously, but as historical evidence they are problematic. In the first place, stories of this type didn't surface until about ten years after the end of the war. If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did, in the closing years of the war, why is there no evidence for that? Moreover, many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-RLG_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RLG-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro-war demonstrators spitting on antiwar demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RLG_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RLG-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records, like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94% of returning Vietnam soldiers received a \"friendly\" welcome.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets; in 1978 the <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_of_America\" title=\"Vietnam Veterans of America\">Vietnam Veterans of America</a> vowed in its founding principle: Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mazur_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mazur-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <i>The Spitting Image</i> Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative\u2014that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on\u2014saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> \"I cannot, of course, prove to anyone's satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen. Indeed, it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran, some time, some place. But while I cannot prove the negative, I can prove the positive: I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-RLG_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RLG-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reception_and_influence\">Reception and influence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Spitting_Image&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Reception and influence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false.

Every time he discusses his findings in a public forum, a hail of angry responses follows, but his explanations and conclusions are compelling and unsettling.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mazur_11-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mazur-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reviews\">Reviews</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Spitting_Image&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Reviews\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i><a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times\" title=\"Los Angeles Times\">Los Angeles Times</a></i> review:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><blockquote><p>The image is ingrained: A Vietnam veteran, arriving home from the war, gets off a plane only to be greeted by an <a href=\"/wiki/Angry_mob\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Angry mob\">angry mob</a> of antiwar protesters yelling, 'Murderer!' and 'Baby killer!' Then out of the crowd comes someone who spits in the veteran's face. The only problem, according to Jerry Lembcke, is that no such incident has ever been documented. It is instead, says Lembcke, a kind of <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_legend\" title=\"Urban legend\">urban myth</a> that reflects our lingering national confusion over the war.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYU_Press_25-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYU_Press-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote></dd></dl>\n<p><i><a href=\"/wiki/Berkshire_Eagle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Berkshire Eagle\">Berkshire Eagle</a></i> review:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"Well-argued and documented.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYU_Press_25-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYU_Press-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Karl Helicher, <a href=\"/wiki/Library_Journal\" title=\"Library Journal\">Library Journal</a> review:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Images of long-haired antiwar protesters, almost always women, spitting on returning Vietnam veterans have become a shameful part of America's collective memory. Lembcke (sociology, Holy Cross Univ.), a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, here presents a stunning indictment of this myth, an illusion created, he maintains, by the Nixon-Agnew administration and an unwitting press to attribute America's loss in Vietnam to internal dissension. In fact, the antiwar movement and many veterans were closely aligned, and the only documented incidents show members of the VFW and American Legion spitting on their less successful Vietnam peers. But Lembcke's most controversial conclusion is that posttraumatic stress disorder was as much a political creation?a means of discrediting returning vets who protested the war as unhinged?as it was a medical condition. The image of the psycho-vet was furthered through such Hollywood productions as The Deer Hunter and Coming Home. This forceful investigation challenges the reader to reexamine assumptions about the dark side of American culture that glorifies war more than peace. Highly recommended for large public libraries and for all academic peace studies collections.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Amazon_26-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Amazon-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Maurice_Isserman\" title=\"Maurice Isserman\">Maurice Isserman</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chicago_Tribune\" title=\"Chicago Tribune\">Chicago Tribune</a></i> review:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The myth of the spat-upon veteran is not only bad history, but it has been instrumental in selling the American public on bad policy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYU_Press_25-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYU_Press-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Christian_G._Appy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Christian G.

But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, but there was no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as \"empathetic and mutually supporting.\" It is certainly true that a remarkable number of veterans opposed the war, and that the antiwar movement did forge alliances with veterans. It is also true that American culture has given too little in-depth attention to antiwar veterans. But Lembcke insists on a strict either/or argument: Veterans and peaceniks were either enemies or comrades. \"Antiwar activists could not have been spitting on veterans while at the same time befriending them in off-base coffeehouses,\" he writes. [...] My own view is that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. [...] I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Appy_27-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Appy-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>\\\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/David_Dellinger\" title=\"David Dellinger\">David Dellinger</a> review:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"The best history I have seen on the impact of the war on Americans, both then and now.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYU_Press_25-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYU_Press-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>Mary Carroll, <a href=\"/wiki/Booklist\" title=\"Booklist\">Booklist</a> review:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>No, Holy Cross College sociology professor Lembcke can't prove a negative, but he makes a strong case that tales of antiwar activists spitting at returning vets are myth. Lembcke, a Nam vet who was active in Vietnam Veterans Against the War, opens with Persian Gulf War politicians' use of \"the spitting image\" and then traces Nixon and Agnew's agitated response to antiwar activism by GIs and veterans. He notes that contemporary media, government, and polling data show no evidence of antiwar spitting incidents; the few events reported had supporters of the war targeting opponents. But later studies reported hostility toward veterans; \"the spitting image\" epitomized that narrative. Similar images were common in post-World War I Germany and France after Indochina; Lembcke suggests the Nixon administration cultivated this notion of betrayal because it stigmatized both the antiwar movement and veterans against the war. With development of a new psychiatric diagnosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, a good vet/bad vet split was complete, and Hollywood films shifted attention from the war itself to its GI victims.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Amazon_26-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Amazon-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p><i><a href=\"/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle\" title=\"San Francisco Chronicle\">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> review:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lembcke builds a compelling case against collective memory by demonstrating that remembrances of Vietnam were almost at direct odds with circumstantial evidence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYU_Press_25-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYU_Press-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Spitting_Image&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_legend\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stab-in-the-back legend\">Stab-in-the-back legend</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam_Syndrome\" title=\"Vietnam Syndrome\">Vietnam Syndrome</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Collective_memory\" title=\"Collective memory\">Collective memory</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Spitting_Image&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/06/0081080\">Stabbed in the back!
