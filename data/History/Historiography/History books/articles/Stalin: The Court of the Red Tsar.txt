Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar is a 2003 history book by Simon Sebag Montefiore. It primarily deals with the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's life and that of those around him from the late 1920s through to his death in 1953, through the period of collectivization, the Moscow show trials, the purges, World War II and the beginning of the Cold War.    The book used previously unseen archival material and Montefiore also conducted interviews with surviving family members from Stalin's inner circle.  Montefiore later wrote the companion piece Young Stalin, published in 2007.
