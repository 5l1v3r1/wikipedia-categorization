It was written in Persian between 1911 and 1919, with its publication following in the year 1921 in Bombay, India.  After its publication Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk ordered the burning of all copies of the book.     This book remained clandestinely in Chitral until the authors son Ghulam Murtaza recovered a copy and together with Wazir Ali Shah used it as a reference to compile the Nayi Tarikh-i-Chitral (1962). The Nayi Tarikh-i-Chitral is an Urdu translation of the original Tarikh-i-Chitral albeit with considerable additions based on the notes of Mehtar Nasir ul-Mulk (r. 1936-1943).
