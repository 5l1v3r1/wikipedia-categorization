class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The black legend mechanism operates by taking a fact (the Spanish Inquisition existed, it was a phenomenon of <a href=\"/wiki/Religious_intolerance\" title=\"Religious intolerance\">religious intolerance</a>, and it practiced torture), twisting it, mixing it with fabrications and blowing it out of proportion (the imposible and baseless numbers reported, that would acount to 1/3 of the population and impact the economy in ways that were not observed, the fantastic descriptions of torture machines and stories of sadism and mutilation of millions of people, often fabricated in propaganda workshops<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>); ignoring or twisting the context (both religious intolerance and torture were common practices all across Europe, and among the manifestations of it the Spanish inquisition proved itself among the most mellow ones <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>, <sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>); ignoring any positive traits- it was the first judicial body in Europe that operated according to a system and not to judicial discretion, torture was restricted to 15 minutes per session and only allowed on adults under very specific conditions for a set number of times <sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>, inquisitors couldn\u00b4t draw blood, mutilate or cause any permanent harm in victims<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> so water boarding was the most common method as opposed to the fantastic devices portrayed in propaganda<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>, a doctor had to be present, most inquisitors didn\u00b4t believe in witchcraft <sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> etc...); and finally systematically neglecting to mention similar actions by other institutions or nations. This construction, the black legend, turns a relatively regular or unremarcable- for the context- event into an exceptionality in scope and nature, attached to one nation alone. As such, the black legend of the inquisition is created to demonize the other- Spain and/or catholicism- and maintained as self justification for those whose\u00b4s own deeds are overshadowed or ignored.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin\">Origin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Origin\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Torture_Inquisition.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Torture_Inquisition.jpg/300px-Torture_Inquisition.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"221\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Torture_Inquisition.jpg/450px-Torture_Inquisition.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Torture_Inquisition.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"486\" data-file-height=\"358\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Torture_Inquisition.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Typical 18th-century European image of the <a href=\"/wiki/Inquisition\" title=\"Inquisition\">Inquisition</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Kamen<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> establishes two sources for the Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition.

Most historians place most of the weight on the Protestant and Calvinist origin though, since in the Italian propaganda Spaniards were most often portrayed as <a href=\"/wiki/Atheists\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Atheists\">atheists</a> or jews than as fanatics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Italy\">Italy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Italy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The increasing influence during the sixteenth century of the <a href=\"/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon\" title=\"Crown of Aragon\">Aragonese</a> Crown and later of the Spanish one on the <a href=\"/wiki/Italian_Peninsula\" title=\"Italian Peninsula\">Italian Peninsula</a> led <a href=\"/wiki/Public_opinion\" title=\"Public opinion\">public opinion</a>, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Pope\" title=\"Pope\">Papacy</a>, to see the Spaniards as a threat. An unfavorable image of Spain grew that naturally ended up involving a negative view of the Inquisition. <a href=\"/wiki/Revolt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Revolt\">Revolts</a> against the Inquisition in Spanish Crown territories in <a href=\"/wiki/Sicily\" title=\"Sicily\">Sicily</a> occurred in 1511 and 1526 and mere rumors of the future establishment of tribunals caused riots in <a href=\"/wiki/Naples\" title=\"Naples\">Naples</a> in 1547 and 1564.\n</p><p>The ambassadors of the independent Italian governments promoted the image of an impoverished Spain dominated by a <a href=\"/wiki/Tyranny\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tyranny\">tyrannical</a> Inquisition. In 1525, Contarini, <a href=\"/wiki/Venice\" title=\"Venice\">Venetian</a> ambassador, said that all tremble before the Inquisition. Another ambassador, Tiepolo, wrote in 1563 that everyone is afraid of its authority, which has absolute <a href=\"/wiki/Political_power\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Political power\">power</a> over <a href=\"/wiki/Property\" title=\"Property\">property</a>, life, <a href=\"/wiki/Honor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Honor\">honor</a> and even the <a href=\"/wiki/Soul_(spirit)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soul (spirit)\">souls</a> of men. He also, commented that the <a href=\"/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain\" title=\"Monarchy of Spain\">King</a> favors it as a way to control the population. Ambassador Soranzo stated in 1565 that the Inquisition had greater <a href=\"/wiki/Authority\" title=\"Authority\">authority</a> than the King. <a href=\"/wiki/Francesco_Guicciardini\" title=\"Francesco Guicciardini\">Francesco Guicciardini</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Florence\" title=\"Florence\">Florentine</a> ambassador at the court of <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\" title=\"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor\">Charles I</a>, stated that Spaniards were \"in appearance religious, but not in reality\", almost the same words by Tiepolo in 1536.\n</p><p>In general, Italians considered the Inquisition as a necessary evil for the Spaniards, whose religion was questionable if not false, after centuries of mixing with Jews and <a href=\"/wiki/Morisco\" title=\"Morisco\">moriscos</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> In fact, after 1492, the word <a href=\"/wiki/Marrano\" title=\"Marrano\">marrano</a> became synonymous with Spaniard and <a href=\"/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI\" title=\"Pope Alexander VI\">Pope Alexander VI</a> was called the \"circumcised marrano\". \nHowever, it was seen as an insulting insinuation to place an inquisition in Naples since they \"didn\u00b4t need an Inquistion\". They were proper christians, not half atheists half jews in clear need of correction due to natural moral weakness and impure blood. The argument against the inquisition was often one of indignation and not of fear. When the Inquisition began to persecute <a href=\"/wiki/Lutheranism\" title=\"Lutheranism\">Lutherans</a>, the explanation was that the Spaniards were by nature more prone to <a href=\"/wiki/Heresy\" title=\"Heresy\">heresy</a> than Italians, so it was still seen as not necessary in Italy.\nAnother force in this rejection was the force of the  <a href=\"/wiki/Papal_States\" title=\"Papal States\">Papal States</a>. The Papal Inquisition had been operating in Naples as a way of controling the territory since the middle ages. One of the reasons why Spain wanted to introduce the Spanish Inquisition instead was precisely to counter or reduce that foreign influence in Spanish territory, and as such the Pope and powers rival to Spain invited, or even brived, disobedience to try and preserve their power in Naples<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Italian sources can hardly be considered as \"part of the legend\" since their deformation of the facts is not systematic and sustained through time but a reasonable reaction to having a foreign institution imposed upon them, but have been used out of context once said legend was already established.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Augsburg_Spain\">Augsburg Spain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Augsburg Spain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Spanish Inquisition was one of the administrative and juridic arms of the Spanish Crawn. It was created, among other things, to keep both powerful noble families and the Roman Catholic Church in check. This sectors of society had the power to dispute, or dodge, the authority of the king at a local level, and were also the demographics with higher literacy rates, wealth, and international relationships.  \nThe main role of the Inquisition was to prevent internal division in the empire and, even though the religious aspect of it is overly emphasized in the popular image, the fragmentation of power and local coalitions to dispute Royal power were an important part of this cohesion as well. It investigated nobles who wished to put their own local interests over the interests of the crown, and the Pope's desires to intervene and gain control over the Empire, usually with the aid of foreign powers (here is where the religious aspect comes and mixes since said powers usually were Protestant). As an independent body from the Pope, the Spanish Inquisition also had the ability to judge clergy for both corruption and treason without the interference of the Pope, which allowed the king to hold clergy accountable in his realm and limit Papal influence in it. As a consequence, the Inquisition systematically ruffled the feathers of the most powerful people inside the Spanish Empire as well as in the Vatican. \n</p><p>The Spanish Inquisition's trial records show a disproportionate over-representation of nobility and clergy among those who are being investigated and prosecuted. The vast majority of the investigations that the Inquisition initiated itself (investigations on middle and low-class people were usually the consequence of the denounce of neighbors and rarely self-started by the institution). Among the trials, those who are conducted over nobility and clergy were also far more likely to be found guilty and convicted. While for the lay Spaniard who had no education to put their thoughts on paper nor the power to spread them, the Inquisition was far more compassionate and lenient than the civil alternative (the civil tribunals and the King's prisons, with no food and unrestricted use of torture), for the powerful the Inquisition was far worse than what they were used to in civil courts (no accountability at all). The sectors the Spanish Inquisition was designed to address and control were also the same sectors that had the education and resources to write and spread said writing, as well as the ones with something to win from any propaganda campaign. Either by accident, just as the result of mostly discontent people were the only ones who could write and talk about the institution internationally, or by design, the negative accounts from Spain's very international nobility constituted a large number of the total accounts of the Inquisition produced.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Protestantism\">Protestantism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Protestantism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In Northern Europe, the religious confrontation and the threat of <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_Empire\" title=\"Spanish Empire\">Spanish imperial</a> power gave birth to the Black Legend, as the small number of Protestants who were executed by the Inquisition would not have justified such a campaign. Protestants, who had successfully used the <a href=\"/wiki/News_media\" title=\"News media\">press</a> to disseminate their ideas, tried to win with propaganda the war they could not win by force of arms.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Madden_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Madden-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On one hand, Catholic <a href=\"/wiki/Theology\" title=\"Theology\">theologians</a> criticized the <a href=\"/wiki/Protestantism\" title=\"Protestantism\">Protestants</a> as newcomers, who, unlike the Catholic Church could not prove a continuity from the time of Christ. On the other hand, Protestants theologians reasoned that this was not true and that theirs was the true Church which had been oppressed and persecuted by the Catholic Church throughout history.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Madden_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Madden-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> This reasoning, which was only outlined by <a href=\"/wiki/Martin_Luther\" title=\"Martin Luther\">Luther</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Calvin\" title=\"John Calvin\">Calvin</a>, was fleshed out by later Protestant historiography identified with <a href=\"/wiki/John_Wycliffe\" title=\"John Wycliffe\">Wycliffe</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Lollardy\" title=\"Lollardy\">lollards</a> of England, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hussite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hussite\">Hussites</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bohemia\" title=\"Kingdom of Bohemia\">Bohemia</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Waldensians\" title=\"Waldensians\">Waldensians</a> of France. All this despite the fact that in the 16th century heretics were persecuted in both Catholic and Protestant countries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> By the end of the 16th century the Protestant denominations had identified with the heretics of previous times and defined them as <a href=\"/wiki/Martyr\" title=\"Martyr\">martyrs</a>.\n</p><p>When the persecution of Protestants started in Spain the hostility felt towards the Pope was immediately extended to include the King of Spain, on whom the Inquisition depended, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Dominican_Order\" title=\"Dominican Order\">Dominicans</a> who carried it out. After all, the greatest defeat suffered by the Protestants had been at the hands of <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_I_of_Spain\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charles I of Spain\">Charles I of Spain</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_M%C3%BChlberg\" title=\"Battle of M\u00fchlberg\">battle of M\u00fchlberg</a> in 1547.

One of the most famous and influential was the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Book_of_Martyrs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Book of Martyrs\">Book of Martyrs</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Foxe\" title=\"John Foxe\">John Foxe</a> (1516\u20131587). Foxe dedicated an entire chapter to the Spanish Inquisition: <i>The execrable Inquisition of Spayne</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Many of the themes that are repeated later on are to be found in this text: anyone can be tried for any triviality; the Inquisition is infallible; people are usually accused to gain money, because of jealousy or to hide the actions of the Inquisition; if proof is not found it is invented; the prisoners are isolated with no contact with the outside world in dark dungeons where they suffer horrible torture etc. Foxe warned that this sinister organization could be introduced into any country that accepted the Catholic faith.\n</p><p>Another influential book was the <i>Sanctae Inquisitionis Hispanicae Artes</i> (<i>Exposition of the Arts of the Spanish Holy Inquisition</i>) published in <a href=\"/wiki/Heidelberg\" title=\"Heidelberg\">Heidelberg</a> in 1567 under the pseudonym <a href=\"/wiki/Reginaldus_Gonsalvius_Montanus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reginaldus Gonsalvius Montanus\">Reginaldus Gonsalvius Montanus</a>. It appears that Gonzalvius was a pseudonym of <a href=\"/wiki/Antonio_del_Corro\" title=\"Antonio del Corro\">Antonio del Corro</a>, a Spanish Protestant theologian exiled in <a href=\"/wiki/Holland\" title=\"Holland\">Holland</a>. Del Corro added credibility to his tale with his knowledge of the tribunal. The book was an immediate success, two editions were printed between 1568 and 1570 in English and French, three in Dutch, four in German and one in Hungarian, and the book continued to be published and referenced until the 19th century.\n</p><p>The largely fabricated story relates the tale of a prisoner who passes through all the stages of the process and above all the interrogation, allowing the reader to identify with the victim. Del Corro's description presents some of the most extreme practices as being routine, such as the innocence of all the accused, the officials of the Inquisition are shown as being devious and vain and each step of the process is shown as a violation of <a href=\"/wiki/Natural_law\" title=\"Natural law\">natural law</a>. Del Corro supported the initial purpose of the Inquisition which was to persecute false converts and he had not foreseen that his book would be used to support the Black Legend in a similar manner to that of <a href=\"/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas\" title=\"Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas\">Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas</a>. He was convinced that the Dominican monks had converted the Inquisition into something execrable, that <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain\" title=\"Philip II of Spain\">Philip II</a> was not aware of the true proceedings and that the Spanish people were opposed to the sinister organization.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bourbon_Spain\">Bourbon Spain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Bourbon Spain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Spanish Bourbons brought French absolutism and centralization to a largely decentralized and relatively liberal nation. The reaction was one of resentment and further polarization of Spanish society as the high nobility and the church, happy with the new acquisition of power, sided and supported the French monarchy (\"<a href=\"/wiki/Afrancesados\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Afrancesados\">afrancesados</a>\") while other sectors got polarised in growing antimonarchic and anti-French hostility. This situation contributed to the feeding of the black legend of the Inquisition from both extrema. On one side, the court of Spain was suddenly dominated by French intellectuals that came along with the first Bourbon king. As a result, the predominant historiographic view was the French view, which portrayed Spain and the Inquisition as violent and barbaric as consequence of centuries of rivalry between both powers. Those Spanish intellectuals who wished to advance and earn recognition in the court had to adopt said views in order to earn respect. On the other extreme, the protection for the absolutist Bourbons of the church generated a growing identification of the church, the old regime, monarchic absolutism and the king. Eventually, antimonarchic intellectuals and Spaniards resenting the new rule started identifying with the alleged cruelties of the medieval church and the Inquisition as reflections of their own perceived oppression under the Bourbons. The Black Legend of the Inquisition, already created and packed for consumption through the XVI and XVII century by England, the Netherlands, and Germany, and introduced in Spain through France was adopted by both sides as throwing accusation. Since the legend used the alleged cruelty of the Inquisition to diminish both Spain and Catholicism, each side picked half of it and used it to either defend the \"illustrated\" French rule or to attack absolutism. <sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\nThis strife provided with a new body of completely misinformed and undocumented texts on the Inquisition written by Spaniards as propaganda against certain aspects of the government. During the 18th century, the existence of said Inquisition itself seemed to calm the waters and most criticisms was focussed towards the past. During the severe unrest of the 19th century, it was turned by the king not against foreign powers but against Spanish liberals<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p><p>Some examples of these Spanish Liberal contributions to the black legend would be <a href=\"/wiki/Goya\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Goya\">Goya</a>'s engravings, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_del_Olmo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jos\u00e9 del Olmo (page does not exist)\">Jos\u00e9 del Olmo</a>\u2019s narrative accounts, Francisco Rizi(Italian but Spanish sympathiser) engravings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"European_politics_in_the_16th_century\">European politics in the 16th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: European politics in the 16th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A number of books appeared between 1559 and 1562 that presented the Inquisition as a threat to the liberties enjoyed by Europeans.

The English monarchs, above all Elizabeth I, preferred to create civil tribunals to repress religious dissidents, above all Catholics, distancing themselves from the previous practices. Catholic heretics were identified as traitors by a system that was not that much different from the Inquisition. It even went so far as to kidnap an English Catholic lawyer from the Netherlands, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Story_(martyr)\" title=\"John Story (martyr)\">John Story</a>, before taking him to England to be tortured, accused of treason and conspiracy and executed.

It considered that those states that carried out religious persecution were not only poor Christians,<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> but also illogical,<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> given that they acted on the basis of a conjecture and not a certainty. These thinkers attacked all types of religious persecution, but the Inquisition offered them a perfect target for their criticism. These points of view were most popular with the followers of minority religious beliefs, \"dissidents\", such as <a href=\"/wiki/Remonstrants\" title=\"Remonstrants\">Remonstrants</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Anabaptist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anabaptist\">Anabaptists</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Quaker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quaker\">Quakers</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Unitarianism\" title=\"Unitarianism\">Unitarians</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mennonite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mennonite\">Mennonites</a> etc. In fact, <a href=\"/wiki/Philipp_van_Limborch\" title=\"Philipp van Limborch\">Philipp van Limborch</a>, the great historian of the Inquisition, was a Remonstrant and Gilbert Brunet, an English historian of the <a href=\"/wiki/Reformation\" title=\"Reformation\">Reformation</a> was a <a href=\"/wiki/Latitudinarian\" title=\"Latitudinarian\">Latitudinarian</a>.\n</p><p>Towards the end of the 16th century the <a href=\"/wiki/Religious_wars_in_Europe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Religious wars in Europe\">religious wars in Europe</a> had made it clear that any attempt to make religiously uniform states were bound to fail. Intellectuals, starting in Holland and France, affirmed that the State should occupy itself with the well-being of its citizens even if this allowed the growth of the heresy of allowing tolerance in exchange for social peace. By the end of the 17th century these ideas had spread to Central Europe and diversity was beginning to be considered more \"natural\" than uniformity, and that, in fact, uniformity threatened the richness of a nation. Spain was the perfect demonstration of this. It had started to decline economically by the middle of the 17th century and the expulsion of the Jews and other rich, industrious citizens was thought to be one of the main reasons for this decline. Also, the fines and seizures of property and wealth would make the problem worse, as the money was being directed to unproductive areas of the Catholic Church.\n</p><p>The Inquisition was therefore converted into an enemy of the state and as such was reflected as such in the economic and political tracts of the time.

The existence of the Inquisition in Portugal, Spain and Rome was thought to be due to the use of force or because the spirit of the people was weakened, it was not considered possible that the Inquisition was supported voluntarily. This supposed weakness of spirit combined with the strength of the Inquisition in these countries was predicted to lead to a lack of imagination and learning as well as hindering advances in science, literature and the arts. Spain, despite the golden age of the <a href=\"/wiki/Siglo_de_Oro\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Siglo de Oro\">Siglo de Oro</a> and although the Inquisition generally only focused on doctrinal matters, is represented after the 17th century as a country without <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_literature\" title=\"Spanish literature\">literature</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_art\" title=\"Spanish art\">art</a> or science.\n</p><p>As of the 17th century the \"Spanish character\" was included as part of the analysis of the Inquisition.

He described an Inquisitor as someone \"separated from society, in a wretched condition, starved of any kind of relationship, so that he will be tough, ruthless and inexorable...\". In his book \"The Spirit of the Laws\" he dedicates chapter XXV.13 to the Inquisition.

Voltaire did not have a deep knowledge of the Inquisition until later in life, but he often used it to sharpen his satire and ridicule his opponents, as shown by his Don Jer\u00f3nimo Bueno Carac\u00facarador, an Inquisitor who appears in <i>Histoire de Jenni</i> (1775). In <i>Candide</i> (1759), one of his best known titles, he does not show a knowledge of the functioning of the Inquisition greater than that to be found in travel books and general histories. <i>Candide</i> includes his famous description of an <i><a href=\"/wiki/Auto-da-f%C3%A9\" title=\"Auto-da-f\u00e9\">auto-da-f\u00e9</a></i> in Lisbon, a satirical gem, that introduces the Inquisition to comedy. Voltaire's attacks on the Inquisition became more serious and acute from 1761. He shows a better understanding and knowledge of the internal workings of the tribunal, probably thanks to the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Abbe_Morellet\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abbe Morellet\">Abbe Morellet</a> who he used extensively and to his direct knowledge of some cases, such as that of <a href=\"/wiki/Gabriel_Malagrida\" title=\"Gabriel Malagrida\">Gabriel Malagrida</a>, whose death in Lisbon caused a wave of indignation throughout Europe.\n</p><p>Abbe Morellet published his <i>Petite \u00e9crit sur une mati\u00e8re int\u00e9resante</i> and <i>Manuel des Inquisiteurs</i> in 1762.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Both works extracted and summarized the darkest parts of the Inquisition and focussed on the use of deception to secure convictions, thereby making procedures known that even the most bitter enemies of the Inquisition had ignored.\n</p><p>Abbe <a href=\"/wiki/Guillaume-Thomas_Raynal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Guillaume-Thomas Raynal\">Guillaume-Thomas Raynal</a> attained a fame equivalent to that of Montesquieu, Voltaire or <a href=\"/wiki/Rousseau\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rousseau\">Rousseau</a> with his book <i>Histoire philosophique et politique des \u00e9tablissements et du commerce des europ\u00e9ens dans les deux Indes</i>, even to the point that in 1789 he was considered one of the fathers of the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Revolution\" title=\"French Revolution\">French Revolution</a>. His <i>History of the Indies</i> gained fame thanks to its censorship and a number of editions were published in <a href=\"/wiki/Amsterdam\" title=\"Amsterdam\">Amsterdam</a>, Geneva, <a href=\"/wiki/Nantes\" title=\"Nantes\">Nantes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hague\" title=\"The Hague\">The Hague</a> between 1770 and 1774. As one would expect, the book was also about the Inquisition. In this case Raynal did not criticize the deaths or the use of torture, instead he stated that thanks to the Inquisition Spain had not suffered religious wars. He thought that in order to return Spain to the <a href=\"/wiki/Concert_of_Europe\" title=\"Concert of Europe\">Concert of Europe</a> the Inquisition would need to be eliminated which would require the importation of foreigners of all beliefs as the only means of attaining \"good results\" in a reasonable amount of time; as he considered that the use of indigenous workers would take centuries to achieve the same results.\n</p><p>One of the most important works of the century, <i><a href=\"/wiki/L%27Encyclop%C3%A9die\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"L&#39;Encyclop\u00e9die\">L'Encyclop\u00e9die</a></i>, dedicated one of its entries to the Inquisition.

Although his article on wine praised Spanish wine his conclusion was that its abuse can cause incurable illnesses.\n</p><p>The article on the Inquisition is clearly taken from Voltaire's writings. For example, the description of the <i>auto-da-f\u00e9</i> is based on that given by Voltaire in <i>Candide</i>.

It is not as if there were not any critics of the Tribunal, there were many as is evident from the Inquisition's own archives, but these critics are not considered relevant to the Black Legend. For example, in 1542 Alonso de Viru\u00e9s, humanist and Archbishop, criticized its intolerance and those that used chains and the axe to change the disposition of the soul; Juan de Mariana, despite supporting the Inquisition, criticized forced conversions and the belief in purity of blood (<a href=\"/wiki/Limpieza_de_sangre\" title=\"Limpieza de sangre\">limpieza de sangre</a>).\n</p><p>Public opinion slowly started to change after the 18th century thanks to contacts with the outside world, as a consequence the Black Legend began to appear in Spain. The religious and intellectual freedom in France was watched with interest and the initial victims of the Inquisition, conversos and moriscos, had disappeared. Enlightened intellectuals started to appear such as <a href=\"/wiki/Pablo_de_Olavide\" title=\"Pablo de Olavide\">Pablo de Olavide</a> and later <a href=\"/wiki/Pedro_Rodr%C3%ADguez,_Conde_de_Campomanes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, Conde de Campomanes\">Pedro Rodr\u00edguez de Campomanes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Gaspar_Melchor_de_Jovellanos\" title=\"Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos\">Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos</a>, who blamed the Inquisition for the injust treatment of the conversos. In 1811 <a href=\"/wiki/Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn\" title=\"Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn\">Morat\u00edn</a> published <i>Auto de fe celebrado en la ciudad de Logro\u00f1o</i> <sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> (Auto de fe held in the city of Logro\u00f1o) which related the history of a large trial against a number of witches that took place in <a href=\"/wiki/Logro%C3%B1o\" title=\"Logro\u00f1o\">Logro\u00f1o</a>, with satirical comments from the author. However, these liberal intellectuals, some of whom were members of the government, were not revolutionary and were preoccupied with the maintenance of the social order.\n</p><p>The Inquisition ceased to function in practice in 1808, during the <a href=\"/wiki/Peninsular_War\" title=\"Peninsular War\">Spanish War of Independence</a> as it was abolished by the occupying French government, although it remained as an institution until 1834.\n</p><p>\nA school of liberal historians appeared in France and Spain at the start of the 19th century who were the first to talk about Spanish decline. They considered the Inquisition to be responsible for this economic and cultural decline and for all the other evils that afflicted the country. Other European historians took up the theme later on and this position can still be seen today. This school of thought stated that the expulsion of the Jews and the persecution of the conversos had led to the impoverishment and decline of Spain as well as the destruction of the middle class.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> This type of author made <a href=\"/wiki/Men%C3%A9ndez_y_Pelayo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo\">Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo</a> exclaim: </p><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468\"/><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Why is there no industry in Spain?

This anticlericalism formed part of many other ideologies of the left wing, such as socialism, communism and <a href=\"/wiki/Anarchism\" title=\"Anarchism\">anarchism</a>. This is demonstrated by a statement made by the Socialist Member of Parliament Fernando Garrido in April 1869<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> that the Church had used the \"Court of the Inquisition as an instrument for its own ends.

They tend to steam from a lack of awareness of the modern-bourocratic nature of the Spanish Inquisition in a time in which most trials were still left to the judge\u00b4s personal discrection and will. This are the most common:\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trial-Execution_ratio\">Trial-Execution ratio</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Trial-Execution ratio\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"High_Volume_of_Investigations\">High Volume of Investigations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: High Volume of Investigations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Like a modern bureaucratic system, the Inquisitorial tribunal had the obligation to consider and investigate every single case that any cityzen of Spain brough to them, regardless of social level of the acuser or the previous opinion of the tribunal about the veracity of the claim. As a consequence the number of raw cases that the inquisition had to handle and the number of processes it opened was astronomical, even if the actual conviction rate of the Inquisitorial tribunal was really low, of 6% on average. The raw numbers of trials usually include cases of witchcraft or false accusations that were quickly identified as neighbour fabrications and dismissed by the system. For example, the Spanish Inquisition trialed 3687 people for witchcraft from 1560 to 1700, of which only 101 were found guilty. <sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup>. Other estimates of trial-conviction ratio for witchcraft are even lower.\n</p><p>A common mistake in inquisitorial Historiography has been to report the number of trials as number of convictions, or even of executions <sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>. Another common mistake has been to assume that the elevated number of trials indicated an active prosecution and search by the inquisitors instead of cases brought to them, or to assume a high ratio of conviction per trial instead of reading through the entire sentences. The mistake comes from the high trial-conviction ratio in cases of heresy observed in Northern Europe in the same period, where verdict was not based on a system but left to individual discretion <sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multiple_Charges\">Multiple Charges</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Multiple Charges\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Another factor that contributed to the high number of inquisitorial investigations was this same low conviction ratio. Due to its reputation of-relative- impartiality during its first two centuries of existence, Spanish citizens preferred the inquisitorial tribunal to the secular courts and presented their cases to them whenever possible. Those held in secular prisons also did all they could to be transferred ti Inquisitorial prisons, since prisoners of the inquisitions had rights while those of the king did not. As such, defendants accused of civil infractions would blaspheme or self accuse of false conversion to be transferred to the Inquisition courts, which eventually made the Inquisitors elevate a complain to the king<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p><p>Another factor that contributes to inflate the number of trials the inquisition is reported to have conducted, especially regarding witchcraft and fasle conversions, were the groups of acusations that often were investigated together. Acusers tended to throw \"witchcraft\" or other vague acusations into the mix, along with legitimate claims. Those cases in which witchcraft was trialed along with other, serious acusations, are sometime reported as \"trials of witchcraft by the inquisition\". For example <a href=\"/wiki/Eleno_de_C%C3%A9spedes\" title=\"Eleno de C\u00e9spedes\">Eleno de C\u00e9spedes</a> was acused of witchcraft during his trial for \"bigamy\", and is often reported as \"having been trialed for witchcraft by the inquisition\", even if he was taken to court for different reasons, the acusation of witchcraft was thrown in during the trial by one of the court\u00b4s witnesses, recorded as the system demanded, and then promptly dismissed by the court as baseless and absurd.<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Role_of_the_Inquisitor\">Role of the Inquisitor</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Role of the Inquisitor\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In popular culture the Inquisitor is an all, powerful, evil and sadistic entity. Even serious work who didn\u00b4t take the time to investigate the Spanish legal system as a whole tend to make the mistake of attributing him more power in the final verdict than he held. As it has been estated, the Inquisitorial court was a court regulated by a system, not by a person, much like courts work in <a href=\"/wiki/Judiciary_of_France\" title=\"Judiciary of France\">modern European democracies</a>. The inquisition was merely a civil servant, a bureocrat. As such the inquisitor had no power to introduce his own judgment in the trials, he had power only to apply the law. This had its problems, but was more beneficial than not.\n</p><p>A popular example of this can be found in <a href=\"/wiki/Alonso_de_Salazar_Fr%C3%ADas\" title=\"Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas\">Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas</a>\u00b4s intervention in the<a href=\"/wiki/Basque_witch_trials\" title=\"Basque witch trials\">case of the Witches of Zurragamurdi</a>, one of the few cases of witchcraft in Spain that ended in actual execution. During the trial, the Inquisitor Fr\u00edas, whom like most educated Spaniards did not believe in witchcraft, refused to condemn the witches despite their voluntary confessions-no torture was used. He declared that \"These women think that they can turn into ravens, but they are just mentally ill!\" and \" There were no witches in Spain until the French started talking and writing about them\". However, he didn't have the power to arbitrary declare them innocent. The case was taken to the General-Inquisitor in Madrid, who agreed with Fr\u00edas in considering that the women were not witches, just mentally disturbed. However, and even though both men considered that the women were not guilty, they had to be convicted because the neighbors refused to drop the charges and the legal requisites for conviction of any crime-voluntary confession of it combined with unanimous and consistent testimony from a lot of eyes witnesses- had been met. The judges had no right to make an arbitrary decision over the written law.<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>. This shows both the bureocratic and modern nature of the SPanish Inquisition when compared to other European courts, and the limited power the inquisitors themselves held.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Black_Legend_of_the_Spanish_Inquisition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Bibliography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>If there is no indication to the contrary, the contents comes from Kamen and Peters, with the exception of <b>The Enlightenment</b> the majority of which was sourced from Hilton.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Ronald_Hilton\" title=\"Ronald Hilton\">Hilton, Ronald</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&amp;bookid=8\"><i>La l\u00e9gende noire au 18e si\u00e8cle.
