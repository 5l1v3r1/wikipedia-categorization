The Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (新しい歴史教科書をつくる会, Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho o Tsukuru Kai) is a group founded in December 1996  to promote a nationalistic view of the history of Japan. The group was responsible for authoring a history textbook published from Fusōsha (扶桑社), which was heavily criticised by China, South Korea, and many Western historians for not including full accounts of or downplaying Imperial Japanese war crimes during World War II, such as the Nanjing Massacre (南京大虐殺) being euphemistically labelled as "Nanjing Incident" (南京事件) and the policy of utilizing "comfort women" (慰安婦).  The textbook also highlights Japan's claim to the Liancourt Rocks, which Japan calls Takeshima and which South Korea calls Dokdo; as well as the Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in Chinese, which are administered by Japan and claimed by both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan). The Japan Policy Institute (日本政策研究センター, not to be confused with the JPRI based in San Francisco) has published a pamphlet entitled "Questionable points of Chinese and Korean textbooks" (ここがおかしい中国・韓国歴史教科書). The institute accuses neighboring Asian nations' textbooks of containing anti-Japanese propaganda, and encouraged people to compare the textbooks. The textbook, published as a trade book in Japan in June 2001, sold six hundred thousand copies by June 2004.  Despite commercial success, the book was taken up by only a handful of schools, most of which are privately run and located in a comparatively small geographic area of Tokyo.  Translated by Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform.  In 1997, Shinzō Abe led the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, and founded the Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About the Outlook of Japan and History Education.
