Renegade Tribune is an anti-Semitic, white separatist, holocaust denying, historical revisionist , white nationalist , and neo-Nazi  website established in 2012 by Kyle Hunt. The website, which is part of a larger brand known as Renegade Broadcasting, primarily focuses on white separatism and antisemitism . In addition to white separatist and anti-Semitic ideology being posted on the website, it also offers content based on volkisch paganism and harsh criticism of other pagans for "wanting to ruin their bloodlines". In March of 2018, Christine Shawcroft, who just became the chairwoman of the Labour Party disputes panel not even three months prior to the event, was found to be defending Alan Bull, a candidate who posted a link to a Renegade Tribune article along with a Facebook post that said, "International Red Cross report confirms the Holocaust of six million Jews is a hoax". As a response to the incident, Renegade Tribune made an article called "UK Labour Candidate Shared Holohoax Article from Renegade Tribune, Suspended by Party".
