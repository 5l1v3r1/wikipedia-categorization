Golden Age of Russian Poetry is the name traditionally applied by philologists to the first half of the 19th century.  It is also called the Age of Pushkin, after its most significant poet (in Nabokov's words, the greatest poet this world was blessed with since the time of Shakespeare ). Mikhail Lermontov and Fyodor Tyutchev are generally regarded as two most important Romantic poets after Pushkin.  Vasily Zhukovsky and Konstantin Batyushkov are the best regarded of his precursors. Pushkin himself, however, considered Evgeny Baratynsky to be the finest poet of his day.  Vasily Zhukovsky Alexander Pushkin Evgeny Baratynsky Mikhail Lermontov
