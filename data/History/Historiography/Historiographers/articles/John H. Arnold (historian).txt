Arnold specialises in the study of medieval religious culture, saying that while he has never been a believer in any religion, 'belief' has always fascinated him. In his work he asks "Why do people believe the things they believe? What does 'believing' really mean in practice?"  Arnold has also written widely about historiography. In 2008 he wrote a policy paper, Why history matters - and why medieval history also matters, for History & Policy.
