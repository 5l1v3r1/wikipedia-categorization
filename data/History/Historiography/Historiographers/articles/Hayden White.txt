Hayden White (July 12, 1928 â€“ March 5, 2018) was an American historian in the tradition of literary criticism, perhaps most famous for his work Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe (1973/2014). He claimed that the manifest historical text[jargon] is marked by strategies of explanation, which include explanation by argument, explanation by emplotment, and explanation by ideological implication.  He argued that historical writing was influenced by literary writing in many ways, sharing the strong reliance on narrative for meaning, therefore eliminating the possibility of objective or truly scientific history.  White also argued, however, that history is most successful when it uses this "narrativity", since it is what allows history to be meaningful.  He ended his career as University Professor Emeritus  at the history of consciousness department of the University of California, Santa Cruz, having previously retired from the comparative literature department of Stanford University. White received his B.A. from Wayne State University (1951) and his M.A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1955) degrees from the University of Michigan. While an undergraduate at Wayne State, White studied history under William J. Bossenbrook alongside then-classmate Arthur Danto.  In 1998, White directed a seminar ("The Theory of the Text") at the School of Criticism and Theory.  White figured prominently in a landmark California Supreme Court case regarding covert intelligence gathering on college campuses by police officers in the Los Angeles Police Department.  White v. Davis, 13 Cal.3d 757, 533 P.2d 222, 120 Cal. Rptr. 94 (1975).  During 1972, while a professor of history at UCLA and acting as sole plaintiff, White sued Chief of Police Edward M. Davis, alleging the illegal expenditure of public funds in connection with covert intelligence gathering by police at UCLA.  The covert activities included police officers registering as students, taking notes of discussions occurring in classes, and making police reports on these discussions.  White v. Davis, at 762.  The Supreme Court found for White in a unanimous decision.  This case set the standard that determines the limits of legal police surveillance of political activity in California; police cannot engage in such surveillance in the absence of reasonable suspicion of a crime ("Lockyer Manual").
