  Georg G. Iggers (December 7, 1926 – November 26, 2017) was an American historian of modern Europe, historiography, and European intellectual history.  Iggers was born in Hamburg, Germany, in 1926. Being a German Jew he fled Germany with his family to the US in 1938, only few weeks before the Kristallnacht.  Iggers belonged to the young émigrés from the Third Reich who later in life, as academic scholars in the United States, had a decisive impact on reviewing critically the history of Germany.  He was Distinguished Professor Emeritus at University of Buffalo and 2007 recipient of the First Class Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Iggers received the Humboldt Prize, honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Richmond, Technische Universität Darmstadt, and Philander Smith College, and fellowships from the American Philosophical Society, Fulbright Foundation, Guggenheim Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Rockefeller Foundation.  He was especially noted for his writings on historiography. He died on November 26, 2017, of complications from a cerebral hemorrhage.   Autobiography Monographies
