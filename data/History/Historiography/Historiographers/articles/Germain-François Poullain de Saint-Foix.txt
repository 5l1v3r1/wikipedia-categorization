Germain-François Poullain de Saint-Foix (5 February 1698 – 25 August 1776) was an 18th-century French writer and playwright. He served with the musketeers until he was 36, distinguishing himself at Guastalla in 1734.  He then left the army and purchased a post as "maître des eaux et forêts" in Rennes.  He published his first comedy, Pandore, in 1721 and from 1740 devoted himself entirely to writing, setting up in Paris and becoming a fashionable author there.  He wrote 20 comedies in all. In 1764 he was made historian of the ordre du Saint-Esprit. The jurist Auguste-Marie Poullain-Duparc was his brother.
