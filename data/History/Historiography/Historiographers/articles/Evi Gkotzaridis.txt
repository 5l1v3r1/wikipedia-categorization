  Universities:NUIM, IrelandEUI, Florence Trials of Irish History  Evi Gkotzaridis is a European historian whose work focuses on 20th century Irish and Greek history.  Her critically acclaimed         book Trials of Irish History gave the first detailed analysis of the revisionist debate in Ireland.   She has also authored a book called A Pacifist's Life and Death, the first historical biography detailing the life, time and achievements of Grigorios Lambrakis. Lambrakis was an athletic champion, doctor, politician and Greece’s most committed defender of democracy and peace. He was mortally struck on the head with a club by Right-wing 'parastate' individuals, shortly after he had delivered the keynote speech at an anti-war meeting in Salonica, on 22 May 1963.   Scholarly reviews of Trials of Irish History were positive overall with occasional criticism of her writing style.  Matthew Kelly described her book as "underpinned by a remarkable historical intelligence".  Bill Kissane of the London School of Economics said the book "defends the revisionists".  Brian Girvin of the University of Glasgow wrote that it was a "stimulating book on the Irish revisionist debate."  David Fitzpatrick of Trinity College in Dublin described it as "quirky" but was "an exceptionally lively, generous, intelligent, wide-ranging and well-informed tribute to a much maligned but formidable lineage of historians."  Martyn Powell described it as "anti-nationalistic" in tone.
