Jean Puget de la Serre (15 November 1594 – July 1665) was a French author and dramatist. Puget de la Serre was born in Toulouse in late 1594.  He was the author of more than a hundred works. He further authored several ballets which were performed in Brussels where he was part of the court of the exiled French Queen Mother, Marie de Medicis, between 1628 and 1635. He also wrote a number of plays. Puget de la Serre returned to France some time before the death of Marie de Medicis in 1639 and was fortunate enough to be received favourably by King Louis XIII of France and the Cardinal de Richelieu, who granted him a pension of 2000 écus. Puget may have owed his good fortune to the influence of his cousin, Pierre Puget de Montauron, a leading financier of the day.  He was appointed librarian in the household of Gaston, Duke of Orléans and in 1647 became almoner to Gaston's daughter, Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans (usually known as la Grande Mademoiselle). He died at Paris in 1665.
