Albert Herrmann (20 January 1886 – 19 April 1945) was a German archaeologist and geographer. His specialty was the geography of the ancient Mediterranean and Chinese geography. He also published a number of works theorizing on the location of Atlantis. The son of Konrad Herrmann (1844-1910), Albert studied at the universities of Göttingen and Berlin. He took his doctor's degree under H. Wagner, studying the course of the Silk Road. He furthered his studies at the Berlin's Oriental Institute, earning the Diploma of Oriental Languages in 1915.  He became a member of the Geographical Society of Berlin and the German Oriental Society. In 1923 he obtained a Chair of Historical Geography at the University of Berlin. Besides his fundamental research in the field of Chinese Geography, his most famous work is Historical and commercial Atlas of China (1935), which was in use worldwide. He died on 19 April 1945, due to wounds received during an air bombardment of the railway station in Pilsen. Herrmann was a believer in Paul Borchardt's Atlantis theories, believing Atlantis to have been located in Tunisia. Due to his position within the Nazi Party, he theories carried considerable weight in the German press.   In 1925 he received funding for an expedition to Tunisia. Believing he had found evidence for the site of Atlantis in the village of Rhelissia, he theorised that Plato's descriptions of the lost city had been incorrect, and argued that it had in fact existed as recently as the 14th century BCE.  Herrmann went on to extrapolate that Atlantis was in fact a colony of Frisland, and that civilisation was therefore Frisian in origin.
