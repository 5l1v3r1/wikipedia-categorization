Lamberto Tassinari (born 1945) is a writer and editor best known for his book John Florio: The Man Who Was Shakespeare. He is one of the founders of the transcultural magazine ViceVersa (not to be confused with a 1948 magazine of the same name), which he directed until its last issue in December 1996. Tassinari is one of the four writers to propose John Florio or Michelangelo Florio, among those who contested the paternity of Shakespeare's work.  Lamberto Tassinari was born in Castelfiorentino, Italy on February 28, 1945. He spent his childhood on the island of Elba.  After obtaining a degree in Philosophy from the University of Florence, he lived in Rome, Milan and Turin where he worked as a teacher and in several publishing companies.  He moved to Montreal and became a resident in 1981.  Two years later he founded, along with three other writers, the transcultural magazine ViceVersa which he directed until its last issue in December 1996.  ViceVersa was a quarterly which published articles in the original language (French, English, Italian and Spanish) without any translation in the Eighties and Nineties. Tassinari participated, as editor-in-chief, to many symposiums and international events: the forum L'État des Revues at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, 1987; the symposium Città Nuova, Nuova Città at the 31st Festival dei Popoli in Florence, 1990; and the symposium Pluralism and Literature at Carleton University, Ottawa, in 1990.  He took part in the CISQ International Seminar Le Projet transculturel de ViceVersa in Rome and the Concordia University’s Conference La Transculture et ViceVersa, Montreal, 2007.  Between 1982 and 2007, he taught Italian language and literature at the University of Montreal.  He is currently at work on his second novel and on a production of The Tempest to be staged in Naples or on the island of Vulcano in the Aeolian Archipelago off Sicily.
