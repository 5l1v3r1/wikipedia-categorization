The Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau ("Secret Files of Henri Lobineau"), supposedly compiled by Philippe Toscan du Plantier, is a 27-page document which was deposited in the Bibliothèque nationale de France on 27 April 1967. The document purports to represent a part of the history of the Priory of Sion, and is widely considered to be a forgery created by Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Chérisey. Thirteen of the 27 pages of the document are taken from another document attributed to "Henri Lobineau" dating from 1964, also thought to have been authored by Plantard, called Généalogie des Rois Mérovingiens  ("Genealogy of the Merovingian Kings"). This document contains genealogy diagrams which apparently show Plantard to be a descendant of the Merovingian king Dagobert II.  Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau comprises the following material (along with the 13 pages taken from Généalogie des Rois Mérovingiens): The documents were used as source material by Henry Lincoln (who appeared to be unaware that they were disputed as forgeries) for a series of BBC Two documentaries in the 1970s. Lincoln and two co-authors, Richard Leigh and Michael Baigent, again used the Dossiers Secrets as source material for the controversial 1982 publication of Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Elements of this work were later used by Dan Brown as sources for his successful novel The Da Vinci Code.
