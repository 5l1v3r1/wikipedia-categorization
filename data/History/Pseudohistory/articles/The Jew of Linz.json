That boy in the top-right corner is undisputedly Hitler (see above right). Cornish alleges that Wittgenstein is the boy on the bottom left; he says the <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_Police\" title=\"Victoria Police\">Victoria Police</a> photographic evidence unit in Australia examined the photograph and confirmed that it was \"highly probable\" the boy is Wittgenstein.

Cornish's thesis is not only that Hitler knew the young Wittgenstein, but that he hated him, and that Wittgenstein was specifically the one Jewish boy from his school days referred to in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mein_Kampf\" title=\"Mein Kampf\">Mein Kampf</a></i>. The last claim referred to the following quote:\n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Likewise at school I found no occasion which could have led me to change this inherited picture.

It should be noted that Wittgenstein did have three Jewish grandparents but Wittgenstein himself, and his mother and father, were Roman Catholics.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Cambridge_Five\">The Cambridge Five</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Jew_of_Linz&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Cambridge Five\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Cornish also argues that Wittgenstein is the most likely suspect as recruiter of the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_Five\" title=\"Cambridge Five\">Cambridge Five</a>\" spy ring.  The author suggests that Wittgenstein was responsible for British <a href=\"/wiki/Decryption\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Decryption\">decryption</a> technology for the German <a href=\"/wiki/Enigma_machine\" title=\"Enigma machine\">Enigma</a> code reaching the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Army\" title=\"Red Army\">Red Army</a> and that he thereby enabled the Red Army victories on the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)\" title=\"Eastern Front (World War II)\">Eastern Front</a> that liberated the camps and ultimately overthrew the Reich.\n</p><p>He writes that the Soviet government offered Wittgenstein the chair in philosophy at what had been Lenin's university (<a href=\"/wiki/Kazan_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kazan University\">Kazan</a>) at a time (during the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Purge\" title=\"Great Purge\">Great Purge</a>) when ideological conformity was at a premium amongst Soviet academics and enforced by the very harshest penalties. Wittgenstein wanted to emigrate to Russia, first in the twenties, as he wrote in a letter to <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Engelmann\" title=\"Paul Engelmann\">Paul Engelmann</a>, and again in the thirties, either to work as a labourer or as a philosophy lecturer. Cornish argues that given the nature of the Soviet regime, the possibility that a non-Marxist philosopher (or even one over whom the government could exert no ideological control) would be offered such a post, is unlikely in the extreme.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"No-ownership_theory_of_mind\">No-ownership theory of mind</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Jew_of_Linz&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: No-ownership theory of mind\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Other sections of the book deal with Cornish's theories about what he claims are the common roots of Wittgenstein's and Hitler's philosophies in mysticism, magic, and the \"no-ownership\" theory of mind. Cornish sees this as Wittgenstein's generalisation of <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer\" title=\"Arthur Schopenhauer\">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>'s account of the Unity of the Will, in which despite appearances, there is only a single Will acting through the bodies of all creatures. This doctrine, generalized to other mental faculties such as thinking, is presented in <a href=\"/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson\" title=\"Ralph Waldo Emerson\">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>'s \"Essays\". The doctrine, writes Cornish, was also held by the Oxford philosopher <a href=\"/wiki/R._G._Collingwood\" title=\"R. G. Collingwood\">R. G. Collingwood</a> who was one of Wittgenstein's electors to his Cambridge chair. Cornish tries to tie this to Wittgenstein's arguments against the idea of \"mental privacy\" and in conclusion says \"I have attempted to locate the source of the <a href=\"/wiki/Holocaust\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holocaust\">Holocaust</a> in a perversion of early Aryan religious doctrines about the ultimate nature of man\". Cornish also suggests that Hitler's oratorical powers in addressing the group mind of crowds and Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and denial of mental privacy, are the practical and theoretical consequences of this doctrine.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reception\">Reception</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Jew_of_Linz&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Reception\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The  book proved controversial, with reviewers criticizing it for drawing unwarranted connections between disparate events. The main criticisms were that:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Cornish's evidence is contentious.</li>\n<li>Hitler and Wittgenstein did attend the same school at the same time, but there is little evidence that they knew each other.</li>\n<li>There is no evidence that there was a personal antagonism between them, or that Hitler's dislike of Wittgenstein shaped the course of Nazi anti-Semitism.</li>\n<li>Despite the wealth of material which has emerged from the archives of the <a href=\"/wiki/KGB\" title=\"KGB\">KGB</a> since the collapse of the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>, there is no evidence that Wittgenstein was amongst the higher-level Soviet spies in the UK, or that he was a Soviet agent, or that he had pro-Soviet sympathies at all.</li>\n<li>Cornish misrepresents Wittgenstein's thought and his philosophical context, or simply does not understand him.</li></ol>\n<p>One of the main issues of contention is the claim that Wittgenstein triggered or substantially contributed to Hitler's antisemitism while they were at school together. It is a view that has some support. British professor Laurence Goldstein, in his <i>Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and His Relevance to Modern Thought</i> (1999), called Cornish's book important, writing: \"For one thing, at the K.u.k. Realschule in Linz, Wittgenstein met Hitler and may have inspired in him a hatred of Jews which led, ultimately, to the Holocaust. This, naturally enough, weighed heavily on Wittgenstein's conscience in his later years ... It is overwhelmingly probable that Hitler and Wittgenstein did meet, and with dire consequences for the history of the world.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Reviewing Goldstein's own book, Mary McGinn called it a sloppy and irresponsible argument: \" [O]ne is amazed at the sheer looseness of thought that allows him to assert that 'at certain points in <i>Mein Kampf</i> where Hitler seems to be raging against Jews in general it is the individual young Ludwig Wittgenstein whom he has in mind', and to suggest that Wittgenstein 'may have inspired \u2026 (the) hatred of Jews which led, ultimately, to the Holocaust'. It is exactly this sort of sloppy, irresponsible, 'plausible' style of thought that Wittgenstein's philosophy, by its careful attention to the particular and to not saying more or less than is warranted, is directed against.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selected_reviews\">Selected reviews</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Jew_of_Linz&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Selected reviews\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Ray_Monk\" title=\"Ray Monk\">Ray Monk</a>, one of Wittgenstein's biographers, concentrates on the inconsistencies in Cornish's theory that Wittgenstein was the head of the Cambridge spy ring, asking why Cornish has apparently not bothered to verify any of his theories by checking the <a href=\"/wiki/KGB\" title=\"KGB\">KGB</a> archives.  Ultimately, Monk says \"As I read <i>The Jew of Linz</i>, I found myself wondering how on earth Cornish had confected so strange a piece of work. I found it by turns puzzling, funny, challenging and outrageously nutty... Cornish calls his book 'pioneer detective work', but I think it is really pioneer detective fiction.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Daniel_Johnson_(journalist)\" title=\"Daniel Johnson (journalist)\">Daniel Johnson</a> viewed <i>The Jew of Linz</i> as a \"revisionist tract masquerading as psycho-history\". He wrote, \"Cornish correctly identifies 'the twist of the investigation' as the thesis that 'Nazi <a href=\"/wiki/Metaphysics\" title=\"Metaphysics\">metaphysics</a>, as discernible in Hitler's writings... is nothing but Wittgenstein's theory of the mind modified so as to exclude the race of its inventor'. So the <i>Jew of Linz</i> was indirectly responsible, at least in part, for the Holocaust. Cornish tries to deflect the implications of his argument thus: 'Whatever 'the Jews' may have done, nothing humanly justifies what was done to them.' But he then offers 'a thought that might occur to a <a href=\"/wiki/Hassidic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hassidic\">Hassidic</a> Jew, and that is more fittingly a matter for Jewish, as opposed to gentile, reflection: the very engine that drove Hitler's acquisition of the magical powers that made his ascent and the Holocaust possible was the Wittgenstein <a href=\"/wiki/Covenant_(biblical)\" title=\"Covenant (biblical)\">Covenant</a> violation'. At this point, the nonsensical shades into the downright sinister.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Nicci_French\" title=\"Nicci French\">Sean French</a> wrote in the <i>New Statesman</i>: \"There is something heroic about this argument and it would be a good subject for a novel about the dangers of creating theories out of nothing. <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov\" title=\"Vladimir Nabokov\">Vladimir Nabokov</a> should have written it. It is not just that there are weak links in the theory. There are no links in the theory. No evidence that Hitler, in his final unhappy year, even knew a boy two years above him. If they did know each other, there is no evidence that he was the boy Hitler distrusted, no evidence that Hitler's remarks on snitching related to specific incidents at the Linz Realschule, no evidence that Wittgenstein informed on his fellow pupils.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> In the same journal, <a href=\"/wiki/Roz_Kaveney\" title=\"Roz Kaveney\">Roz Kaveney</a> calls it \"a stupid and dishonest book\", and says \"[Cornish's] intention is to claim Wittgenstein for his own brand of contemplative mysticism, which he defines as the great insight that IndoEuropeans (or, as he unregenerately terms them, Aryans) brought to Hinduism and Buddhism.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Antony_Flew\" title=\"Antony Flew\">Antony Flew</a> offers a mixed review: \"Mr Cornish contends that the reason why the government of the USSR treated Wittgenstein with such peculiar generosity was that he had been the recruiter of all the Cambridge spies. The question whether or not this hypothesis is true or false can be definitively settled only if and when the relevant Soviet archives are examined. But I am myself as confident as without such knock-down decisive verification it is possible to be that Mr Cornish is right. On the other hand, 'On the very first page of Part III, Mr Cornish explains that the essence of this doctrine was expressed by Emerson in his restatement of the original Aryan doctrine of consciousness: '\u2026 the act of seeing and the thing seen, the see-er and the spectacle, the subject and the object is one'. I confess, not very shamefacedly, that confronted with such doctrines I want to quote Groucho Marx: 'It appears absurd. But don't be misled. It is absurd.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>German historian <i>Michael Rissmann</i> argues that Cornish overestimates Hitler's intellectual capacities and uses fraudulent talks <a href=\"/wiki/Hermann_Rauschning\" title=\"Hermann Rauschning\">Hermann Rauschning</a> claims to have had with Hitler to prove Hitler's alleged occultist interest.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> In <i>Philosophy Now</i>, John Mann argues that the contentions that so riled up the book's many critics were simply a clever ruse by Cornish designed to attract more readers. Mann writes: \"Cornish is clever enough to know if he wrote a book on his 'no ownership' theory of language it would not have a wide readership. If he says this 'no ownership' theory was taught by Wittgenstein, learned and twisted for his own ends by Hitler, and actually needs Cornish to explain it all in great detail for the rest of the book he has the book reviewed in every paper and even serialised in the Sunday Times. ... If you\u2019re looking for a book which offers history, politics, magic and philosophy, try <i>The Jew of Linz</i>.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A review by Kathrin Chod in the <i>Berliner Lesezeichen</i> reels off, with an increasingly weary air of stunned sarcasm, the conjectures put forward by Cornish. At the end, the reviewer refrains from delivering a coup de grace or even a conclusion, trusting the reader to supply one themselves in light of what has been shown.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
