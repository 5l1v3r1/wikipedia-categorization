Many significant locations, cultures/groups, and objects throughout history have been lost, inspiring archaeologists and treasure-hunters around the world to search for them.   The existence of some of these places or items, particularly those from ancient history, is legendary and remains in doubt.   Excluded from these lists are lost worksâ€”literary, historical, or mythological writings which have no current complete copies but are referenced by their contemporaries.
