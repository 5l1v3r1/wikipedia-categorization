The Viking Altar Rock in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, is a glacial erratic  and a local landmark. The boulder was found in 1943 and is roughly 8.2 m (27 ft) long by 5.2 m (17 ft) wide.  It has four roughly triangular holes about 1 meter above the base.  The rock is promoted as an attraction as part of a "Trail of the Vikings" featuring supposed evidence of Viking exploration of Minnesota.  This is however conjecture.  The "altar" was rededicated in August 1975 with an ecumenical celebration of Mass.
