Hidden Worlds: Fresh Clues to the Past is a 1974 book, by M. Van Der Veer and P. Moerman, that describes the existence of a previously unidentified ancient civilization   that was subsequently destroyed by a natural disaster.  Hidden Worlds: Fresh Clues to the Past is a rejection of Von Daniken's theories;       however, Der Veer and P.Moerman concede the existence of Atlantis.     The book contests orthodox history, claiming international settlement  in the Americas prior to European colonization of the region by Christopher Columbus in 1492.    Until 1974, M. Van Der Veer and P. Moerman were both painters, neither holding academic-level scientific qualifications or credentials; subsequently, reviewers criticized their work as pseudoarchaeology.
