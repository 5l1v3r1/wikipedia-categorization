George B. McMullen was an intuitive archaeologist and forensic remote viewer who claims that he has the ability  to use paranormal psychic abilities to use objects to tune into scenes from the past. He claims that he has his strong extrasensory perception to locate ancient sites for archaeological digs, or describe context of artifacts. Scientific archaeologists tested his claims which revealed to be extreme accurated.  The author is deeply indebted to Dr. J. Norman Emerson of the University of Toronto for his instruction and inspiration over a number of years; and especially to Dr. Emerson and his collaborator Mr. George McMullen for their experiments in intuitive archaeology at the Boys site which led to the discovery of the palisade and of the second house structure. (THE BOYS SITE: A PICKERING BRANCH VILLAGES IN ONTARIO COUNTY, p. iv-v) McMullen is the author of One White Crow which was published in 1995 and describes his long life experience as intuitive archaeologist. McMullen is also the author of Running Bear published in 1996, Two Faces published in 1997, and Born Many Times published in 1999. He died on June 4, 2008.
