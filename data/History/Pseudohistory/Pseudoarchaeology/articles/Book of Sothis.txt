The Book of Sothis is a document known mainly by transmission by George Syncellus  (died after AD 810), purporting to have been written by the historian Manethon (who lived during the early 3rd century BCE).  Modern scholars are nearly unanimous that the book was in fact written by someone other than Manethon, considering it a forgery written before the fifth century.  Its contents are consequently regarded as being of little value to Egyptology, although a classic of pseudepigraphy.  While the unknown author is considered to have displayed a thorough knowledge of Manethon, the best indication of forgery is the introductory dedication to Ptolemy II Philadelphus, referring to him as "σεβαστῷ" (sebastōi) — i.e. "august" or Augustus, a Roman title that was not used until centuries after Manethon's death. Syncellus states that Manethon included information from monuments in "the Siriadic land" (variously conjectured to be Assyria, Arabia or Egypt), that had been engraved before the Deluge, but afterward had been translated and stored in hieroglyphic books in Egyptian temples.
