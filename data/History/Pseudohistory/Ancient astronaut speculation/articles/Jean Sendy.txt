Jean Sendy (1910-1978)  was a French writer and translator, author of works on esoterica and UFO phenomena. He was also an early proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis.  He wrote the 1968 book The moon: The key to the Bible in which he claimed the word "Elohim" mentioned in the Hebrew Genesis of the Bible, which is usually translated as God, should in fact be translated in the plural as "Gods" because the singular of the word Elohim is Eloah  . He claimed that the "Gods" were actually space travelers (an alien race of humanoids). Sendy believed that Genesis was factual history of ancient astronauts colonizing earth who became "angels in human memory". The book contains similar ideas to that of the UFO religion RaÃ«lism.    In his 1969 book Those Gods who made Heaven and Earth, Sendy claimed that space travelers 23,500 years ago arrived in the solar system in a large hollow sphere and seeded humanity.
