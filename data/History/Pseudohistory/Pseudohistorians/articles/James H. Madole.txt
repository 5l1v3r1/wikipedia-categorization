James Hartung Madole (July 7, 1927 â€“ May 6, 1979) was a prominent fascist and leader of the National Renaissance Party in the United States. He is now recognized as a pivotal figure in the development of post-war occult-fascism.  Madole founded the National Renaissance Party in New York City in 1948. It ended in 1981, with the death of Madole's mother, Grace Hartung Madole. Madole was influenced by Aryanism and Hinduism. He wrote that the Aryan race was of great antiquity and had been worshipped worldwide by lower races as "White Gods". Madole also wrote that the Aryans originated in the Garden of Eden located in North America.  He also believed that America was the "new Atlantis" and "the cradle of a new God like race".
