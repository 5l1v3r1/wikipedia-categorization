Estotiland is a region that appeared on the Zeno map, located where Labrador, Quebec, and Newfoundland are now situated on nautical charts. According to the letters that accompanied the Zeno map, Estotiland was discovered by fishermen who sailed in the North Atlantic during the 14th century. Zeno, in a report addressed to his brother, writes: the fishing vessel "Frise" was blown westward by a storm, and arrived at a land named "Estotiland," whose inhabitants traded with "Engroenelandt." This country, "Estotiland," was very fertile, and had mountains inland. The king of this country possessed books written in Latin, which he did not understand. The language that he spoke and his subjects shared no similarity to that of the Vikings. The king of Estotiland, seeing that his guests sailed safely with the aid of an instrument (the compass), persuaded them to make a maritime expedition to another land to the south called "Drogeo."  A number of historians have considered this map and these letters to be fakes since the 16th century. Nonetheless, a map created by French cartographer Nicolas Sanson around 1660 testifies to the existence of Estotiland and to its location north of New France. Several hypotheses have been put forward pertaining to the origin of the word Estotiland.
