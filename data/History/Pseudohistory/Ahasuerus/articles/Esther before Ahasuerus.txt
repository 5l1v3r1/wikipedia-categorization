Esther before Ahasuerus is a 1546-47 painting by Tintoretto showing a scene from the Book of Esther. It is recorded in the inventory of the collection of Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua in 1627 as hanging alongside The Muses in a passage in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua. It was acquired from the Gonzagas by Charles I of Great Britain. On his execution it was valued at Â£120 and sold, before being reacquired by the royal family on the Restoration. It now hangs in Kensington Palace.
