To give Bermuda much-needed food in exchange for the powder, Congress resolved on July 15, 1775 to permit the exchange of food for guns and gunpowder brought by any vessel to an American port. On the night of August 14, 1775, two American ships kept a rendezvous with Colonel Tucker's men off the coast of Bermuda, and sent a raiding party ashore. An American sailor was lowered into the arsenal through an opening in the roof, and opened the doors. The barrels of gunpowder were rolled to waiting Bermudian <a href=\"/wiki/Whaleboat\" title=\"Whaleboat\">whaleboats</a> and transported to the American ships. Twelve days later half of the powder was delivered to Philadelphia and half to American forces at <a href=\"/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina\" title=\"Charleston, South Carolina\">Charleston</a>.  America's second covert action effort ended in failure. General Washington, hearing independently of the Bermuda powder, dispatched ships to purchase or seize it. Lacking a centralized intelligence authority, he was unaware of the previous success; when Washington's ships arrived in Bermuda in October 1775, the gunpowder had been gone for two months and British ships patrolled Bermuda waters.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada\">Canada</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Intelligence_operations_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Canada\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>On the basis of information received by the Secret Correspondence Committee, on February 15, 1776 Congress authorized a covert action plan to urge the Canadians to become a \"sister colony\" in the struggle against the British.

Sometime after his arrival in Paris, Silas Deane was visited by a young man named <a href=\"/wiki/John_the_Painter\" title=\"John the Painter\">James Aitken</a>, recently returned from America. Aitken produced crudely drawn but accurate plans of the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Navy_Dockyards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Royal Navy Dockyards\">Royal Navy Dockyards</a> in England and proposed to sabotage them by utilizing a unique <a href=\"/wiki/Incendiary_device\" title=\"Incendiary device\">incendiary device</a> of his own design. Deane engaged his services and issued Aitken a passport signed by French Foreign Minister Vergennes with instructions to French officials: \"We will and command you very expressly to let pass safely and freely, Mr. James Actzen, going to England, without giving him or suffering him any hindrance; but on the contrary giving every aid and assistance that he shall want or occasion for.\" In late November 1776, Aitken landed at <a href=\"/wiki/Dover\" title=\"Dover\">Dover</a>, and on December 7 he ignited a fire at the <a href=\"/wiki/Portsmouth\" title=\"Portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a> dockyard that burned from late in the afternoon until the following morning, destroying twenty tons of <a href=\"/wiki/Hemp\" title=\"Hemp\">hemp</a>, ten one-hundred-<a href=\"/wiki/Fathom\" title=\"Fathom\">fathom</a> (183 m) <a href=\"/wiki/Wire_rope\" title=\"Wire rope\">cables</a>, and six tons of ship <a href=\"/wiki/Rope\" title=\"Rope\">cordage</a>. After failing to penetrate the security at <a href=\"/wiki/Plymouth\" title=\"Plymouth\">Plymouth</a>, Aitken proceeded to <a href=\"/wiki/Bristol\" title=\"Bristol\">Bristol</a>, where he destroyed two <a href=\"/wiki/Warehouse\" title=\"Warehouse\">warehouses</a> and several <a href=\"/wiki/House\" title=\"House\">houses</a>. On January 16, 1777, the British cabinet met in emergency session and urged immediate measures to locate the mysterious \"John the <a href=\"/wiki/Painting\" title=\"Painting\">Painter</a>\" (Aitken was a house painter). Guards were augmented at all military facilities and arsenals, and a reward was posted. By January 20 the cabinet, again in extraordinary session, discussed suspending <a href=\"/wiki/Habeas_corpus\" title=\"Habeas corpus\">habeas corpus</a> and placing the country under <a href=\"/wiki/Martial_law\" title=\"Martial law\">martial law</a>. Five days later the reward was increased to one thousand pounds, and newspapers reported panic throughout England. Aitken was soon apprehended, with a pistol and <a href=\"/wiki/Explosive\" title=\"Explosive\">inflammables</a> in his possession. He would not admit to the sabotage when <a href=\"/wiki/Interrogation\" title=\"Interrogation\">interrogated</a>, but eventually confided in a friendly American visitor who was secretly in the pay of the British. Based on these confidences, personal effects, including the passport from Vergennes, were located. His trial was speedy, and on March 10, 1777, Aitken went to the <a href=\"/wiki/Gallows\" title=\"Gallows\">gallows</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Portsmouth_Dockyard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Portsmouth Dockyard\">Portsmouth Dockyard</a>, where his exploits had begun.\n</p><p>His actions may have resulted in \"<a href=\"/wiki/Arson_in_royal_dockyards\" title=\"Arson in royal dockyards\">arson in the Royal dockyards</a> in the time of <a href=\"/wiki/War\" title=\"War\">war</a>\" being added to the list of <a href=\"/wiki/Capital_crime\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Capital crime\">capital crimes</a> in England, which was one of the last to be repealed.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Counterintelligence\">Counterintelligence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Intelligence_operations_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Counterintelligence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Probably the first organization under the <a href=\"/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation\" title=\"Articles of Confederation\">Articles of Confederation</a> created for counterintelligence purposes was the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Committee_for_Detecting_and_Defeating_Conspiracies&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies (page does not exist)\">Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies</a>, later the Commission. It was made up of a series of groups established in New York between June 1776 and January 1778 to collect intelligence, apprehend British spies and couriers, and examine suspected British sympathizers.

Crosby, a veteran of the Continental Army, had been mistaken by a Westchester County Loyalist as being someone who shared his views. He confided to Crosby that a secret enemy military company was being formed and introduced him to the group. Crosby reported the plot to the Committee and was taken with the group. He managed to \"escape\" and, as directed, infiltrated another secret Tory unit. This unit, including Crosby, was also taken and escaped once more. He repeated the operation at least two more times, before the loyalists started to get wise to his \"escaping\" and he retired.

Posing as a deserter, Gray entered the service of Colonel Beverly Robinson, a Tory intelligence officer, and became Robinson's courier. As a result, the contents of each of Robinson's dispatches were read by the Americans before their delivery. Gray eventually became the courier for Major <a href=\"/wiki/Oliver_DeLancey,_Jr.\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oliver DeLancey, Jr.\">Oliver DeLancey, Jr.</a>, the head of the British secret service in New York. For two years, Gray, as DeLancey's courier to Canada, successfully penetrated the principal communications link of the British <a href=\"/wiki/Secret_service\" title=\"Secret service\">secret service</a>. Upon completing his assignment, Gray returned to the ranks of the Continental Army and his name was struck from the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Deserter_list&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Deserter list (page does not exist)\">deserter list</a>, where it had been placed at the beginning of the operation.\n</p><p>Colonel <a href=\"/wiki/Benjamin_Tallmadge\" title=\"Benjamin Tallmadge\">Benjamin Tallmadge</a>, a senior intelligence officer under Washington, played a key role in the capture of Major <a href=\"/wiki/John_Andr%C3%A9\" title=\"John Andr\u00e9\">John Andr\u00e9</a>, who preceded DeLancey as chief of the British secret service in New York. Although he declined to discuss the episode in his memoirs, it is said that one of Tallmadge's agents had reported to him that Major Andr\u00e9 was in contact with a \"John Anderson\" who was expecting the surrender of a major installation. Learning that a certain John Anderson had been captured by three Militiamen, Tallmadge hurried to the post where Andr\u00e9 was being held. John Paulding, Isaac Van Wert and David Williams had been on sentry trying to catch loyalist \"Cow-Boys\" that had been preying on people in Westchester County, New York. Andr\u00e9 mistakenly assumed that the men were aligned with the British and declared himself to be a British officer. Then upon realizing the mistake tried to use a pass provided by Arnold. They searched Andr\u00e9 and found papers hidden in his socks. Paulding understood the papers revealed \"Anderson\" to be a spy, and stated that no amount of money would be enough to let Andr\u00e9 go.  As Tallmadge arrived to the post, he found that the acting Post Commander had sent Andr\u00e9, under guard, back to General Arnold. After extensive and animated lobbying by Tallmadge, the commander, Jamieson, ordered that \"Anderson\"  be returned for interrogation. \"Anderson\" admitted to his true identity (that he was Andr\u00e9) and was tried, convicted, and executed as a spy. Arnold, learning that Andr\u00e9 had been taken and that his own treachery was no doubt was exposed, fled West Point before he could be captured, and joined the British forces.\n</p><p>General Washington demanded effective counterintelligence work from his subordinates. On March 24, 1776, for example, he wrote: \"There is one evil I dread, and that is, their spies. I could wish, therefore, the most attentive watch be kept... I wish a dozen or more of honest, sensible and diligent men, were employed... in order to question, <a href=\"/wiki/Cross_examination\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cross examination\">cross-question</a> etc., all such persons as are unknown, and cannot give an account of themselves in a straight and satisfactory line.... I think it a matter of importance to prevent them from obtaining intelligence of our situation.\" Washington occasionally had to deal with rogue intelligence officers in his own ranks who used their positions for personal gain or undertook unauthorized or illegal operations that might have compromised parts of his intelligence apparatus. Once Washington discovered that two of his agents who supposedly were collecting intelligence on Long Island actually were \"mere plundering parties.\" He set up a special team to investigate and arrest the renegade operatives.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Deception_operations\">Deception operations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Intelligence_operations_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Deception operations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To offset British superiority in firepower and number of troops, General Washington made frequent use of deception and <a href=\"/wiki/Disinformation\" title=\"Disinformation\">disinformation</a>. He allowed fabricated documents to fall into the hands of enemy agents or be discussed in their presence. He allowed couriers carrying bogus information to be \"captured\" by the British, and inserted forged documents in intercepted British communications that were then permitted to continue on to their destination. He had army procurement officers make false purchases of large quantities of supplies in places picked to convince the British that a sizable rebel force was massing. Washington even had fake military facilities built. In all this he managed to make the British believe that his three-thousand-man army outside Philadelphia was forty thousand strong.\n</p><p>After learning from the Culper Ring that the British planned to attack a French expedition that had just landed in <a href=\"/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island\" title=\"Newport, Rhode Island\">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, Washington planted information with known British agents indicating that he intended to move against New York City.

Lafayette gave him a fabricated order that was destined for a large number of nonexistent replacements. Armistead delivered the bogus order in crumpled, dirty condition to Cornwallis, claiming to have found it along the road during his mission. Cornwallis believed him and did not learn he had been tricked until after his surrender. Armistead was granted his freedom by the <a href=\"/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly\" title=\"Virginia General Assembly\">Virginia General Assembly</a> as a result of this and other wartime service.\n</p><p>Another deception operation at Yorktown found <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Charles_Morgan_(American_soldier)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Charles Morgan (American soldier) (page does not exist)\">Charles Morgan</a> entering Cornwallis' camp as a deserter. When debriefed by the British, he convinced them that Lafayette had sufficient boats to move all his troops against the British in one landing operation. Cornwallis was duped by him and dug in rather than marched out of Yorktown.
