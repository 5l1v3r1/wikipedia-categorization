Indeed, the ancient church in the J\u012bl\u016b village of S\u0101\u0163 (modern-day \u0130kiyaka) is dedicated to St. M\u0101r\u012b, and is the only church in the Hakkari region or northern Iraq historically known to have had been.

Afterwards, St. 'Az\u012bz\u0101 - reputedly a disciple of <a href=\"/wiki/Mar_Awgin\" title=\"Mar Awgin\">Mar Awgin</a> - is credited with having arrived in J\u012bl\u016b during the 4th century AD, establishing a monastery in the village of Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b.

According to the Saint's vita, J\u012bl\u016b at that time was the center of a kingdom named J\u012bl\u0101m-J\u012bl\u016b and the church construction project was led by its king B\u0101laq son of King Z\u016braq.

Additionally, many Chaldean families in the <a href=\"/wiki/Urmia\" title=\"Urmia\">Urmia</a> region trace their ancestry to settlers originally from J\u012bl\u016b. Among the most well known are the Malek-Yonan family of Geogtapa, who are descended from a J\u012bl\u016b chieftain who founded the village in the 16th century.

An exception to this appears to have been the patriarch M\u0101r Shim'on XV Michael Mukhattas (1740-1780), who is said to have been metropolitan of J\u012bl\u016b before being elevated to the patriarchate and, indeed, the Cathedral of Sts.

The tradition is probably full of historical errors, but must have some element of truth to it.\n</p><p>It narrates that a man named Mand\u016b, from the clan of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nebuchadnezzar\">Nebuchadnezzar</a>,\" for some unknown reason set out from the city of \u0100thor (<a href=\"/wiki/Mosul\" title=\"Mosul\">Mosul</a>), traveling in the company of his four brothers: B\u0101rut, Y\u00f4sip, B\u0101kus and Iss\u00e9. Mand\u016b had promised that he would settle in a place where they could feed him the head and shanks of a sheep (a dish called <i>p\u0101ch\u0101</i>). After a long journey Mand\u016b and his brothers arrived at a place named P\u0101ch\u016b, where a poor man fed them <i>p\u0101ch\u0101</i>. Mand\u016b observed that he had reached his destination and decided to stay there and become the head of that district. He chose a good place, later known as Z\u0101r\u0101n\u012bsh (Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b), just opposite from P\u0101ch\u016b. There he built a house for himself.\n</p><p>One day as Mand\u016b was walking in the forest, he saw four <a href=\"/wiki/Birds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Birds\">birds</a> but did not know from where they had come. He also saw a black stone, and nearby, a locked church. In his dream that night he saw the key to the church and a <a href=\"/wiki/Candelabra\" title=\"Candelabra\">candelabra</a> buried under the black stone. The next morning he went and found the key under the black stone, opened the church and entered it to pray. From that day that church became a place for <a href=\"/wiki/Worship\" title=\"Worship\">worship</a> for all the residents of the village. One day, as Mand\u016b was walking according to his habit, he saw a large cave filled with human bones. He inquired and was told that some people had escaped from the <a href=\"/wiki/Persian_people\" title=\"Persian people\">Persians</a> and had hidden themselves in this cave. The Persians found the cave and lit a fire before its entry, killing those inside it.\n</p><p>Around the village there used to live some pagans who Mand\u016b converted to <a href=\"/wiki/Christianity\" title=\"Christianity\">Christianity</a>, killing those who refused to. Mand\u016b did not molest those from four well-known families though, and ordered them to go and live in a nearby village. They went as ordered and their descendants still remained for some time but did not increase. Each had remained one family only. Descendants of Malik Mand\u016b became Maliks of Greater J\u012bl\u016b, and also took the name of Mand\u016b.\n</p><p>The same tradition recounts that during the reign of one of the Maliks, the <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_Patriarchs_of_the_Church_of_the_East\" title=\"List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East\">Mar Shim'on</a> (Catholicos-Patriarch of the <a href=\"/wiki/Church_of_the_East\" title=\"Church of the East\">Church of the East</a>) fled from \u0100thor (<a href=\"/wiki/Mosul\" title=\"Mosul\">Mosul</a>) and sought refuge in <a href=\"/wiki/Alqosh\" title=\"Alqosh\">Alqosh</a>. The Persians then came and conquered the area and took M\u0101r Shim'on to Persia, permitting him to live in the town of <a href=\"/wiki/Oshnavieh\" title=\"Oshnavieh\">Ushn\u016b</a>, where he settled as a refugee and built a large cathedral. After a while Malik Mand\u016b is said to have freed M\u0101r Shim'on from the Persians and brought him to Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b. For 60 years after that time the M\u0101r Shim'ons lived in Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b. The grave of one of them was even said to be located in the village cemetery. It is not clear why they left Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b and settled in the village of Tirq\u00f4nis, and later in <a href=\"/wiki/Konak,_Turkey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Konak, Turkey\">Qudsh\u0101nis</a>, which was given to them as a gift by Malik Mand\u016b. They did not stay long in <a href=\"/wiki/Konak,_Turkey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Konak, Turkey\">Qudsh\u0101nis</a> either because the village was near <a href=\"/wiki/Hakkari\" title=\"Hakkari\">Julamerk</a>, and prone to the raids of its Kurdish <i>Emir</i> (prince).\n</p><p>He was therefore obliged to move to the district of D\u012bzan. Malik Mand\u016b was not pleased that M\u0101r Shim'on had left <a href=\"/wiki/Konak,_Turkey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Konak, Turkey\">Qudsh\u0101nis</a>. He conferred with the Kurdish <i>Emir</i> of <a href=\"/wiki/Hakkari\" title=\"Hakkari\">Julamerk</a> on how he could return M\u0101r Shim'on to <a href=\"/wiki/Konak,_Turkey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Konak, Turkey\">Qudsh\u0101nis</a>. He went to D\u012bzan and burned M\u0101r Shim'on's residence near the village of Rabb\u0101n D\u0101d-\u012asho'. Later they collected money and built a new one for him in <a href=\"/wiki/Konak,_Turkey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Konak, Turkey\">Qudsh\u0101nis</a>, and invited him to live in it. In this manner M\u0101r Shim'on was made to accept the invitation to go and settle in <a href=\"/wiki/Konak,_Turkey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Konak, Turkey\">Qudsh\u0101nis</a>.\n</p><p>It continues to tell that the 'throne' of Malik Mand\u016b was inherited by Malik Ahron. He attacked the Kurdish castle of Khirw\u0101t (modern-day Hirvata near the Gawar Plain), took it and destroyed it. It was a great victory. Malik Ahron was followed by another who took the name Mand\u016b. He also, like former Maliks, was a man of war. When there was a conflict with Malik Khubyar of <a href=\"/wiki/Baz,_Turkey\" title=\"Baz, Turkey\">B\u0101z</a>, he attacked the district and killed a number of its inhabitants. Malik Mand\u016b was followed by Malik Sulaym\u0101n and during his reign the Ottoman Government thought it was necessary to post its representatives in those parts. The Government appointed a local <i>Rayyis</i> (Chief) each in <a href=\"/wiki/Hakkari\" title=\"Hakkari\">Julamerk</a>, Gawar, and <a href=\"/wiki/Shamdinan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shamdinan\">Shamdinan</a> (Shamsdin). These Chiefs tried in every way to prevent fighting between the various tribes in the area. Therefore, Malik Sulaym\u0101n and Malik Shl\u00ebmun who followed him, both had kept peace among the other tribes.\n</p><p>Malik Shl\u00ebmun was followed by Malik Ward\u0101. It was said that he was bribed by the Kurdish chief of <a href=\"/wiki/Daglica\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Daglica\">Oramar</a>, not to aid the Assyrian tribes of D\u012bzan, <a href=\"/wiki/Tyari\" title=\"Tyari\">\u0162y\u0101r\u00e9</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tkhuma_Tribe\" title=\"Tkhuma Tribe\">Tkh\u016bm\u0101</a> when they were attacked by Kurdish <i>Emir</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Bedirhan_Bey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bedirhan Bey\">Badr Kh\u0101n Beg</a> of Bohtan and his allies. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Massacres_of_Badr_Khan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Massacres of Badr Khan\">massacres of Badr Khan</a> the Kurds attacked, plundered, killed and stole their cattle, but Malik Ward\u0101 did not interfere to defend the Assyrian tribes. Malik \u012ash\u016b, who followed Malik Ward\u0101, attacked the Assyrian <a href=\"/wiki/Tkhuma_Tribe\" title=\"Tkhuma Tribe\">Tkhuma Tribe</a> and took away 2,000 head of sheep. After that the tribe of D\u012bzan attacked Tkh\u016bm\u0101, occupied the lands of Qar\u0101s\u016b, and put their own cattle in their planted fields. Malik \u012ash\u016b attacked the D\u012bzan tribe, and took their cattle. He then controlled their fields and collected their farming produce for himself.\n</p><p>Malik \u012ash\u016b was followed by Malik Mirz\u0101. Nothing is known about this Malik. During the time of Malik Kh\u0101lil who followed Malik Mirz\u0101, Kurdish tribes attacked J\u012bl\u016b tribes and stole 2,000 head of sheep. Malik Kh\u0101lil complained to the Ottoman government, later taking 400 strongmen from his tribe and 40 Turkish soldiers to attack the Kurdish chief of <a href=\"/wiki/Daglica\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Daglica\">Oramar</a>. He was forced to pay Malik Kh\u0101lil 200 Liras, 682 sheep, seven mules, four cows, and some carpets and other things. Afterwards, in 1909 Malik Kh\u0101lil traveled to Europe to collect money. He was dressed in his native clothes and was introduced into the presence of Pope <a href=\"/wiki/Pius_X\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pius X\">Pius X</a>. He explained to the Pope that he was Malik of J\u012bl\u016b and added that there was no education in his country and requested Pope's permission to collect money to open schools.\n</p><p>The Pope gave his permission and in a short time he collected 18,000 Vatican Liras and returned home where he began to build a school building. He again went back to Europe to collect money. It appeared that he was impersonating a Catholic monk in his travels in <a href=\"/wiki/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">Germany</a>. As Lalayan had learned from a German Consul he knew, the German Government arrested Malik Kh\u0101lil since they suspected him of fraud, i.e. collecting money for himself in the name of the Church, and he had requested the Consul to introduce him personally to German Government!<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Lalayan (<i>Assyrians of the Van District</i>, 1914), also recounts the oral legend concerning the origins and history of the Maliks of Lesser J\u012bl\u016b. It narrates that Malik Z\u0101m\u016b, considered the head of his clan, along with his brother Bayrijj\u00e9 and their relatives, had come from the village of \u0162irn\u0101kh\u012br in the Boht\u0101n region and settled in the village of \u0162el\u0101n\u0101 in Greater J\u012bl\u016b. They had been exiled from their former homes by Kurds. Several Maliks inherited his position. One of the Maliks made strong kinship ties with one of the well-known families of \u0162el\u0101n\u0101 by giving his daughter in marriage to one of their sons. It is not known when they settled in Z\u012br. From this clan was born a strongman named Aro, who later brought \u0162el\u0101n\u0101 under his rule, and assumed the title and authority of Malik. He was succeeded by his son Malik Gewarg\u012bs, and then his grandson Malik Khamm\u016b, of whom nothing particular is known.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Neo-Aramaic_dialect_of_J.C4.ABl.C5.AB\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neo-Aramaic_dialect_of_J\u012bl\u016b\">Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jilu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The J\u012bl\u016b dialect is one of the most distinct Neo-Aramaic dialects of Southeastern Turkey.

There are also sub-dialects within the J\u012bl\u016b dialect, some with their own distinct pronunciation or verb conjugations. The J\u012bl\u016b Assyrians read Assyrian Standard based literature and read and write in Assyrian Standard. Most can <a href=\"/wiki/Accent_reduction\" title=\"Accent reduction\">switch back and forth</a> from J\u012bl\u016b to Assyrian Standard or Iraqi Koine when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<caption>Examples\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<th><a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English</a>\n</th>\n<th>Assyrian Standard\n</th>\n<th>J\u012bl\u016b Koine\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>To come\n</td>\n<td>bit\u0101y\u0101\n</td>\n<td>biyy\u00e1\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>To go\n</td>\n<td>brikhsh\u0101 <i>or</i> bikh\u0101sh\u0101\n</td>\n<td>biz\u0101l\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Come\n</td>\n<td>t\u0101\n</td>\n<td>hiy\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plenty\n</td>\n<td>r\u0101ba\n</td>\n<td>reba or riba\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Village\n</td>\n<td>m\u0101ta\n</td>\n<td>M\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pillow\n</td>\n<td>barisht\u0101 <i>or</i> sp\u0101d\u012bt\u0101\n</td>\n<td>sp\u0101diya\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sit on the floor\n</td>\n<td>t\u016b l-ar'\u0101\n</td>\n<td>t\u016bll\u00e8r\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>House\n</td>\n<td>beyt\u0101\n</td>\n<td>b\u012by\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boy\n</td>\n<td>br\u016bn\u0101\n</td>\n<td>y\u0101l\u016bn\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Girl\n</td>\n<td>br\u0101t\u0101\n</td>\n<td>kittch\u00e9\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Assyrian Male\n</td>\n<td>S\u016br\u0101y\u0101\n</td>\n<td>S\u016br\u00e1\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Assyrian Female\n</td>\n<td>S\u016breyt\u0101\n</td>\n<td>S\u016br\u012by\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jilu Male\n</td>\n<td>Jilw\u0101y\u0101\n</td>\n<td>Jilwa\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jilu Female\n</td>\n<td>Jilweyt\u0101\n</td>\n<td>Jilw\u012by\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mother\n</td>\n<td>yimm\u0101\n</td>\n<td>d\u00e1\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>My Paternal Uncle\n</td>\n<td>m\u0101m\u016bn\u012b\n</td>\n<td>\u0101m\u00f4y\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I will see you (to female)\n</td>\n<td>b-khazzinnakh\n</td>\n<td>b-kh\u0101zn\u0101nakh\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I will see you (to male)\n</td>\n<td>b-khazzinnukh\n</td>\n<td>b-kh\u0101zn\u0101n\u016b\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I want (male)\n</td>\n<td>ki-bayyin\n</td>\n<td>\u012b-b\u00e2n\u00e2\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I want (female)\n</td>\n<td>ki-bayyan\n</td>\n<td>\u012b-b\u00e2yan\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>For\n</td>\n<td>q\u0101\n</td>\n<td>\u1e6dl\u0101 or \u0137l\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Offering / Sacrifice\n</td>\n<td>qurb\u0101n\u0101\n</td>\n<td>\u0137urb\u0101n\u0101\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Drink!

The J\u012bl\u016b Koine may also be attributed to the social exposure of the J\u012bl\u016b to Chaldeans of other tribes, and especially to those speaking the Urmian dialect. The majority of J\u012bl\u016b Koine speakers are from Iraq or descendants of J\u012bl\u016b Chaldeans from Iraq. \nJ\u012bl\u016b Chaldeans from Syria tend to have a verb conjugation system that is similar to the J\u012bl\u016b Koine but further from the Assyrian Standard. Their sub-dialects originate mostly from the Greater J\u012bl\u016b villages of Nahr\u0101, Al\u015fan and M\u0101t\u0101 d-M\u0101r Zay\u02bf\u0101 (settled in Tell-Gor\u0101n), as well as Z\u012br in Lesser J\u012bl\u016b and Isht\u0101zin (settled in Ab\u016b-T\u012bn\u0101). Thy also employ vocabulary and terms that are foreign to J\u012bl\u016b Koine speakers from Iraq, e.g. \"t\u00e9noww\u00e8\" (speaking) instead of the usual \"b-humz\u00f4m\u00e8\" in Iraqi J\u012bl\u016b Koine. Some speakers of the J\u012bl\u016b dialect from Syria claim that their way of speaking is purer than that of the Iraqi speakers. It is certain that many Iraqi J\u012bl\u016b speakers consider the dialect of those from Syria to be more archaic. This is because they have remained in two adjacent rural settlements until this day and are relatively isolated from other Assyrian groups.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<caption>Examples of verb conjugations\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>English\n</th>\n<th>Assyrian Standard\n</th>\n<th>J\u012bl\u016b Koine\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>What is the matter with you (plural)?\n</td>\n<td>m\u0101l\u00f4khun?\n</td>\n<td>malkh\u016b?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Sub-Districts.2C_Villages_and_Clans\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sub-Districts,_Villages_and_Clans\">Sub-Districts, Villages and Clans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jilu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Sub-Districts, Villages and Clans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:272px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg/270px-Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"126\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg/405px-Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg/540px-Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"280\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Hakkari_Turkey_Provinces_locator.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>J\u012bl\u016b is located in the Hakkari Province, southeastern part of <a href=\"/wiki/Turkey\" title=\"Turkey\">Turkey</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p><b>Greater J\u012bl\u016b</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b (modern-day Demirli) - residence of the Malik</li>\n<li>Alsan (modern-day Arsan) - its inhabitants were originally from Z\u00ear\u012bn\u012b</li>\n<li>M\u012bdh\u012b</li>\n<li>Nahr\u0101 (modern-day Kapakl\u0131):\n<ul><li>Yawela established Nara, he had 2 sons</li>\n<li>Latchin and Bella, who were the origin for all Nara`s families</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Ya\u0137\u0137\u016b</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Khawsh\u016b (B\u00e9-Yagm\u0101l\u0101)</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-L\u0101chin - originally from village of B\u00e9-Nahr\u00e9 in Rumt\u0101 sub-district of Upper \u0162y\u0101r\u00e9</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Bill\u0101 - originally from village of B\u00e9-Nahr\u00e9 in Rumt\u0101 sub-district of Upper \u0162y\u0101r\u00e9</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-\u012ashay (Halan\u0101y\u00e9) - originally from the ruined village of B\u012bd\u016b, said to be of Greek origin</li></ul></li>\n<li>M\u0101t\u0101 d-\u02bfUmr\u0101 d-M\u0101r Zay\u02bf\u0101 (M\u00e1 d-M\u0101r Zayy\u0101):\n<ul><li>B\u00e9-H\u0101j\u012b - originally from <a href=\"/wiki/Ankawa\" title=\"Ankawa\">Ankawa</a></li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Zkhary\u0101</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-M\u0101r Sarg\u012bs (B\u00e9-Yagm\u0101l\u0101)</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Sm\u0101l</li></ul></li>\n<li>B\u00e9-P\u0101ch\u016b</li>\n<li>Ummu\u0163</li>\n<li>\u0162el\u0101n\u0101</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Bu\u0137r\u0101</li></ul>\n<p><b>Lesser J\u012bl\u016b</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Z\u012br (modern-day \u00dc\u00e7karde\u015f) - residence of the Malik</li>\n<li>N\u00e9rik</li>\n<li>\u016ar\u00e9</li></ul>\n<p><b>Isht\u0101zin</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Samsikk\u00e9 (modern-day Ye\u015filta\u015f) - residence of the Malik</li>\n<li>Sarpil:\n<ul><li>B\u00e9-D\u0101mirch\u012b - originally from <a href=\"/wiki/Arbil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arbil\">Arbil</a></li></ul></li>\n<li>B\u016bb\u0101w\u0101</li>\n<li>M\u0101t\u0101 d-\u016ary\u0101y\u00e9 (M\u00e1 d-\u016ary\u00e9)</li>\n<li>M\u016bsper\u0101n</li>\n<li>B\u00e9-Baghsh\u00e9 (Beth-Bgh\u0101sh)</li></ul>\n<p><b>Dostik\u0101n</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Oramar (modern-day <a href=\"/wiki/Da%C4%9Fl%C4%B1ca\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Da\u011fl\u0131ca\">Da\u011fl\u0131ca</a>)</li>\n<li>S\u0101\u0163 (modern-day \u0130kiyaka)</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Notable_J.C4.ABl.C5.AB_Assyrians\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_J\u012bl\u016b_Assyrians\">Notable J\u012bl\u016b Assyrians</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jilu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Notable J\u012bl\u016b Assyrians\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Terrence_Malick\" title=\"Terrence Malick\">Terrence Malick</a></i></li></ul>\n<dl><dd>Assyrian-American <a href=\"/wiki/Hollywood\" title=\"Hollywood\">Hollywood</a> film director, screenwriter, and producer.
