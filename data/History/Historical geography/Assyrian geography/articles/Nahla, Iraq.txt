Nahla Valley (Arabic: سهل نهلا‎, Syriac: ܢܗܠܐ‎), is a geographic region located in the province of Nineveh in Aqrah  District, Iraq. The Sapna valley lies to the northwest and is separated by a mountain range, and the city of Aqra is to the south, separated by another mountain range. It is bound by the Greater Zab River to the north and east, and the Khazir River to the west. The valley is mainly inhabited by Assyrians and Kurds, with an Arab minority present as well. Most of the Assyrians living in Nahla, which number around 20,000, moved there from Hakkari after the Assyrian Genocide that occurred during the First World War. However, some villages were emptied in the 1960s when fights between the Iraqi government and Kurdish separatists forced most of their inhabitants to flee to Baghdad and Mosul. Some scarcely populated villages were completely destroyed later on during the Anfal genocide in the 1980s as well. The population of the valley grew considerably following the Iraq War, as many Assyrians living in Dora and Mosul started settling back in the region. There is significant friction between the Kurds and Assyrians in the valley, with a history of violence, land squatting, and voting suppression since the establishment of Iraqi Kurdistan.  On July 17, 1999 an armed group belonging to the Patriotic Revolutionary Organization of Bet Nahrain attacked a PDK Peshmerga position in the region in retaliation for the murder of an Assyrian girl. The attack resulted in 39 deaths and 20 injured on the Kurdish side.  Coordinates: 36°50′N 43°56′E﻿ / ﻿36.833°N 43.933°E﻿ / 36.833; 43.933﻿ (Nahla)
