He described what he found on his first journey  to the islands beyond 54 degrees north in a book, <i>Inventio Fortunata</i>, which he presented to the King.\n</p><p>Unfortunately, by the time Atlantic explorers were seeking information in the 1490s, the <i>Inventio</i> had gone missing, and was only known through a summary in a second text, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Itinerarium\" title=\"Itinerarium\">Itinerarium</a>,</i> written by a <a href=\"/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant\" title=\"Duchy of Brabant\">Brabantian</a> traveller from <a href=\"/wiki/%27s-Hertogenbosch\" title=\"&#39;s-Hertogenbosch\">'s-Hertogenbosch</a> named Jacobus Cnoyen (also known as James Cnoyen or Jakob van Knoyen; modern Knox). As will be discussed below, Cnoyen's summary was the basis for the depiction of the Arctic region on many maps, one of the earliest being Martin Behaim's 1492 globe. By the late 16th century, even Cnoyen's text was missing, so most of what we know of the contents of the <i>Inventio Fortunata</i>, other than its use on maps, is found in a letter from the Flemish <a href=\"/wiki/Cartographer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cartographer\">cartographer</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator\" title=\"Gerardus Mercator\">Gerardus Mercator</a> to the English astronomer <a href=\"/wiki/John_Dee_(mathematician)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John Dee (mathematician)\">John Dee</a> dated April 20, 1577, now located in the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Museum\" title=\"British Museum\">British Museum</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-taylor_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-taylor-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Cnoyen's information came in a very round-about way. In 1364, a priest from one of the Atlantic islands had returned to <a href=\"/wiki/Norway\" title=\"Norway\">Norway</a>, bringing with him an <a href=\"/wiki/Astrolabe\" title=\"Astrolabe\">astrolabe</a> which he had received from the visiting Franciscan friar, in exchange for a religious book. He made a detailed report to the King of Norway. Copies still survive of a social and geographical description of <a href=\"/wiki/Greenland\" title=\"Greenland\">Greenland</a> by a local church official named Ivar Bardarson, who turns up in Norwegian records in 1364, so this much of Cnoyen's story tallies well with reality (although this report does not contain the sort of personal information relayed by Cnoyen). Cnoyen seems to have obtained his information from Norwegian sources some time later, neither he nor the priest having actually seen the <i>Inventio</i>.\n</p><p>Cnoyen's account (originally in his own language; translations here based on Eva Taylor's version<sup id=\"cite_ref-taylor_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-taylor-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>) mixes probable fact with what may have been his own attempts to research the background, stating that Greenland was first settled at the orders of <a href=\"/wiki/King_Arthur\" title=\"King Arthur\">King Arthur</a>, whose army supposedly conquered the North Atlantic islands. He also refers to the \"indrawing seas\"- currents which drew ships northward, so that:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"nearly 4000 persons entered the indrawing seas who never returned. But in A.D. 1364 eight of these people came to the King's Court in Norway.  Among them were two priests, one of whom had an astrolabe, who was descended in the 5th generation from a <a href=\"/wiki/Brussels\" title=\"Brussels\">Brussels</a> citizen. One, I say: all eight were from those who had penetrated the northern regions in the first ships.\"</dd></dl>\n<p>Of the visiting Franciscan, Cnoyen (or Mercator) summarised the priest's report thus:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"Leaving the rest of the party who had come to the Islands, he journeyed further, through the whole of the North etc, and put into writing all the wonders of those Islands, and gave the King of England this book, which he called in Latin <i>Inventio Fortunatae</i>.\"</dd></dl>\n<p>In reality, the \"book\" may have been a detailed report, intended mainly to highlight the commercial possibilities offered by the North Atlantic following the decline of Norwegian interest in its colonies.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Authorship\">Authorship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inventio_Fortunata&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Authorship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Mercator's contemporary, the 16th-century English historian <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Hakluyt\" title=\"Richard Hakluyt\">Richard Hakluyt</a>, identifies the author of the <i>Inventio</i> as <a href=\"/wiki/Nicholas_of_Lynn\" title=\"Nicholas of Lynn\">Nicholas of Lynn</a>. Hakluyt apparently arrived at this conclusion because of <a href=\"/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer\" title=\"Geoffrey Chaucer\">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s mention of Nicholas in his <i>Treatise on the Astrolabe.</i> Hakluyt did not himself, of course, have a copy of the <i>Inventio.</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Nicholas was alive at the right time (very roughly -- he is quite likely to have been a child in 1360), and had the right skills, but he was a <a href=\"/wiki/Carmelite\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Carmelite\">Carmelite</a> friar, not a Franciscan, and no earlier biographer indicates that he spent years travelling back and forth across the Atlantic on government business. There is another possible candidate, about whom, unfortunately, almost nothing is known. According to early 16th century literary historian John Bale, an Irishman named Hugh, who was a Franciscan, travelled widely in the 14th century, and wrote \"a certain journey in one volume\" -- but again, whether or not this was the <i>Inventio</i>, no copy of it is known.<sup id=\"cite_ref-taylor_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-taylor-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influence_on_maps\">Influence on maps</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inventio_Fortunata&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Influence on maps\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The concept of the pole as a magnetic mountain goes back at least to Roman times, but the author of <i>Inventio Fortunata</i> added other features to the picture as well as measurements.

He was descended in the fifth generation from those whom Arthur had sent to inhabit these lands, and he related that in the year 1360 a certain Minorite, an Englishman from Oxford, a mathematician, went to those islands; and leaving them, advanced still farther by magic arts and mapped out all and measured them by an astrolabe in practically the subjoined figure, as we have learned from Jacobus. The four canals there pictured he said flow with such current to the inner whirlpool, that if vessels once enter they cannot be driven back by wind.\"</dd></dl>\n<p>The Arctic map inset on Mercator's 1569 world map was the prototype for the influential and widely circulated <i>Septentrionalium Terrarum</i> of 1595, posthumously published by his son, and the maps in <a href=\"/wiki/Ortelius\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ortelius\">Ortelius</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Theatrum_Orbis_Terrarum\" title=\"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\">Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</a></i> of 1570. Both show the same configuration of the arctic regions as the 1569 map.\n</p><p>In his letter to Dee, Mercator further quotes Cnoyen's description of the Northern regions: \n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"...In the midst of the four countries is a Whirlpool into which there empty these four Indrawing Seas which divide the North. And the water rushes round and descends into the earth just as if one were pouring it through a filter funnel. It is 4 degrees wide on every side of the Pole, that is to say eight degrees altogether. Except that right under the Pole there lies a bare rock in the midst of the Sea. Its circumference is almost 33 French miles, and it is all of magnetic stone. And is as high as the clouds, so the Priest said, who had received the astrolabe from this Minorite in exchange for a Testament. And the Minorite himself had heard that one can see all round it from the Sea, and that it is black and glistening. And nothing grows thereon, for there is not so much as a handful of soil on it.\"</dd></dl>\n<p>The persistence of this idea of the geography of the far north persisted throughout the 16th and 17th century. This is probably due to the influence of Ruysch, Mercator, and Ortelius. Maps were only revised when the region was explored and mapmakers obtained knowledge of the true geography of the Arctic.\n</p><p>More interesting to modern researchers are the people the friar encountered, \"pygmies\" who may well be identical with the <a href=\"/wiki/Skraelings\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skraelings\">Skraelings</a> referred to in old Norse texts about Greenland, predecessors of the modern <a href=\"/wiki/Inuit\" title=\"Inuit\">Inuit</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_John_Day_letter\">The John Day letter</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inventio_Fortunata&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The John Day letter\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1956 a letter referring to the existence of the book was found in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Archivo_General_de_Simancas\" title=\"Archivo General de Simancas\">Archivo General de Simancas</a></i> (Spain) from the English merchant <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=John_Day_(merchant)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"John Day (merchant) (page does not exist)\">John Day</a> to \"The Most Magnificent And Most Worthy Lord - The Lord Grand Admiral\" (presumably <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Columbus\" title=\"Christopher Columbus\">Christopher Columbus</a>).\n</p><p>In the letter, written in either December 1497 or January 1498, John Day says, \n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"...<i>Your Lordship's servant brought me your letter.
