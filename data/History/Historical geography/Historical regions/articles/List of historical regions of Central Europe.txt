There are many historical regions of Central Europe. For the purpose of this list, Central Europe is defined as the area contained roughly within the south coast of the Baltic Sea, the Elbe River, the Alps, the Danube River, the Black Sea and the Dnepr River.  Note that these regions come from different time periods – from medieval to modern era – and may often overlap. National borders have been drawn across those regions multiple times over centuries so usually they cannot be assigned to any specific nation. The list below indicates which present-day states control the whole or a part of each of the listed regions.
