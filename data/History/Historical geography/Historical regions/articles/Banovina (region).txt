a Banovina is not designated as an official region, it is a geographic region only. Banovina, formerly known as Banska krajina or Banija,  is a geographical region in central Croatia, between the Sava, Una, and Kupa rivers. The main towns in the region include Petrinja, Glina, Kostajnica, and Dvor.  The area is almost entirely located in the Sisak-Moslavina County. During World War II, Banovina Banija was the site of one of the Ustaše's genocidal massacres against the Serbs. A half-century later, the area suffered during the Croatian War of Independence in the 1990s, with much of the population fleeing during the hostilities, many later returning.
