  Dosso is a city in the south-west corner of Niger. It lies 130–140 kilometres (81–87 mi)   south-east of the capital Niamey at the junction of the main routes to Zinder and Benin. The seventh-most populous town in Niger and the largest in Dosso Region, it had an official population during the 2001 census of 43,561.  It is the capital of its region—which covers five departments in the southwestern corner of the nation, as well as of its own department: Dosso Department. The city itself lies at the centre of its own Urban Commune.  Dosso is the seat of the Dosso kingdom, a Zarma chieftaincy which rose to dominate the entire Zarma region in Niger in pre-colonial Niger. The traditional ruler is called Zarmakoy or Djermakoy of Dosso, an autochthonous title meaning literally "King of Djermas" where koy means "king" in Zarma (or Djerma) language. Attractions in the town include the Djermakoy's palace and museum, nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006.  The city of Dosso is a critical commercial hub through which transit import-export products from the Cotonou port. Due to this and its proximity to Niamey, Dosso is transportation hub. Dosso has an interim terminus of the Niamey–Cotonou railway presently[when?] under construction.  An extension to the capital, Niamey, would be a later stage. In addition, there is a plan for the construction of a dry commercial port.
