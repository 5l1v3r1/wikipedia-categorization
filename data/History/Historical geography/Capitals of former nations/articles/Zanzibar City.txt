Zanzibar City (or Zanzibar Town, often simply referred to as Zanzibar; Swahili: Jiji la Zanzibar; Arabic: مدينة زنجبار‎) is the capital and largest city of Zanzibar, in Tanzania. It is located on the west coast of Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, roughly due north of Dar es Salaam across the Zanzibar Channel. It also serves as the capital of the Zanzibar Urban/West Region, and qualifies as a district, formally known as Zanzibar Urban District. In 2002 its population was 205,870.  Zanzibar City comprises two main parts, Stone Town and Ng'ambo (literally: "The Other Side"); the two areas are historically divided by a creek, now marked by a large street called Creek Road.   Stone Town is the historical core of the city, former capital of the Zanzibar Sultanate; because of its unique architecture and culture, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.  Ng'ambo is a much larger, modern area that developed around Stone Town after the Zanzibar Revolution, with office buildings and large apartment blocks such as those of the Michenzani neighbourhood.  Zanzibar City has a tropical climate, very similar to whole Unguja island, and slightly warmer than what is found in Pemba. This climate is classified as "Am" by the Köppen-Geiger system. The average temperature in Zanzibar City is 26.9°C (78°F). The average annual rainfall is 1,512 mm. The monthly average temperatures are usually between 25.1 - 28.8°C (77°F - 84°F).
