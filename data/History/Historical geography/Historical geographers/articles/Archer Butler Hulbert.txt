Hulbert's last position was at Colorado College, from 1920 until his death. After his death, his wife, Dorothy Printup Hulbert, continued his work.  Hulbert's interest in trails dated from fishing trips taken during his college, when he noticed Indian trails. This interest led at first to his 16 volumes of Historic Highways of America (1902–05).  The 1929 Bibliography of Archer Butler Hulbert lists 102 volumes. His work Forty Niners (1931) won a $5,000 prize from The Atlantic Monthly magazine.
