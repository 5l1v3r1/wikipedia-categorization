 Claude Reignier Conder (29 December 1848, Cheltenham – 16 February 1910, Cheltenham) was an English soldier, explorer and antiquarian.  He was a great-great-grandson of Louis-François Roubiliac.   Conder was educated at University College London and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.  He became a lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers in 1870.  He carried out survey work in Palestine in 1872–1874, latterly in conjunction with Lt Kitchener, later Lord Kitchener,  whom he had met at school,   and was seconded to the Palestine Exploration Fund from 1875 to 1878 and again in 1881 and 1882, when he was promoted captain.  He retired with the rank of colonel in 1904.  Conder joined the expedition to Egypt in 1882, under Sir Garnet Wolseley, to suppress the rebellion of Arabi Pasha. He was appointed a deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general on the staff of the intelligence department. In Egypt his perfect knowledge of Arabic and of Eastern people proved most useful. He was present at the action of Kassassin, the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, and the advance to Cairo, but then, seized with typhoid fever, he was invalided home. For his services he received the war medal with clasp for Tel el-Kebir, the Khedive's bronze star and the fourth class of the Order of the Medjidie. While surveying the area of Safed in July 1875, Conder and his party were attacked by local residents, during which altercation Conder sustained a serious head injury which left him bed-ridden for a while and unable to return to Palestine.  The work of surveying the country of Palestine commenced again only in late February 1877, without Conder.    Conder was first proposed as a  candidate for the Jack the Ripper murders by the author Tom Slemen.
