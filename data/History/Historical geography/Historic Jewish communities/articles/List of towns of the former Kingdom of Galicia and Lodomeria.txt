This is a list of major cities and towns which belonged to the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. Between those dates, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria consisted mostly of the territories gained by the Habsburg Empire in the First Partition of Poland in 1772.  Today, the territory of Galicia is split between Poland in the west and Ukraine in the east. At the turn of the Twentieth Century, Poles constituted 78.7% of the whole population of Western Galicia, Ukrainians 13.2%, Jews 7.6%, Germans 0.3%, and others 0.2%. Respective data for Eastern Galicia show the following number: Ukrainians 64.5%, Poles 21.0%, Jews 13.7%, Germans 0.3%, and others 0.5%. Before World War II, many Galician towns, even in the predominantly ethnic Ukrainian east, had substantial Polish, Jewish and German populations.
