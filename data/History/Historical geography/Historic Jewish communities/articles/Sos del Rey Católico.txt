Sos del Rey Católico (in Aragonese: Sos d'o Rei Catolico) is a historic town and municipality in the Cinco Villas comarca, province of Zaragoza, in Aragon, Spain. Located on rocky and elevated terrain, this important border town served well as a stronghold from the year 907  when it was reclaimed by Sancho I of Pamplona. It was incorporated in 1044 by Ramiro I into the Kingdom of Aragon.  In the year 1452, during the War of Navarre, Queen Juana Enríquez de Córdoba moved to the town, then called "Sos". There she gave birth to the infante Ferdinand on March 10, 1452, who later became Ferdinand II of Aragon, one of the Catholic Monarchs. His birth added "d'o Rei Catolico" to the name of the town,  which translates as either "You are of the Catholic Monarch" or "You belong to the Catholic Monarch". In 1711 it was named as the capital of the Cinco Villas.  The exceptional preservation of the historic center makes a stroll around this town becomes a journey into the past highlighting the city walls, churches, Plaza de la Villa and the Palacio de los Sada, where Ferdinand was born in 1452. In 2009, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of La Vaquilla film in the town, a set of sculptures were placed, made in bronze by sculptor José Luis Fernández. The sculptures represent life-size chair commonly used by film directors, and also one sculpture of the director. The film La vaquilla was shot in Sos with many locals working as extras. It was directed by Pablo Garcia Albano. Barués Campo Reyal Castiello Barués Mamillas Novellaco O Reyal Sofuentes
