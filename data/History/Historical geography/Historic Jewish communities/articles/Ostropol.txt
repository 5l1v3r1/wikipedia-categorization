Ostropol (Ukrainian: Остропіль), also known as Staryy Ostropil, is a small town on the Sluch River located in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast about 133 miles (222 km) WSW of Kiev, Ukraine. It is located at latitude 49°48' N, longitude 27°34' E and is situated at an altitude of 742.5 feet (225 m). The town of Lyubar is 11.1 miles (18.5 km) from Ostropol. Ostropol was an important Jewish center in the 17th century and was mentioned in many contemporary texts including the birthplace of the noted Rabbi, Kabbalist and martyr Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli. Its Jewish population was wiped out along with that of Starokonstantinov by the Nazis in 1942 before being liberated by the Red Army in 1945. The 5200 murdered Jews have since been commemorated at the Holocaust Memorial Park in Brooklyn, New York. http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/commemoration.asp?cid=554 The hero of Jewish humor, Hershele Ostropoler, was from that town. There are two cemeteries, one across the street from the other. Both are in a dilapidated condition. Coordinates: 49°47′52″N 27°33′51″E﻿ / ﻿49.79778°N 27.56417°E﻿ / 49.79778; 27.56417
