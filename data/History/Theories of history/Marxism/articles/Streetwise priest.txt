Streetwise priests (Italian: preti di strada, Spanish: curas de la calle, French: prêtres de rue, German: Priester der Straße) are Roman Catholic priests who exercise their spiritual mandate by living in structures in direct contact with the "street", which is their mission land. Historical streetwise priests include Philip Neri (1515–1595) and John Bosco (1815–1888). Recently, the expression came to denote priests with reformist ideas, especially those involved in reform movements for social justice in a Christian context through service to the poor and marginalized.  Their work covers various areas, such as education, marginalization, imprisonment, development cooperation, drug addictions, disabilities, orphans and abandoned children, prostitution, and homelessness. In many cases, streetwise priests form groups, associations, or communities, especially inclusive to laics.  Debates and conflicts with ecclesiastical hierarchy exist regarding Catholic social teaching and implementing the Second Vatican Council's doctrine.
