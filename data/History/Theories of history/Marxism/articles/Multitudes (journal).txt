Multitudes is a French philosophical, political and artistic monthly journal founded in 2000 by Yann Moulier-Boutang. It is thematically situated in the theoretical framework of the seminal work Empire by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. The journal, like the book, focuses on the further elaboration of the philosophical and political thought of the Italian operaismo, but seems also to rest on Foucault, Althusser, and Deleuze's thought. It is a successor to the review Futur Ant√©rieur edited by  Jean-Marie Vincent (1934-2004) and Toni Negri, at the dep. of political science - University Vincennes Paris 8. It is a member of the Eurozine network. Multitudes's name comes from the Spinozist eponymic concept. It has been thought by Toni Negri as an alternative to the classic conception of the people, class consciousness, or nation-state. It publishes a lot on themes relating to the information society and the knowledge economy, supporting in particular the thesis of a "cognitive labour" and "affective labour" which can not be measured by standard means of labor-time, and also insists on the cooperative aspects of production in modern society. For this reason and others, it tends to argue in favour of a guaranteed minimum income. Contents published by Multitudes are mostly in French, although some articles are translated (in English, Spanish, etc.) and are under a Creative Commons license.  See full list
