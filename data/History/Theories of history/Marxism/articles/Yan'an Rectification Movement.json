These included the consolidation of <a href=\"/wiki/Mao_Zedong\" title=\"Mao Zedong\">Mao Zedong</a>'s paramount role within the CCP, especially from 1942 to 1944, and the adoption of a party constitution that endorsed <a href=\"/wiki/Marxist-Leninism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marxist-Leninism\">Marxist-Leninism</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Maoism\" title=\"Maoism\">Mao Zedong Thought</a> as guiding ideologies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This move formalized Mao's deviation from the <a href=\"/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union\" title=\"Communist Party of the Soviet Union\">Moscow party line</a> and the importance of Mao's major adaptations of communism to the conditions of China. The Rectification Campaign was successful in either convincing or coercing the other leaders of the CCP to support Mao. Because the CCP had overcome great odds to grow and develop during this period, the methods employed in Yan'an were looked upon in reverence during Mao's later years. After the founding of the <a href=\"/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"People&#39;s Republic of China\">People's Republic of China</a> in 1949, Mao repeatedly used some of the tactics that had been successful in Yan'an whenever he felt the need to monopolize political power.<sup id=\"cite_ref-LIEBERTHAL_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LIEBERTHAL-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In large part, the Yan'an Rectification Campaign began with the \"systematic remolding of human minds.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-newman_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-newman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Remolding_of_the_volunteer_corps\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Remolding of the volunteer corps</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Rise_of_Mao\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rise of Mao</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Operational_principles\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Operational principles</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Thought_reform\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Thought reform</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#A_campaign_in_three_phases\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">A campaign in three phases</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Phase_I\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Phase I</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Phase_II\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Phase II</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Phase_III\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Phase III</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yan%27an_Rectification_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Background\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the 1930s the remote region of <a href=\"/wiki/Yan%27an\" title=\"Yan&#39;an\">Yan'an</a> had not experienced the same turmoil and hostilities as other <a href=\"/wiki/Mainland_China\" title=\"Mainland China\">mainland</a> territories.

Modern scholars have increasingly viewed the movement as being initiated by Mao in order to ensure his status as paramount leader of the CCP. Most historical sources refer to multiple phases of \"rectification\", often with inconsistent names and imprecise start and end times.\n</p><p>Throughout the Rectification Campaign, Yan'an was not seriously threatened by either the <a href=\"/wiki/Empire_of_Japan\" title=\"Empire of Japan\">Japanese</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Kuomintang\" title=\"Kuomintang\">Nationalists</a>.

When the Communists completed the Long March the CCP was a relatively small band of less than 10,000 worn out troops from the south, displaced to an isolated and poor area in the hinterlands of northern China. By the end of the Yan'an era, however, the CCP's forces had grown to nearly 2.8 million members, and the Party governed nineteen base areas that contained a population of nearly one hundred million people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-LIEBERTHAL_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LIEBERTHAL-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Remolding_of_the_volunteer_corps\">Remolding of the volunteer corps</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yan%27an_Rectification_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Remolding of the volunteer corps\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Party membership was strongly shaped by the devastation of the final battles for the <a href=\"/wiki/Jiangxi_Soviet\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jiangxi Soviet\">Jiangxi Soviet</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Long_March\" title=\"Long March\">Long March</a>, and the numerous clashes with the Japanese during the Yan'an era.<sup id=\"cite_ref-LIEBERTHAL_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LIEBERTHAL-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> With only few early members of the CCP surviving to the end of the Yan'an period, the Party as of the mid-1940s consisted to 90% of peasants recruited from the base areas of north China.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chang,_Jung_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chang,_Jung-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The mostly young volunteers who arrived in Yan'an after the Long March were \"vital to Mao because they were relatively well educated, and he needed competent administrators to staff his future regime\". Most of the Long Marchers and rural recruits from within the Communist bases were illiterate peasants. It was these more recent volunteers who were Mao's primary \"target\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chang,_Jung_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chang,_Jung-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A large number of the young volunteers congregated in Yan'an, the capital of Mao's Communist Party. By the time Mao Zedong started his drive to \"condition\" them, around 40,000 had arrived. Most were in their late teens and early twenties, had joined the Party in territories controlled by the Nationalists, and later departed to Yan'an. They were excited at reaching what was called a \"revolutionary Mecca.\" One young volunteer described his feeling: \"At last we saw the heights of Yenan city. We were so excited we wept. We cheered from our truck ... We started to sing the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Internationale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Internationale\">Internationale</a>\", and Russia's Motherland March.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chang,_Jung_4-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chang,_Jung-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Party's leadership, however, reflected the CCP's origins south of the <a href=\"/wiki/Yangtze_River\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yangtze River\">Yangtze River</a>, and was at best supplemented by the intellectuals who trekked out to Yan'an to join the Party during the war against Japan. The Yan'an Rectification Campaign was also directed towards the indoctrination of older Communist Party personnel. \"The Party chose to re-emphasize its basic principles during this period, in an evident determination to maintain its <a href=\"/wiki/Leninist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leninist\">Leninist</a> foundations in the midst of all the changes brought about by the war-time shift to the united front.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Yan'an Rectification Campaign improved the discipline, education, and organization of the membership of the CCP. Having lost many veterans before and during the Long March, the Communists found new sources of recruits among urban youth, students, and intellectuals. Alienated from the Nationalist government and doubting its resolve in resisting the Japanese, many new CCP volunteers were drawn by communist propaganda that portrayed the CCP as \"the saviors of the nation\", promising democracy and liberal reforms. As a result, hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, artists, writers, and journalists poured into Yan'an, seeking a revolutionary career. In Marxist classification these new recruits were of <a href=\"/wiki/Petit_bourgeois\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Petit bourgeois\">petit bourgeois</a> origin. Their enthusiasm and various sorts of expertise were useful for the revolution, but only after they had undergone a thorough political reeducation and ideological reform.<sup id=\"cite_ref-newman_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-newman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The process of indoctrination extended even to the cadres who had survived the Long March and \"proven their revolutionary credibility.\" All Party members were reeducated with the newly established \"Mao Zedong Thought\" in order to ensure their high compliance with the new leadership and the new party ideology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-newman_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-newman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In order to secure his power, Mao supported his political authority with ethical and moral rhetoric.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rise_of_Mao\">Rise of Mao</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yan%27an_Rectification_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Rise of Mao\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Yan'an rectification saw Mao consolidate his position of preeminence in the CCP. To do this he undertook a \"thought-reform campaign\" from 1942 to 1944. The effort was partly a reflection of Mao's wish to eradicate Soviet influence. Under the conditions of independently operating Communist areas and incessant warfare, Mao could not rely on discipline alone to guarantee obedience in the CCP ranks. In order to ensure the Party's obedience to his orders, Mao developed the techniques of the Rectification Campaign to implement \"thought reform\" (literally \"washing the brain\" in Chinese). Mao's tactics often included isolating and attacking dissenting individuals in \"study groups.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-LIEBERTHAL_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LIEBERTHAL-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Operational_principles\">Operational principles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yan%27an_Rectification_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Operational principles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Communists established numerous schools, formulating a new type of educational system. Among these schools were the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, the Lu Xun Academy of the Arts, the Northwest Public School, the Central Party School, the Academy of Marxism-Leninism, the Women's University, Yan'an University, and the Academy of the Nationality, as well as a number of special training programs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-newman_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-newman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> All veterans and new recruits had to be enrolled and educated in one of these institutions, in accordance with their previous training or their expertise, before they could be trusted with assignment to party and government positions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-newman_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-newman-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At the end of the Yan'an Rectification Campaign the CCP had developed an operational set of principles and practices that differed greatly from the centralized, functionally specialized, hierarchical, command-oriented approach imposed by <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>.

Before the Rectification Campaign Mao's contribution to the revolution in rural areas, and even his status as a senior leader, was doubted by other members of the CCP, including <a href=\"/wiki/Xiang_Zhongfa\" title=\"Xiang Zhongfa\">Xiang Zhongfa</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Zhang_Guotao\" title=\"Zhang Guotao\">Zhang Guotao</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Lisan\" title=\"Li Lisan\">Li Lisan</a>, and intellectuals such as <a href=\"/wiki/Zhou_Enlai\" title=\"Zhou Enlai\">Zhou Enlai</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Qu_Qiubai\" title=\"Qu Qiubai\">Qu Qiubai</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/28_Bolsheviks\" title=\"28 Bolsheviks\">28 Bolsheviks</a>. Unlike his rival <a href=\"/wiki/Wang_Ming\" title=\"Wang Ming\">Wang Ming</a>, Mao was not recognised by the <a href=\"/wiki/Comintern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Comintern\">Comintern</a> as one of the CCP's preferred leaders.\n</p><p>During this preparatory phase, Mao used his political skills to consolidate his power base. By manipulating the political climate in Yan'an, Mao was able to break up the alliance of his opponents, most notably Zhang Guotao and the members of the <a href=\"/wiki/28_Bolsheviks\" title=\"28 Bolsheviks\">28 Bolsheviks</a>, and to eliminate his rivals one by one.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_II\">Phase II</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yan%27an_Rectification_Movement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Phase II\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Rectification Campaign was officially launched in 1942. Since the 4th Plenum Meeting of 6th National Congress of the CCP (1928), the 28 Bolsheviks began to take control of the CCP with the help of the Comintern. To gain the support of those who might potentially oppose him, Mao labeled his rivals as comrades who were supporting the wrong cause. This rejection of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ad_hominem\" title=\"Ad hominem\">ad hominem</a></i> arguments  made him appear politically and mentally superior to his political enemies. Mao categorized his rivals, or potential rivals, into two groups.\n</p><p>One group was labeled \"dogmatists,\" comprising <a href=\"/wiki/Wang_Ming\" title=\"Wang Ming\">Wang Ming</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/28_Bolsheviks\" title=\"28 Bolsheviks\">28 Bolsheviks</a>, and those who had studied abroad and were deeply influenced by foreign theories, including <a href=\"/wiki/Liu_Bocheng\" title=\"Liu Bocheng\">Liu Bocheng</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Zuo_Quan\" title=\"Zuo Quan\">Zuo Quan</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Zhu_Rui\" title=\"Zhu Rui\">Zhu Rui</a>. The other group was labeled  \"empiricists\", whose members included <a href=\"/wiki/Zhou_Enlai\" title=\"Zhou Enlai\">Zhou Enlai</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ren_Bishi\" title=\"Ren Bishi\">Ren Bishi</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peng_Dehuai\" title=\"Peng Dehuai\">Peng Dehuai</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Chen_Yi_(communist)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chen Yi (communist)\">Chen Yi</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Weihan\" title=\"Li Weihan\">Li Weihan</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Deng_Fa\" title=\"Deng Fa\">Deng Fa</a>, and any other senior leaders who supported Wang Ming. Mao forced these leaders to criticize each other and self-criticize in rounds of meetings. Every one of them wrote reports of confession and apologies for their mistakes. Those who had produced self-criticisms were later persecuted according to their own confessions.\n</p><p>Mao set up the Central General Study Committee to be in charge of the movement. This Committee was run by Mao's close allies <a href=\"/wiki/Kang_Sheng\" title=\"Kang Sheng\">Kang Sheng</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Fuchun\" title=\"Li Fuchun\">Li Fuchun</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peng_Zhen\" title=\"Peng Zhen\">Peng Zhen</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Gao_Gang\" title=\"Gao Gang\">Gao Gang</a>, and later included <a href=\"/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi\" title=\"Liu Shaoqi\">Liu Shaoqi</a>. This Committee temporarily replaced the politburo and secretariat, running daily operation for the CCP and making it one of the most powerful administrative bodies at that time. The Committee gave Mao the ability to exercise authoritarian power without being limited by elections and term limits. The earlier collective decision-making system of CCP center was abandoned, and Mao turned the government of Yan'an into his own dictatorship.\n</p><p>From Feb 1942 to Oct 1943, the Rectification Campaign reached its peak. Mao gave the lecture \"Improving the Party Work Style and Thought\" in the opening ceremony at the <a href=\"/wiki/Party_School_of_the_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China\">Central Party School</a> (\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u9ee8\u6821).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Garver_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Garver-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The lecture \"Against Party Stereotype-Writing\" in the cadre party of Yan'an in Feb 1942 interpreted the aim and policy of the movement in full detail - the event included thousands of cadres from the party.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Garver_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Garver-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  In this lecture, <a href=\"/wiki/Mao_Zedong\" title=\"Mao Zedong\">Mao Zedong</a> declared: \n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Why must there be a revolutionary party?

The most famous came from <a href=\"/wiki/Wang_Shiwei\" title=\"Wang Shiwei\">Wang Shiwei</a>, a journalist and intellectual known for his belief in \"democracy and science.\" Wang wrote an essay denouncing the hierarchy, bureaucracy, and inegalitarian distribution of resources in Yan'an. The essay irritated Mao greatly, and Wang was labeled a <a href=\"/wiki/Trotskyist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trotskyist\">Trotskyist</a>.
