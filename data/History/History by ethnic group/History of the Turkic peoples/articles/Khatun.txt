Khatun (Mongolian: ᠬᠠᠲᠤᠨ, khatun, хатан khatan; Persian: خاتون‎ khātūn; Urdu: خاتون‎ khātūn, plural خواتين khavātīn; Bengali: খাঁতুন, খাতুন; Turkish: hatun) is a female title of nobility and counterpart to "khan" or "Khagan" prominently used in the Turkic Khaganate and in the subsequent Mongol Empire. It is equivalent to "queen regnant" or "empress regnant", approximately. Before the advent of Islam in Central Asia, Khatun was the title of the queen of Bukhara. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, "Khatun [is] a title of Sogdian origin borne by the wives and female relatives of the T'u-chüeh and subsequent Turkish rulers."  Peter Benjamin Golden observed that the title qatun appeared among the Göktürks as the title for the khagan's wife and was borrowed from Sogdian xwāten "wife of the ruler"  Earlier, British Orientalist Gerard Clauson (1891–1974) defined xa:tun as "'lady' and the like" and says there is "no reasonable doubt that it is taken from Sogdian xwt'yn (xwatēn), in Sogdian xwt'y ('lord, ruler') and xwt'yn 'lord's or ruler's wife'), "which is precisely the meaning of xa:tun in the early period."  In Uzbek, the language spoken in modern-day Bukhara, Uzbekistan the word is spelled xotin and has come to simply refer to any woman. In Turkish it is written hatun. The general Turkish word for 'woman', kadın, is a doublet derived from the same origin.  In Urdu, the word khatun is used commonly to refer to any woman. The female title khanum is also used as the feminine counterpart of khan.
