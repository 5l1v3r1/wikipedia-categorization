Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the board under the conditions laid down in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Western_Australian_Aborigines_Protection_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Western Australian Aborigines Protection Act\">Aborigines Protection Act</a></i> of 1886.  In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people.  As the board had very limited funds Protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including Resident Magistrates, Jail Wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local Police Inspectors.  The minutes of the board show they mostly dealt with matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from Resident or Police Magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction.\n</p><p>The 1893 <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1893_Education_Act_of_Western_Australia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"1893 Education Act of Western Australia (page does not exist)\">Education Act</a></i> of Western Australia gave white parents the power to object to any Aboriginal child attending any school also attended by their children, a provision which saw Aboriginal children progressively and completely excluded from the state education system.\n</p><p>In 1897, as part of the Western Australian Government's attempt to gain control of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aborigines Department was set up as a result of the <i>Aborigines Act</i> 1897, which had abolished the Aborigines Protection Board.  The Department operated as a subdepartment of the Treasury, with a very small staff under the Chief Protector of Aborigines, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Henry_Charles_Prinsep&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Henry Charles Prinsep (page does not exist)\">Henry Charles Prinsep</a>.  Repeated cuts in finances for the operating budget of the Aborigines Department, partly resulting from the 1905 Aborigines Act, saw this department merged in 1909 to form the Department of Aborigines and Fisheries.\n</p><p>The sixty years from 1881 to the 1940s can be divided into two by the passage of the 1905 Aboriginal Act, which resulted in institutionalised racism and created what amounted to Aboriginal \"concentration camps\" in which the Aboriginal people were to be confined until the race became extinct. It began with the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fairburn_Report&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Fairburn Report (page does not exist)\">Fairburn Report</a> which first drew attention to the \"Aboriginal Problem\".  This institutionalised racism reached its peak in the 1930s.  Children were removed from Aboriginal parents, who were considered \"biologically capable of having children, but not socially capable of raising them\".  This continued beyond this period until well into the 1970s.  The major task confronting Aboriginal people throughout this period was how their cultures could survive.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1943_to_the_present\">1943 to the present</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aboriginal_history_of_Western_Australia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: 1943 to the present\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This period began with the <a href=\"/wiki/1946_Pilbara_strike\" title=\"1946 Pilbara strike\">Great Stockman's Strike of 1946</a>.

The passing of the Mabo and Wik High Court Decisions, which recognised Aboriginal people as in possession of the land at the date of European settlement, is an appendix to these changes.

Most Aboriginal people were living in regional areas, where sexual exploitation of Aboriginal women by whites led to an increasing number of \"degenerate\" mixed-race children who were subsequently abandoned by their fathers.  It led in 1905 to a new Act which extended the definition of Aboriginal to all half-caste[sic] children and made all Aboriginal persons as wards of the state with the Chief Protector of Aborigines made legal guardian in place of the parents, with powers to remove children from their parents' care and place them in custodial situations.\n</p><p>As the Honourable J.M. Drew stated\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it is our duty not to allow these children, whose blood is half-British, to grow up as vagrants and outcasts, as their mothers are now. There is a large number of absolutely worthless black and half-castes[sic] about who grow up to lives of prostitution and idleness; they are a perfect nuisance; if they were taken away from their surroundings of temptation much good might be done with them. There is no power to do this now, consequently a half - caste who possesses few of the virtues and nearly all the vices of whites, grows up to be a mischievous and very immoral subject. This Bill will tend, in a great measure, to remedy this abuse. I may say it may appear to be a cruel thing to tear away an Aborigine child from its mother, but it is necessary in some cases to be cruel to be kind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The 1911 <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aborigines_Act_Amendment_Act&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Aborigines Act Amendment Act (page does not exist)\">Aborigines Act Amendment Act</a></i> significantly extended the Protector's guardianship power to remove Aboriginal children to the 'exclusion of the rights of the mother of an illegitimate or half caste child[sic]'.  In that year 200 Aboriginal people had camped on the fringes of <a href=\"/wiki/Katanning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Katanning\">Katanning</a>, in order to allow their children to get an education, but under the powers of the 1893 Education Act, parents in 1914 demanded that Aboriginal children be excluded from their school, and in 1915 the Katanning white community, acting on its own, had local police remove the Aboriginal <a href=\"/wiki/Fringe_dwellers\" title=\"Fringe dwellers\">fringe dwellers</a> to what was the equivalent of a <a href=\"/wiki/Concentration_camp\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concentration camp\">concentration camp</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Carrolup\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Carrolup\">Carrolup</a>.\n</p><p>In 1915, the appointment of <a href=\"/wiki/A._O._Neville\" title=\"A.

He saw the Aboriginal population of Western Australia as comprising two groups\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Full_blood_Aborigines&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Full blood Aborigines (page does not exist)\">Full blood Aborigines</a>, who were to be segregated from the community in order that they could become extinct.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Half-caste_Aborigines&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Half-caste Aborigines (page does not exist)\">Half-caste Aborigines</a>, who were to be assimilated through intermarriage within the white community as quickly as possible.</li></ul>\n<p>In 1922 in interests of economy and expediency the Carrolup River Native Settlement was shut and inmates transferred to <a href=\"/wiki/Moore_River_Native_Settlement\" title=\"Moore River Native Settlement\">Moore River Native Settlement</a> near <a href=\"/wiki/Moora\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Moora\">Moora</a>, and the Carrolup land taken over by local farmers.\n</p><p>The Moseley Royal Commission heard evidence in 1934 that the Moore River Native Settlement a 'woeful spectacle', buildings over-crowded (by at least 50%), buildings and clothing was vermin ridden, there was no vocational training except for the chores given by staff, the diet lacked all fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs, milk, and health of inmates was seriously affected.  Solitary confinement imprisonment of children in the \"Boob\" was stated to be barbarous and must be stopped.  The Commission ruled that in its present condition it had 'no hope of success' with the children in its care.\n</p><p>Nevertheless Neville continued in his role as Chief Protector to argue before the <a href=\"/wiki/Moseley_Royal_Commission\" title=\"Moseley Royal Commission\">Moseley Royal Commission</a> of 1934 for an extension of his powers, and despite some opposition to this the commission agreed to support his recommendation.  In 1936 Sections 8 and 12 of the new <i><a href=\"/wiki/Native_Administration_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Native Administration Act\">Native Administration Act</a></i> the Chief Protector's guardianship powers were increased still further by a new definition of \"native child\" to mean any child with any Aboriginal descent, and further widened the scope of the Chief Protector's guardianship and therefore jurisdiction over all Aboriginal people in Western Australia.\n</p><p>A new <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Native_Welfare_Act&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Native Welfare Act (page does not exist)\">Native Welfare Act</a></i> in 1954 did nothing to limit these removal powers under the 1936 Act, which continued unabated.  However amendments to the <i>Native Welfare Act</i> in 1963 repealed all previous legislation and abolished the Chief Protector's powers to remove children of Aboriginal descent from their biological parents.  Nevertheless the removal of Aboriginal children continued under the arbitrary implementation of the broad provisions of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Child_Welfare_Act&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Child Welfare Act (page does not exist)\">Child Welfare Act</a> of 1947.\n</p><p>In 1972 a departmental reorganisation resulted in the functions of the then <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Native_Welfare_Department&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Native Welfare Department (page does not exist)\">Native Welfare Department</a> being split between two newly created Departments, the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Aboriginal_Affairs_Planning_Authority&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority (page does not exist)\">Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority</a> (AAPA) and the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Department_of_Community_Welfare&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Department of Community Welfare (page does not exist)\">Department of Community Welfare</a> (now the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Department_for_Community_Development&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Department for Community Development (page does not exist)\">Department for Community Development</a>), responsible for the care and placement of Aboriginal children in the welfare sector.
