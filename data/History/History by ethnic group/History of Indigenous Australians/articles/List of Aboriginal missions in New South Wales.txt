Aboriginal missions, together with reserves and stations, were areas of land in New South Wales where many Aboriginal people were forced to live due to government laws and policies.  The missions were established by religious individuals or churches and they were controlled by those churches and missionaries with limited government involvement.   More than ten missions were established in NSW between 1824 and 1923.   Relocation to missions denied Aboriginal people access to their traditional lands, hunting grounds, and sacred sites, and disrupted kinship systems.      The origin of laws seeking to protect Aboriginal people in the Australian colonies and to provide religious instruction and missionaries can be found in the Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes, (British settlements.) which was presented to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1837.  The missions were primarily run by Christian churches, whose religious teaching and western values greatly influenced day-to-day life for the communities.  In New South Wales, there were two non-denominational Missions, the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) also called the Australian Aborigines' Mission (AAM) and the Australian Inland Mission (AIM).   The United Aborigines Mission published the Australian Aborigines Advocate, a magazine documenting their activities.
