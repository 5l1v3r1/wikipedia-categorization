At Jane Brook, another party of Aboriginal men was found (women and children were seen hiding), who mimicked English calls of \"How do you do!\" and traded spears and womeras for clothing and swans shot by Stirling. Stirling explored as far as Guildford where he commented on the fine alluvial soils. He then sailed south to Albany. Lockyer was eager to return to Sydney with the Success, with Randall, the captive and to get him to stand trial for his crimes of murder and abduction. Stirling reluctantly agreed to allow Lockyer, but refused to allow the sealers and their women on board.

Midgegooroo\u2019s tribe expressed dissatisfaction when it was learned that he had been executed, and two parties of six soldiers each were sent to patrol the Swan and Canning Rivers to protect settlers from angry Aborigines. At the same time, Constable Hunt, together with four soldiers and three colonists were sent to the Upper Swan to capture <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Munday_(Indigenous_Australian)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Munday (Indigenous Australian) (page does not exist)\">Munday</a>, said to be hiding amongst <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Weeip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Weeip (page does not exist)\">Weeip</a>\u2019s people. Shortly afterwards <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> approached George Fletcher Moore at Millendon, and in pidgin English insisted that it was wrong for Aborigines to steal from settlers, and also wrong for whites to kill Aborigines caught stealing. When an Aborigine was killed by a settler, <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> insisted that it was permissible for an Aboriginal to kill the settler, as payback in accordance with their custom. Moore insisted that if a settler was caught stealing he would be shot too, as the Aboriginal had been. If killing and theft stopped, Moore explained there would be peace between the races. In Nyungar <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> explained that the Europeans had come to disrupt the Aboriginal people in their lives, and are fired upon by Europeans in their own country. He declared they would take European lives in revenge for any death of <a href=\"/wiki/Midgegooroo\" title=\"Midgegooroo\">Midgegooroo</a>. The next day Mr Shaw informed <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> that <a href=\"/wiki/Midgegooroo\" title=\"Midgegooroo\">Midgegooroo</a> had been executed. Settlers in Upper Swan seemed to be defying the order to capture him, and Lieutenant Ball gave orders to his servants that <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> was not to be shot. Friendly overtures were extended to <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Weeip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Weeip (page does not exist)\">Weeip</a>, despite the refuge he was giving to Yagan and Munday.</li>\n<li><i>June 1833</i>, the Agricultural Society Meeting discussed the growing problem with Aborigines and suggested specific measures rather than extermination be followed.

The Aborigines were generally friendly. After two failed attempts over an extended period, William shot <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a> in the head, and was immediately speared to death by aborigines accompanying Yagan. James Keats then shot Heegan, one of the other Aboriginals who was about to throw his spear, and aimed at Weeip, also about to throw his spear, but missed. Keat\u2019s brother James, then escaped by swimming the River, and saw a group, including <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Weeip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Weeip (page does not exist)\">Weeip</a>, spearing William repeatedly. William Cruse, after hearing of the affair, accompanied by six others returned to the spot, found the gun had been used also as a club, and then following the sound of crying, found the wounded Heegan and the dead <a href=\"/wiki/Yagan\" title=\"Yagan\">Yagan</a>. Heegan was then shot through the head, to \"put him out of his misery\". The Editor of the Perth Gazette condemned William Keats for his treachery in killing Yagan and warned settlers there would be another round of reprisals from Aborigines. Two weeks later, the Lieutenant Governor issued a proclamation that <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Munday_(Indigenous_Australian)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Munday (Indigenous Australian) (page does not exist)\">Munday</a> was no longer an outlaw as sufficient retribution had been made for the death of the Velvick brothers. James Keats claimed the reward, and Heegan\u2019s family informed others that James Keats would be killed in retribution for the death of Heegan. Lieutenant Bull encouraged Keats to leave the colony on board the Cornwallis.</li>\n<li><i>January 1834</i>, for the February meeting of the Agricultural Society of Guidford, R. M. Lyon gave notice of a motion to set aside lands for the sole use of Aborigines in every district. He said it was incumbent on settlers who had disposed the Aborigines of their lands to do so, and that the Legislative Council effectively secure Aboriginal rights and privileges as promised, including unrestricted fishing and hunting rights on all unclaimed lands. No vote was taken and the matter was deferred until Stirling returned to the colony. Lyon was expelled from the society by members when Stirling had returned.</li>\n<li><i>February 1834</i>, Aboriginal \"theft\" had increased again, and Lieutenant Governor Irwin appointed Captain <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_P%C3%A9gus\" title=\"Peter P\u00e9gus\">Peter P\u00e9gus</a> as an additional Superintendent of Native Tribes, with a staff of four soldiers, with duties to distribute rations and pursue Aboriginal \"offenders\".</li>\n<li><i>April 1834</i> <a href=\"/wiki/Calyute\" title=\"Calyute\">Calyute</a> leads a raid by thirty <a href=\"/wiki/Binjareb\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Binjareb\">Binjareb</a> on Shenton's Mill in <a href=\"/wiki/South_Perth,_Western_Australia\" title=\"South Perth, Western Australia\">South Perth</a>.

A warrant was sought for the arrest of Yeedamira, the leader of the group, who was arrested, but was shot dead on trying to escape from the Barracks. In retaliation <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Weeip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Weeip (page does not exist)\">Weeip</a> and Godaljud led a group to the Barracks where in payback they killed Private Dennis Larkin, one of the soldiers there. A jury found Weeip, Bilyomeri, Goldaljud, Beguin, Gotark, Gregad, and Narrall, all \"guilty of wilful murder\", insisting, contrary to British justice, that the whole group was guilty for a crime perpetrated by one. This was unpopular amongst Upper Swan settlers, who admired Weeip and they petitioned the government claiming that Goodalyat had been the Aboriginal who had speered Larkin.</li>\n<li><i>June 1834</i> Bilyomeri, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Weeip&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Weeip (page does not exist)\">Weeip</a>'s son, captured by Captain Ellis and imprisoned in Fremantle.

To prevent a payback killing from <a href=\"/wiki/Yellagonga\" title=\"Yellagonga\">Yellagonga</a>, or from his son Nandra, who was grieving over the death of hos brother, Stirling ordered the immediate arrest of McKail. Yellagonga was invited to witness his trial. Stirling then acted to seal a peace treaty with the Perth Noongar, distributing fifty loaves of bread, after the celebration of a peace \"kening\" (= Noongar, <i>\"<a href=\"/wiki/Corroboree\" title=\"Corroboree\">corroboree</a>\"</i>)  McKail was eventually let free on a legal technicality. Francis Armstrong secured the peace by ensuring that McKail repaid Yellagonga with food and blankets. McKail was then banished from Perth, and moved to Albany, where he became a well known local settler. The case established an unfortunate precedent, as henceforth an Aborigine's testament was not accepted unless supported by white testimony.</li>\n<li><i>May 1835</i> James Twine, travelling to York was speared, and his companion, Murphy was killed.

Gallop, that night, shot one of the two thieves dead. This ushered in a new and violent turn in the York resistance. Mr Trimmer, and Mr Bland, a government representative were attacked in reprisal and only escaped due to the speed of their horses. Yellagong was attacked as a payback reprisal by Balardong, for these and other white killings of Aborigines in the York area, and two Aboriginal children were killed.</li>\n<li><i>October 1835</i> Dr Collie, with deteriorating heath was given permission to return to Scotland, but with his illness could not leave King George Sound.</li>\n<li><i>8 November 1835</i> Dr Collie dies and was buried, according to his wishes, in the same grave as his friend Mokkare, under what is now the Albany Town Hall.</li>\n<li><i>December 1835</i> Captain <a href=\"/wiki/Frederick_Irwin\" title=\"Frederick Irwin\">Frederick Irwin</a> speaking to the Dublin Branch of the <a href=\"/wiki/London_Missionary_Society\" title=\"London Missionary Society\">London Missionary Society</a> explained the need to \"<a href=\"/wiki/Christian\" title=\"Christian\">Christianise</a> the Natives\".

He was appalled at the way in which settlers were competing amongst themselves by collecting the ears of Aboriginal people they had slain. Balardong Nyungar were retaliating by spearing settlers and stock and burning homesteads. Settlers along the Avon had fenced all of the permanent summer waterholes and were shooting at natives seen inside these fences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated1_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-autogenerated1-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li><i>July 1836</i> Lieutenant Bunbury is transferred from William to York, and becomes involved in killing local Aborigines.

This makes him very unpopular with settlers. Armstrong Records the removal of the Waugal eggs from the Goonininup sacred site at Mount Eliza. The subsequent loss of an anchor at the site led to attempts to get local Aborigines to dive and retrieve it. Wadjuk natives refuse, but a Yed man from Moore diver decides to, but he drowns and his body is not recovered, justifying to the local people that the site is <i>winaitj</i> (sacred).</li>\n<li><i>December 1836</i> The brother of the man shot by Bland, took revenge upon Knott, an old man living alone about 5 kilometres from <a href=\"/wiki/York,_Western_Australia\" title=\"York, Western Australia\">York, Western Australia</a>. Payback shootings and reprisals continued.</li>\n<li><i>1837</i> The British House of Commons committee into the rights of Aboriginal people before the law debated \"should district magistrates be allowed to issue summary punishments?\" as was happening in Western Australia. \"Should Aborigines have the power to appear in court? Could they be represented by Counsel? Have the rights to an interpreter?\"  The Buxton Select Committee on Native Peoples ruled that within the recollections of many living men \"every part of this territory was the undisputed property of the Aborigines\". However, in the establishment of the colonies it did not appear that the \"territorial rights of the natives were considered\" and in fact their claims \"whether as sovereigns or as proprietors of the soil, have been utterly disregarded. The land has been taken from them without the assertion of any title other than that of superior force.\"  This was ruled as contrary to British common law, and the report acknowledged that it must be an oversight. It stated that the effects of this dispossession would continue to be enormous for the settlers of the colony until the injustice had been corrected.</li></ul>\n<dl><dd>Francis Armstrong visits the 8 Wadjuk campsites around Perth and records only 295 people out of the 1500 there were estimated to have lived there at the time of the arrival of the first settlers 7 years before. The smallest groups were those in greatest proximity to the white settlements. This would seem to indicate that contact with the <a href=\"/wiki/Djanga\" title=\"Djanga\">Djanga</a> (Spirits of the dead = the name given to the settlers) was proving fatal to Aboriginal groups, through killings and reprisals, starvation, or disease, and there may have also been elevated intra-Aboriginal payback killings with a rising rate of accusation for sorcery \u2013 (a result of the increase inexplicable to Aboriginal people, of the rise in fatal diseases).  Neville Green<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> also believes there may have been a deliberate wish to avoid contact, amongst people who still had a viable culture.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Stirling warns the York settlers to have no dealings with Aboriginal people, trying to \"impress on every European the necessity  there is by keeping arms in [working] order\". As a result, Heal, a local \"settler\" set his dogs against a group of women trying to access what had been their local waterhole. The women were obliged to seek safety in a deep pool. A reprisal spearing of Heal, obtained whilst working with his partner, on Mr Burns, was prevented from becoming fatal by Mrs Burns threatening the attackers with a gun. Despite an offer of reward the \"aggressors\" were never captured. A corroboree and an offer of restitution by two men, brought the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. The new Government resident in York only made matters worse, when he arrested the two men supposedly involved and sent them to Perth for trial. One died along the way as a result of the brutality of his treatment in white hands initiated a new round of violence. Peter Chidlow and Edward Jones, were speared by Balardong Noongar, who had believed they had been deliberately tricked into taking lime instead of flour. Woods, a York settler, left a poisoned damper for Aboriginal people, and other gifts of poisoned flour were the cause of another round of reprisals.</dd></dl>\n<ul><li><i>May 1837</i> Giustiniani protested against George Moore sentencing an Aboriginal for 7 years for stealing one bunch of grapes, growing on what had until 1829 been his own land.</li>\n<li><i>June 1837</i> Yellagonga's wife was arrested on a trifling charge and forced to sleep on a cold stone floor without a blanked or any heating at all.

Today Aboriginal people are still awaiting their Treaty, and only 151 years later were their land rights legally acknowledged.</li>\n<li><i>August 1841</i> The Aborigines who had remained at Goonininup (the Swan Brewery site) since the closure of the Aboriginal Feeding Station there, were moved to an Anglican run camp site at Jane Brook (the \"West Australian Missionary Society\" mission site) where the Reverend Giustianini's mission school was reopened under the control of Abraham Jones. Subsequently, an Anglican Aboriginal school on similar lines was opened in Fremantle by Revd George King. An influenza outbreak that year killed 11 of the Abraham Jones's school's 23 students, making parents very reluctant to have their children educated there. At this camp are the first recorded Aboriginal cases of venereal disease and tuberculosis as well as influenza. The diseases were subsequently to sweep through Aboriginal populations in the state.</li>\n<li><i>1840</i> Governor Hutt announced a land bounty as a remission of a land purchase price for those white settlers who consent to train Aborigines.

Also an Act was passed, establishing Rottnest as a prison, although the Governor states that it was to be a training establishment to domesticate and prepare Aborigines for employment. Stirling's \"rations\" for Aborigines displaced by settlement, were reduced to 500 grams of flour per month, only given in return for good behaviour. Eventually it was cut out altogether, forcing Aboriginal people to seek labouring jobs from the people who had seized their land.</li>\n<li><i>1842</i> Crown versus Wewar tries the first Aboriginal for a tribal killing. After being found guilty Wewar was transported to Rottnest. Henry Trigg accompanied him to the island to build the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Rottnest_lighthouse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Rottnest lighthouse (page does not exist)\">Rottnest lighthouse</a>, and learned that Wewar was perplexed at the governors displeasure. He stated that Aboriginal people never interfered with white ways of murders, why should whites interfere with what was a traditional Aboriginal matter. This precedent was to have a disastrous effect upon Noongar and other Aboriginal group's marriage customs, as Aboriginals who made <i>winnaitj</i> or <i>mundju</i> illegal liaisons, and would have been punished by losing their lives, now could make incestuous liaisons  formerly outlawed by kinship principles, with impunity. Those enforcing the punishments were now not allowed to and were themselves punished by European courts, and could be tried and hanged. \"<i>Winnaitj</i>\" marriages proliferated, as traditional law gets flouted. Henry Trigg reported seeing Aboriginal prisoners at Rottnest weeping at the sight of cooking fire smoke from relatives cooking on the mainland. In York, Barrow resigns as Protector of the Aborigines to be replaced by R. H. Bland, who took a very punitive attitude to the local Balardong.</li>\n<li><i>10 June 1843</i> Death of Yellagonga, by drowning.</li>\n<li><i>1843</i> Father John Brady visits Western Australia and writes to Rome appealing for missionaries to be sent to the natives of Western Australia. Charles Symmonds, Protector of Aborigines, has the northern Aborigines Eanna and Bokoberry arrested and confined to Rottnest to <i>\"teach them, outwardly at least, to conform to our social regulations\"</i>. Those who had acquired farming skills in Rottnest gardens, and assisted in harvesting salt, were given early pardon and allowed to return home. Wollaston noted that large numbers of Aborigines in the south west were dying from epidemics.</li>\n<li><i>1844</i> Aboriginal school was shifted to Wanneroo. George Shenton, as Governor of the School, reports that it is hard work trying to destroy the natural habits of Aboriginal bush life. Cultural genocide was the educational policy and was now firmly established.</li>\n<li><i>1846</i> <a href=\"/wiki/George_Grey\" title=\"George Grey\">George Grey</a> leaves Western Australia. Writing of his experiences in the state, he said that despite those who treat Aborigines as inferior, that they were \"as apt and intelligent as any race of men that I am acquainted with\". His experience with indigenous people was to deepen throughout his life until as Governor of New Zealand he insisted in the New Zealand Constitution that seats be reserved for Maoris in the new Parliament.</li>\n<li><i>1847</i> 8,000 kangaroo skins exported from Albany.</li>\n<li><i>1851</i> Few Balardong in the York district were left, and they were ravaged by starvation, venereal disease and influenza.</li>\n<li><i>1852</i> Systematic raiding by Aborigines of cattle in the <a href=\"/wiki/Geraldton\" title=\"Geraldton\">Geraldton</a> area continues into 1853. It would seem that from 1829 some 30 European settlers in Western Australia had been killed by this time and another 34 had been wounded. No record was kept of aboriginal casualties but a ratio of 10\u201320 times this number is suggested.</li>\n<li><i>1877</i> Just before her death Pangieran a.k.a. Mary Alice Cuper, who was an expert Morse Code operator trained another Aboriginal woman Mary Sarah Ninak, to take her place.

It began with the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fairburn_Report&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Fairburn Report (page does not exist)\">Fairburn Report</a> which first drew attention to the \"Aboriginal Problem.\"  This institutionalised racism, like the racism of the Nazi period in Germany, the racism of the southern states of the USA, and the racism of South Africa, reached its peak in the 1930s. The \"final solution to the Aboriginal problem\" was to take all children from Aboriginal parents, who were considered as \"biologically capable of having children, but not socially capable of raising them.\"  This \"solution\" continued beyond this period until well into the 1970s. The major task confronting Aboriginal people throughout this period was how their cultures could survive.\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>1881</i> C.D.F. Foss appointed magistrate and with a company of police troops and 3 Aboriginal trackers, he travelled across the Gascoyne investigating complaints and imposing sentences that were later shown to be illegal and excessive. Pastoralists had made Aboriginal people de facto slaves on their own land, in contravention of British law. By marking a cross on a \"contract,\" Aboriginal people were forced to work as a shepherd, shearer, shed hand, domestic servant or concubine. Once \"assigned\" the men and women were considered the \"property\" of the station, and could be arrested and sent back by the police if they \"absconded.\"  Consistent absconders had their feet burned or were branded by their master's initial. The Fairburn Report, which reported on these abuses was howled down by angry pastoralists in Parliament. Aboriginal labour in the state was recorded as 1,640 men and 706 women, nearly 7% of the total white population of the time, estimated at 30,013 people.</li>\n<li><i>June 1881</i> The first judicial court held on Brockman's station. Four Aboriginal men were tried and sentenced to be transported to Rottnest Island. Aboriginal resistance in the north grew in intensity. Gascoyne, Lyons and the Upper Minilya tribes were said to be the worst in the state. Charles Gayle asked that the government to shut its eyes for 6 months and he would put an end to the depredations by exterminating the troublemakers.</li>\n<li><i>1882</i> Flogging of Aboriginal prisoners on Rottnest was legalised, although it had already been abolished for whites. John Forrest spoke in favour of the punishment. Only the cat-of-nine-tails was prohibited, but its use continued, being used at the Moore River settlement at least until 1940. It was admitted in the Legislative Council that the great majority of convictions of Aboriginal people to Rottnest, had been illegal. Governor Ord intervened and a large number of Aboriginal people were released from custody. Alexander Crawfords, running a sheep station in the Murchison, and writing to his fiance, Lillie Matthews in Victoria, wrote of the continuous way in which whites \"in arms\" were engaged in \"nigger hunts.\"  Lillie was horrified at the brutality he so casually described. The Gold Rushes brought still more unattached men to Western Australia, many contracting both legal and de facto marriages with Aboriginal women. Typical was Anderson, a Fin, who married Lucy Bobbinet, and having three children before she was abandoned by her husband in 1899.</li>\n<li><i>1883</i> The Attorney General, Hensman, introduces a bill to parliament to extend the powers of Magistrates in the north, and to legalise all questionable sentences to Rottnest Island that had occurred. The Colonial Secretary, Malcolm Fraser, said at the second reading speech, the bill was intended to \"affirm the convictions made by Mr Foss at the Gascoyne\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>  A Commission of Inquiry into the treatment of Aboriginal prisoners on Rottnest confirmed that the identifying disks on prisoners were sometimes exchanged, resulting in the alteration of sentences, and the release of prisoners often in alien territory from which they were then forbidden to leave. Over 179 Rottnest island prisoners, mostly from the north, were in conditions so overcrowded that more than 60 died from a bout of influenza. The second great measles epidemic entered the state via Albany, spreading to Bunbury, York, Fremantle, Perth, Geraldton and Carnarvon. Ten died at New Norcia as a result, and with a combined influenza outbreak, it combined to kill 64 prisoners at Rottnest. In this year Victoria River station, in the Kimberley, was stocked for the first time.</li>\n<li><i>1884</i> Alexander Forrest publishes his report on the Kimberley expedition, estimating that some 10,000,000 acres (40,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) are available for grazing sheep and cattle. Just before Forrest had left Darwin, the Commissioner of Crown Lands had been presented with 26 applications to take up the most promising lands in the Kimberley. Adam Johns and Phil Saunders, following Forrest's route, discovered Gold at Halls Creek. David Carly wrote to England saying \"the whole system of Horrors as is done to the Natives\" would continue until the \"Home Government send someone here who has got a mind that will not be ruled by a few Settlers whose Heart is set on getting Gold by any means\". In Bridgetown, a third Aboriginal reserve of 100 acres (0.40&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) was established.</li>\n<li><i>1885</i> The Duracks settle Lissadell station in the Kimberleys. E.T. Hardiman, the government geologist, confirms the find of Halls Creek gold. Fifteen men at the field clash with local Aborigines, but resistance to miners declined as the numbers increased. An amendment to the Dog Act states that Aboriginal people in the state are only allowed one dog and then only if it is licensed. Most Aboriginal people in the state could not afford the license, and so police could shoot any Aboriginal hunting dog any time they wished.</li>\n<li><i>January 1885</i> Henry Parry, the Anglican Archbishop lodged for new \"mission reserves\" to be established for the Vasse, Murchison, Ashburton and Gascoyne. He welcomes the Rev. J.B. Gribble and sends him to work amongst the Aborigines in the Gascoyne. Gribble arrives in Perth and is introduced to the Governor, Sir Napier Broome. He is given letters of introduction to Maitland Brown and Alexander Forrest. On arriving in Carnarvon Gribble was welcomed by Foss the Magistrate, however, at the time he witnessed six Aboriginal men and one Aboriginal woman, chained by the neck to a tree, awaiting the magistrates visit, still some weeks away. Thirty seven men were chained inside a tin shed in the summer heat. Moving to the Kimberley, Gribble discovered that police raiding parties, along the Fitzroy were organised to keep the pearling industry supplied with \"blackbirded\" Aborigines to work on the luggers, in contravention of the earlier Pearl Shell Fisheries Act. Many pastoralists and jackeroos had taken Aboriginal concubines, but any girl who tried to run away was rounded up and escorted by police back to her \"master\". Finding no support amongst locals to end these practices Gribble travelled back to Perth to publicise what he had found. The uproar was huge. Rather than alienate those pastoralists who were contributing to the building of St Georges Cathedral, Bishop Parry decided to sacrifice Gribble to the indignation of the pastoralists.</li>\n<li><i>December 1885</i> a meeting of pastoralists in Carnarvon appoint Brockman, Maitland Brown and others to condemn Gribble's missionary work. Nothing changed. There was still no attempt to properly establish guilt of Aboriginal people \"sentenced\" to Rottnest from the north. For instance on 28 December men were found a quarter of a mile away from speared cattle and were found guilty of an offence without any evidence being presented, and were sentenced to 2 years on Rottnest</li>\n<li><i>January 1886</i> A petition is circulated to have Gribble removed. Gribble travelled then to Victoria, trying to drum up support against the WA pastoralists of the Gascoyne, and entertained people to packed halls with the stories of the atrocities he had witnessed. So grim were the reports that women and children were refused admittance. In his talks he exposed the widespread practice of \"child labour\" and condemned the \"assignment system\" as slavery. He protested the abuses of the court system in Carnarvon, where it was admitted that convictions against Aboriginals were secured with a single uncorroborated word of any settler, with the person being transported to Rottnest, often to die. Gribble reported that he had been shot at in the bush and nearly lynched when sailing to Perth. When he was met by \"Christian communicants\" in Fremantle, he was told that Aboriginal people should be treated \"only as horses or dogs\". Winthrop Hackett, then Editor of the Western Australian called Gribble \"a lying, canting humbug,\" and Gribble sued him for libel. At the height of the controversy, Governor Broome classified as confidential a series of reports from the Government Resident of Roebourne, Lieutenant Colonel E. F. Angelo, documenting the slavery and murder perpetrated by local pearlers, settlers, and the local magistrate, who was offering to kidnap Aborigines for the pearlers at a cost of five pounds a head, or to shoot them for 2s 6p each. \"The fears of the whites\" he wrote, was \"more a cause of disorder than the aggression of the blacks.\"  About 6-700 Aborigines were then used in diving off the pearling luggers. Had these reports been made available Gribble would have won his case against Hackett, but he lost, and in disgrace, Gribble left the state, and publishes \"Dark Deeds in a Sunny Land\" a fierce castigation of his opponents that created a furore so that the welfare of the Aboriginals was obscured by much blackening of reputations until the 1905 Aboriginal Act.</li>\n<li><i>1886</i> Following the furor over the Fairburn Report and the work of the Rev. John Gribble, parliament introduced the Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (WA) which established the Aboriginal Protection Board with five members and a secretary, all of whom were nominated by the Governor. Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the board under the conditions laid down in the Aborigines Protection Act of 1886. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people. As the board had very limited funds Protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including Resident Magistrates, Jail Wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local Police Inspectors. The minutes of the board show they mostly dealt with matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from Resident or Police Magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction. It introduced employment contracts between employers and Aboriginal workers over the age of 14. There was no provision in the 1886 WA Act for contracts to include wages. However, employees were to be provided with \"substantial, good and sufficient rations,\" clothing and blankets. The 1886 WA Act provided a Resident Magistrate with the power to indenture 'half-caste' and Aboriginal children, from a suitable age, until they turned 21. An Aboriginal Protection Board, was also established to prevent the abuses reported earlier, but rather than protect Aborigines, it mainly succeeded in putting them under tighter government control. It was intended to enforce contracts, employment of prisoners and apprenticeships, but there was not sufficient power to enforce clauses in the north, and they were openly flouted. The Act defined as \"Aboriginal\" \"every Aboriginal native of Australia, every Aboriginal half-caste, or child of a half-caste\". Governor Broome insisted that the act contain within it a clause permitting traditional owners to continue hunting on their tribal lands. The effect of the Act was to give increasing power to the Board over Aboriginal people, rather than setting up a system to punish whites for wrongdoing in relation to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal Department was set up, under the office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines. Nearly half of the Legislative Council voted to amend the act for contract labour as low as 10 but it was defeated. Mackenzie Grant, the member for the north claimed that child labour of 6 or 7 was a necessary commonplace, as \"in this way they gradually become domesticated.\"  The Atourney General Septimus Burt, in debate on the 2nd reading speech, claimed that contracts were being issued, not for current work, but to hold Aboriginal people as slaves on stations for potential future work, and so prevent them from being free to leave.</li>\n<li><i>1886</i> dealings with \"natives\" in Western Australia had been the responsibility of the British <a href=\"/wiki/Colonial_Office\" title=\"Colonial Office\">Colonial Office</a>.

The Department operated as a sub-department of the Treasury, with a very small staff under the Chief Protector of Aborigines.

This Bill will tend, in a great measure, to remedy this abuse.
