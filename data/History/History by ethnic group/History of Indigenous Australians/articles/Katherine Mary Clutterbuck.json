Now referred to as \"Sister Kate\", Clutterbuck worked with orphans in the London slums for 17 years until 1901 when she and several other sisters were sent to <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Australia\" title=\"Western Australia\">Western Australia</a> to establish a girls' school and orphanage.  She arrived in Western Australia in December 1901 with Sister Sarah and 22 <a href=\"/wiki/Orphaned\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Orphaned\">orphaned</a> English children aged between 6 and 10 in her care.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>While the other sisters of her order set about the establishment of founding a church school (now <a href=\"/wiki/Perth_College,_Western_Australia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Perth College, Western Australia\">Perth College</a>), Clutterbuck and Sister Sarah set out to establish a home for orphaned babies. Temporary premises in William Street, <a href=\"/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Perth, Western Australia\">Perth</a> were used while a permanent children's home in the country was located.  The nuns purchased a 20-acre (8.1&#160;ha) block at <a href=\"/wiki/Parkerville,_Western_Australia\" title=\"Parkerville, Western Australia\">Parkerville</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Darling_Range\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Darling Range\">Darling Range</a>.  Clutterbuck took up residence in 1903 with eight children in an old hut and bark roofed barn which she named The League of Charity Homes for Waifs and Stray Babies and which was later expanded to become Parkerville Children's Home.   Forty-five children were being fostered by 1905 and, thanks to a benefactor, <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Padbury\" title=\"Walter Padbury\">Walter Padbury</a>, a large stone nursery was built.  Other improvements included a 6000-gallon (27,000-litre) water tank and 120 acres (50 ha) of land partially planted with fruit trees as well as a carriage and horse.  The state government provided some funding and by 1911, 100 children were living there.  Another two sisters were recruited from England and the building were extended to include a dining-room, schoolhouse and kitchen.\n</p><p>For nearly 30 years Clutterbuck ran the home where over 800 disadvantaged children passed through her care.  In 1927 the home was taken over by the Diocese of Perth and in 1930 she retired at the age of 70.  She was awarded an MBE the following year.\n</p><p>Parkerville continues to be operated today as accommodation for disadvantaged children.  A small river in the vicinity of the home is named Clutterbuck Creek.<span class=\"plainlinks nourlexpansion\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Katherine_Mary_Clutterbuck&amp;params=31_52_20_S_116_8_10_E_type:landmark&amp;title=Parkerville+Children%27s+Home\"><span class=\"geo-default\"><span class=\"geo-dms\" title=\"Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location\"><span class=\"latitude\">31\u00b052\u203220\u2033S</span> <span class=\"longitude\">116\u00b08\u203210\u2033E</span></span></span><span class=\"geo-multi-punct\">&#xfeff; / &#xfeff;</span><span class=\"geo-nondefault\"><span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"geo-dec\" title=\"Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location\">31.87222\u00b0S 116.13611\u00b0E</span><span style=\"display:none\">&#xfeff; / <span class=\"geo\">-31.87222; 116.13611</span></span><span style=\"display:none\">&#xfeff; (<span class=\"fn org\">Parkerville Children's Home</span>)</span></span></span></a></span>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Return_from_retirement_and_the_Stolen_Generations\">Return from retirement and the Stolen Generations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Katherine_Mary_Clutterbuck&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Return from retirement and the Stolen Generations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Friend and associate Ruth Lefroy shared an interest in the welfare of Aboriginal children.  In 1932, Lefroy purchased a property in Neville Street, <a href=\"/wiki/Bayswater,_Western_Australia\" title=\"Bayswater, Western Australia\">Bayswater</a> called the Children's Cottage Home which was run by Clutterbuck.  Another house used as a holiday home was acquired in Beach Street, <a href=\"/wiki/Mosman_Park,_Western_Australia\" title=\"Mosman Park, Western Australia\">Mosman Park</a>.  The home was funded by government subsidies from the Native Welfare and Child Welfare Departments, as well as f\u00eates, jumble sales, donations and street collections.\n</p><p>At this time <a href=\"/wiki/A._O._Neville\" title=\"A. O. Neville\">A. O. Neville</a>, the government <a href=\"/wiki/Protector_of_Aborigines\" title=\"Protector of Aborigines\">Chief Protector of Aboriginals</a>, was the architect of an official scheme which oversaw the care, custody and education of Aboriginal and half-caste children under 16 years in the state.  The scheme's purpose was to integrate young and part Aboriginal children into white society by separating them from their families.  The process by which the separation was done has been widely condemned since a report entitled <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bringing_Them_Home\" title=\"Bringing Them Home\">Bringing Them Home</a></i> was published in 1997 following a federal government inquiry.  These people are now known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Stolen_Generations\" title=\"Stolen Generations\">Stolen Generations</a>.\n</p><p>As part of the scheme, Neville directed young Aboriginal children and babies into the Children's Cottage Home run by Clutterbuck.\n</p><p>In June 1934, Clutterbuck and Ruth Lefroy relocated the home with ten school-aged children to a new site on Railway Street (now Treasure Road), <a href=\"/wiki/Queens_Park,_Western_Australia\" title=\"Queens Park, Western Australia\">Queens Park</a>.  The new six-roomed home was named \"Myola\" and had been purpose built with the help of private sponsorship.  Due to a <a href=\"/wiki/Measles\" title=\"Measles\">measles</a> epidemic, the cottage was soon extended to create a ward where sick children could be isolated and nursed.  In 1935 a kitchen and a second cottage, \"Friendly Cottage\", were built on the site to accommodate younger children.  At this time Queens Park was a relatively undeveloped suburb although the cottage was well located with a school and <a href=\"/wiki/Queens_Park_railway_station,_Perth\" title=\"Queens Park railway station, Perth\">train station</a> nearby.  Towards the end of 1936, Neville began negotiations on behalf of Clutterbuck for the purchase of land immediately adjacent to the home.  An adjoining 5.25 acres (2 hectares) was acquired at a cost of \u00a385 in January 1937 using funds donated by a benefactor.  The same person also donated funds to extend the second cottage and to build a third cottage and a chapel. This third cottage was known as \"Nursery Cottage\" and the chapel was named the \"Chapel of the Guardian Angel\".\n</p><p>Neville supposedly reproached Sister Kate for building the chapel, suggesting that the funds should have been spent on the children.\n</p><p>Church services, Sunday School and daily prayers were conducted in the new chapel on a regular basis. A morning service conducted by Sister Kate was conducted each morning. The chapel was very important to Sister Kate: according to Vera Whittington\n</p>\n<table class=\"cquote pullquote\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"margin:auto; border-collapse: collapse; border: none; background-color: transparent; width: auto;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 20px; vertical-align: top; border: none; color: #B2B7F2; font-size: 40px; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, Times, serif; font-weight: bold; line-height: .6em; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px;\">\u201c\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;\"><i>Even in her last years, when she no longer took the services, it was her delight to walk to the chapel for private devotions.

In 1937, fund-raising by a group known as the  'Virgillians', led by <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Durack\" title=\"Mary Durack\">Mary Durack</a>, enabled further development of the site and in 1938\u201341 a <a href=\"/wiki/Kindergarten\" title=\"Kindergarten\">kindergarten</a> and another cottage were constructed.\n</p><p>With the onset of World War 2 most of the children were evacuated to the Duke of York Hotel at <a href=\"/wiki/Greenbushes,_Western_Australia\" title=\"Greenbushes, Western Australia\">Greenbushes</a>. Some children required specialised medical attention and attendance at Perth hospitals however, and so Ruth Lefroy purchased a cottage at <a href=\"/wiki/Roleystone,_Western_Australia\" title=\"Roleystone, Western Australia\">Roleystone</a>.  After the war, the Roleystone property was sold and the proceeds used to pay for the construction of 'Memorial cottage'.\n</p><p>In 1946, funds from the <a href=\"/wiki/Lotteries_Commission_of_Western_Australia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lotteries Commission of Western Australia\">Lotteries Commission</a> helped build 'Gran's Cottage' (as she was then known) as a private residence for Sister Kate.  Soon after however, she died suddenly at <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tresillian_Hospital&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Tresillian Hospital (page does not exist)\">Tresillian Hospital</a> in Nedlands at the age of 86.\n</p><p>Most of her foster-children were with her from babyhood to maturity: they called her 'Mum', and in later years 'Gran'.  She was not a big woman and was said to have an English complexion, and radiated kindliness with a quiet strength that won respect and confidence from young and old.  Always full of sympathy, she had a kindly understanding nature and was always able to offer advice for the children which she treated as her own.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Posthumous_events\">Posthumous events</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Katherine_Mary_Clutterbuck&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Posthumous events\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A committee then administered the home, with the position of Superintendent Matron taken over by Ruth Lefroy.  The Queens Park complex, which by this time comprised seven cottages as well as the chapel and kindergarten, became known as \"Sister Kate's Children's Cottages\" in recognition of her work.
