 The Australian Aboriginal Progress Association (AAPA) was an early Indigenous Australian organisation focused on aboriginal rights. It was founded in 1924, publicly announced the following year, and based out of Surry Hills.   Its leadership, Fred Maynard and Tom Lacey, were inspired by the ideas of Marcus Garvey, and Maynard had been involved in another organisation, the Coloured Progressive Association, a decade earlier.   The AAPA eventually expanded to 11 branches and over 500 active members. By the end of 1927 the association had been dissolved.
