  The Aborigines Progressive Association (APA ) was established in 1937 by William Ferguson and Jack Patten in Dubbo, New South Wales.   Ferguson led a group in the western part of the state, while Patten assembled an alliance of activists in the north-east. Both wings of the APA were involved in political organisation, rallies, and protests in both Aboriginal communities and reserves and major NSW centres such as Sydney.  In 1938 the APA organised the Day of Mourning on Australia Day of that year to protest the lack of basic human rights available to Aborigines.  It was held at the Australian Hall building, Sydney.  The APA ceased to exist in 1944, but was revived in 1963-1966.
