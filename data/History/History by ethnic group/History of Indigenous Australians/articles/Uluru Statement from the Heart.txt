The Uluru Statement from the Heart  was released 26 May 2017 by delegates to a Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Referendum Convention held near Uluru in Central Australia. The statement calls for a ‘First Nations Voice’ in the Australian Constitution and a ‘Makarrata Commission’ to supervise a process of ‘agreement-making’ and ‘truth-telling’ between government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  The statement references the 1967 referendum which brought about changes to the Constitution of Australia to include indigenous Australians. A 16-member Referendum Council was jointly appointed on 7 December 2015 by the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition to advise the government on steps towards a referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution.  More than 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from around Australia were delegates at the 2017 First Nations National Constitutional Convention at Uluru where they adopted the Uluru Statement from the Heart with a standing ovation.   This article incorporates text available under the CC BY 4.0 license. The official painted and signed canvas of the Statement was presented to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the leader of the opposition, Bill Shorten, at the Indigenous Garma festival in north-east Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.  The Statement was also on display alongside musician John Butler at the Woodford folk festival in Queensland.
