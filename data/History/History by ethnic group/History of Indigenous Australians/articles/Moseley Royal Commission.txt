  The Moseley Royal Commission, officially titled the Royal Commission Appointed to Investigate, Report and Advise Upon Matters in Relation to the Condition and Treatment of Aborigines was a Royal Commission established by the Government of Western Australia in 1934 to hear evidence regarding the treatment of Aboriginal people.  The Royal Commission was to examine proposals to extend the powers of A. O. Neville, the "Chief Protector of Aborigines", and the social policy of removal of children from their parents. Agitation by critics and the resulting media coverage in London  and locally  had brought attention to the Native Administration Act 1905â€“1936 (WA) Amendment(1911) and to actions by Neville. A series of submissions detailing accusations of child slavery, abuse and mistreatment and the evidence was given by mothers of the removed children. The commission produced a report citing problems with the policy, but concluding to continue with the recommendations of Neville.
