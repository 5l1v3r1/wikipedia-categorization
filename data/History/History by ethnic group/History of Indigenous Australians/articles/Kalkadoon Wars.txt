  The Kalkadoon Wars were a series of encounters between European colonists and the Kalkadoon people of Australia. Europeans started settling in the Kalkadoon's homelands around 1860. At first relations were peaceful but as numbers of new settlers increased, things became more hostile and the Kalkadoons eventually resorted to guerrilla war.  In 1884 the Kalkadoons killed five native police and a prominent pastoralist. The Queensland government sent in heavily armed police and ended up fighting the Kalkadoon at Battle Mountain. The Europeans were ultimately victorious.
