The Nhuwala are an indigenous Australian people of the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Where Nhuwala fits into the classification of Australian Aboriginal languages has not yet been ascertained with absolute certainty due to lack of data, though the working assumption is that it belongs to the Ngayarta family.    According to Norman Tindale, the Nhuwala tribal lands covered an estimated 2,200 sq. miles, approximately along the coastal plain, and extending inland some 40 miles, from the vicinity of Cape Preston, close to the area where the Fortescue River flows into the Indian Ocean, southwest from Onslow. The hinterland reaches stopped short of the Thalanyji territory at the Ashburton River.
