Mordechai Zaken in his PHD and forthcoming book discusses the three main clashes in which the Assyrian Christians were engaged, with the tribal Kurds (1843\u201346), with the Turks, the Kurds and the Persians (during and following WWI) and with the Iraqi Arabs (during 1933).<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The first major clash could be attributed in part to the presence and involvement of western Christian missionaries in the tribal politics in Kurdistan. The Hakk\u0101r\u012b region, today in Southeast Turkey, witnessed in 1843 an unprecedented outburst of animosity between Kurds and Christians. Atiya regarded \u201cthe horrors\u201d of the massacre of 1843 as \u201cthe worst since the ravages of Timur Lane.\u201d  The massacres in Nestorian villages by Muslim Kurds were described as \u201cthe ugliest, which the Nestorians of Kurdistan had experienced since the Mongol invasion.\u201d Joseph stressed that it was \u201cthe first major conflict between native Christians and Muslims in modern times.\u201d  Contemporary observers and scholars estimate that between four and ten thousand Assyrians in the Hakkari region were massacred in 1843, when Bader Khan the M\u012br of Bohtan invaded their region.  After a later massacre in 1846, the Turks who were in a midst of re-centralization policy of gaining the power back from tribal leaders and peripheral principalities, were further pushed by the western powers into intervening in the Kurdish region.\nThe interaction between the missionaries, the Kurdish chieftains, and the Assyrian Patriarch, at this critical time, had been important to the understanding of the subject discussed in this volume. Already in 1836, from the American mission in Urmia, the American missionary Justin Perkins wrote the Assyrian Patriarch in Kochanes, expressing an interest to act amongst his people. Three years later, Dr. Asahel Grant, the partner of Perkins, vested the patriarch for the first time. During his visit he treated Mir Nurallah Beg and managed to cure him of an illness. At that time Nurallah Beg resided in Bashqala while his nephew and rival, Suleyman, lived in the fortress of Julamerk.  Mar Shimon sided with Suleyman, because he was an ally of his late father. Consequently, he won the hostility of Nurallah. According to Yonan \"The arrival of the foreign missionaries disturbed this delicate historical balance.  While the native Christians viewed their Western counterparts as a source of strength, the Kurds considered them a harbinger of decay for their autonomous feudal power. \"\nIn the midst of this tribal rivalry, Nurallah traveled to Erzerum to mobilize the support of the Turkish pasha, as he wished to reduce Mar Shimon power. He also counted on the support of several Christian Maleks, who were against the concentration of power (both spiritual and temporal) within the patriarch family. On Dr. Grant's third visit, in 1841, he visited both Mar Shimun and Suleyman, albeit he did not visit Nurallah. The Kurdish tribesmen interpreted Grant's activities quite differently. Nurallah had Mar Shimon's residence burned down during his absence as a sign of warning. However, in 1842, on his fourth journey, Dr. Grant visited Nurallah and negotiated with him the establishment of several mission stations in the tribal region of Tiyari, in Ashita. It should be noted that Grant did not bother to ask they did not officially recognize the approval from the Ottoman authorities, as the Nestorian millet. 1842 was the year during which the alliance between Badr Khan Beg, the powerful Kurdish Mir of the Bohtan region and Nurallah Beg of Hakkari was fortified. They planned a campaign against the Turkish governor Mohammed Pasha of Mosul, from whom Ismail Pasha of Amadiya won his town back in the summer of 1842. These occurrences happened during the time that the Turkish authorities had been engaged in re-centralization campaign that aimed at re-claim the power from the princes of the principalities. Several Christian chieftains supported the Kurdish alliance, as they were in rivalry with Mar Shimon, who preferred to seek support from the Turkish Pasha. According to Yonan, an Assyrian scholar, it is possible that due to Grant's influence, Mar Shimon placed greater trust in the Turks and the European protectors, whose representatives sought contact with him ever more frequently.\" Mohammed Pasha of Mosul assured Dr. Grant that he would assist the Assyrians against the Kurds in case of an invasion. In the meantime, the American mission station was opened in Ashita in September 1842 in a building constructed more as a fortress than a mission station. Meanwhile, the Kurds lost out to Mohammed Pasha and were forced to retreat. As a result, their hostility towards Mar Shimon grew, while Mohammed Pasha did not feel oblige to protect him. \nIn the fall of 1842, the English missionary G. P. Badger., who warned him about the American mission, whose church he considered dissident, visited Mar Shimon. During his visit, a letter from Nurallah Beg arrived, asking a meeting with the patriarch. Mar Shimon refused, apparently on the advice of Badger. He was determined to depend only on the Ottoman government and its allies.  Following Badger\u2019s departure, the disaster for the Nestorians in the isolated province took its course, and the government did not provide any support at all. Nurallah Beg decided to set out on a punitive expedition against the Nestorian tribes, and he came to an agreement with Badr Khan of Bohtan, having obtained the approval of the Turkish governor of Mosul beforehand. Though he was supposedly obliged to Mar Shimon, at least morally, for the defeat of the Kurds, Mohammed Pasha gave no second thought to keeping his promise to him. Dr. Grant played a bizarre part in this conflict. He was in the company of none other than Nurallah Beg during the preparations of the attacks on the Nestorians.  He looked at himself as a \"neutral mediator\" who should not mingle in local affairs. Yonan thinks that he \"was not even aware that he himself had brought on the conflict.\" During ten days, he was an eyewitness for the preparations for the invasion, but he seemed satisfied with the promise that Mar Shimon's property and his residence would be spared and treated as a sanctuary.  Only following Grant\u2019s departure, the allied Kurdish tribes attacked Tiyari in an attack that wiped out fifth of the Nestorian population. \nA year later, Dr. Grant died of cholera in Mosul and his mission fort in Ashita was destroyed. Mar Shimun Abraham, the contemporary Patriarch (from 1820 to 1861), would spend a decade in exile in Persia. He returned embittered towards the foreigners and hostile to foreign missions. He cautioned his bishops in Jilu, Gavar, Berwar and Shamsdinan against working with them, but his influence on the diocese in Persia was too weak to prevent this.  The details of the clashes and massacres of the Assyrians had been depicted by contemporary observers. The following passages are from a report of the English missionary G.P.Badger:\"Early in the month of May [1843] I received a letter from Mar Shimun, in which he informed me that the combined forces of Badr Khan Beg and the Hakkari Emeer were about to make war upon the Nestorians, or to attack the Berwari district within the jurisdiction of Mohammed Pasha of Mosul, and to charge them with the invasion.  On the 4th  of June I received another letter in which the Patriarch thus describes the execution of this long-projected scheme: \"If you inquire after our weal, be it known unto you that the Hakkari Emeer, Ismael Pasha, Badr Khan Beg, and Tatar Khan Agha, the chief of the Artushi Coords, combined against us, and on the great feast of the Ascension made a sudden irruption [sic] into our territory, carried off an immense booty in sheep belonging to Melek Ismaeel and other of our people, murdered a number of men, women, and children, cut off their ears and sent them to Bedr Khan Beg.  Moreover, we learn that they are preparing for a second onslaught, when they intend to burn, kill, destroy, and if possible, exterminate the Christian race from the mountains.  From this you may see that what befell [sic] Job has fallen to our lot: our sons and daughters have been slain with the edge of the sword, and our flocks, herds, and property have become the prey of our enemies.\" \nNot long afterwards occurred a massacre in the village of Ashitha, where Layard visited the and blamed the injudicious attitude of the missionaries. He saw the ruins of the school and dwelling house, built by the American missionaries during their short sojourn in the mountains. These buildings had been the cause of much jealousy and suspicion to the Kurds. They stand upon the summit of an isolated hill, commanding the whole valley. A position less ostentatious and proportions more modest might certainly have been chosen; and it is surprising that persons, so well acquainted with the characters of the tribes among whom they had come to reside, should have been thus indiscreet. \nLayard reported as well from Lizan, on the Zab River, the results of \u201cone of the most terrible incidents of the massacre.\u201d After the massacre, he walked on a hill covered with bones, mingled with the long platted tresses of the women and skulls of all ages.  Reportedly, one-fifth of this Nestorian population was killed, about 10,000 out of a total population of 50,000.  0ther reports give lower estimates. Two American missionaries, Edward Breath and Austin Wright, estimated the casualties at 7,000, while the Anglican missionary George Percy Badger, who compiled a list of losses in each Assyrian village, indicated the number at 4,000.  Bader Khan Beg, the M\u012br of Bohtan and the leader of the Kurdish reprisal against the Nestorians, carried away a large number of women and children as slaves, but Sir Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador managed to release many of the captives. \nOriginally, the Kurdish emirates were territorial based tribal entities. These emirates had been based either on a single tribe, whose Mir was the hereditary chieftain of the tribe, or it had been based on an agglomeration of   tribes, as was the case in Hakkari, where the Mir was the chieftain of a tribe that was ties with others, through intermarriage and tribal agreements.  As noted above, during the first half of the 19th century, the Turks adopted a policy aimed at terminating all (semi) independent principalities in the peripheries. Even so, for a short period, two Kurdish principalities - Bohtan and Soran - grew stronger and benefited from the decline of the other principalities. By the early 1840s, Bader Khan Beg, the M\u012br of the Bohtan, set up a strong confederation of tribal leaders. His reign could be the dream of some Kurdish nationalists who wish to unite all parts Kurdistan into one free and independent country. His jurisdiction included the city of Diyarbakir in Western Kurdistan, Sulaim\u0101n\u012bya in Central Kurdistan and Mahabad in Eastern Kurdistan. Bader Khan Beg was not just another tribal ruler. He had an ammunition factory; he struck his own coins; and more symbolically, the khutba (Ar., Friday\u2019s public sermon at the mosque) was delivered in his name, an honor reserved to the main ruler of the state.  According to Rev. Thomas Laurie who wrote a biography of Dr. Grant, the \"dervishes and Moolahs\" amongst Bader Khan's following \n\"inveighed with great vehemence against the Nestorians. It was such a work of 'charity' to destroy those 'infidels' as would meet with rich reward in Paradise. 'Kill la the men,' they cried, 'who will not receive the Koran.' \"\nThis powerful Kurdish leader, Bader Khan Beg, had not only religious personalities in his camp. But he in fact stood at the head of an alliance of tribes, who acted against the Nestorians at this critical time.\nAround the same time, in the early 1840s, the Assyrian patriarch M\u0101r Shimon acted, at least twice, against the main tribal Kurdish leaders of Hakk\u0101r\u012b. The Nestorians in Hakk\u0101r\u012b had been for centuries under the nominal rule of the M\u012br of Hakk\u0101r\u012b. Around 1841, the M\u012br of Hakk\u0101r\u012b died and his brother, N\u016brallah Beg, became the new M\u012br, depriving Sulaim\u0101n, the rightful heir according to the tribal Kurdish tradition. A feud broke out between Sulaim\u0101n and his uncle N\u016brallah Beg, and the patriarch, who was a friend of the late M\u012br, supported his son, Sulaim\u0101n. Several Nestorian M\u0101liks, on the other hand, supported N\u016brallah Beg, who eventually won the M\u012brship of Hakk\u0101r\u012b. This vote reflected a disagreement within the Nestorian leadership. Another conflict between the patriarch and several M\u0101liks was related to the leaning of the patriarch for independence, while some M\u0101liks preferred to continue the previous arrangement according to which they paid allegiance merely to the Kurdish M\u012br of Hakk\u0101r\u012b. These conflicts have weakened the Assyrian unity prior to the clash with the Kurds. Wigram, a keen observer of the Assyrians, expressed his view about Assyrian disunity, in light of the consequences.\nHad the Christians held together, they might have been able to resist the attack ... As it was, each clan hoped to save itself by remaining neutral while others were destroyed, and each of the Christian \u2018Ashiret districts was ravaged individually, from end to end. \nKurdish chiefs were concerned with the leaning of the patriarch towards independence. They were also worried from the pro-Turkish and pro-western position of the Patriarch, who refused to give in to the demands of the new Hakk\u0101r\u012b chief. Indeed the new M\u012br, N\u016brallah Beg, offered M\u0101r Shimon XVII a peace treaty with one condition \u2013 that he should forsake his temporal authority, and leave it to the Nestorian M\u0101liks - most of whom supported N\u016brallah Beg.  This demand is indicative of the political participation and split within the Assyrian tribal leadership. It could insinuate as well on the real-politic, more practical approach of the Maliks in comparison to their Patriarch.\nThe tension between the Kurds and the Nestorians led to \u201cpetty feuds\u201d between the two parties in the early 1840s. Soon afterwards, N\u016brallah mobilized the support of several Kurdish chieftains, notably of Bader Khan Beg. The missionary physician Dr. Grant visited the Kurdish camp just before the attack on the Nestorians. As strange as it may seem, both Bader Khan and N\u016brallah spoke with Dr. Grant \u201cwithout the least reserve\u201d of their plan to achieve \u201cthe complete subjugation of the Nestorians.\u201d The Nestorians were doomed and the only way they could be saved, was by the payment of a tribute. When Dr. Grant asked to save his house in Ashitha, the Kurdish chieftains promised to \u201cspare the whole valley of Ashitha, as far as Lizan, \u201cif the inhabitants would only submit and pay tribute.\u201d  The Assyrians never met this condition and the massacres that followed had two immediate results. First, the Turks decided to terminate the rule of Bader Khan. Second, the American Board of Commissionaires as well as the Anglicans decided to suspend the mission to the mountain Nestorians, therefore actually admitting their failure to prevent blame in the tragic events, if not their partial blame in the occurrences.  As is any war in this region at the time, there was booty looting and captive taking, especially young women that were taken to be slaves and perhaps later wives of the chieftains. The following is from a report of Layard:\n\"It may be remembered, that Bedr Khan Bey, in 1843, invaded the Tiyari districts, massacred in cold blood nearly 10,000 of their inhabitants, and carried away as slaves a large number of girls and children.  But it is perhaps not generally known, that the release of the greater part of the captives was obtained through the humane interference and generosity of Sir Stratford Canning, who prevailed upon the Porte to send a commissioner into Kurdistan, for the purpose of inducing Bedr Khan Bey and other Kurdish chiefs, to give up the slaves they had taken, and advanced, himself, a considerable sum towards their liberation.  Mr. Rassam also obtained the release of many slaves, and maintained and clothed at his own expense, and for several months, not only the Nestorian Patriarch, who had taken refuge in Mosul, but many hundred Chaldeans who had escaped from the mountains. . .\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kurdish_internal_conflicts\">Kurdish internal conflicts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1843_and_1846_massacres_in_Hakkari&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Kurdish internal conflicts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>War broke out in <a href=\"/wiki/Hakkari\" title=\"Hakkari\">Hakkari</a> in 1839 between <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nurallah_of_Hakkari&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Nurallah of Hakkari (page does not exist)\">Nurallah</a>, brother of the former Emir, who governed from Bash Qal'a, and Suleyman his nephew whose capital was in Gullamerk.
