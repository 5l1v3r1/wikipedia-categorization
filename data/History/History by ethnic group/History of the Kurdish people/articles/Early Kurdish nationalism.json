Abdul Hamid responded with a policy of repression, but also of integration, co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents into the Ottoman power structure with prestigious positions in his government.

That kind of identity was related with a more tribal consciousness; one that lacked sophistication for many. Others had much to lose if the status quo was altered. For many, this stemmed from a religious concern, where the Sultan had long brought Muslims under a secure <a href=\"/wiki/Caliphate\" title=\"Caliphate\">Caliphate</a>.

Shaykh Abd al Razzaq Badr Khan eventually formed an alliance with Shaykh Taha and Shaykh Abd al Salam Barzani, another powerful family in Kurdistan. Because of this possible Kurdish threat as well as the alliance's dealings with Russia, Ottoman troops moved against this alliance in 1914.

However, some Kurds continued to work behind the scenes for an independent Kurdistan. These represent some of the first attempts by Kurds to work with foreign powers against Turks for their autonomy. In 1914, General Muhammad Sharif Pasha offered his services to the British in Mesopotamia. Elsewhere, members of the Badr Khan family held close relations with Russian officials and discussed their intentions to form an independent Kurdistan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jwaideh_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jwaideh-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Meanwhile, the conflict between Kurds and <a href=\"/wiki/Armenians\" title=\"Armenians\">Armenians</a> in the east raged. Kurds were threatened with punishment by Ottoman authorities if they did not obey orders to evict or kill the Armenians. In rare instances, Kurds spared their Christian victims and protected them because they were neighbors with whom they had held cordial relations.  It is difficult to accept that the struggle was a purely ethnic one. The Armenians, it was reasoned, presented a real threat for many Kurds, especially the farther one went east. Armenians, after all, had relationships with the hostile European powers and Russia. According to David McDowall, \"most Kurds involved in the massacres probably felt it was a question of 'them or us'\".

However, the effect of the war on the Kurdish populated areas was more severe. Many regions throughout Kurdistan were laid waste and their populations decimated by advancing and retreating troop forces. Furthermore, as the war continued, the <a href=\"/wiki/Young_Turks\" title=\"Young Turks\">Young Turks</a> implemented large scale <a href=\"/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing\" title=\"Ethnic cleansing\">ethnic cleansing</a> of both <a href=\"/wiki/Armenian_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Armenian people\">Armenians</a> and Kurds, including the deportation of Kurds from <a href=\"/wiki/Erzurum\" title=\"Erzurum\">Erzurum</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bitlis\" title=\"Bitlis\">Bitlis</a> in the winter of 1916.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> By the end of World War I, up to 700,000 Kurds had been forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jwaideh_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jwaideh-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, at this time the Ottoman Kurds still had the legal right to conduct their affairs in Kurdish, celebrate unique traditions, and identify themselves as a distinct ethnic group.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_end_of_the_Ottoman_Empire\">The end of the Ottoman Empire</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Early_Kurdish_nationalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The end of the Ottoman Empire\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Kurdish ethnonationalist movement that emerged following World War I and the <a href=\"/wiki/Defeat_and_dissolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_(1908%E2%80%931922)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908\u20131922)\">end of the Ottoman Empire</a> was largely in reaction to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical <a href=\"/wiki/Secularization\" title=\"Secularization\">secularization</a> which the strongly <a href=\"/wiki/Muslim\" title=\"Muslim\">Muslim</a> Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant <a href=\"/wiki/Turkish_nationalism\" title=\"Turkish nationalism\">Turkish nationalism</a> in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-natali_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-natali-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1918, the prominent Kurdish nationalist <a href=\"/wiki/%C5%9Eerif_Pasha\" title=\"\u015eerif Pasha\">\u015eerif Pasha</a> pressed the British to adopt a policy supporting autonomous Kurdish regions throughout Kurdistan.

However, his efforts to plead the cause of his people leading up to the Peace Conference impressed Western powers. Because of his friendship with Armenians, after he was chosen to represent the Kurds by various Kurdish nationalist organizations at the Peace Conference, a Kurdo-Armenian peace accord was reached between \u015eerif and Armenian representatives at the conference in 1919. The British persuaded the Kurdish and Armenian representatives to sign this Kurdish-Armenian declaration of solidarity against the <a href=\"/wiki/Kemalist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kemalist\">Kemalists</a> for strategic reasons.

Aside from the supporters of such sentiments in the US, Britain, France, and of course of Kurds, there were other aspects to consider. These included the operational breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the Kemalist movement, Russia's territorial ambitions, the status of the Christian Armenian population, and Britain's desire to preserve stability in and around its colonial possessions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Yildiz_2007_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Yildiz_2007-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anatolia\">Anatolia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Early_Kurdish_nationalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Anatolia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Turkish forces often broke the terms of the Armistice by arming Kurdish forces in eastern Anatolia.

He militantly voiced concern for the safety of the sultanate and called for the preservation of eastern Anatolia against the Christian threat. This likewise had a similar effect on Kurds. Kemalist power grew throughout 1919. With this growth, came persecution of the Kurds and the narrowing of Kurdish political space. A new Kurdish political party was refused registration. Newspapers related calls for Kurdish independence with that of supporting Armenian nationalism as well. Outspoken Kurds were imprisoned or executed for treasonous statements.

During this time, the Kemalist government in Ankara was attempting to influence Kurds to join the Turkish nationalistic cause by offering jobs and bribes. Throughout 1920, Kurdish organizers in the Dersim region were increasingly successful in tribal organization for an autonomous Kurdistan against the Kemalists, even though many in the region supported the Kemalists. During the summer months, Kurdish armed forces in the region began attacking Turkish ammunition sites and police stations. By November, three months after the signing of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, Kurds were demanding official recognition for their autonomy. However, winter stifled their ability to organize and armed operations ceased. During this time, Kemalists were able to surround the region and co-opt many Kurdish tribal leaders and bring them into the Kemalist camp.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Clashes erupted again as early as January 1921. With their new position of advantage, Turkish Kemalists arrested and deported Kurdish nationalists and demanded the unconditional surrender of the Kurdish forces that they met, threatening the destruction of their villages if they did not cooperate. Yet, Kurdish forces won several important battles and gained important footholds in the region by March. These successes prompted an increased response from Ankara. By April, the Kurdish rebellion was decisively put down. Reasons behind the Ko\u00e7giri rebellion were both ideological and strategic. The main reason for Kurdish support for the rebellion was in order to implement articles 62-64 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres and increase their autonomy in Kurdish Anatolia. Strategically, Kurdish organizers and forces in the region thought they could take advantage of the fledgling Kemalist government as well as its preoccupation with the Greek conflict in the west. The Kurds severely miscalculated in this last respect. There is also evidence that they anticipated foreign support from the French, British, or Greeks. But there is no evidence that they received any. Some Kurdish forces disagreed with requesting foreign support against the Turks as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There are four main reasons that the Ko\u00e7giri rebellion failed. Firstly, the Kurds received no outside European support. Secondly, the tribal nature of Kurdish society allowed the Kemalists to co-opt tribes and break up the unity of the movement. Thirdly, there were religious and sectarian differences among Kurds (primarily Sunni and Alevi differences) that created mistrust and a weak unity. Lastly, the Turks' military, organizational, and patronage power was overwhelmingly superior. It should also be noted that it is unlikely that any of the tribes involved in the revolt had battle experience in World War I. Most of the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments that fought in the Balkans under the Ottoman flag lived further east and south. The Kocgiri rebellion was also located near Ankara was relatively accessible by Turkish forces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Ko\u00e7giri rebellion had a significant impact on the government of Ankara. The government continued its policy of attempting to win over Kurdish tribal leaders but set up special commissions to investigate the rebellion. A draft law came before the Grand National Assembly in February 1922 that dealt with administering the Kurdish regions. Because of its superficial nature in dealing with Kurdish autonomy, most Kurdish deputies in the Grand National Assembly opposed it. In his analysis of the draft law, Rober Olson claims that Kurdish opposition to the law reveals that these Kurdish Kemalists were hopeful of obtaining greater autonomy for the Kurds. He also claims that the draft law and its overwhelming majority support reveals that at the time Turks in the Assembly did not favor a violent policy towards the Kurds, but that they \"did not remotely consider independence or even autonomy in any meaningful sense of that term\" for the Kurds (p.&#160;41).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Iraq\">Iraq</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Early_Kurdish_nationalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Iraq\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:A_Jaf_chief,_S._Kurdistan.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/A_Jaf_chief%2C_S._Kurdistan.jpg/220px-A_Jaf_chief%2C_S._Kurdistan.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"316\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/A_Jaf_chief%2C_S._Kurdistan.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"317\" data-file-height=\"455\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:A_Jaf_chief,_S._Kurdistan.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A Kurdish <a href=\"/wiki/Jaff_(Kurdish_tribe)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jaff (Kurdish tribe)\">Jaff</a> tribal chief, <a href=\"/wiki/Mesopotamia\" title=\"Mesopotamia\">Mesopotamia</a>, 1914</div></div></div>\n<p>First direct contact with Kurds in <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq\" title=\"Iraq\">Iraq</a> and British was in 1917 after the British occupied <a href=\"/wiki/Khanaqin\" title=\"Khanaqin\">Khanaqin</a> and later other regions in the north of present Iraq, including <a href=\"/wiki/Kifri\" title=\"Kifri\">Kifri</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tuz_Khurmatu\" title=\"Tuz Khurmatu\">Tuz Khurmatu</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Kirkuk\" title=\"Kirkuk\">Kirkuk</a>.

This policy of using primarily the Royal Air Force as the dominant military presence in Mesopotamia was experimental at the time. The Air Scheme was popular among British policymakers. The biggest proponents of the Air Scheme were also among the biggest supporters of a \"Greater Iraq.\" The preference in early 1920 strategy was to include southern Kurdistan under the auspices of the British Air Scheme. British policy at this point still regarded northern Kurdistan as would be described in articles 62-64 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, in policy meetings that took place in <a href=\"/wiki/Cairo_Conference_(1921)\" title=\"Cairo Conference (1921)\">Cairo</a> in March 1921 British policy towards the Kurds was altered. The newly formed Middle East Department concluded that \"purely Kurdish areas should not be included in the Arab state of Mesopotamia\". The framers of this policy stated that Kurdish areas would be put under control of the <a href=\"/wiki/British_High_Commission\" title=\"British High Commission\">British High Commission</a> and not under control of any Iraqi government. Noel and others supported this position because they thought Kurds would prefer rule closer to home and rule that was not under Arabs or Turks. This position was also thought to be strategic because an autonomous Kurdistan would create a buffer between the Turks outside of Iraq as well as anti-British movements within Iraq. <a href=\"/wiki/Winston_Churchill\" title=\"Winston Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a>, the Secretary of Colonies at the time, agreed with these sentiments and this position.

Correspondence shows that Churchill still assumed that the only link between the southern Kurdish regions and Iraq would be through the British High Commission.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As Turkish forces grew in strength and militancy, Cox began dealing with <a href=\"/wiki/King_Faisal_I_of_Iraq\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"King Faisal I of Iraq\">King Faisal I of Iraq</a> in determining how Kurds in southern Kurdistan should be incorporated into Iraq territorially and politically.

These pan-Islamic policies were designed to win over the Kurds in the region in the possibility of using them as a barrier against the Russians or Armenians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jwaideh_6-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jwaideh-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, Kurdish nationalism grew in other environments. In 1918, members of the Mukri tribe of the <a href=\"/wiki/Mahabad\" title=\"Mahabad\">Mahabad</a> region were in talks with British officials discussing a possible scheme for an independent Kurdish state under British protection. Like Sharif Pasha, these individuals stressed their desire for autonomy and a desire to reach a peace agreement with the Armenians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jwaideh_6-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jwaideh-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Later in 1921, the Persian Kurd, <a href=\"/wiki/Simko_Shikak\" title=\"Simko Shikak\">Simko Shikak</a> pursued a different strategy. Simko dealt directly with Persian and Russian officials. He became impatient with Persia's unwillingness to act on granting Kurdish autonomy, and so rebelled in 1922. In the Persian operations against Simko's rebellion, Turkish armies provided valuable support. The rebellion was quickly put down. Following this rebellion, however, Major Noel tried, unsuccessfully, to bring together Simko and other Kurdish nationalist leaders, including Shaykh Mahmud. The object was to create a Kurdish alliance to frustrate Turkish designs. No agreement was reached between these leaders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jwaideh_6-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jwaideh-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Treaty_of_Lausanne\">The Treaty of Lausanne</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Early_Kurdish_nationalism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: The Treaty of Lausanne\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After it became apparent how vehemently the government in Ankara opposed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres and with the rising power of the Kemalists, Major Noel and the British began seriously considering supporting a Kurdish rebellion. The fear that the rebellion might not be controllable resulted in the plan's abandonment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McDowall_3-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McDowall-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This plan was revived, however, in 1921 after Kemalist troops were found meddling with tribes south of the Armistice line. British policymakers again began contemplating assisting a wide-scale Kurdish rebellion against the Turks in order to counter their growing strength and influence in the region. There were many drawbacks to this plan. This would reflect negatively on King Faysal of Iraq, as weapons would come to northern Kurdistan via Iraq. If the revolt failed, it was thought that the British in Iraq would face a massive amount of Kurdish refugees. There was also the constant worry that Kurdish leaders were unreliable and the Kurdish forces were not unified. But the French had reached an agreement with the government in Ankara on the basis of the National Pact rather than the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. This was done after the Greeks seemed likely to lose against the Turks. France ceded much of its previously occupied land in southern Anatolia, thus providing the Kemalists with the ideal assembly point for an assault on British occupied Iraq. This caused the British to re-evaluate the plausibility of their plans to foment rebellion among the Kurds against the Turks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McDowall_3-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McDowall-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Olson_12-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Olson-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Yet it still appeared that the British favored Kurdish autonomy in Iraq when they issued a Joint Declaration with the Iraqi government in 1922 that was communicated to the League of Nations. It recognized the right of the Kurds to form a government within the borders of Iraq.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Yildiz_2005_2_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Yildiz_2005_2-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the end, as Kemalist forces spread and grew in strength, \"the British desire for peace with Turkey, on the best terms for itself, of course, subordinated Britain's Kurdish policy to this objective.\" (p.&#160;81). It became desirable for the British to negotiate peace with Turkey on much different terms than those of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McDowall_3-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McDowall-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:4969062_f520.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/4969062_f520.jpg/250px-4969062_f520.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"186\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/4969062_f520.jpg/375px-4969062_f520.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/4969062_f520.jpg/500px-4969062_f520.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"520\" data-file-height=\"386\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:4969062_f520.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Signing of the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne_(1923)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Treaty of Lausanne (1923)\">Treaty of Lausanne (1923)</a></div></div></div>\n<p>On 24 July 1923, the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne_(1923)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Treaty of Lausanne (1923)\">Treaty of Lausanne</a> was signed between the British, their allies, and the Turks.

In the end, the League of Nations abandoned ethnic considerations in favor of economic and strategic ones. Kurdish territory in modern-day Iraq was granted to Iraq, under British control. The Kurdish regions were fully incorporated into the state in 1923 when Iraq held its first elections to the Constituent Assembly.<sup id=\"cite_ref-McDowall_3-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McDowall-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Iraqi Prime Minister, before the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, was authorized to meet with Kurdish tribal leaders in <a href=\"/wiki/Sulaymaniyah\" title=\"Sulaymaniyah\">Sulaymaniyah</a> in 1923. By this time, he found that they were very much in support of the plan to recognize their national aspirations but within the framework of one country. They even displayed support to King Faysal in a meeting with him in May 1923. These Kurdish leaders, as well as other Kurdish business men and dignitaries were opposed to Shaykh Mahmud's style of nationalism because of his history of political manipulation and lawlessness.
