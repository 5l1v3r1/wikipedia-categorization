Han Mahmud (Khan Mahmud) was a 19th-century Kurdish Lord. He was born in Mukus (now Van, Turkey), and after his father Abdi Beg's death, he became Lord (Mir) of the Mukus Kurdish Emirate. In 1847, he fought in a Kurdish revolt against the Ottomans, which was organized with Bedirhan Beg, the Lord of CizÄ±r-Botan.  The revolt was quashed, Bedirhan Beg was exiled to Crete, and Han Mahmud was exiled to Rousse (now a Bulgarian city). Han Mahmud died in Rousse in 1866.
