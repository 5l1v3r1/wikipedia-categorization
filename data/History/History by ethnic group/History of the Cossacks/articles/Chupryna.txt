Chupryna (Ukrainian: чуприна), chub (Ukrainian: чуб, "crest"), khokhol (Russian: хохол, "forelock"), or oseledets (Ukrainian: оселедець, "herring") is an element of traditional Ukrainian Cossack haircut. It describes a style of man's haircut that features a lock of hair sprouting from the top or the front of an otherwise closely shaven head. There are several Ukrainian surnames deriving from words chub and oseledets Russians commonly use the word khokhol (Russian: хохо́л) as an ethnic slur for Ukrainians. The term is frequently derogatory or condescending, an equivalent of the Ukrainian term katsap (Ukrainian: кацап) and Polish  kacap for Russians.
