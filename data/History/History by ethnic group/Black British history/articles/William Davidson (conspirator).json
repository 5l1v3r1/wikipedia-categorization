At the age of 14 he travelled to <a href=\"/wiki/Glasgow\" title=\"Glasgow\">Glasgow</a> to study law. In <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland\" title=\"Scotland\">Scotland</a> he became involved in the <a href=\"/wiki/Friends_of_the_People_Society\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friends of the People Society\">movement for parliamentary reform</a>. He was apprenticed to a <a href=\"/wiki/Liverpool\" title=\"Liverpool\">Liverpool</a> lawyer, but ran away to sea. Later, he was <a href=\"/wiki/Impressment\" title=\"Impressment\">press-ganged</a> into the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Navy\" title=\"Royal Navy\">Royal Navy</a>.\n</p><p>After his discharge, he returned to Scotland. His father arranged for him to study mathematics in <a href=\"/wiki/Aberdeen\" title=\"Aberdeen\">Aberdeen</a>. Davidson withdrew from study, moved to <a href=\"/wiki/Birmingham\" title=\"Birmingham\">Birmingham</a>, and started a cabinet-making business. He courted the daughter of a prosperous merchant. Her father suspected that Davidson was after her \u00a37,000 dowry, and arranged for Davidson to be arrested on a false charge. When Davidson discovered she had married someone else he attempted suicide by taking poison.\n</p><p>Davidson's cabinet-making business failed, and he moved to London. He married Sarah Lane, a working-class widow with four children. They had two more children. Davidson became a <a href=\"/wiki/Wesleyanism\" title=\"Wesleyanism\">Wesleyan</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Methodist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Methodist\">Methodist</a>, and taught at the <a href=\"/wiki/Sunday_School\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sunday School\">Sunday School</a>. However, he left after he was accused of attempting to seduce a female student.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Political_activism\">Political activism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Davidson_(conspirator)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Political activism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"/wiki/Peterloo_Massacre\" title=\"Peterloo Massacre\">Peterloo Massacre</a>, William Davidson became involved in radical politics again. In October 1819 <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Carlile\" title=\"Richard Carlile\">Richard Carlile</a> was found guilty of blasphemy and <a href=\"/wiki/Seditious_libel\" title=\"Seditious libel\">seditious libel</a>, and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Davidson said that this had caused him to lose his belief in God. He joined the Marylebone Union Reading Society, a club that offered a reading room of radical newspapers such as the Republican and the <i>Manchester Observer</i> for a subscription of twopence a week. He also read the works of <a href=\"/wiki/Tom_Paine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tom Paine\">Tom Paine</a>.\n</p><p>Davidson met John Harrison at the Marylebone Union. Harrison was a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Spence\" title=\"Thomas Spence\">Spencean Philanthropists</a> in London. Davidson soon became a Spencean. He met <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Thistlewood\" title=\"Arthur Thistlewood\">Arthur Thistlewood</a>, and after a few months he became one of the Committee of Thirteen that ran the organisation.\n</p><p>In February 1820, George Edwards, a government <a href=\"/wiki/Agent_provocateur\" title=\"Agent provocateur\">provocateur</a>, drew Davidson and Thistlewood and 27 other Spenceans into a plot to kill government cabinet officers as they dined at Lord <a href=\"/wiki/Dudley_Ryder,_1st_Earl_of_Harrowby\" title=\"Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby\">Harrowby</a>'s house at 39 <a href=\"/wiki/Grosvenor_Square\" title=\"Grosvenor Square\">Grosvenor Square</a> on 23 February. Thistlewood selected Davidson as one of an Executive of Five to organise the assassinations. (The dinner was a fictitious construction.)\n</p><p>Davidson had worked for Lord Harrowby in the past, and knew some of his staff at Grosvenor Square. His job was to find out more details about the cabinet meeting. One of the servants told him that the Earl of Harrowby was not in London. Davidson relayed this information to Arthur Thistlewood, who believed that the servant was lying, and ordered the conspirators to proceed with the plot.\n</p><p>On 23 February the <a href=\"/wiki/Cato_Street_Conspiracy\" title=\"Cato Street Conspiracy\">Cato Street Conspiracy</a> met in a hayloft on Cato Street, near Grosvenor Square. However, there was no cabinet meeting: the Spenceans had been set up by George Edwards.\n</p><p>George Ruthven led 13 police officers to storm the hayloft. Several revolutionaries refused to surrender their weapons. Thistlewood killed police officer Richard Smithers with a single sword-thrust.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> When the co-conspirators tried to escape, Benjamin Gill hit Davidson on the wrist with his truncheon, and he dropped his <a href=\"/wiki/Blunderbuss\" title=\"Blunderbuss\">blunderbuss</a>. Four conspirators, Thistlewood, John Brunt, Robert Adams and John Harrison escaped through a window. However, their identities were given to the police by Edwards and they were quickly  arrested.\n</p><p>Eleven men were charged with involvement in the Cato Street Conspiracy. Robert Adams testified against the other men, and charges against him were dropped. Davidson pleaded innocence and claimed the court was prejudiced against <a href=\"/wiki/Black_British\" title=\"Black British\">black people</a>. However, his presence at the scene with a blunderbuss led to his conviction.\n</p><p>On 28 April 1820, William Davidson, James Ings, Richard Tidd, <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Thistlewood\" title=\"Arthur Thistlewood\">Arthur Thistlewood</a>, and John Brunt were found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to death. John Harrison, James Wilson, Richard Bradburn, John Strange and Charles Copper were also found guilty. However their death sentences were subsequently commuted to transportation for life.\n</p><p>William Davidson, with his four fellow conspirators, was publicly hanged and decapitated outside <a href=\"/wiki/Newgate_Prison\" title=\"Newgate Prison\">Newgate Prison</a> on 1 May 1820.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=William_Davidson_(conspirator)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=YSwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=sheriff+london+1820#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\"><i>Execution of Thistlewood, Brunt, Ings, Tidd and Davidson</i></a><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
