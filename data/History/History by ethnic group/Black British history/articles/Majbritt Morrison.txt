Majbritt Morrison (born 1933) is known for being the victim of an incident of racial violence that sparked off the 1958 Notting Hill race riots  which escalated from there,  and as the author of the best seller Jungle West 11. She was born in Sweden.  In 1955, as a 22-year-old student, she went to the UK. There she met and fell in love with Raymond Morrison, a Jamaican painter, and married him.  The night before the Notting Hill race riots, she was outside Latimer Road tube station, arguing with her husband. The following day on Saturday, 30 August 1958,  while leaving a blues dance,  she was seen by a gang of white youths the following day who remembered her. They followed her, throwing milk bottles and hurling racist abuse.  One of the slurs that was thrown at her was "Black man's trollop". She was also hit in the back with an iron bar and somebody from the mob called out: "Kill her!"  While standing her ground, she was ordered by the police to go inside. She refused, and she was arrested. Meanwhile, the mob carried on down the road, smashing windows and would have attacked a house party that was organized by Count Suckle who was one of the first sound system operators in Great Britain. Count Suckle and his friends were escorted out of the neighborhood.  On 1 September 1958, having been charged with obstruction during the riots, Majbritt Morrison was photographed along with her husband  leaving the West London Police Court. She was scheduled to have a hearing at the Tower Hill Court a few days from then.  Years later in the 1970s Raymond Morrison would be in the music business and release a few reggae singles on the Hawk Records label as Ray Morrison or with a lady friend Tamara as Ram and Tam.  He also managed a club in Swiss Cottage during the 1970s. Her book Jungle West 11 was first published in the UK by Tandem Books in 1964.  This was her account of the events relating to the Notting Hill Riots.
