Horvat Ma平on (also Khirbet Ma平in, Tell Ma平in) is an archaeological site near Nirim in the Negev, the arid southern portion of Israel.  It is usually considered the site of the Maon of Joshua (15:55),  as well as Beth-baal-meon (Joshua 13:17) and Beth-meon (Jeremiah 48:23).  The Bible identifies Maon as a place in the territory of the Tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:55), and describes Nabal as living in Maon (1 Samuel 25:2-3). Horvat Ma平on, under the name Menois, was the capital of Saltus Constantinianus, , also known as Saltus Constantiniaces,  an administrative district formed by either Constantine the Great or Constantius II.   Excavations there have uncovered the Maon Synagogue, known for its mosaics adorned with various animals and likely built around 600 CE.
