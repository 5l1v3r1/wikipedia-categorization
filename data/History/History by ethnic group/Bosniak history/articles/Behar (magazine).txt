Behar was a Bosniak political magazine published twice monthly between 1900 and 1911. The word behar means blossom in English. It was established in 1900 by Bosniak intellectuals Edhem Mulabdić, Safvet-beg Bašagić, and Osman Nuri Hadžić, assisted financially by Ademaga Mešić. In addition to Bašagić and Mulabdić, Musa Ćazim Ćatić, Džemaludin Čaušević, and Ljudevit Dvorniković also served as editors during the decade that the magazine was published.  A 1927 revival, called Novi behar (New Blossom), by Hamdija Kreševljaković and Husein Dubravić lasted until 1943.
