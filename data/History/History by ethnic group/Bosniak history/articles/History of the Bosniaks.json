The Serbs settled in what is now southcentral Serbia, and later expanding into the upper Drina valley of eastern Bosnia and into Eastern Herzegovina, known in the later Middle Ages as Zahumlje. The Croats to the west came under the influence of the Germanic <a href=\"/wiki/Carolingian_Empire\" title=\"Carolingian Empire\">Carolingian Empire</a> and the Roman Catholic Church, and Croatia was closely tied to Hungary and later Austria until the twentieth century. The Serbs to the east came under periodic <a href=\"/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\" title=\"Byzantine Empire\">Byzantine</a> rule, converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and absorbed Byzantine cultural influences. After some centuries of rule by Croatia, Serb principalities, and the Byzantine Empire, an independent Bosnian kingdom flourished in central Bosnia between the 12th and the 15th centuries.\n</p><p>The subject of ethnicity in medieval Bosnia has been one of great debate ever since it was brought up in its current context by historians during the second half of the 19th century. All three ethnic groups in Bosnia have a different view on the matter, and this complex and sensitive subject has been further obscured by nationalism and propaganda through the ages. Proving their people as the true heirs of the medieval Bosnian state is important to many nationalists because they consider this indigenousness to have important implications in modern social, political, and interethnic issues. Simply put, however, there is no sign that the population of pre-Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina, in whichever social stratum, had developed Croatian or Serbian ethnic consciousness even in a medieval sense of the word.

We can say that the majority of the Bosnian territory was probably occupied by Croats - or at least, by Slavs under Croat rule - in the seventh century; but that is a tribal label which has little or no meaning five centuries later. The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism. All that one can sensibly say about the ethnic identity of the Bosnians is this: they were the Slavs who lived in Bosnia.<sup id=\"cite_ref-google_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-google-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Bosnian Kingdom blended cultural influences from east and west; although nominally Roman Catholic, the Bosnian kings embraced elements of Byzantine culture and court ceremonial, and formed alliances and dynastic marriages with the neighboring rulers of both Croatian-Dalmatian and Serb states. Because of Bosnia's mountainous and inaccessible terrain and its remote location on the borderland between the Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, control by church authorities was weak. The religious situation was also peculiar because of the presence of an indigenous <a href=\"/wiki/Bosnian_Church\" title=\"Bosnian Church\">Bosnian Church</a> (its adherents were known as <i>krstjani</i>, \"Christians\"). The kr\u0161tjani were considered heretics by both the <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman Catholic Church\">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastern Orthodoxy\">Orthodox Church</a>.

Discord among his heirs weakened the kingdom after his death, and Bosnia and the Serb principalities to the east were unable to prevent Ottoman Turkish incursions into the western Balkans. The final Turkish conquest in 1463 marked the end of an independent Bosnia and the beginning of the influence of a third civilization, Islam.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ottoman_rule\">Ottoman rule</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Bosniaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Ottoman rule\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_(1463%E2%80%931878)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463\u20131878)\">History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463\u20131878)</a></div>\n<p>Historians have long debated how and why many ethnic Bosnians converted to Islam.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"Contentious material in this paragraph, some of which has already been deleted following discussion; see talk page.

The gradual conversion of many ethnic <a href=\"/wiki/Bosnia_(region)\" title=\"Bosnia (region)\">bosnian</a> Serbs to Islam proceeded at different rates in various areas and among different groups. Conversion to Islam was more rapid in urban areas, which were centers of learning and of the Ottoman administration, than in the countryside. Merchants found it advantageous to convert to Islam because they gained greater freedom of movement and state protection for their goods as Muslims. Many converted and were trained as professional soldiers to fight for the ottomans.\n</p><p>One practice was through forced conversion, a process known as <a href=\"/wiki/Devshirme\" title=\"Devshirme\">devshirme</a>. Effectively, taking Serbian children from Christian villages and forcing them to convert to Islam. A notable example is the <a href=\"/wiki/Bosniaks\" title=\"Bosniaks\">Bosniak</a> soldier <a href=\"/wiki/Sokollu_Mehmed_Pasha\" title=\"Sokollu Mehmed Pasha\">Mehmet Pasa Sokolovic</a>.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\" title=\"Ottoman Empire\">Ottoman Empire</a> at the time was centered on militaristic expansion with focus on religion and maintaining power. By this time, Muslims already made up a large majority of Bosnia's population.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_conquest_of_Bosnia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ottoman conquest of Bosnia\">Ottoman conquest of Bosnia</a> was notable because, unlike all other European regions that came under Ottoman control, Bosnia retained its status as a distinct entity from the very beginning (first as a <a href=\"/wiki/Sanjak\" title=\"Sanjak\">sanjak</a>, then as a province [<a href=\"/wiki/Eyalet\" title=\"Eyalet\">eyalet</a>]). The Ottomans imported their feudal system to Bosnia shortly after the take-over, and estates were granted to men called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sipahis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sipahis\">sipahis</a></i>, in return for military service in times of war. At the beginning of the Ottoman period, these estates were usually, but not exclusively, granted to Muslims, and later only to Muslims. In Bosnia, these land grants gradually became hereditary, and by the end of the Ottoman period, a majority of the landowners in Bosnia were Muslims, and most Christians were peasants or serfs<a href=\"/wiki/Serbs\" title=\"Serbs\">Serbs</a>.\n</p><p>Probably the biggest reason behind the spread of Islam in the region was the very weak presence of the Church in Bosnia at the time. The old competition between the Catholic and Bosnian churches (along with the Orthodox Church in certain areas) contributed to a very weak and disorganized religious structure in much of Bosnia. To many Bosnians, religion was a combination of traditions and superstitions. Compared to the well-funded and organized religious institutions of their neighbors, it was relatively easy for Bosnians to switch from their Christianity to Islam. It is significant that the only other European region under Ottoman control where a large segment of the population adopted Islam was <a href=\"/wiki/Albania\" title=\"Albania\">Albania</a>; also home to competing Christian sects. Some <a href=\"/wiki/Taxation_in_the_Ottoman_Empire\" title=\"Taxation in the Ottoman Empire\">taxes on Muslims</a> and orthodox <a href=\"/wiki/Vlachs\" title=\"Vlachs\">Vlachs</a> were also lighter than those on other <i>rayah</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\"><span title=\"This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears.

Cities that were founded at the time, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Sarajevo\" title=\"Sarajevo\">Sarajevo</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mostar\" title=\"Mostar\">Mostar</a>, grew rapidly with a specifically Islamic character and advanced living standards. It is understandable that many Christians in the outlying rural regions would convert to Islam to be part of the superior conditions in such places. Further, slaves who converted to Islam could petition for their freedom, and many of the Christians enslaved during the wars with <a href=\"/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy\" title=\"Habsburg Monarchy\">Habsburg Austria</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary\" title=\"Kingdom of Hungary\">Hungary</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_of_Venice\" title=\"Republic of Venice\">Republic of Venice</a> converted to Islam in order to secure their release. Many of these newly freed converts settled in the growing cities, further contributing to their growth and development.\n</p><p>As mentioned previously, it was previously thought that the greater rights afforded to Muslims in the Ottoman Empire motivated Christians to convert to Islam. However, the extent to which Muslims were privileged is often overestimated. The primary discrimination faced by non-Muslims was of a legal nature, as Christians and Jews were not allowed to file lawsuits or testify against Muslims in court. There were also rules of conduct imposed upon them, but there were many to whom these rules did not apply. Though much has been made of the fact that Christian and Jewish subjects of the sultan paid a <a href=\"/wiki/Tax_per_head\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tax per head\">poll tax</a> from which Muslims were exempt, Muslims were also faced with the religious <a href=\"/wiki/Zakat\" title=\"Zakat\">zakat</a> tax, whereas Catholics made donations to their church only on a voluntary basis.\n</p><p>Christians became Muslims through the <a href=\"/wiki/Devshirmeh\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Devshirmeh\">devsirme</a> system, whereby boys were gathered from the Ottoman lands and were sent to Istanbul to convert to Islam and be trained as <a href=\"/wiki/Janissary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Janissary\">Janissary</a> troops, servants of the Sultan or Ottoman officials. One observer in the 16th century even mentioned that the Sultan believed Bosniaks were <i>\"the best, most pious and most loyal people\"</i> and <i>\"much bigger, more handsome, and more able\"</i> than other Muslim peoples. This firmly establish the Slavic element and language in Istanbul's administration and provided Bosnia with local Bosniak governors from 1488 onward.\n</p><p>The 17th century brought major defeats and military setbacks on the Ottoman Empire's western frontier. With major wars occurring every few decades, Bosnia was economically and militarily exhausted. For Bosnia and Bosniaks, the most critical conflict of all was the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Turkish_War\" title=\"Great Turkish War\">Great Turkish War</a>. At its very start in the mid-1680s, the <a href=\"/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy\" title=\"Habsburg Monarchy\">Habsburgs</a> conquered nearly all of Ottoman <a href=\"/wiki/Hungary\" title=\"Hungary\">Hungary</a>, sending tens of thousands of Muslim refugees flooding into Bosnia. A similar process occurred with the Habsburg conquest of <a href=\"/wiki/Lika\" title=\"Lika\">Lika</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Slavonia\" title=\"Slavonia\">Slavonia</a>. Thousands of Muslims from these parts fled eastward into the Bosnian pashaluk, while those who remained were forcibly converted to Catholicism. In total, it is estimated that more than 100,000 Muslims were expelled from the frontier regions and settled in Bosnia during this time. Many brought with them a new sense of hostility towards Christianity.\n</p><p>Ottoman military disasters continued into the next decade. In 1697, Habsburg <a href=\"/wiki/Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy\" title=\"Prince Eugene of Savoy\">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a> conducted an extremely successful border raid which culminated in Sarajevo being put to the torch. The Great Turkish War was finally ended by the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Karlowitz\" title=\"Treaty of Karlowitz\">Treaty of Karlowitz</a> in 1699. However, in the late 1710s yet another war between the Ottomans and the Habsburg-Venetian alliance ensued. It was ended by the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Passarowitz\" title=\"Treaty of Passarowitz\">Treaty of Passarowitz</a> in 1718, but not before sending another wave of Muslim refugees fleeing to Bosnia proper.\n</p><p>These events created great unrest among Bosniaks. The sentiment of discontent was further magnified by war and an increased tax burden. As a result, Bosniak revolts sprang up in Herzegovina in 1727, 1728, 1729, and 1732. A large plague that resulted in the death of thousands during the early 1730s contributed to the general chaos. In 1736, seeking to exploit these conditions, The Habsburgs broke the Treaty of Passarowitz and crossed the <a href=\"/wiki/Sava\" title=\"Sava\">Sava</a> river boundary. In one of the most significant events in Bosniak history, local Bosniak nobility organized a defense and counterattack completely independent of the ineffective imperial authorities. On August 4, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Banja_Luka\" title=\"Battle of Banja Luka\">Battle of Banja Luka</a>, the outnumbered Bosniak forces routed the Habsburg army and sent them fleeing back to Slavonia.\n</p><p>Traditionally, the Ottoman authorities classed subjects of the Empire not by nationality, but by religion. During the nineteenth century, modern national consciousness began to increase among the south Slavs; some historians now believe that it was in this period that Catholic Bosnians increasingly began to think of themselves as Croats, and Orthodox Bosnians as Serbs. The beginnings of a Muslim Bosnian national consciousness is also first attested in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as these early Bosniak nationalists began to assert a national identity distinct from both their Orthodox and Catholic neighbors, and from the other Muslim inhabitants of the empire. Most Serb and Croat nationalists tend to deny a separate Bosniak national identity, claiming that Bosniaks were either Serb or Croat in origin, but of Islamic religion. This debate, whether Bosnia and the Bosniaks are really Croats, Serbs, or a separate Bosniak Bosnian nation, has energized debates among nationalists until the present day. Anthropologists find the nationalist statements on \"Bosniak\" origin rather irrational and ultimately undignified attention, since, with a few notable exceptions, the ethnicity and history of the dominated in communist and monarchy Yugoslavia has been prescribed by the dominators and by the general demographics of a region.\n</p><p>Like national identity in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general, Bosniak national identity is chiefly based on religion and communal feeling, as opposed to linguistic and/or physical differences from their neighbors. In that sense, the earliest foundation of modern Bosniak national development can be found as early as the beginning of the 18th century, as native Bosnian Muslims found themselves often fighting against the empire's enemies by their own (i.e. the Battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Banja_Luka\" title=\"Banja Luka\">Banja Luka</a>, where the city's garrison was composed entirely of Bosniaks). On top of present cultural uniqueness, by the first half of the 19th century upper class Bosniaks and intellectuals were already propagating what can be considered early Bosniak nationalism, by way of writing and politics, all of which would later lead to the Bosniak rebirth at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nationalism\">Nationalism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Bosniaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Nationalism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main articles: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_(1878%E2%80%931918)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)\">History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Rise_of_nationalism_under_the_Ottoman_Empire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire\">Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Illyrian_movement\" title=\"Illyrian movement\">Illyrian movement</a></div>\n<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina was occupied and administered by <a href=\"/wiki/Austria-Hungary\" title=\"Austria-Hungary\">Austria-Hungary</a> in 1878, and a number of Bosniaks left Bosnia and Herzegovina. Official Austro-Hungarian records show that 56,000 people mostly Bosniaks emigrated between 1883 and 1920, but the number of Bosniak emigrants is probably much larger, as the official record doesn't reflect emigration before 1883, nor include those who left without permits. Most of the emigrants probably fled in fear of retribution after the intercommunal violence of the 1875\u20131878 uprising. Many Serbs from Herzegovina left for America during the same period. One geographer estimates that there are 350,000 Bosniaks in Turkey today, although that figure includes the descendants of Muslim South Slavs who emigrated from the <a href=\"/wiki/Sand%C5%BEak\" title=\"Sand\u017eak\">Sand\u017eak</a> region during the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Balkan_War\" title=\"First Balkan War\">First Balkan War</a> and later. Another wave of Bosniak emigration occurred after the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">First World War</a>, when Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats,_and_Slovenes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes\">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes</a>, known after 1929 as Yugoslavia.\n</p><p>Urban Bosniaks were particularly proud of their <a href=\"/wiki/Multicultural\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Multicultural\">cosmopolitan</a> culture, especially in the Bosnian capital, <a href=\"/wiki/Sarajevo\" title=\"Sarajevo\">Sarajevo</a>, which was, until <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, home to thriving Bosniak, Serb, Croat, and Jewish communities.

A member of this group was father of <a href=\"/wiki/Safvet-beg_Ba%C5%A1agi%C4%87\" title=\"Safvet-beg Ba\u0161agi\u0107\">Safvet-beg Ba\u0161agi\u0107</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Bosnians\" title=\"Bosnians\">Bosnian</a> poet. The Bosniak group would remain active for several decades, with the continuity of ideas and the use of the archaic Bosniak name. From 1891 until 1910, they published a magazine titled <i>Bosniak</i>. However, by the start of the 20th century, this group had all but died out, due to its most prominent members either dying or deciding for <a href=\"/wiki/Croat\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Croat\">Croat</a> identity.\n</p><p>The administration of <a href=\"/wiki/Benjamin_Kallay\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Benjamin Kallay\">Benjamin Kallay</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Austria-Hungary\" title=\"Austria-Hungary\">Austria-Hungarian</a> governor of <a href=\"/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\" title=\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, enforced the idea of a unitary <i><a href=\"/wiki/Bosnians\" title=\"Bosnians\">Bosnian</a> nation</i> (<i>Bosanci</i>) that would include the Catholic and Orthodox Bosnians as well as Muslims. The idea was fiercely opposed by Croats and Serbs, but also by a number of Muslims. This policy further clouded the Bosnian ethnical issue and made the Bosniak group seem as pro-regime. After Kallays death in 1903, the official policy slowly drifted towards accepting the three-ethnical reality of Bosnia.\n</p><p>Muslim National Organization (MNO), a political party founded in 1906, was a major opponent of the regime and promoted the idea of Muslims as a separate entity from <a href=\"/wiki/Serbs\" title=\"Serbs\">Serbs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Croats\" title=\"Croats\">Croats</a>. A group of dissidents that, among other things, identified themselves with the Croat Muslim identity formed a party named Muslim Progressive Party (MNS), However, the party received little popular support and faded away over the next few years.\n</p><p>The first <a href=\"/wiki/Constitution\" title=\"Constitution\">constitution</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\" title=\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> from 1910 explicitly mentioned <a href=\"/wiki/Serbs\" title=\"Serbs\">Serbs</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Croats\" title=\"Croats\">Croats</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Muslims_by_nationality\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Muslims by nationality\">Muslims</a> as the \"native peoples\".

MNO, Serb National Organization (SNO) and Croat National Community (HNZ) received almost unanimous support in their respective ballots, and their members formed the parliament, albeit this parliament had little power in the <a href=\"/wiki/Austria-Hungary\" title=\"Austria-Hungary\">Austria-Hungarian</a> province of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

MNO, reformed into the <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslav_Muslim_Organization\" title=\"Yugoslav Muslim Organization\">Yugoslav Muslim Organization</a> (JMO), dropped the pursuit of Muslim national identity and focused on protecting the religious and existential issues of Muslims through <a href=\"/wiki/Coalition\" title=\"Coalition\">coalescing</a> with other parties, sometimes even with the Serbian parties such as <a href=\"/wiki/Nikola_Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87\" title=\"Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107\">Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/People%27s_Radical_Party\" title=\"People&#39;s Radical Party\">People's Radical Party</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Milan_Stojadinovi%C4%87\" title=\"Milan Stojadinovi\u0107\">Milan Stojadinovi\u0107</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslavian_Radical_Community\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yugoslavian Radical Community\">Serbian Radical Party</a>.\n</p><p>In the 1921 census, only <a href=\"/wiki/Serbs\" title=\"Serbs\">Serbs</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Croats\" title=\"Croats\">Croats</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Slovenes\" title=\"Slovenes\">Slovenes</a> were recognized as native nations or \"tribes\", and these were the only available options for ethnicity. The result was that a large number of Bosniaks simply left the field for ethnicity blank. This phenomenon, labeled <i>nonethnical element</i> (<i>nenarodni element</i>), was a topic of heated debate amongst scholars and politicians for years to follow. Some of them argued that the nonethnical element were descendants of the Turkish occupier and as such should be expelled. Nevertheless, thanks to the helpful influence of JMO, there were only isolated incidents of oppression against Bosniaks.\n</p><p>This political void was quickly filled with a number of opposition parties which recognized Muslims as a separate nation. Among them was the <a href=\"/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Yugoslavia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Communist Party of Yugoslavia\">Communist Party of Yugoslavia</a>, as a document from the 1930s reveals. It's no coincidence that a large number of Bosnian Muslims joined the Communist Party, and later the <a href=\"/wiki/Partisans_(Yugoslavia)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Partisans (Yugoslavia)\">partisans</a>, many of them becoming prominent political leaders and commandants.\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, the authorities of the Nazi-puppet <a href=\"/wiki/Independent_State_of_Croatia\" title=\"Independent State of Croatia\">Independent State of Croatia</a> tried to ally with the Bosniaks whom they considered to be \"Muslim Croats\" against the Serbs and other \"undesirables\". As a token, the <a href=\"/wiki/Me%C5%A1trovi%C4%87_Pavilion\" title=\"Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion\">Artists Gallery museum</a> (by <a href=\"/wiki/Ivan_Me%C5%A1trovi%C4%87\" title=\"Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107\">Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107</a>) in <a href=\"/wiki/Zagreb\" title=\"Zagreb\">Zagreb</a> was furnished with minarets and ceded to be used as a mosque.\n</p><p>The Declaration of the State Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH), issued on November 25 of 1943 by the partisan government, is widely considered to be the constitutional basis of the modern <a href=\"/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\" title=\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. This document uses essentially the same wording as the 1910 Constitution. Furthermore, the Resolution of ZAVNOBiH states: \"Today, the nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through their only political representative - the ZAVNOBiH, desire that their country, which is neither Serb, nor Croat nor Muslim, but Serb as well as Croat and Muslim, should be the free and united Bosnia and Herzegovina in which the full equality, legal and otherwise, of Serbs, Muslims and Croats will be guaranteed\".\n</p><p>Unfortunately, this declaration was broken as soon as <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> was over, as the Constitution of the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_People%27s_Republic_of_Yugoslavia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Federal People&#39;s Republic of Yugoslavia\">Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia</a> (later <a href=\"/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia\" title=\"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>) mentioned <a href=\"/wiki/Serbs\" title=\"Serbs\">Serbs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Croats\" title=\"Croats\">Croats</a>, but not <a href=\"/wiki/Muslims_by_nationality\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Muslims by nationality\">Muslims</a>, as the native nations (<i>narodi</i>). In the Yugoslav census of 1948, 90% of Muslims in Yugoslavia declared themselves as \"nationally undetermined\". Furthermore, many who registered as Serbs or Croats did so largely out of societal and economic pressure. When the \"Yugoslav, nationally undeclared\" option became available in 1953, 900,000 people registered as such.\n</p><p>With a weakening of Serb dominance in Bosnian communist leadership, the door opened up for a new national identification. Finally in the 1961 Yugoslav census, the \"Muslims in the ethnic sense\" option first appeared. By 1963 Muslims were listed in the Bosnian constitution alongside Serbs and Croats. Finally, in 1968, \"<a href=\"/wiki/Muslims_by_nationality\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Muslims by nationality\">Muslims</a>\" with a capital M was adopted as the term for a member of a nation rather than \"Muslims\" as adherents to Islam.\n</p><p>The decision wasn't greeted without debate among communist leadership, but Bosniaks had made themselves clear. \"Practice has shown the harm of different forms of pressure,\" read a communique issued by the Bosnian Central Committee, \"from the earlier period when Muslims were designated as Serbs or Croats from the national viewpoint. It has been shown, and present socialist practice confirms, that the Muslims are a distinct nation\".\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:312px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif/310px-Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif\" width=\"310\" height=\"375\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif/465px-Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif/620px-Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif 2x\" data-file-width=\"1213\" data-file-height=\"1467\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ethnic_Composition_of_BiH_in_1991.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Composition of ethnic Bosniaks within Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991 prior to the war.</div></div></div>\n<p>From then until the <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslav_wars\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yugoslav wars\">Yugoslav wars</a>, Bosniak national identity continued to develop with two different philosophies forming. These breakthroughs in the 60s were not carried out by religious Muslims (in fact, they were headed chiefly by secular Muslim communists) but in the following decades two separate schools of thought emerged. The first, was a secular \"Muslim Nationalism\" (as supported by people such as <a href=\"/wiki/Hamdija_Pozderac\" title=\"Hamdija Pozderac\">Hamdija Pozderac</a>), and the second was a separate revival of Islamic religious belief (a reaction to communist-sponsored secularism and advocated by people such as <a href=\"/wiki/Alija_Izetbegovi%C4%87\" title=\"Alija Izetbegovi\u0107\">Alija Izetbegovi\u0107</a>). The effects of these two separate ideas on what exactly Bosnian Muslims are that have also occasionally clashed can be seen to this day.\n</p><p>In September 1993, the Congress of Bosniak Intellectuals<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> re-introduced the historical ethnic name <i>Bosniaks</i> instead of the previously used <a href=\"/wiki/Muslim_by_nationality\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Muslim by nationality\">Muslim by nationality</a>. Other ethnic groups (Serbs and Croats) objected to the name as a ploy to monopolize the history of Bosnia and make them seem to be foreign invaders (see <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\" title=\"History of Bosnia and Herzegovina\">History of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>). The term in itself means <i>Bosnians</i> and is an archaic term that was once used for all inhabitants of Bosnia regardless of faith. Bosniaks counter by pointing out that <i>Bosniak</i> is the historical term for their nation, and that had they truly wanted to \"monopolize\" Bosnian history it would have been far easier to use the \"newer\" version \"<i>Bosanci</i>\" which, however, has a somewhat different meaning.\n</p><p>Since the 1990s, the name has been adopted outside of Bosnia itself, onto the Slavic Muslim population of other former Yugoslav republics such as <a href=\"/wiki/Serbia\" title=\"Serbia\">Serbia</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia\" title=\"Republic of Macedonia\">Macedonia</a>. It allows a Bosniak/Bosnian distinction to match the Serb/Serbian and Croat/Croatian distinctions between ethnicity and residence.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Bosniaks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Wagner, Sarah (2008). <i>To Know Where He Lies: DNA Technology and the Search for Srebrenica\u2019s Missing</i>.
