The Black Swans (Bosnian: Crni labudovi) was a special forces unit within the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was a Patriotic League unit formed in 1992 in Sapna, under the 2nd Corps (later 1st Corps) which eventually numbered 800 men. It earned a reputation for battlefield bravery. The first commander, Senad Mehdin Hodžić, was a former member of the Special anti-terrorist unit of the Yugoslav Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP). When he took command of the Black Swans, he would be known as "Kapetan Labud" or Captain Swan. Captain Hajro Mešić then went on to take the commanding position for a while. The most successful and lasting commander was Brigadier Hase Tirić. The Black Swans' areas of operation included Konjic, Igman and Jablanica. The Black Swans wore black uniforms with their respective unit patch on the left sleeve, and the ARBIH patch on the right sleeve.
