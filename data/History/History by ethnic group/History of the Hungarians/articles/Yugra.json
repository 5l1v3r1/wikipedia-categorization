But on top of the tree there sits a large creature, they say it is a bird.

Next, the golden idol is mentioned in the 16th century by the subjects of the Grand Duke of Moscow, commissioned to describe the trade and military routes of the expanding Russia.

(See Karjalainen 1918:243-245, Shestalov 1987:347.) And <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grigori_Novitski&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Grigori Novitski (page does not exist)\">Grigori Novitski</a>'s statement that in earlier days there used to be in one shrine in Belogorye together with the <i>copper goose</i> \"the greatest real idol\", and that the superstitious people \"preserved that idol and took it to Konda now that idol-worshipping is being rooted up\", has also been regarded as relating to the golden woman (Novitski:61). Actually, no European has ever seen that idol and most probably it never existed in the described form (as a full-length woman made of gold).\n</p><p>Of the \"Copper Goose\" Novitski wrote the following:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The goose idol very much worshipped by them is cast of copper in the shape of a goose, its atrocious abode is in the Belogorye village on the great river of Ob. According to their superstition they worship the god of waterfowls - swans, geese and other birds swimming on water\u2026 His throne in the temple is made of different kinds of broadcloth, canvas and hide, built like a nest; in it sits the monster who is always highly revered, most of all at the times of catching waterfowls in nests\u2026 This idol is so notorious that people come from distant villages to perform atrocious sacrifice to it - offering cattle, mainly horses; and they are certain that it (the idol) is the bearer of many goods, mainly ensuring the richness of waterfowls\u2026\" </p></blockquote>\n<p>Comparisons of different Yugran traditions indicate that the goose was one of the shapes or appearances of the most popular god of the \"World Surveyor Man\", and that <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Belogorye&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Belogorye (page does not exist)\">Belogorye</a> is still sometimes referred to as his home. Novitsky also describes a site for worshipping this \"World Surveyor\" or \"Ob Master\":\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The home of the Ob Master was presumably near the stronghold Samarovo in the mouth of the river Irtysh. According to their heathen belief he was the god of the fish, depicted in a most impudent manner: a board of wood, nose like a tin tube, eyes of glass, little horns on top of the head, covered with rags, attired in a (gilt breasted) purple robe. Arms - bows, arrows, spears, armour, etc - were laid beside him. According to their heathen belief they say about the collected arms that he often has to fight in the water and conquer other vassals. The frenzy ones thought that the atrocious monster is especially horrifying in the darkness and in the large waters, that he comes through all the depths where he watches over all fish and aquatic animals and gives everyone as much as he pleases.\" (Novitsky: 59).</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modern_history\">Modern history</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yugra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Modern history\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Christianization of the Mansi en masse started at the beginning of the 18th century.

The words of the village elder and the caretaker of the sanctuary <b>Nahratch Yeplayev</b> have been recorded:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We all know why you have come here -- you want to pervert us from our ancient beliefs with your smooth-tongued flattery and damage and destroy our revered helper, but it is all in vain for you may take our heads but this we will not let you do.\" (Novitsky: 92-93)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Novitsky describes the above-mentioned idol as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The idol was carved of wood, attired in green clothes, the evil looking face was covered with white iron, a black fox skin was placed on its head; the whole sanctuary, especially his site which was higher than anywhere else, was decorated with purple broadcloth. Other smaller idols nearby which were placed lower were called the servants of the real idol. I think there were many other things in front of him - caftans, squirrel skins, etc\u2026\" (Ibid.: 93)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It seems that a compromise was reached whereby the idols would be saved - for now at least - and at last Nahratsh who had consulted the elders of the village proposed a compromise:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p> \"We will now obey the ruler's regulations and ukase. So we will not discard your teaching, we only beg you not to reject the idol so revered by our fathers and grandfathers, and if you wish to christen us, honour also our idol, christen it in a more honourable manner - with a golden cross. Then we will decorate and build a church with all the icons ourselves, as a custom goes, and we will place ours also among these.\" (Ibid.: 94-95) </p></blockquote>\n<p>This arrangement seems to have lasted for a while, but later it is recorded that this agreement was broken and the totems and idols so sacred to the Mansi and Khanty were burned by Russian Christian zealots. Many of these totems were not destroyed, but were hidden, their locations kept secret over the generations. Even during repression in the 1930s many of these sacred sites remained undiscovered by the authorities and some can be found today.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yugrian_Principalities_and_relations_with_the_Tatars_and_the_Russians\">Yugrian Principalities and relations with the Tatars and the Russians</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yugra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Yugrian Principalities and relations with the Tatars and the Russians\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Kondia.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Coat_of_Arms_of_Kondia.jpeg/220px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Kondia.jpeg\" width=\"220\" height=\"222\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Coat_of_Arms_of_Kondia.jpeg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"291\" data-file-height=\"293\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Kondia.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Coat of Arms of Kondia.</div></div></div>\n<p>There are three or four known proto-states of the Yugran inhabitants, both <a href=\"/wiki/Khanty_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Khanty people\">Khanty</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mansi_people\" title=\"Mansi people\">Mansi</a>.

The stronghold of the Pelym princes was also a significant religious centre; a sacred Siberian larch grew in its surroundings and even in the 18th century people used to hang the skins of sacrificed horses on its branches. Near the sacred tree was a worship storehouse with five idols of human figure, and smaller storehouses with high pillars and human-faced peaks around it for storing sacrificial instruments. The bones of sacrificial animals were stored in a separate building (Novitski: 81). The Principality of <a href=\"/wiki/Kondia\" title=\"Kondia\">Konda</a> (mainly Mansi) formed a large semi autonomous part of the Pelym principality, according to the tax registers from 1628/29 it was inhabited by 257 tax-paying Mansi. The treasures of Prince <i>Agai of Konda</i> who was imprisoned by the Russians in 1594 gives us a good picture of the wealth of the Yugran nobles of this period. Namely, the Russians confiscated two silver crowns, a silver spoon, a silver beaker, a silver spiral bracelet, \"precious drapery\" and numerous pelts and precious furs (Bahrushin 1955,2: 146). The third part of the Pelym principality was the region of Tabary, in which inhabited 102 adults in 1628/29. Preceding the coming of the Russians the Mansi of this region were farmers and according to the tradition Yermak collected tribute in the form of grain (Bahrushin 1955,2: 147).\n</p><p>It is believed that the Yugran people or <a href=\"/wiki/Ob-Ugrians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ob-Ugrians\">Ob-Ugrians</a> had made trade with many countries far and wide since the earliest times.

At that time, the Russians probably came into contact with the <a href=\"/wiki/Mansi_people\" title=\"Mansi people\">Mansi</a> who were still living in Europe, along the upper course of the river <a href=\"/wiki/Pechora\" title=\"Pechora\">Pechora</a>, in the neighbourhood of the ancient <a href=\"/wiki/Komi_peoples\" title=\"Komi peoples\">Komi</a> realm of <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Perm\" title=\"Great Perm\">Great Perm</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Novgorod_Chronicle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Novgorod Chronicle\">Novgorod Chronicle</a> tells of a military campaign under the leadership of <i>Yadrei of Novgorod</i> in 1193, which ended in the destruction of the Novgorod forces. The defeat was blamed on some Novgorodans who had reportedly \"been in contact with the Yugrans\" (Bahrushin 1955,1:75). In the 13th to 15th centuries, Yugra was supposed to pay tribute to Novgorod. But taxes could be collected only by means of armed forces. The chronicles describe several campaigns, mentioning the strong resistance of Yugran princes who took shelter in their strongholds. After the annexation of <a href=\"/wiki/Ustyug\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ustyug\">Ustyug</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Moscow\" title=\"Moscow\">Moscow</a> in the 14th century, Muscovite campaigns began instead of the Novgorodan ones.\n</p><p>In the 15th century, the most important Russian stronghold in Permland and the starting point for all expeditions going to the East was the diocese established on the <a href=\"/wiki/Vym_River\" title=\"Vym River\">Vym River</a> by Stephan of Perm. In 1455 the <a href=\"/wiki/Mansi_people\" title=\"Mansi people\">Mansi</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Pelym\" title=\"Pelym\">Pelym</a> launched a campaign under the command of <i>Prince Asyka</i>.

In the source it is told that 40 strongholds were taken and 58 Khanty and Mansi princes captured in the expedition. Even though already at the end of the 15th century the Grand Duke of Moscow assumed the honorary title of <i>Prince of Yugra</i> by the 16th century several Yugran princes were paying tribute to the <a href=\"/wiki/Siberia_Khanate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Siberia Khanate\">Siberia Khanate</a> and participated in their military ventures against Russian settlers protected by <a href=\"/wiki/Cossacks\" title=\"Cossacks\">Cossacks</a> and Komi auxiliaries who were chasing the Yugran natives from their homes.\n</p><p>In response the Khanty and Mansi of <a href=\"/wiki/Pelym\" title=\"Pelym\">Pelym</a> continually sent forth counter-campaigns to the lands of <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Perm\" title=\"Great Perm\">Great Perm</a>.

According to Russian estimates, the army of the Mansi and their allies, the Tartars, stood 700 strong (Bahrushin 1955,1:99; 2:144).

In some sources, <i>Alach, Prince of <a href=\"/wiki/Kondia\" title=\"Kondia\">Koda</a></i> figures as an important ally of the Siberian Khan <a href=\"/wiki/Kuchum\" title=\"Kuchum\">Kuchum Khan</a> and is said to have been awarded one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Yermak\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yermak\">Yermak</a> mail-coats taken from the enemy (Bahrushin 1955, 1:114). In 1592, another Russian campaign against the Mansi of Pelym was launched. It ended in 1593 when the stronghold of Prince <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ablegirim_of_Pelym&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ablegirim of Pelym (page does not exist)\">Ablegirim of Pelym</a> was taken, the prince and his family captured and a Russian fortress erected in the heart of the stronghold. Although in the following year the Pelym principality suffered the loss of its lands lying on the <a href=\"/wiki/Konda_River\" title=\"Konda River\">Konda River</a>, the Mansi did not give up resistance. In 1599, they once again brought \"war, theft and treachery\" to the banks of the <a href=\"/wiki/Chusovaya_River\" title=\"Chusovaya River\">Chusovaya River</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kurya_River&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kurya River (page does not exist)\">Kurya River</a> and plundered the Russian settlements there (Bahrushin,2:143-144).\n</p><p>The close connections between the Yugrans and the Turkic Tartars are also demonstrated by the fact that even in the 1660s, the idea of restoring the Kuchum Khanate was still popular with the Khanty of <a href=\"/wiki/Beryozovo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beryozovo\">Beryozovo</a> (Ibid). It was only in the middle of the 17th century that Moscow succeeded in subduing Yugra.\n</p><p>In the 18th century the successors of the Principality of Pelym and <a href=\"/wiki/Kondia\" title=\"Kondia\">Principality of Konda</a> - princes Vassili and Fyodor - lived in Pelym. They became Russianized and performed various duties for the Tsarist government. The Mansi, however, considered them still as their rulers. The fact that the ancient family of princes ruled on in Konda is also proved by a tsar letter from 1624:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p> \"He, prince Vassili and prince Fyodor have close brothers in Big Konda - our tax-paying murzas, and our simple Voguls are ruled by them in Big Konda, the brothers of prince Vasily, the murzas.\" (Bahrushin 1955,2: 148) </p></blockquote><p> Prince <i>Kyntsha of Konda</i> received a deed of gift from Tsar in 1680 which confirmed his noble position. Even in the 18th century the Konda princes were known for their relative independence. It is assumed that even in 1715 Prince <i>Satyga of Konda</i> and his 600 armed men made an attempt to impede the <a href=\"/wiki/Christianisation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Christianisation\">christianisation</a> of the Konda Mansi (Novitski: 98). During 1732\u20131747 Konda was ruled by Satyga's son Prince <i>Osip Grigoryev</i>, followed by his own son Prince <i>Vlas Ossipov</i>. According to recent research by Aado Lintrop one of the great-grandchildren of Satyga, the teacher of the Turinsky community school, <i>Aleksander Satygin</i> claimed the title \"Prince of Konda\" as late as 1842.\n</p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hungarian_Urheimat\">Hungarian Urheimat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Yugra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Hungarian Urheimat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Name_of_Hungary\" title=\"Name of Hungary\">Name of Hungary</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hungarian_prehistory\" title=\"Hungarian prehistory\">Hungarian prehistory</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Hungarian_migration.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Hungarian_migration.png/300px-Hungarian_migration.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Hungarian_migration.png/450px-Hungarian_migration.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Hungarian_migration.png/600px-Hungarian_migration.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"850\" data-file-height=\"689\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Hungarian_migration.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Migration of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hungarians\" title=\"Hungarians\">Hungarians</a> from  <a href=\"/wiki/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Yugra is also considered to be the place of origin of the <a href=\"/wiki/Hungarians\" title=\"Hungarians\">Hungarians</a> (in Hungarian <i><a href=\"/wiki/Magyar_%C5%91shaza\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Magyar \u0151shaza\">magyar \u0151shaza</a></i>).
