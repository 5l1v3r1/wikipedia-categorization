Agere ifa (àgéré Ifá) is a container for storing sacred palm nuts for Yoruba divination. Given its ritual and aesthetic functions, àgéré Ifá  provides the Yoruba carver with a unique opportunity to display his artistic talents. Usually carved from wood and measuring between five and sixteen inches in height, a typical container is in the form of an animal or human figure bearing a small bowl. In some cases, the metaphysical attribute of a given animal motif (such as a snake or mudfish) may be used to further empower the sacred palm nuts inside the bowl. But when the motif assumes a human form, it frequently has a votive significance, especially since some àgéré Ifá are given by clients to a diviner to thank Òrúnmìlà for a blessing or to implore the deity to bestow more favors on the donor.
