Lagelu, Oro a pata maja, ("Oro" in Yoruba means a sprite) was the founder of Ibadan. A military legend and Yoruba's generalisimo from Ile Ife, he founded two (Eba Odan and Eba'dan) of the three cities that eventually became the great and historical city of Ibadan.  Eba Odan + Eba'dan = Ibadan The first military commander of Ibadan was Lagelu, a.k.a., Oro, a pata maja. He left Ile Ife and founded Eba Odan. This city was peaceful and prosperous until it was jealously ravaged by the neighbouring towns and cities. A very old Lagelu and some of his people survived this attack; he then formed another city called Eba'dan on top of "Ori yangi" (meaning rocky mountain) -- now known as the world-famous Oja'ba (Oba's Market)-- in a very close proximity to the ravaged city of Eba Odan. Shortly after, Lagelu, Oro, a pata maja,â€”its founder and defender passed on. For many years, this newly created city enjoyed peace and tranquility till another war engulfed and destroyed her. For the third time, another city was founded, which became Ibadan as we have come to know it. Iwe Itan Ibadan (A Book on the History of Ibadan) by the late Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba I.B. Akinyele
