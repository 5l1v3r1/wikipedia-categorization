 British Empire  Unknown 598 killed The Adubi War (known locally as Ogun Adubi or Egba Uprising) was a conflict in June and July 1918 in the British Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria ostensibly because of the imposition of colonial taxation.  Direct taxes were introduced by the colonial government along with existing forced labour obligations and fees. On the 7th June, the British arrested 70 Egba chiefs and issued an ultimatum that resisters should lay down their arms, pay the taxes and obey the local leadership.  On 11 June, a party of soldiers, recently returned from East Africa, were brought in to help police the area and keep the peace. On 13 June, Egba rebels pulled up railway lines at Agbesi and derailed a train. Other rebels demolished the station at Wasimi and murdered the British agent; the Oba Osile, the African leader of the north-eastern Egba district.  Hostilities between the 30,000 rebels and colonial troops continued for about three weeks at Otite, Tappona, Mokoloki and Lalako but by the 10th July, the rebellion had been put down and the leaders killed or arrested.  About 600 people were killed, including the British agent and the Oba Osile, although this may have been due to a dispute over land and unconnected to the uprising.  The incident led to the abrogation of Abeokutan independence in 1918 and the introduction of forced labour in the region; imposition of the direct taxes was postponed until 1925.   British soldiers who repressed the revolt received the Africa General Service Medal.
