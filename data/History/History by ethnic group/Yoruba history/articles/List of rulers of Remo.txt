The western half of the Ijebu Kingdom in Nigeria is known as Remo. It was initially settled roughly around the second half of the 15th century and was consolidated into a major sector of the kingdom with its own dominant ruling family around the early 16th century. This is a list of the Akarigbo's of Remo, who in many present day sources can also be referred to as the Oba or King of Sagamu (pronounced shagamu ).
