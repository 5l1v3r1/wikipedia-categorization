The Tanais Tablets are two tablets dated late 2nd-3rd century AD, and written in Greek from the city of Tanais, in the proximity of modern Rostov-on-Don, Russia.   At the time, Tanais was composed of a mixed Greek and Sarmatian population. The tablets are public inscriptions which commemorate renovation works in the city. One of the tablets, Tanais Tablet A, is damaged and is not fully reconstructed.  The other one, Tanais Tablet B, is fully preserved and is dated to 220 AD.  The tablets were discovered by Russian archaeologist Pavel Mikhailovich Leontjev in 1853 and are today kept in the lapidary of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.  The tablets are considered important for the early Croatian history. Among the names on the tablets are those of three men: Horoúathos, Horoáthos, and Horóathos (Χορούαθ[ος], Χοροάθος, Χορόαθος).  Those names scholars interpret as anthroponyms of the Croatian ethnonym Hrvat.  The ethnonym Hrvat is generally considered to be of Iranian origin,   and that can be traced to the Tanais Tablets.   The Tanais Tablet B mentions Horoathos as the son of Sandarz which is a Scytho-Sarmatian name, and scholars view this as an indication that early Croats could have been at that time Sarmatians or Alans who became Slavicized in the following centuries.   The tablets were discovered by the Russian archeologist Pavel Mihajlovič Leontjev (1822-1874) in September 1853. Mostly international scholars wrote about the tablets, while of Croatian scholars Stjepan Krizin Sakač, Dominik Mandić and Radoslav Katičić.  However, during the time of Yugoslavia, Yugoslavian scholars avoided discussing them,  or mainly wrote about them in a superficial way and misinterpreted (Ferdo Šišić, Trpimir Macan, Josip Horvat, Bogo Grafenauer, Jaroslav Šidak, Gordan Ravančić, Ivan Biondić, Stjepan Pantelić etc.),  and sometimes malicious manner, for example, Miroslav Krleža saw the connection as "historical lunacy", while Nada Klaić ignored and only mentioned them for the criticizing of the Iranian-Caucasian theory of the Croatian ethnogenesis.  The open debate only followed after the collapse of Yugoslav Communism.  First who connected the tablets personal names with Croatian ethnonym was A. L. Pogodin in 1902,   while first who considered such a thesis and Iranian origin was Konstantin Josef Jireček in 1911.  It should be noted that some scholars use this tablets only to explain the etymology, and not necessarily the ethnogenesis.  However, whether the early Croats have been Slavs who taken the name of Iranian origin or were ruled by Sarmatian elite caste,  or were Slavicized Sarmatians,  the remote Irano-Sarmatian elements or influences on the Croatian ethnogenesis cannot be entirely excluded.   Still, the secure connection of those three personal names with the Croatian ethnonym, or ethnic identity, is rather difficult without more evidence.  The Tablet A is the larger and older inscription, dated to 175-211 AD, and which originates from the time when king Tiberius Julius Sauromates II (175-211 AD) ruled the Bosporan Kingdom.  The marble tablet (0.92 x 0.73 x 0.09) probably sustained heavy damage even before the excavation.  Thirty-two lines from thirty fragments were saved from the inscription.  The public inscription mentions the king, the synod, or devotional assembly, the leadership of the devotional assembly, and its regular members, which were slightly less than forty.  The fourth line ends by mentioning of the father of the devotional assembly, Horoúathos (Χορούαθος), who is referred to by name in the fifth line,  and amongst others an unknown male who is said to be the son of Horoáthos (Χοροάθου) is also cited.  The inscription ends with the date, from which is saved only the appellation of the Greek-Macedonian month, which corresponds to either July or August.  Greek original: ΘΕΩι ΥΨΙΣΤΩι.

The inscription sustained less damage, it is broken into four parts, and is relatively readable.  On it are engraved twenty lines in Greek monumental capitals.  Cited in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth lines, along with the names of their fathers, are the four leaders of the city of Tanais at the time when this monument was erected (Hofarno, Babos, Niblobor, and Horoathos).  The monument was erected because of the renovation of the central square in the city of Tanais.  Greek original: ΑΓΑΘΗΙ ΤΥΧΗΙ.
