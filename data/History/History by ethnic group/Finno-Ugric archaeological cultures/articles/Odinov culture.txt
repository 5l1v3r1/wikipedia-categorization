The Odinov culture is the beginning of the Bronze Age archeological culture of foot hunters named after the settlement Odino in the basin of lower Ishim river in Western Siberia. The culture is dated to the 18th to 16th centuries BCE, but may be older. The Odinov culture is an island surrounded by forest-steppe type cultural array. Its settlements are situated along the terraces of the rivers and creeks. Insufficiently known dwellings appear to be dug-outs.  It is thought that Odinov culture rose from Eneolithic forest- steppe cultures in the Ishim area.  The available materials indicate beginning of tradition of animal husbandry economy. Osteological material is represented exclusively by domesticated animals' bones showing main role of producing economy. Similarity with typical products of tin bronze alloys indicate affiliation with the Seima Turbino phenomenon. The Odinov culture stone industry has not been fully studied.  Odinov culture burials are similar to those of the Krotov culture, they indicate a presence of common rituals typical for the cultures of the northern forest-steppe belonging to the Seima Turbino metallurgical province. The Odinov culture is notable for its ceramics with dishes decorated with comb impressions with or without  rows of pit indentations, coarse textile prints, some pit ornament elements form geometrical figures. Odinov culture is marked by specific borrowings in ornamentation, including pseudo-textile prints, which indicates close ties with the taiga populations.
