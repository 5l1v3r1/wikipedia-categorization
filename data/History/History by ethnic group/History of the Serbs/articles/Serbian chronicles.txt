This is a list of Serbian chronicles, most often referring to works of the Middle Ages, until the Ottoman conquest, hence called Old Serbian chronicles (Serbian: Стари српски летописи/Stari srpski letopisi). There exists c. 30 Serbian chronicles from the period between 1390 and 1526. Chronicles are divided into letopisi (annals, chronicles) and rodoslovi (geneaologies), and in turn by source age into "older" (stariji) and "younger" (mlađi).
