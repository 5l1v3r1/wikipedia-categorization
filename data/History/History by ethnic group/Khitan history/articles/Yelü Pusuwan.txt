Yelü Pusuwan (Chinese: 耶律普速完; pinyin: Yēlǜ Pǔsùwán) — was a regent of Qara Khitai. She stepped up as regent when his older brother Yelü Yilie died, since his son Yelü Zhilugu was still a minor.   In 1165 Masud II pillaged Balkh and Andkhoy with Pusuwan's support. After punitive expeditions in 1169 and 1172, Qara Khitai army crushed Il Arslan, who soon died. His death caused civil war in Khwarazmid realm - his wife Terken Khatun enthroned Sultan Shah, while another son Tekish fled to Qara Khitai and asked for help. Around this time Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba sent a tribute to empress.  Yelü Pusuwan sent her husband Xiao Duolubu (蕭朵魯不) with a huge army who defeated Sultan Shah and put Tekish to throne on 11 December 1172. In eastern border, she tried subdue Naimans and Qanglis unsuccessfully by sending her general Erbuz (额儿布思).  After a while Tekish fed up with growing Qara Khitai demands of tribute and killed an emissary sent by Pusuwan, who was her relative. This caused Pusuwan to favor Sultan Shah. Xiao Duolubu was sent again, this time to dethrone the very man he coronated. While Duolubu was away, she was infatuated with his brother Xiao Puguzhi (蕭樸古只). She created Duolubu as "Pacifier of East" (東平王) but spent more time lately with her new lover. When her father-in-law Xiao Wolila (萧斡里剌) found about the relationship, he surrounded the palace and killed both lovers. Her nephew Yelü Zhilugu was installed as new emperor.
