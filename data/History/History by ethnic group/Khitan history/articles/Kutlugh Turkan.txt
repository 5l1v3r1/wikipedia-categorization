Kutlugh Turkan (d. 1283), was a sovereign ruler of Kirman from 1257 until 1282.  She was the daughter of Buraq Hajib of Kirman and married her father's cousin Qutb al-Din (d. 1257). When her father died in 1234, he was first succeeded by her brother Rukn al-Din (d. 1252), and then by her spouse. When she was widowed in 1257, when their son Hajjaj was  a minor, the Kirman notables asked the Mongol overlords to recognize his mother, Buraq Hajib's daughter and Qutb al-Din's mother, as the sovereign of Kirman, which they did. She established an alliance with Mongolia by sending her son to the army of Hulagu, and marrying her daughter Padishah Khatun to Abaka Khan, Hulagu's son.  She was officially confirmed in her title by Hulagu 1264, named 'Ismat al-dunya wa al-din, and had the khutba proclaimed in her name.  Her former stepson Suyurghatamish contested her right to rule and eventually forced her to name him her co-ruler. However, she: "complained to her daughter Padishah Khatun and received a yarligh forbidding her stepson to meddle in the affairs of Kirman".  The last years of her reign was described as a golden age of Kirman. In 1282, however, the Ilkhan Ahmad Teguder placed Suyurghatamish on the throne of Kirman. She traveled to the Mongol court at Tabriz to protest, but without success. In 1291, Suyurghatamish was deposed by her daughter Padishah Khatun.
