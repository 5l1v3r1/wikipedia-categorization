Li Weiyue, Li Na, Tian Chengsi's nephew and successor <a href=\"/wiki/Tian_Yue\" title=\"Tian Yue\">Tian Yue</a>, and Liang thus prepared for war against the imperial regime.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Liang was quickly defeated by <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Xilie\" title=\"Li Xilie\">Li Xilie</a> and committed suicide, while imperial forces inflicted serious damage on Tian's and Li Na's forces.

When Li Weiyue tried to counterattack in spring 782, Zhu and Zhang's joint forces defeated him at Shulu (\u675f\u9e7f, in modern Shijiazhuang), forcing him to flee back to Chengde's capital Heng Prefecture.  It was said that during the Battle of Shulu, Wang Wujun, serving as Li Weiyue's forward commander and believing that Li Weiyue was already suspicious of him, decided not to fight to the best of his ability, and that this led to the defeat.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ227_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ227-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>After the defeat, Li Weiyue was even more suspicious of Wang, but his advisors pointed out that there was no one other than Wang who would be capable to command the army.  Li Weiyue thus commissioned Wang, assisted by Wei Changning (\u885b\u5e38\u5be7), to attack Zhao Prefecture, and put Wang Shizhen in charge of security at headquarters.  Wang Wujun was relieved to get to leave Heng Prefecture, and once he exited the city, initially wanted to flee to Zhang.  Wei pointed out that Emperor Dezong had issued an edict promising to give the offices that Li Weiyue wanted to whoever would cut off Li Weiyue's head and advocated for an attack on Li Weiyue.  Wang Wujun thus notified Wang Shizhen and involved Li Weiyue's close associate Xie Zun (\u8b1d\u9075) in the plot at well.  He made a surprise attack against Heng Prefecture, and Wang Shizhen and Xie opened the city gates to welcome him.  Wang Wujun killed Li Weiyue and his associates and surrendered to the imperial government.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ227_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ227-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rebellion_against_Emperor_Dezong\">Rebellion against Emperor Dezong</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wang_Wujun&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Rebellion against Emperor Dezong\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Emperor Dezong, in the aftermaths, divided Chengde's seven prefectures into three smaller circuits \u2014 with Zhang Xiaozhong receiving three prefectures and the title of military governor of the newly created Yidingcang Circuit (\u6613\u5b9a\u6ec4, headquartered in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Baoding\" title=\"Baoding\">Baoding</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hebei\" title=\"Hebei\">Hebei</a>, later renamed Yiwu Circuit (\u7fa9\u6b66)), while Wang Wujun and Kang Rizhi received two prefectures each with lesser titles of military prefect (\u5718\u7df4\u4f7f, <i>Tuanlianshi</i>), of Hengji (\u6046\u5180) and Shenzhao (\u6df1\u8d99, both headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang).  This displeased both Zhu Tao and Wang \u2014 as Zhu had wanted Emperor Dezong to give him Shen Prefecture (\u6df1\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Hengshui\" title=\"Hengshui\">Hengshui</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hebei\" title=\"Hebei\">Hebei</a>), which went to Kang instead (Emperor Dezong gave Zhu two prefectures on paper,  De (\u5fb7\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Dezhou\" title=\"Dezhou\">Dezhou</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shandong\" title=\"Shandong\">Shandong</a>) and Di (\u68e3\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Binzhou\" title=\"Binzhou\">Binzhou</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shandong\" title=\"Shandong\">Shandong</a>), both then still held by Li Na, and Wang believed that Emperor Dezong had reneged on the promise to reward him with the positions that Li Weiyue had wanted.

Wang was pleased, and agreed to join him and Tian.  (Zhu also tried to persuade Zhang to join the alliance, but Zhang refused.)  When Emperor Dezong sent emissaries to order Zhu and Wang to advance south against Tian, Wang arrested the imperial emissaries and delivered them to Zhu, thus openly turning against imperial authority.  Zhu, as promised, transferred control of Shen Prefecture to Wang, while sending forces to join Wang's in sieging Kang at Zhao Prefecture.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ227_7-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ227-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, by this point, Tian was in desperate straits under siege from imperial forces commanded by Ma, <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Baozhen\" title=\"Li Baozhen\">Li Baozhen</a>, and Li Qiu (\u674e\u827d) at his capital Wei Prefecture (\u9b4f\u5dde).  Zhu and Wang thus advanced south to relieve him, and as they arrived, so did additional imperial forces commanded by <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Huaiguang\" title=\"Li Huaiguang\">Li Huaiguang</a>.  Against Ma's advice of waiting until his soldiers had enough rest, Li Huaiguang decided to battle Zhu and Wang immediately.  He had initial successes, but Wang cut his soldiers off from each other with a charge, leading to a major defeat for the imperial forces.  Zhu and Wang then tried to cut off the imperial troops escape, but Ma then promised to request that Emperor Dezong put Zhu in charge of the entire region north of the Yellow River.  Despite Wang's stern opposition, Zhu believed him and did not pursue imperial forces further, so the imperial forces were able to withdraw over a river from Wei Prefecture, and were able to take up a posture against the rebel forces, thus putting the armies into a stalemate.  Zhu, seeing that he had been tricked by Ma, apologized to Wang, but Wang, while accepting the apology, thereafter resented Zhu.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ227_7-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ227-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the aftermaths of the imperial forces' defeat, Tian was grateful to Zhu, and offered to subjugate himself and Wang to Zhu \u2014 in effect, offering the emperor title to Zhu.

At the suggestion of Zhu's staff member Li Ziqian (\u674e\u5b50\u5343) and Wang's staff member Zheng Ru (\u912d\u6fe1), they decided to each claim a princely title to show independence from imperial authority, but keep Tang's <a href=\"/wiki/Era_name\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Era name\">era name</a> in order not to completely break from Tang.  On December 9, 782,<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> in an elaborate ceremony, Zhu claimed the title of Prince of Ji; Wang claimed the title of Prince of Zhao; Tian claimed the title of Prince of Wei; and they issued a letter offering Li Na the title of Prince of Qi.

Zhu left his general Ma Shi (\u99ac\u5bd4) at Weibo and personally relieved Qingwan, defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun and forcing them to withdraw back to Yi Prefecture, under Zhang Xiaozhong's control.  Upon defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun, however, Zhu did not immediately return to Weibo, and Wang sent his subordinate Song Duan (\u5b8b\u7aef) to Zhu, urging him to return to Weibo as soon as possible.  When Song met Zhu, Song was harsh in his words, and Zhu threw a fit of anger\u2014causing Wang to be fearful and to apologize to Ma in person.  Zhu's angers subsided, and it was said that he continued to treat Wang as an ally, but that Wang's secret resentment toward Zhu grew even more.  Wang subsequently responded to an overture by Li Baozhen into forming a secret alliance, although he also continued in alliance with Zhu, Tian, and Li Na.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ228_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ228-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In fall 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (\u6d87\u539f, headquartered in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Pingliang\" title=\"Pingliang\">Pingliang</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gansu\" title=\"Gansu\">Gansu</a>), then at Chang'an in preparation for deployment to the Weibo front, were angry that they were not given sufficient rewards, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (\u5949\u5929, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Xianyang\" title=\"Xianyang\">Xianyang</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shaanxi\" title=\"Shaanxi\">Shaanxi</a>).

Zhu Tao, upon receiving the communique from Zhu Ci, immediately spread the news to the other circuits in hopes that they would declare for Zhu Ci as well.

Zhu thus continued to siege two primary cities of Weibo \u2014 with Zhu himself sieging Bei Prefecture (\u8c9d\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Xingtai\" title=\"Xingtai\">Xingtai</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hebei\" title=\"Hebei\">Hebei</a>), defended by the Weibo general Xing Caojun (\u90a2\u66f9\u4fca), and Ma Shi sieging Wei Prefecture, but could not capture either.  Meanwhile, Li Baozhen and Wang had joined their forces and advanced into Weibo territory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ230_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ230-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Hearing the news, Ma Shi lifted the siege on Bei Prefecture and joined forces with Zhu.  When Zhu prepared to battle Wang and Li Baozhen the next day, Ma Shi, citing the fact that his soldiers at just travelled a substantial distance, requested a few days of rest.  However, the Huige general assisting Zhu, as well as Yang Bu (\u694a\u5e03) and Cai Xiong, advocated for immediate attack.  The next day, May 29, 784,<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> the armies battled, and the overly confident Zhu was defeated by Wang's and Li Baozhen's forces.  Over 10,000 of his 30,000 soldiers were killed, and over 10,000 deserted.  Zhu, with a few thousand remaining soldiers, feared annihilation at Wang's and Li Baozhen's hands and fled to De Prefecture.  Wang and Li Baozhen were unable to give chase because of dense fog.  After defeating Zhu, Wang returned to Heng Prefecture and declined the additional title of military governor of Lulong, and Emperor Dezong agreed.  Soon, with Wang continuing to attack Zhu, Zhu resubmitted to Tang authority as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ZZTJ231_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ZZTJ231-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Meanwhile, in the aftermaths of Wang's and Li Baozhen's victory over Zhu, De and Di Prefectures, which Zhu had taken over, surrendered to Wang and were incorporated into Chengde, formally under the command of Wang's son Wang Shizhen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-BT142_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BT142-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  By 790, however, Zhao Gao (\u8d99\u93ac) the prefect of Di Prefecture had offended Wang and was refusing Wang's summons.  Meanwhile, there were rumors that Li Na, whom Tian Xu's older brother Tian Chao (\u7530\u671d) served under as prefect of Qi Prefecture (\u9f4a\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Ji%27nan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ji&#39;nan\">Ji'nan</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shandong\" title=\"Shandong\">Shandong</a>), was planning to escort Tian Chao back to Weibo to vie for control of Weibo Circuit.  Tian Xu feared this, and, under suggestion by his staff member Sun Guangzuo (\u5b6b\u5149\u4f50), he sent gifts to Li Na to please him and persuade him to send Tian Chao to Chang'an \u2014 and further suggested Li Na to accept Zhao's submission.  Li Na therefore accepted Zhao's surrender and took Di Prefecture, despite Wang's attacks.  Tian further cemented the relationship with Li Na by sending Sun to Pinglu's headquarters at Yun Prefecture (\u9106\u5dde), announcing an imperial edict (which Tian Xu had forged) declaring Di Prefecture to be part of Pinglu Circuit.  In anger, Wang Wujun sent his son Wang Shiqing (\u738b\u58eb\u6e05) to attack Weibo's Bei Prefecture (\u8c9d\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Xingtai\" title=\"Xingtai\">Xingtai</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hebei\" title=\"Hebei\">Hebei</a>), occupying four counties of Bei Prefecture.  In winter 790, Emperor Dezong, wanting to put an end to the campaigns between these circuits, ordered Li Na to return Di Prefecture to Chengde; Li Na demanded that Wang return the four counties of Bei Prefecture to Weibo first.  Wang did so, and subsequently, Li Na returned Di Prefecture to Chengde.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 792, Li Na died, and his son <a href=\"/wiki/Li_Shigu\" title=\"Li Shigu\">Li Shigu</a> succeeded him.  Wang Wujun felt that he could take advantage of Li Shigu's youth, and therefore sent an army to De and Di Prefectures, readying an attack on two Pinglu forts \u2014 Geduo<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> (in modern Binzhou) and Sancha (\u4e09\u6c4a).  Li Shigu sent Zhao to defend against the expected attack.  Emperor Dezong sent <a href=\"/wiki/Eunuch_(court_official)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eunuch (court official)\">eunuchs</a> to order them to stop fighting, and thereafter Wang withdrew.  Meanwhile, in 793, after an incident when Zhang Xiaozhong's son Zhang Shenglin (\u5f35\u6607\u7498), whose older brother Zhang Shengyun (\u5f35\u6607\u96f2) had succeeded their father Zhang Xiaozhong as military governor of Yiwu in 791 after Zhang Xiaozhong's death and who was also a son-in-law of Li Na's, publicly cursed Wang, Wang submitted an accusation against Zhang Shenglin for disrespect.  Emperor Dezong ordered that Zhang Shenglin be removed from his office as military prefect of Hai Prefecture (\u6d77\u5dde, in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Lianyungang\" title=\"Lianyungang\">Lianyungang</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jiangsu\" title=\"Jiangsu\">Jiangsu</a>) and detained.  However, Wang used this excuse to attack Yiwu, capturing Yifeng (\u7fa9\u8c50, in modern Baoding) and seizing 10,000 people.  Only after repeated apologies by Zhang Shengyun did Wang withdraw.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 794, when Li Baozhen died, his son Li Jian (\u674e\u7dd8) tried to take control of his Zhaoyi Circuit (\u662d\u7fa9, headquartered in modern <a href=\"/wiki/Changzhi\" title=\"Changzhi\">Changzhi</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Shanxi\" title=\"Shanxi\">Shanxi</a>) and sought material aid (in forms of a loan) from Wang.  Wang firmly rebuked him, and subsequently, without support from neighboring circuits or Zhaoyi's own officers, Li Jian gave up his attempt to seize the circuit.  In 796, Emperor Dezong bestowed on Wang the greater honorary chancellor title of <i>Zhongshu Ling</i> (\u4e2d\u66f8\u4ee4).<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>  Wang died in 801 and was posthumously honored with the same ceremony that had been used for the great general <a href=\"/wiki/Hun_Jian\" title=\"Hun Jian\">Hun Jian</a>.
