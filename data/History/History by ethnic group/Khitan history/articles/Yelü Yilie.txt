Shaoxing (紹興 Shàoxīng) or Xuxing (Xùxīng 續興) Yelü Yilie (Chinese: 辽仁宗) — was second emperor of Qara Khitai. He was too young when Yelü Dashi died in 1143. Not much is known about his reign.  History of Liao states he changed his era name to Shaoxing in 1151, however recent coins unearthed in Central Asia might prove it was a scribal mistake.  During his reign, there was a census conducted, which turned out 84500 households in empire. Although it may also be number of adult men who can serve in the army.  In 1156, he tried to establish peace with Jin dynasty unsuccessfully.  Same year Karluks under Ayyar Beg revolted against Western Karakhanid ruler Ibrahim III and killed him. Yelü Yilied appointed Ali b. Hasan as Chaghrï Khan to Samarqand. Chagri marched on Ayyar Beg with reinforcements from Qara Khitai and eastern Karakhanid Ibrahim II  (who was created Ilig Türkmen by Yelü Dashi ). Ibrahim's forced killed Ayyar Beg and Chaghri Khan reinstated on his throne. In 1158 Yelü Yilie ordered expulsion of Karluks from Bukhara and Samarqand to Kashgar and charged Chaghri to deal with matter. Purged Karluks went to Khwarazmshah Il-Arslan to ask for help. Chaghri just had reinforcements from new East Karakhanid ruler Muhammed II consisting of 10,000 men, while Karluks marched on Bukhara with Khwarazmi help. Same year Chaghri died and was replaced by Masud II who appeared before Bukhara and defeated Karluks. Same year Yelü Yilie died and since his son Yelü Zhilugu was too young, Yelü Pusuwan stepped up as his regent.
