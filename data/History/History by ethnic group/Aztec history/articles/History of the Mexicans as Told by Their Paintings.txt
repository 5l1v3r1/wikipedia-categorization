The History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings (Spanish: Historia de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas) is a Spanish language, post-conquest codex written in the 1530s. This manuscript was likely composed by Father Andrés de Olmos, an early Franciscan friar.  It is presumed to be based upon one or more indigenous pictorial codices. Henry Phillips Jr., a 19th-century historian, made a translation of the document in the 1880s and referred to it as the Codex Ramírez, after Bishop Ramírez de Fuenleal who authorized its creation in 1532. It is held in the library of the University of Texas at Austin.
