Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Musa (? - outskirts of Zaragoza, 898), was a Muslim lord who held the medina quarter of Zaragoza and Larida,   in the Upper March of Al-Andalus. Muhammad was son to Lubb ibn Musa (and thus grandson to the famous Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi), from the prominent Muwallad Muslim Banu Qasi clan, of Visigothic or Hispano-Roman extraction. He had at least six sons, Lubb, Musa, Yusuf, Abd Allah, Yunus and Mutarrif.  The sons began to quarrel among themselves, thus provoking, to a great extent, the complete dismantling of Banu Qasi power throughout the Ebro valley. When his father and his uncles rebelled against emir Muhammad I of Córdoba, Muhammad ibn Lubb supported the emir leading an army that defeated his own uncle, Isma'il ibn Musa.   In 882, he had already conquered Zaragoza, where attempted to rule independent of Córdoba lord,   but the constant pressure of the Arab Banu Tujibi clan (Arabic: بنو تجيب‎), forced him into the choice of selling the Zaragoza to the emir by 885.    Raimon, count of Pallars acted as intermediary in the transfer.  After further family disputes, and with the ascendancy of Abd Allah to the throne of Córdoba, Muhammad's pact with the new emir led him to be appointed new wali of Larida (contrarily to the pretensions that the wali of Huesca, the also Muwallad Muhammad al-Tawil, had to such dignity).   But Muhammad then ceded the dignity to his son Lubb.   In 897, Muhammad conquered Toledo.  In 898, he initiated a new military campaign to recover Zaragoza, but died during its siege  surprised by an enemy warrior while he was resting, in October 8.
