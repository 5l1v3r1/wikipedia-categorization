The Ilergetes were an ancient Iberian (Pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula (the Roman Hispania) who dwelt in the plains area of the rivers Segre and Cinca towards Iberus (Ebro) river, and in and around Ilerda/Iltrida, present-day Lleida/LÃ©rida. They are believed to have spoken the Iberian language. Indibilis, king or chief of the Ilergetes, resisted against the Carthaginian and Roman invasions.
