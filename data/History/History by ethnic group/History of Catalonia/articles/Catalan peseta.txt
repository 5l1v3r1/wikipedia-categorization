The peseta was a unit of currency in Catalonia until 1850, when the whole of Spain decimalized. It was also a name used throughout Spain for an amount of 4 reales de vellón. In Catalonia, the peseta was subdivided into 6 sueldos, each of 4 quartos (also spelled cuartos), 8 ochavos or 12 dineros. Five pesetas were equal to one duro, which was itself equal to the Spanish 8 reales de plata fuerte (Spanish dollar). In the new, decimal currency, the peseta was worth 4 reales. The name peseta reappeared in 1868 for the new Spanish currency. Its value was equivalent to that of the earlier peseta. The name of the currency comes from pesseta, the diminutive form of the word peça, which is a Catalan word that means piece or fraction. The first non-official coins which contained the word "peseta" were made in 1808 in Barcelona. During the 1809-14 period, coins denominated in pesetas and quartos were minted in Barcelona.
