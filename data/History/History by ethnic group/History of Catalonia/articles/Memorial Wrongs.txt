The Memorial de Greuges (Catalan) or Memorial Wrongs is the name by which the report was popularly known in defense of the moral and material interests of Catalonia, sent to King Alfonso XII of Spain in 1885 in the style of old Claims of the Catalan Cortes. It was published in a ceremony chaired by Joaquim Rubi√≥ i Ors and consisted of a series of economic and political demands on the occasion of the trade agreement between Spain and Britain and attempts to unify the Civil Law in Spain. The document was a collaborative effort of the intelligentsia and the middle and upper class, and industrial Catalonia is considered the first political act of Catalan nationalism, setting what would become the basis of Manresa in 1892.
