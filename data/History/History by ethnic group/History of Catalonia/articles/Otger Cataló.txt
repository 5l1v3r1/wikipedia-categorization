Otger Cataló (or  'Catalon' ) is a legendary character who with the Nine Barons of Fame would have conquered Catalonia from the Saracens sometime in the 8th century AD. According to some old theories[by whom?], the name of Catalonia would have derived from its surname. In any case, the oldest written references to this character that have survived are from the fifteenth century, much later than any contemporaneous source. The legend was recovered mainly from XIX with the appearance of Catalan and by the works of the authors of the Catalan Renaixença: Víctor Balaguer, Antoni Ferrer i Codina and Jacinto Verdaguer.   The legend is based on events that occurred in three different generations. Otger agrees in the name and on the date of death with Otger (671-735),  Arcomte de Catalanum  (710-735), Duke of Aquitaine, who died in the battle for the reconquest of Roses and was buried in the Monastery of the island of Ré.
