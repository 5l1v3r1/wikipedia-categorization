The House of Entença was an ancient and noble dynasty of the Crown of Aragon. The Entença noble family originated in the town of Entença in La Franja, presently in Aragon, around the 11th century. Later, in the 13th century the Barony of Entença was established in the Priorat and Ribera d'Ebre areas that had been conquered to the saracens and needed repopulation. Further south, the Barons of Entença shared the lordship over Tortosa in Baix Ebre. By 1313 William II of Entença was deeply in debt and decided to donate the Barony of Entença to king James II of Aragon. King James II waited until William's death to take possession of the Barony. Thus, in 1324 King James II annexed the Barony of Entença to the County of Prades, which he established for his son Ramon Berenguer. In this manner the dominions of the Barons of Entença became part of the County of Prades. In 1414 Joana de Prades inherited the Barony of Entença. Following her marriage to Joan Folch de Cardona, the lineage of Entença merged with the viscounts of Cardona. The ruins of the Casa de la Reina Teresa d'Entença  can still be seen in Entença village, close to Benavarri. Because of the historical significance of this bloodline, streets or squares named 'Entença' or 'Entenza' are common in towns and villages throughout Catalonia, the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands. Also some present-day municipalities —such as Vandellòs i l'Hospitalet de l'Infant, Marçà, Cornudella de Montsant and Ulldemolins, among others— have kept the heraldic colors of the ancient House of Entença in their coats of arms. Among the foremost members of the Entença family, the following deserve mention  (names in Catalan):
