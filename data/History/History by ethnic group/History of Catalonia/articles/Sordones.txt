The Sordones were an ancient (Pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula (the Roman Hispania). They are believed to be of Iberian language. Their territory was located in the Roussillon, in what is now the French département of Pyrénées-Orientales and was limited in the west by the Pyrenees. They are classified as ancient Iberian or as ancient Gauls according to the sources.   The main towns of the Sordones were Ruscino, present-day Château-Roussillon near Perpignan, and Illiberis, present day Elne.
