Bushra Zaidi (Urdu: بشریٰ زیدی‬‎) was a 20-year-old girl whose death in a traffic accident on April 15, 1985 started riots in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.  Bushra, a 20-year-old Muhajir student of Sir Syed College, died after being struck by a bus driven by Pashtun driver as it was thought at that time as public transport was and is dominated by Pashtun in actual the driver was a Kashmiri. This accident started an ethnic conflict between Muhajir and Pashtuns that has lasted over 3 decades.  Later the family of Bushra emigrated from Pakistan and settled overseas permanently.
