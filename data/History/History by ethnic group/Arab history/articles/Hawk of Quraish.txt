The Hawk of Quraish is a symbol which is found on a number of emblems, coat of arms and flags of several states of the Arab League. The Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula, today especially those from the Persian Gulf coast, are traditionally falconry experts; falcons (and hawks) are seen as status symbols and one of the Arabs' favorite animals. Also the traditions and recorded history about the Quraysh and Muhammad claim a falcon had been used as clan symbol. Therefore, several variants of the Quraishi hawk were and are seen in the flags, coat of arms, seals and emblems of several Arab states until today. In that meaning, the Hawk of Quraish is a rival to the so-called Eagle of Saladin.
