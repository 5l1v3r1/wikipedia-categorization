Gindibu was a King of Arabs that who led the Arab forces at the Battle of Qarqar (853 BCE), as an ally of Ben Haddad the king of the Aramean state of Damascus, as they fought against Assyria. He was one of the twelve kings who allied against the Assyrian Empire. He appears on the Kurkh Monolith, on which an Assyrian scribe recorded a description of the size of the enemy forces under eleven kings facing king Shalmaneser III, and a record containing "the first known reference to the Arabs as a distinct group". It is assumed that the concept of alliance in Akkadian is 'twelve kings'.   Little else is known of Gindibu or the Arabs of his time.
