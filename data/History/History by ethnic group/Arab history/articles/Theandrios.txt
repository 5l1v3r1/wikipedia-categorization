In Greek religion and mythology, Theandrios (Greek: Θεάνδριος, "God-Man") or Theandrates (Θεανδράτης) is a deity that was worshipped in towns and villages around Mount Hermon by North Arabian tribes of pre-Islamic Arabia.  Theandrios is evidenced by a dedication to a male god found at Beit Rime, Syria and it is supposed that the Greek name was imposed on a previous god of the region.  He has been considered the Arabian version of similar "God-man" deities such as Dionysius, Herakles/Hercules, Mithras, Krishna and Jesus.
