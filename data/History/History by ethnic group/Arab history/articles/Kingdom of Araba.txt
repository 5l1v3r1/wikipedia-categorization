The Kingdom of Araba (or simply Araba) was a 2nd-century, semi-autonomous buffer kingdom between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, mostly under Parthian influence, located in modern Iraq.  The city of Hatra was probably founded in the 3rd or 2nd century BCE, under the Seleucid kingdom.  Arabs were common in Mesopotamia at the time of the Seleucids (3rd century BC).  In the 1st and 2nd century, Hatra was ruled by a dynasty of Arabian princes.  It rose to prominence as the capital of Araba.  Hatra would become an important religious center as a result of its strategic position along caravan trade routes.  Araba is sometimes identified as the first Arab state to be established outside of Arabia.  For others, that distinction is accorded to Al-Hirah (circa 300 CE), a vassal of the Sassanid Empire.
