The Land of Tema,  te'-ma or tema',  ( תֵּמָא, Θαιμάν, تيماء (مدينة) and Thaiman) is a place mentioned in the Bible   where the descendants of Ishmael's son Tema dwelt.  In Hebrew, the name means "south country" and was named for Tema, a son of Ishmael    and the tribe descended from him   The Bible mentions it five times. It was located in Edom    and is described as a remote  oasis on a main trade route through Arabia.  It is often associated with the Land of Dumah. It was admonished by Amos and Jeremiah. It was mentioned by Ptolemy,  Pliny,  Agatharchides,   and Josephus.     It was noted as halfway between Damascus and Mecca, and between Babylonia and Egypt.   Yaqut mentions that in the Middle Ages, it was inhabited by a Jewish Community.  The Land of Tema was most likely in northern Saudi Arabia and has been identified with the modern Teima',     an oasis (fitting with the description in Jeremiah) which lies about 200 miles North of Medina, and some 40 miles South of Dumat  (Dumah), now known as el-Jauf. Teima' is on the ancient caravan road connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Aqaba; which in antiquity bought wealth to the town   Doughty has described at Teima the ruins of an old city wall 3 miles in circuit.   An Aramaic stele recently discovered, belonging to the 6th century BC, shows the influence of Assyrian in the town.  The place is mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions.
