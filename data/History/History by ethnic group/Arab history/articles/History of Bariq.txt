 Ancient History The first Islamic covenants  Modern phases  Between two phases  Saudi Arabia Bariq (also transliterated as Barik or Bareq, Arabic: بارق‎) was founded in 220 AD. It is part of the territory known historically as Yemen, which dates back to the second millennium BC. It was inhabited by immigrant tribes of southern Yemen called Bariq, who belong to the ancient tribe Al-Azd which has many clans linked to it.    Bariq was known before the advent of Islam as Badiyar Bariq (Arabic: بديار باريق‎), and it formed part of the old commercial route from Yemen to Mecca and the Levant, a regular seasonal journey.   This also held Suq Hubasha,  in the first month of Rajab,  which was the main market for Azd. Both the market and convoys were protected by the Bareq country. Suq Habasha was perhaps the greatest Arab souq and also the last of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic) markets to be destroyed.   In the mid-seventh century AD, tribes from Bariq adopted Islam and played a pivotal role in the Islamic conquests,       settling in many countries after the Muslim conquest.     Bariq has been mentioned by many historians of the Islamic era and Arab writers such as Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Al-Kalbi, Ibn Hisham, Ya'qubi, Al-Baladhuri, ibn Khayyat, al-Tabari, Ibn Duraid and others.  The first mentioning of Bariq in ancient geography books was from Hāmdāni's book Geography of the Arabian Peninsula. al-Hamawi also mentioned Bariq in his book.  Bariq dates back to 4,000 years ago. It was first inhabited by Hwaila ebn yaktan and his dynasty. It later joined the Sheba Kingdom during the 4th century B.C. and was ruled by the Himyarite Kingdom during the first century B.C.
