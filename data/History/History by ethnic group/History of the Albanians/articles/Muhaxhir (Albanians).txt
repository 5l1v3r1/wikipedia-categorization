Muhaxhir and Muhaxher (plural: Muhaxhirë and Muhaxherë, meaning "Muslim refugees") are terms borrowed from Ottoman Turkish: muhacir and derived from Arabic muhajir.     The term Muhaxhir(ë) refers to Ottoman Albanian communities that left their homes as refugees or were transferred, from Greece, Serbia and Montenegro to Albania, Kosovo and to a lesser extent Macedonia during and following various wars. Muslim Albanians, along smaller numbers of urban Turks (some with Albanian heritage), were expelled by the Serb army from most parts of the Sanjak of Niş and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet during and after the Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78).  An estimated 60–70,000 to as low as 30,000       Albanians were either expelled, fled and/or retreated from the captured areas seeking refuge in Ottoman Kosovo.   During the Balkan Wars, Muslim Albanians were deported from Christian territories, and settled in the Ottoman Empire, as far as the Middle East. Cham Albanians massively fled Greece after World War II, in which they had collaborated with the Italians, fearing reprisals.
