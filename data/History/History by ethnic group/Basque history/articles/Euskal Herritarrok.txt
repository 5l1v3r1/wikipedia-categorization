Euskal Herritarrok (English: Basque Citizens, EH) was a Basque independentist and socialist political party in the Basque Country. EH was banned in 2003 on the grounds that it sympathized with ETA. In February 2000, Batzarre and Zutik left EH after the rupture of the ETA 1998-2000 truce, due to the absence of any condemnation of that fact by EH. In June 2000 a sector of Herri Batasuna also decided to split and form the Aralar Party, that openly and fully rejected ETA and its rupture of the truce.
