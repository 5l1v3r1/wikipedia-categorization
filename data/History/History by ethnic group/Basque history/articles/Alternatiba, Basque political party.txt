Alternatiba (English: Alternative) is a Basque socialist political party. Founded in 2009, Alternatiba was born as a critical tendency within Izquierda Unida (IU) in the Basque Country opposing a participation in the Basque government along with the PNV and Eusko Alkartasuna. In 2009 this tendency broke away from IU and formed an independent party.
