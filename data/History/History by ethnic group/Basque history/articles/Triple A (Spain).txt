Triple A (an acronym for Alianza Apostólica Anticomunista, Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance) was a Spanish far-right paramilitary, Spanish nationalist group active from 1977 to 1982, primarily in the southern Basque Country but also in the French Basque Country and Barcelona. A June 2010 report by the Office for Victims of Terrorism of the Basque Government attributed eight murders in the Basque Autonomous Community to the group and linked it to the Spanish police, SECED and the Guardia Civil.  The group attacked the satirical magazine El Papus in Barcelona, killing one person and injuring 17.  This list may be incomplete, because many attacks were never admitted. The acronyms GAE and others (Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey, Anti Terrorismo ETA or ATE, Primera Línea de Fuerza Nueva, Batallón Vasco Español, Grupos Armados Españoles and, later, GAL and GANE) seem to have been used by the same Spanish nationalist networks.
