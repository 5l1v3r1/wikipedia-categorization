The flag appeared in the time of pope Cl√©ment III to gather the Gascons during the Third crusade (12th century).  It contains the St Andrew's cross, the patron saint of Bordeaux and the red color of English kingdom, who reigned over Gascony from 12th to mid-15th century. After the end of the Hundred Years' War, the flag went out of use and was never replaced. A modern blazon (blue and red with sheaf of wheat and lion) was created in Versailles by the judge of weapons'cabinet (chief of protocol) of French king Louis XIV in 1697-1709 to add symbolically the province to the French royal coat of arms.  The contemporary return of the historic flag of Gascony is ought to convey identity and values which make of this province a land of "douceur de vivre" (sweetness of life): soft climate, authenticity of relationship, conviviality, good wines and art of dining.
