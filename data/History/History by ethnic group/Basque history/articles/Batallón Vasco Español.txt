The Batallón Vasco Español (Basque Spanish Battalion) was a Spanish Basque right-wing paramilitary group active from 1975 to 1981, primarily in French Basque Country. The BVE employed violence mainly against Basque separatist groups. With the change of government in Madrid, from the post-Francoist center-right Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) to the center-left Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in 1982, the BVE vanished but a similar group, the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (GAL) took its place.
