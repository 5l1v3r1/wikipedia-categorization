The Bigerriones were an Aquitani pre-Roman tribe settled in what today is southwestern France, around the city of Castrum Bigorra, present-day Saint-LÃ©zer and Civitas Turba, present-day Tarbes. The Bigorre region is named after this tribe. They are mentioned by Julius Caesar in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, where he mentions how the peoples from Aquitaine were subdued by Publius Licinius Crassus. It is believed the Bigerriones spoke a form or dialect of the Aquitanian language, a precursor of the Basque language.
