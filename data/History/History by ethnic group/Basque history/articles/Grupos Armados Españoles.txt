Grupos Armados Espa√±oles (Spanish for Spanish Armed Groups; GAE) was a Spanish right-wing paramilitary Spanish nationalist and parapolicial group active from 1979 to 1980, primarily in the Southern Basque Country. A report by the Office for Victims of Terrorism of the Basque Government in June 2010 attributed 6 murders in the Basque Autonomous Community to the group, and linked it to the Spanish police, SECED and Guardia Civil.  The report of the Office of Victims of Terrorism of the Basque Government (2010) said that the GAE was a well organized right-wing group, that "acted with a high level of tolerance, when no complicity with important sectors of the police apparatus of the time", while acknowledging that" and criticized the impunity and lack of investigation about group actions.
