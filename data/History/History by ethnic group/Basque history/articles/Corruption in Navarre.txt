Corruption in Navarre refers to a quick succession of corruption scandals which have come to light since 2012 referring to the UPN's tenure in office (since 1996). However, amidst heated political confrontation since the late days of Franco's dictatorship, the first corruption cases erupted early on, going back to the first government cabinets formed after the establishment of Navarre's "Betterment" (the Amejoramiento, a Navarre-specific administrative system, 1982). In 1996, Miguel Sanz's government started a 15-year period of distancing and breaking of virtually all historic institutional bonds and cultural cooperation with fellow Basque provinces, citing fears of a "Basque nationalist takeover", and billing themselves as the guarantee of Navarrese institutions and identity. However, two prime rallying points and historic flagship institutions of all the Navarrese, i.e.Caja Navarra and Osasuna, collapsed during the UPN's tenure in office.
