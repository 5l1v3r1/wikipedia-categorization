Carlists supporting The Battle of Arlabán, a battle of the First Carlist War, occurred at the heights of Arlabán, between Álava and Guipúzcoa.  Between January 16 and 17, 1836, the Liberals occupied Arlaban after dislodging the Carlist forces there.  The Liberals were commanded by Luis Fernández de Córdova and were supported by the British Legion, French Legion, and units commanded by Baldomero Espartero; the forces were divided along three fronts.  After conquering Arlabán as well as Legutiano (Villarreal de Álava), however, the Liberals were pushed back by the Carlists on the 18th of January, suffering large numbers of casualties.
