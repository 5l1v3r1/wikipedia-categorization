Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, Inc. (JCR) was an organization established in 1947 to collect and distribute heirless Jewish property in the American occupied zone of Germany after World War II.  Shortly after its founding, it became the cultural arm of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO).  About 150,000 heirless items (mostly books from the Offenbach Archival Depot whose owners could not be identified) were distributed by the JCR to libraries in the United States and abroad,  among others to the library of the Israelitische Cultusgemeinde ZÃ¼rich (ICZ) in Switzerland. Hannah Arendt, then managing director of the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, Inc., handed over parts of the library of the Breslau Rabbinical Seminary in Germany which was suppressed by the Nazis in 1938. The oldest books of the Breslau collection date back to the 16th century, among them a 1595 print of Flavius Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews.   Funding for the JCR's operations was provided by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Among the leaders and officers of the organization were Salo Baron, Hannah Arendt, Leo Baeck, and Gershom Scholem.  The JCR ceased operations in 1952.
