The Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, formally the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art and sometimes referred to as the Washington Declaration is a statement concerning the restitution of art confiscated by the Nazi regime in Germany before and during World War II.  It was released in connection with the Washington Conference on Holocaust Era Assets, held in Washington, D.C., United States, on 3 December 1998.  The conference was hosted by the United States Department of State and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  It assembled participants from a 1995 New York symposium, The Spoils of Warâ€”World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property, along with others,  and built on the Nazi Gold conference which had been held in London in December 1997.  The 1998 conference's aim was to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets.  44 governments, including the reunified Germany, sent delegates,  as did thirteen international non-governmental organizations.  The conference organizer was the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, Stuart E. Eizenstat,  who had previously been United States Ambassador to the European Union,  and its chairman was Judge Abner Mikva.  U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright gave the opening address.  The statement includes eleven numbered principles, prefixed:  In developing a consensus on non-binding principles to assist in resolving issues relating to Nazi-confiscated art, the Conference recognizes that among participating nations there are differing legal systems and that countries act within the context of their own laws. The principles are:  The Principles were outlined by Eizenstat, along with "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."  He also gave a statement at the conference, titled In Support of Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, saying:   Several weeks ago, we prepared a discussion paper of 11 general principles, which was used as the basis of extensive consultations and which all of you have today. These principles are not, in themselves, a solution. They are a means by which nations can fashion their own solutions consistent with their own legal systems. The principles try to capture the spirit of this conference for nations engaging in this task. If these principles are properly applied, the discovery of Nazi-confiscated art will no longer be a matter of chance. Instead, there will be an organized international effort -- voluntary in nature but backed by a strong moral commitment -- to search provenance and uncover stolen art. This effort will be undertaken by governments, NGOs, museums, auctioneers and dealers.
