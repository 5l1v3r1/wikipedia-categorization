Below is a partial list of selected villages and towns (shtetls) depopulated of Jews during the Holocaust. The liquidation actions were carried out mostly by the Nazi Einsatzgruppen and Orpo police as well as auxiliary battalions through mass killings. The German "pacification" units of the Einsatzkommando were paramilitary forces within the Schutzstaffel, under the high command of the Obergruppenführer. The Einsatzgruppen operated primarily in the years 1941–45.       The following Jewish communities in Lithuania were destroyed during the Holocaust. Note that the list includes places in modern, post-1991 Lithuania, some of which were in German-occupied Poland during the war.
