Ishmael is eventually claimed as a child soldier for the Sierra Leone Armed Forces at age 13. After being rescued by <a href=\"/wiki/UNICEF\" title=\"UNICEF\">UNICEF</a> at 16, he is rehabilitated and begins to live with his Uncle Tommy. While there, he is recruited to travel to the United States to speak at a <a href=\"/wiki/United_Nations\" title=\"United Nations\">United Nations</a> event about child soldiers. Returning to <a href=\"/wiki/Freetown,_Sierra_Leone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Freetown, Sierra Leone\">Freetown</a> after his speaking event, he eventually made his way back to the United States. After a time, he was able to forgive himself and love once again. Many dispute the book's accuracy, claiming that the rebels only attacked the village two years after Beah states and that there is no record of the surname \"Beah\" in the region; please read the section about the \"Accuracy Dispute\" for more information.\n</p><p><b>Junior Beah:</b>  Ishmael's older brother by one year. He is eventually separated from Ishmael during the attack on the village of Kamator, where they were seeking refuge in. \n</p><p><b>Alhaji:</b> One of Ishmael\u2019s closest friends. Alhaji was part of the group of boys from Mattru Jong that Ishmael met in the wilderness. Alhaji and Ishmael formed a close bond during their years as soldiers and were part of the same squad. Alhaji was nicknamed \"<a href=\"/wiki/John_Rambo\" title=\"John Rambo\"> Little Rambo</a>\" for his combat skills that were heavily influenced by the film.

Saidu is the first of the group to die; he dies suddenly two nights after he and the other boys eat a crow that fell from the sky. Kanei is the oldest of the group by three years, although Alhaji is confused as being older because he is taller. He becomes a junior sergeant and later is chosen to stay behind because he is older while Alhaji and Ishmael are sent to rehabilitation. It is unknown what happens to him. Musa is the group's storyteller. He is killed in the first battle that Ishmael and his squad fight in. Jumah and Moriba also become part of the army.

The three are able to flee the village without the rebels following them. They decide to head back home. On the way, it turns out that their village was also captured by the RUF. According to an old man who was sitting outside the village, most of the people had fled to a village on the Sierra Leone coast.\n</p><p>Ishmael, Junior, and their friend decide to travel there in order to locate their families. On their way, they encounter multiple other villages. They are accepted into another village on the grounds that they help with the farming. After months, the village is attacked. Caught by surprise, Ishmael, Junior, and their friend split up and run into the swamps.\n</p><p>It is unknown what happens to his friends afterwards. Ishmael roams around the wilderness by himself for a while, until he meets up with another group of traveling boys whom he recognizes from his home village. The boys then travel together to another village on the coast. Many refugees fled to this village because the <a href=\"/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Armed_Forces\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sierra Leone Armed Forces\">Sierra Leone Armed Forces</a> occupied it. In search of safety, the group of boys and Ishmael go to that village, but soon leave.\n</p><p>Ishmael then learns from a woman from his hometown that Junior, his younger brother Ibrahim, and his parents are safe in another village with many others from Mattru Jong. Just before they reach the village, the boys meet a man named Gasemu whom Ishmael knew from Mattru Jong. Gasemu tells them that Ishmael's family are indeed safe in the village, and ask the boys to help him carry bananas back to that village. However, moments before they reach the town, it is attacked by the RUF.\n</p><p>Although their bodies are not found among the dead or in the burning house where they lived, Ishmael assumes that his family is dead. Devastated, and believing that Gasemu is to blame for his not being able to see his family on time, Ishmael attacks Gasemu but is stopped by the other boys. They are then chased into the forest by remaining RUF soldiers, and Gasemu dies from being shot, leaving Ishmael more saddened.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recruitment_and_life_as_a_child_soldier\">Recruitment and life as a child soldier</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Long_Way_Gone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Recruitment and life as a child soldier\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The boys then settle into another village protected by the army.

The report claimed that Beah's village was destroyed in 1995 rather than 1993, and that given the more compressed time frame, he could not have been a soldier for more than a couple of months, rather than the years that he describes in his book.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> He would also have been aged 15 when he became a soldier, rather than 13. Questions were also raised about Beah's description of a battle between child soldiers at a UNICEF camp, in which 6 people were said to have been killed. Witnesses interviewed by <i>The Australian</i> said that such an event in a UNICEF camp would have drawn significant attention in Sierra Leone, but no independent verification of such a battle could be obtained. Investigations by other publications also failed to discover other evidence of such a battle, and UNICEF, while supportive of Beah in general, also said that it had not been able to verify this aspect of his story.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The <i>Australian's</i> claims were subsequently denied in a statement issued by Beah, in which he called into question the reliability of the sources quoted. The statement also cited the fact that during the early stages of its research, the newspaper had investigated the possibility that Beah's father was still alive, a possibility that was based on mistaken identity by an Australian mining engineer. The <i>Australian's</i> published articles stated that they had established that the man in question was not Beah's father.\n</p><p>Beah's adoptive mother also reaffirmed her belief in the validity of the dates, quoting two Sierra Leonean sources who corroborated the chronology of events given in his book.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> However, the publisher amended this statement after <i>The Australian</i> objected that it seriously misrepresented the newspaper's report. The source cited by the publisher, Leslie Mboka, National Chairman of the Campaign for Just Mining, was in fact quoted by <i>The Australian.</i> The newspaper quoted him as saying that Beah \"was a young child who had been through terrible things so he could easily have got things mixed up.\" Mboka, when subsequently contacted by the publisher, reported to them that he had vigorously supported Beah's chronology when interviewed by <i>The Australian,</i> and had challenged the paper for bias. However, Mboka had not met Beah until after the disputed events had taken place, and so was unable to provide firsthand verification of his account.<sup id=\"cite_ref-voice_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-voice-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The other correction involved the newspaper's publication, not of Beah's foster-mother's <i>address</i> but of her publicly listed website address; hate mail had indeed been received, but via the Internet.  While the publisher made note of these, it stood by the accuracy of the book.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The dispute over Beah's credibility arose at a time when the exposure of some \"fictional\" memoirs, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Margaret_Seltzer\" title=\"Margaret Seltzer\">Margaret Seltzer</a>'s account of growing up in a Los Angeles crime gang<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> and <a href=\"/wiki/James_Frey\" title=\"James Frey\">James Frey</a>'s account of drug addiction, had led to debate over the nature of the genre. The controversy was followed up in international publications including the British <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sunday_Times\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sunday Times\">Sunday Times</a></i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Slate_(magazine)\" title=\"Slate (magazine)\">Slate</a></i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Village_Voice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Village Voice\">Village Voice</a></i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-voice_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-voice-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Beah had claimed to have a \"photographic memory\", which enabled him to have perfect recall of the events he described, leaving him \"less room to maneuver\" than if he had allowed room for human error.<sup id=\"cite_ref-voice_8-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-voice-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> However, some of his defenders as well as his critics allowed for the possibility that his account was not entirely accurate, stating that the main point was that he had drawn attention to an issue that was of vital importance. Possible explanations for any inaccuracies include the trauma of war as experienced by a young child, the drug use described in his account, and the possibility that Beah was tacitly encouraged by outsiders to compile stories from multiple sources into a singular autobiographical account.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Neil_Boothby\" title=\"Neil Boothby\">Neil Boothby</a>, an academic who has undertaken extensive research into children and war, said that while all of the atrocities described by Beah have occurred at various points, it would be highly unusual for one child to have experienced them all. Boothby criticized the mentality that provided attention only to those with the most horrific stories to tell, thus encouraging exaggeration. \"I've seen it over and over. Whether by psychologists or journalists, they are encouraged to tell the sensational stories...The system is set up to reward sensational stories. We all need to look at why does something have to be so horrific before we open our eyes and ears and hearts?\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-voice_8-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-voice-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=A_Long_Way_Gone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i><a href=\"/wiki/Children_of_War_(2009_film)\" title=\"Children of War (2009 film)\">Children of War</a></i> (2010), documentary by Bryan Single</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Jimmie_Briggs\" title=\"Jimmie Briggs\">Jimmie Briggs</a>, investigator and author of <i>Innocents Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War</i></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/P._W._Singer\" title=\"P.
