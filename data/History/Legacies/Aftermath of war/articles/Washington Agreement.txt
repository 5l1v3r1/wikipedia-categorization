The Washington Agreement was a ceasefire agreement between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the unrecognized Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, signed in Washington on 18 March 1994 and Vienna.  It was signed by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdžić, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granić and President of Herzeg-Bosnia Krešimir Zubak. Under the agreement, the combined territory held by the Croat and Bosnian government forces was divided into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The cantonal system was selected to prevent dominance by one ethnic group over another.  The subsequently signed Washington Framework Agreement had the creation of a loose federation (or confederation) between Croatia and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as one of its goals.
