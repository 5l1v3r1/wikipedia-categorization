The RINJ Foundation (RINJ) is a Canadian incorporated   global not-for-profit health care-related non-governmental organization women's group listed with the United Nations as an NGO   with "a mission while supporting and medically caring for survivors, to also gather and compile detailed information on parties to armed conflict that are credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for acts of rape or other forms of sexual violence. " RINJ women campaign vigorously to encourage members and the public at large to boycott entities RINJ says promote misogyny and sexual violence.  Boycotts include the February 2017 response to song 'No Favors' on "I Decided" Rap Album by "Slim Shady" (Marshall Bruce Mathers (a.k.a. Eminem)) and Sean Michael Anderson (Big Sean) whom RINJ calls "rape rappers". When rappers like Eminem and Big Sean encourage the commission of felonious crimes (Lyrics in 'No Favors' call for the rape of Ann Coulter  ) they themselves commit an indictable offense in the USA and could be arrested.            Among other boycotted misogyny/rape promoting "offenders" identified by RINJ were Facebook advertisers allegedly running advertisements on Facebook pages promoting rape ("rape pages").  RINJ joined forces with other organizations like "Women's Views on News"   to organize boycotts of Facebook advertisers that ran advertisements on Facebook rape pages. The RINJ Foundation women urged boycotts of  broadcasters like Kyle Sandilands   in Australia who reportedly attacked a female journalist making rude remarks about her breasts and threatening to "hunt her down". RINJ also went after Bill Cosby and sought a boycott of his shows in Canada protesting outdoors in January 2015 with "Rape Is No Joke" signs   after a plethora of rape allegations against Cosby became public in 2014. In April 2018, The RINJ Foundation asked the UN for sanctions against Kuwait in response to what it claimed are widespread sexual exploitation violations against migrant Filipino female workers in Kuwait.   The RINJ Foundation operates health care/rape clinics in and near war zones  to apply its care, forensic evidence gathering and reporting protocols for sexual violence in areas of armed conflict   where sexual violence patients are cared for   and evidence is gathered about the rapists with the intent of prosecution. "The RINJ Foundation addresses impunity and identification of perpetrators of rape in armed conflicts and war. "    The group assists communities in identifying newly released dangerous sex offenders.  RINJ reports perpetrators of pervasive violence to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and has recently been cited as "calling on the international community to indict Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte for systematic extra-judicial killings that comprise crimes against humanity".  and has challenged operators it says have contributed to child sex trade in war zones.  On February 24, 2017, the UN Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations in its 2017 regular session recommended The RINJ Foundation (Canada) for special Consultative Status to the Economic and Social Council.  The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) at its Coordination and management meeting of 19 April 2017 adopted the recommendation of the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to grant special consultative status to The RINJ Foundation.  On June 21, 2017, RINJ launched its fifth annual international campaign  to provide a surge to its ongoing abolitionist campaign against Sexual slavery and Child sex tourism.
