During World War II a number of countries were conquered and controlled. Some of these countries were then given new names, and assigned new governmental leaders which were loyal to the conquering country.  These countries are known as puppet states. Germany and Japan were the two countries with the most puppet states. Italy also had several puppet states. Most of the Allies (with the exception of the Soviet Union) did not have many puppet states. The Soviet Union had only one puppet state prior to World War II, the Tuvan People's Republic, but it acquired many more during the war. Following the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'Ã©tat, Lithuania was led by what was known as the "Smetona regime," named after the leader of the coup, Antanas Smetona.   It was only in Soviet hands just under a year when German forces captured the Lithuanian SSR, and incorporated it into the Reichskommissariat Ostland.  The Soviets retook the LSSR during the Baltic Operation.  The LSSR gained its independence before any of the other Baltic states taken over by Russia, with the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990, though the Soviet Union refused to recognize its independence until 6 September 1991.  The United Kingdom only had two puppet states during World War II, both of which were in the Middle East; one in Iraq, and one in Iran. Empire of Japan had been creating puppet states in China since the 1931 Mukden Incident. It established a puppet state in 1932. German Reich had a large number of puppet states after the start of World War II. Some were countries that once supported it, but fell to the Allies. Others were countries that Germany invaded. Italy did not have nearly as many puppet states as its partner Axis countries, however, Italy did co-administer some countries in the Balkans with Germany, Greece, in particular.  Italy's puppet states were captured by Germany after the Armistice of Cassibile.
