A victory parade is a parade held to celebrate a victory. Numerous military and sport victory parades have been held. Among the most famous parades are the victory parades celebrating the end of the First World War and the Second World War. However, victory parades date back to ancient Rome, where Roman triumphs celebrated a leader who was militarily victorious. In the modern age, victory parades typically take the form of celebrating a national victory, rather than a personal one. In the former USSR including the Russian Federation victory parades are held annually in every major city celebrating the victory of the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War (1941â€“1945). Parades are traditionally held on 9 May to celebrate the victory in World War II over Nazi Germany. Cities hosting the winning sports team in one of the four major league sports will host a victory parade in the city that the team represents.
