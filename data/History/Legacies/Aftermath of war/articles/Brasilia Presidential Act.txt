The Brasilia Presidential Act is an international treaty signed by the then President of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad and President of Peru, Alberto Fujimori which effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute. During the 20th Century Peru and Ecuador had fought several armed conflicts as part of the Ecuadorianâ€“Peruvian territorial dispute. The last of these conflicts was the Cenepa War in 1995.  The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999.
