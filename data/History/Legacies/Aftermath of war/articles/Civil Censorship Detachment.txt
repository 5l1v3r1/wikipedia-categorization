The Civil Censorship Department was created within the Civil Intelligence Section of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.     It exercised considerable influence over the operation and administration of the American Occupation of Japan after World War II.     Much of its records are housed in the Gordon W. Prange Collection in the Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland.
