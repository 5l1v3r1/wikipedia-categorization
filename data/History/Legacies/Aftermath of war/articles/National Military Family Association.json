From their efforts, the <i>Survivor Benefit Plan</i> came into being. In the ensuing years, NMFA has been in the vanguard of advocacy for improvements in the quality of military family life. The name of the organization was changed in 1984 to reflect the broad scope of its involvement. NMFA is a <a href=\"/wiki/Non-profit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Non-profit\">non-profit</a> <a href=\"/wiki/501(c)(3)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"501(c)(3)\">501(c)(3)</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Membership_and_organization\">Membership and organization</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Military_Family_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Membership and organization\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>NMFA has members from all ranks of the seven uniformed services worldwide and their families. Its Board of Governors, which includes active duty service members, reserve component, retirees and spouses, sets the policies, approves the issues, and oversees operations.

It is also supported by distinguished Board of Advisers.\nNMFA receives significant support at the top levels of the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Armed_Services\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Armed Services\">Services</a> and works regularly on common concerns with <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Military_Coalition&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"The Military Coalition (page does not exist)\">The Military Coalition</a>, an umbrella organization of 36 military-related associations.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Programs\">Programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Military_Family_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>NMFA activities revolve around programs to educate the public, the military community, and the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Congress\" title=\"United States Congress\">Congress</a> on the rights and benefits of military families, as well as advocate for an equitable quality of life for those families.\n</p><p>Members of the <i>Government Relations Department</i> study issues, testify before <a href=\"/wiki/Congressional_committees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Congressional committees\">Congressional committees</a>, work with Congressional staff and represent NMFA on advisory groups for many <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" title=\"United States Department of Defense\">Department of Defense</a> agencies, to include the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Defense_Commissary_Agency_Patron_Council&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Defense Commissary Agency Patron Council (page does not exist)\">Defense Commissary Agency Patron Council</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/TRICARE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TRICARE\">TRICARE</a> Beneficiary Panel.\n</p><p>Since its inception in 1969, the effectiveness of NMFA is reflected in accomplishments in most of the issue areas in which the association works. These include medical and dental benefits, dependent education, retiree and survivor benefits, relocation and spousal employment.
