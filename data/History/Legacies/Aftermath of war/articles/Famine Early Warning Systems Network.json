Created in 1985 by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/\">US Agency for International Development</a> (USAID), and the US Department of State, after devastating famines in East and West Africa, FEWS NET today is a valuable resource to a vast community of governments, international relief agencies, NGOs, journalists, and researchers planning for, responding to, and reporting on humanitarian crises. With support from a technical team in Washington, D.C., FEWS NET staff based in more than 20 country offices collaborate with US government agencies, national government ministries and international partners to collect data and produce objective, forward-looking analysis on the world\u2019s most food-insecure countries. Using an integrated approach that considers climate, agriculture production, prices, trade, nutrition, and other factors, together with an understanding of local livelihoods, FEWS NET forecasts most likely outcomes and anticipates change six to twelve months in advance. To help decision-makers and relief agencies plan for food emergencies, FEWS NET publishes monthly reports (available on its web site) on current and projected food insecurity, up-to-the-minute alerts on emerging or likely crises, and specialized reports on weather hazards, crops, market prices, and food assistance.\n</p><p>In 2010, to mark its 25th anniversary, produced a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/31031955\">video</a> to document its work.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Methodology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Methodology</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Partners\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Partners</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#History\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Methodology\">Methodology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Famine_Early_Warning_Systems_Network&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Methodology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>FEWS NET reporting focuses on acute food insecurity\u2014sudden and/or short-term household food deficits caused by shocks\u2014rather than chronic food insecurity, ongoing or cyclical food deficits related to persistent poverty and a lack of assets. \nIn general, food insecurity is rarely the result of one causal factor. The strength and reliability of FEWS NET forecasting lies in its integrated consideration of the diversity of factors that lead to risk. Along with agricultural production, climate and weather, FEWS NET places analytical importance on markets and trade, livelihoods and sociopolitical issues such as conflict and humanitarian response. Key elements of FEWS NET's methodology include:   \n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Classifying food insecurity</i>: FEWS NET describes the severity of food insecurity using the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ipcinfo.org/\">Integrated Food Security Phase Classification version 2.0</a> (IPC 2.0), an international five-level scale. FEWS NET representatives were among the international food security leaders who designed the scale.</li>\n<li><i>Scenario development</i> is at the heart of FEWS NET\u2019s analytical process. In the simplest terms, scenario development can be described as a sophisticated \u201cif-then\u201d statement. In practice, this nine-step methodology relies on the creation of specific, informed assumptions about future events, their effects, and the likely responses of various actors. Considered in the context of current conditions and local livelihoods, these assumptions allow for the estimation of future food security outcomes and easy updating of the scenario as new information becomes available.</li>\n<li><i>Remote monitoring</i>: Since the 2008 global food price crisis, the risk of food insecurity has continued to rise in unexpected places. In 2010, FEWS NET responded to the demand for information on these new areas of concern by developing a lighter, scalable version of its traditional methodology. This approach, known as remote monitoring, centers on the identification and monitoring of anomalies that might lead to food insecurity. In remote monitoring, a FEWS NET coordinator covers a portfolio of countries, typically from a nearby regional office. Relying on a network of partners to collect and share data, the coordinator analyzes available information and produces monthly, two-page reports describing the current and projected food security situation.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Partners\">Partners</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Famine_Early_Warning_Systems_Network&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Partners\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Along with USAID, other US agencies make integral analytical contributions to FEWS NET reports.  They include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/\">US Geological Survey</a>, which provides regular agroclimatology reports and technical advice on vegetation, water availability and other environmental and climate issues.

In certain countries, partnerships may involve joint reporting, joint field assessments and/or collaborative analysis.

From the beginning, the aim of the early warning system, then called \"FEWS\", was to anticipate impending famines and advise policy makers on how to prevent or mitigate such famines.  In July 2000, the initiative's name was changed to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, or FEWS NET, to signal the importance of collaborating with and strengthening national local food security information systems.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a
