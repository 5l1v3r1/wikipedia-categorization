The entire run of episodes was aired on Fox Kids in the UK. These episodes are:\n<ul><li>\"Battle Protocol\" was never re-aired in the U.S. after its premiere due to a scene of Megatron smashing through a skyscraper in claw mode.</li>\n<li>The opening scene of \"Secret of the Ruins\" featured buildings being destroyed and a reference to terrorism, and the episode was held back to be redubbed. The scene in question was recreated using footage from \"Battle Protocol!\". Eventually, the episode aired between \"Ultra Magnus\" and \"Ultra Magnus: Forced Fusion\". It is the episode in which Doctor Onishi's microchip is introduced, so its removal left something of a hole in the series.

All three episodes featured buildings being destroyed, and the plot of \"Sky-Byte Rampage\" revolved around stopping a tower from falling over. However, this is the first episode to put focus on the O-Parts, and its removal from the lineup disrupted the continuity of the show.</li>\n<li>\"Spy Changers To The Rescue\": There were two versions of this episode aired before and after 9/11. The pre-9/11 episode contained references to the generator possibly exploding and a scene with Prowl's jet-claw.
