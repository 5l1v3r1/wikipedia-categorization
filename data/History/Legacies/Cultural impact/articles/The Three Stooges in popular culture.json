The following information is a partial list of such tributes.  Depending on the form of media used, there are direct and indirect references to the Three Stooges. Beginning with the Stooges themselves as the trio did make small guest appearances in movies or in small bumper clips for their cartoon series. Clips from the Stooges shorts are sometimes featured in the actual footage of a movie, TV show, or advertisement, or the line from the 1934 short <i><a href=\"/wiki/Men_in_Black_(1934_film)\" title=\"Men in Black (1934 film)\">Men in Black</a></i>, \"Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard\" is used.  <a href=\"/wiki/Moe_Howard\" title=\"Moe Howard\">Moe Howard</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Larry_Fine\" title=\"Larry Fine\">Larry Fine</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Curly_Howard\" title=\"Curly Howard\">Curly Howard</a> (Or Curly <a href=\"/wiki/Joe_DeRita\" title=\"Joe DeRita\">Joe DeRita</a>) appeared as cartoon versions of themselves.\n</p><p>The indirect references are harder to spot. These are the ones that fans of the shorts would instantly recognize, but another viewer not familiar with the series may not recognize. A careful viewing of all the original shorts reveals that each of the Stooges had his own signature haircut, catchphrase, and action. The easiest reference would be simply talking about the Stooges, or accusing another character of acting or reminding them of the Stooges.\n</p><p>Each Stooge had his own signature insult or catchphrase. While very rarely did any of the other Stooges insult or injure Moe, he did come up with the most insults of the entire group.  He frequently called Larry a porcupine. He used other insults such as mongoose, dope, hyena, applehead, soft-boiled egghead, grapehead, frizzletop, and birdbrain. While the catchphrases for each Stooges such as Moe's use of \"Remind me to kill you later\", Curly's with \"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk\" or \"woob, woob, woob\", <a href=\"/wiki/Shemp_Howard\" title=\"Shemp Howard\">Shemp Howard</a>'s noise babbling, and <a href=\"/wiki/Joe_Besser\" title=\"Joe Besser\">Joe Besser</a>'s \"Not so hard!\", are nearly always paired with the signature haircut of the same Stooge.\n</p><p>For their haircuts, Moe had a bowl cut, Larry was bald on the top of his head with his remaining hair frizzled out, Shemp had a more loose hairstyle (It frequently fell into his face), while Curly, Joe, and Curly-Joe were all bald. Characters could appear in groups of three, sporting the signature haircuts.\n</p><p>Each Stooge developed his own signature action and reaction.  Moe would frequently eye-poke the others, to which they developed a signature hand block. He always slapped one of the others. Curly had a shuffle where he would spin on the floor. Larry played the violin. Joe would always give a soft punch to the arm while using his catchphrase. So characters may also act like the Stooges using their signature phrases and actions.\n</p><p>The hardest references to spot are the ones where only the names may be used such as a group of three being called Moe, Larry, and Curly. Places and buildings might have one of the Stooges names or the actors\u2019 names. And perhaps the hardest of all, a character having a slight Stooge-like tone such as the elephant in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rabbit_Fire\" title=\"Rabbit Fire\">Rabbit Fire</a></i>.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Film\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Film</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Literature\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Literature</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Children&#39;s_Literature\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Children's Literature</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Comic_Books\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Comic Books</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Humor\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Humor</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Magazines\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Magazines</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Novels\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Novels</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Music\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Music</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Television\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Television</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Advertisements\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Advertisements</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Animation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Animation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Comedy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Comedy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Drama\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Drama</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Children&#39;s_Television\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Children's Television</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Made-for-TV_Movies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Made-for-TV Movies</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Science_Fiction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Science Fiction</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Video_games\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video games</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Other\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Film\">Film</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_Three_Stooges_in_popular_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Film\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the film list, the action varies depending on the scene. If the Stooges themselves were used, clips from their shorts were shown such as in <i>Lethal Weapon</i> and <i>Flubber</i>. However, in some cases, due to copyright demands of <i>Columbia Pictures</i>, most often these scenes are edited out or the scene only uses the voices and sounds from the clips. Several scenes use the famous line \"Calling Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard\" from the 1934 short, <i>Men in Black</i>, which can be heard in the background. Most often characters would be seen acting like Curly such as barking at people, using both hands to repeatedly clean the face, or using his catchphrase of \"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.\". Although the simplest reference used is when one character refers to another as the Three Stooges.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th style=\"padding:0 9px;\">Year\n</th>\n<th style=\"padding:0 8px;\">Title\n</th>\n<th style=\"padding:0 8px;\">Reference\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1961 - 1968\n</td>\n<td>Comedy Movies\n</td>\n<td>Russian comedians <a href=\"/wiki/Yuri_Nikulin\" title=\"Yuri Nikulin\">Yuri Nikulin</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Georgy_Vitsyn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Georgy Vitsyn\">Georgy Vitsyn</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Yevgeny_Morgunov\" title=\"Yevgeny Morgunov\">Yevgeny Morgunov</a> starred in several comedy films as the famous trio Trus (Coward), Balbes (Fool) &amp; Byvalyj (Experienced)- which had a style somewhat analogous to that of The Three Stooges.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1978\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Grease_(film)\" title=\"Grease (film)\">Grease</a></i>\n</td>\n<td>Three of the members of the T-Birds were goofing around with face slaps and eyepokes until Danny (John Travolta) tells them to settle down.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1980s\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Evil_Dead\" title=\"The Evil Dead\">The Evil Dead</a></i> film series\n</td>\n<td>There are a number of Stooge-inspired moments, including the blood flowing in the basement in <i>Evil Dead</i> (an homage to the 1940 short <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Plumbing_We_Will_Go\" title=\"A Plumbing We Will Go\">A Plumbing We Will Go</a></i>), the hero's fight with his own severed hand in <i>Evil Dead II</i>, and the fight with the skeleton hands and with the little Ashes in the third movie in the series <i>Army of Darkness</i>.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1981\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Gas_(1981_film)\" title=\"Gas (1981 film)\">Gas</a></i>\n</td>\n<td>A gas station attendant who is being interviewed by a news reporter does his impression of Curly for the camera\n</td></tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1981\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Stripes_(film)\" title=\"Stripes (film)\">Stripes</a></i>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/John_Candy\" title=\"John Candy\">John Candy</a> impersonates Curly during the mud wrestling match with the bikini-clad and nude women.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1984\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap\" title=\"This Is Spinal Tap\">This Is Spinal Tap</a></i>\n</td>\n<td>The heavy metal rock band Spinal Tap replacement drummer is named Joe \"Mama\" Besser, a reference to Joe Besser's role as a replacement Stooge as well as the insult \"Yo mama\".\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1985\n</td>\n<td><i><a href=\"/wiki/Stoogemania\" title=\"Stoogemania\">Stoogemania</a></i>\n</td>\n<td>The story of an obsessed Three Stooges fan.

The lyrics may refer to someone acting like / admiring the Three Stooges, refer to their names, hairstyles, or pre-Columbia work. The simplest reference can come from when a group names their band after trio such as the group <a href=\"/wiki/The_Stooges\" title=\"The Stooges\">The Stooges</a>.\n</p><p><i>The Curly Shuffle</i> was a direct homage and featured clips from 26 of the Curly-era Three Stooges shorts. Including <i>An Ache in Every Stake</i>, <i>A Bird in the Head</i>, <i>Calling All Curs</i>, <i>Punch Drunks</i>, <i>No Census, No Feeling</i>, and <i>A Plumbing We Will Go</i>.  Each lyric sang the praises of the Stooges and included imitations of some of their famous lines such as \"Oh, wiseguy?\" and \"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk\".  All of the Stooges with the exception of Joe (Curly-Joe\u2019s image is used) are talked about in the lyrics.\n</p><p>Some songs such as \"The Haircut Song\" by Ray Stevens, Timbuk3\u2019s \"Hairstyles and Attitudes\", and Modern Band\u2019s \"Moe\" reference the Stooges unique hairstyles, while others like Meat Loaf\u2019s \"Everything Louder Than Everything Else\", Cherry Poppin\u2019 Daddies' \"Sockable Face Club\", Frank Black\u2019s \"Two Reelers\", and Chris Brown\u2019s \"Look At Me Now\" contain small references to the trio.  The 1934 short <i>Men in Black</i> provides the line \"Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard\".  The names or the actual voice/line is used as part of song/video such as in the background of the video to <a href=\"/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic\" title=\"&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic\">\"Weird Al\" Yankovic</a>\u2019s \"Like a Surgeon\", or the title of a song on album <i>Boppin\u2019 the Blues</i> by NRBQ.\n</p><p>Some artists go further in their references.  The Canadian rock group Rush used the Stooges' television series theme music, a derivative of \"Three Blind Mice\", as introductory music during their album <i>Signals</i> through <i>Hold Your Fire Tours</i>, and again for the <i>Vapor Trails Tour</i>. A picture of the Stooges and their names are included in the band's album <i>Counterparts</i> liner notes, and are included in the \"assistance, inspiration, comic relief\" listing.[2]\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th style=\"padding:0 9px;\">Song\n</th>\n<th style=\"padding:0 8px;\">Artist\n</th>\n<th style=\"padding:0 8px;\">Reference\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Chanukah Song\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/Adam_Sandler\" title=\"Adam Sandler\">Adam Sandler</a>\n</td>\n<td>In this version of this song a line states: \"Some people say that Ebenezer Scrooge is [Jewish] / He's not, but guess who is?
