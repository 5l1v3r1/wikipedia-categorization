The Bir el Qutt inscriptions[A] (Georgian: ბირ ელ ყუტის წარწერები) are the Georgian language Byzantine mosaic inscriptions written in the Georgian Asomtavruli script which were excavated at a St. Theodore Georgian monastery in 1952  by an Italian archaeologist Virgilio Canio Corbo near Bir el Qutt, in the Judaean Desert, 6 km south-east of Jerusalem and 2 km north of Bethlehem.  Georgian inscriptions were found on a mosaic floor.    Two inscriptions are dated AD 430 and the third one AD 532.   The monastery where the inscriptions were excavated was founded or rebuilt by the Georgian philosopher and royal prince Peter the Iberian. One of the inscriptions mentions him with his father.   The other inscription mentions Bacurius the Iberian who is thought to be a possible grandfather of Peter.  So far, the first two carvings are the oldest extant Georgian inscriptions. The inscriptions are kept at the museum of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem.  Inscription 2 mentioning Peter the Iberian is currently missing.
