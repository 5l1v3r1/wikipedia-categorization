The Samshvilde Sioni inscription (Georgian: სამშვილდის სიონის წარწერა) is the Georgian language inscription written in the Georgian Asomtavruli script on the Sioni Church in Samshvilde, a ruined basilica located in the Tetritsqaro Municipality, Kvemo Kartli, Georgia. Originally the inscription was 35 metres long but only 10 metres of inscription survived.   The inscription mentions Georgian eristavis Varaz-Bakur and Iovane and two Byzantine Emperors, Constantine V and Leo IV the Khazar.  Several scholars differently dated the inscription because of its damage. Sargis Kakabadze dates it to 778 AD,  Giorgi Chubinashvili - 8th century, Ekvtime Takaishvili - 958 AD,  where Marie-Félicité Brosset thought the inscription was dated to 1313 AD.
