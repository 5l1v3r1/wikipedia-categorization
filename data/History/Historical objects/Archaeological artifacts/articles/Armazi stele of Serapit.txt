The Armazi stele of Serapit (Georgian: სერაფიტას არმაზის სტელა) or Armazi bilingual (Georgian: არმაზის ბილინგვა) is a funerary stele with bilingual inscriptions written in Ancient Greek and Armazic, a local idiom of Aramaic, found in 1940, at Armazi, near Mtskheta, in the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Iberia. The stele memorialises a short-lived Georgian princess named Serapit.  The inscriptions mention Georgian monarchs, Pharnavaz I of Iberia and Pharasmanes II of Iberia, and other members of aristocracy. The inscriptions are dated 150 AD.
