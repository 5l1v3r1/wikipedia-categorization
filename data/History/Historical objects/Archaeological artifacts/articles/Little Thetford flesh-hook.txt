A flesh-hook is a metal hook with a long handle used to pull meat out of a pot or hides out of tan-pits. This particular find is one of 32 other such archaeologically significant finds, scatters, and excavations within 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of Little Thetford. The artefact was found by a Mr. Dresser, whilst digging a ditch on reclaimed fenland, at Little Thetford in 1929. Discovered about 9 feet (2.7 m) down, it consisted of two-parts, connected by the remains of a wooden shaft. The wood remains have not survived; a contemporary wooden shaft has been added by the British Museum for display purposes. The artefact is in the British Museum though is not, as of 2012, on display.  Within 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of Little Thetford, there have been 33 finds of various kinds over the years,  such as flints  from the Neolithic era through to a windmill  of the late Medieval period. The word flesh-hook is relatively modern. The OED gives the origin of the word as 1325 AD, and defines it as a metal hook with a long stail,  used to pull hides out of tan-pits or as a hook for pulling meat from the pot.  It may also have been used as a tool to prod animals.  The use of this flesh-hook in the Bronze-age can only be speculated. The metal used in the construction is a bronze alloy, found to be typical of the late Bronze-age. The material was analysed using ICP – AES and contained (approximately) 85% copper, 10% tin, 3% lead, and 2% impurities; although the constituents of the individual parts varied around these figures.  From an analysis of 36 other Bronze-age flesh-hooks known to be in existence,  the assembled length of hook-part, butt-end, and missing wood part is speculated to be 2.5 feet (0.76 m).  The artefact was manufactured by casting, using a mould in a lost-wax (cire perdue) process.  The British Museum dates the artefact within the Bronze Age 1150 – 950 BC.  The Cambridgeshire Historic Environment Record database dates the artefact as late Bronze-age 1000–701 BC.
