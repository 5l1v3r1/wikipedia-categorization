The so-called Mask of la Roche-Cotard, also known as the "Mousterian Protofigurine",  is a purported  artifact dated to the Mousterian period, 33,000 years ago or earlier, found in 1975  in the entrance of a cave named La Roche-Cotard, territory of the commune of Langeais (Indre-et-Loire), on the banks of the Loire River.   The artifact, possibly created by Neanderthal humans,  is a piece of flat flint that has been shaped in a way that seems to resemble the upper part of a face.  A piece of bone pushed through a hole in the stone has been interpreted as a representation of eyes.  Paul Bahn has suggested this "mask" is "highly inconvenient", as "It makes a nonsense of the view that clueless Neanderthals could only copy their cultural superiors the Cro-Magnons".  Though this may represent an example of artistic expression in Neanderthal humans,  some archaeologists question whether the artifact represents a face,  and some suggest that it may be practical rather than artistic.
