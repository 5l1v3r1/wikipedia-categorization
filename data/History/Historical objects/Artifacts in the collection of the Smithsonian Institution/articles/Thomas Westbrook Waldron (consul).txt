Thomas Westbrook Waldron was a captain's clerk  on the Wilkes Expedition, and the first United States consul  to Hong Kong.   His service to the United States consular service was honoured by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a ceremony in 2009.  The youngest of eight children of Daniel Waldron and Olive Huske Sheafe Waldron of Dover, New Hampshire, and named after his grandfather, he was born May 1, 1814.   An older cousin of the same name had moved away prior to his birth and the name was re-used. With his oldest brother Richard Russell Waldron he joined the Wilkes Expedition which explored a portion of the coast of Antarctica, some of the Pacific islands, and the coast of what is now Washington state.  Waldron Glacier in the Antarctic is named after him.  Waldron Island is named after him or his brother.  For reasons that are not presently very clear, in December 1843 he was nominated by President John Tyler to the office of United States consul to Hong Kong.   He travelled to neighbouring Macau on official business,  where he died September 18, 1844  after contracting cholera.   He is buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau.   On May 1, 2009, as part of a ceremony honouring several diplomats who were deceased during their duty, he was honoured by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.   A second ceremony occurred the same month at his burial site.  Waldron Glacier and possibly Waldron Island are named after him.
