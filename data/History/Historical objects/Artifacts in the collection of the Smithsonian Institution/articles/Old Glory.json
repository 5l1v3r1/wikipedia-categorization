In celebration of his appointment, Driver's mother \"and a group of young Salem female admirers\" sewed the flag and gave it to him as a gift in 1824. With this flag flying over his ship, Driver went on to have a colorful career as an American <a href=\"/wiki/Merchant_marine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Merchant marine\">merchant seaman</a>, sailing to China, India, <a href=\"/wiki/Gibraltar\" title=\"Gibraltar\">Gibraltar</a>, and the South Pacific.

Then, why should it not be called Old Glory?\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Driver retired from seafaring in 1837, after his wife Martha Silsbee Babbage died from <a href=\"/wiki/Throat_cancer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Throat cancer\">throat cancer</a>. At the time, Driver was 34 and had three young children. Driver settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where his three brothers operated a store. Driver remarried the next year to Sarah Jane Parks, a Southerner with whom he had several more children. Driver took his flag with him to Nashville, flying it on holidays \"rain or shine.\"  The flag was \"so large that he attached it to a rope from his attic window and stretched it on a pulley across the street to secure it to a locust tree.\" Driver worked as a salesman and served as <a href=\"/wiki/Vestryman\" title=\"Vestryman\">vestryman</a> of Christ Episcopal Church.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Paine_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Paine-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1860, Driver and his wife and daughters repaired the flag, sewing on ten more stars, and Driver added (by <a href=\"/wiki/Appliqu%C3%A9\" title=\"Appliqu\u00e9\">appliqu\u00e9</a>) a small white <a href=\"/wiki/Anchor\" title=\"Anchor\">anchor</a> in the lower right corner, to symbolize his maritime career.  By that time, the secession crisis had begun, and Driver's family was split. While Driver was a staunch <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Unionist\" title=\"Southern Unionist\">Unionist</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Returns_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Returns-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  two of his sons were fervent Confederates who enlisted in local regiments, and one died from wounds suffered at <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Perryville\" title=\"Battle of Perryville\">Perryville</a>.  \"One can only imagine the tensions between the Salem-born and Nashville-born Drivers, whose relations may have already been strained by first- and second-family rivalry. In March 1862, Driver wrote: \"Two sons in the army of the South! My entire house estranged...and when I come home...no one to soothe me.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Soon after <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee_in_the_American_Civil_War\" title=\"Tennessee in the American Civil War\">Tennessee seceded from the Union</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Governor_of_Tennessee\" title=\"Governor of Tennessee\">Governor</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Isham_G._Harris\" title=\"Isham G.

An armed group showed up on Driver's front porch, but was confronted by Driver, who said, \"If you want my flag you'll have to take it over my dead body,\" leading them to leave.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In order to save the flag from further threats, Driver (aided by loyal women neighbors) had it sewn into a <a href=\"/wiki/Woven_coverlet\" title=\"Woven coverlet\">coverlet</a> and hidden until late February 1862, when Nashville <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Donelson\" title=\"Battle of Fort Donelson\">fell to Union forces</a>. When the <a href=\"/wiki/Union_Army\" title=\"Union Army\">Union Army</a> (led by the <a href=\"/wiki/6th_Ohio_Infantry\" title=\"6th Ohio Infantry\">6th Ohio Infantry</a>) entered the city, Driver went to <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee_State_Capitol\" title=\"Tennessee State Capitol\">Tennessee State Capitol</a> after seeing the American flag and the 6th Ohio's <a href=\"/wiki/Regimental_colors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regimental colors\">regimental colors</a> raised on the Capitol flagstaff.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Horace Fisher, the <a href=\"/wiki/Aide-de-camp\" title=\"Aide-de-camp\">aide-de-camp</a> to the Union commander in the city, <a href=\"/wiki/Brigadier_General\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brigadier General\">Brigadier General</a> <a href=\"/wiki/William_%22Bull%22_Nelson\" title=\"William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson\">William \"Bull\" Nelson</a>, wrote that: \"A stout, middle-aged man, with hair well shot with gray, short in stature, broad in shoulder, and with a roll in his gait, came forward and asked, 'Who is the General in command? I wish to see him.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Raising_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Raising-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Introducing himself as a sea captain and <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Unionist\" title=\"Southern Unionist\">Unionist</a>, Driver brought the coverlet with him. Fisher recalled: \"Capt. Driver&#8212;an honest-looking, blunt-speaking man, was evidently a character; he carried on his arm a calico-covered bedquilt; and, when satisfied that Gen. Nelson was the officer in command, he pulled out his <a href=\"/wiki/Pocket_knife\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pocket knife\">jack-knife</a> and began to rip open the bedquilt without another word. We were puzzled to think what his conduct meant. ... [Then], the bedquilt was safely delivered of a large American flag, which he handed to Gen.

He spoke triumphantly, with tears in his eyes.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Raising_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Raising-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Nelson accepted the flag and ordered it run up on the Capitol flagstaff, accompanied by \"frantic cheering and uproarious demonstrations.\" The 6th Ohio later adopted the motto \"Old Glory.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>That night, a violent storm \"threatened to tear the banner to pieces\" and so Driver replaced it with a newer flag, taking the original Old Glory for safekeeping. The flag apparently remained in his home until December 1864, when the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Nashville\" title=\"Battle of Nashville\">Battle of Nashville</a> was fought. As Confederate troopers under the command of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Bell_Hood\" title=\"John Bell Hood\">John Bell Hood</a> sought to retake the city, Driver hung his flag in a clearly visible spot out of the third-story window and left to join the defense of the city. For the rest of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">American Civil War</a>, Driver served as <a href=\"/wiki/Provost_marshal\" title=\"Provost marshal\">provost marshal</a> of Nashville, serving in hospitals.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to Mary Jane Roland, one of Driver's Nashville-born daughters, Driver gave her the flag as a gift on July 10, 1873, telling her: \"This is my old ship flag Old Glory. I love it as a mother loves her child; take it and cherish it as I have always cherished it; for it has been my steadfast friend and protector in all parts of the world\u2014savage, heathen and civilized.\" Driver died on March 3, 1886, and was buried in the <a href=\"/wiki/Nashville_City_Cemetery\" title=\"Nashville City Cemetery\">Nashville City Cemetery</a>, where (at Driver's request) his rescue of the <i>Bounty</i> descendants is noted on his grave marker.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Paine_2-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Paine-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Over the next several decades, a family feud took place over the flag and its ownership. Driver's Salem-born niece, Harriet Ruth Waters Cooke, the daughter of Driver's youngest sister, claimed that she had inherited it, and presented her version of Old Glory to the <a href=\"/wiki/Essex_Institute\" title=\"Essex Institute\">Essex Institute</a> in Salem (which later became the <a href=\"/wiki/Peabody_Essex_Museum\" title=\"Peabody Essex Museum\">Peabody Essex Museum</a>), \"along with family memorabilia that included a letter from the Pitcairn Islanders to Driver.\" Cooke also <a href=\"/wiki/Self-publishing\" title=\"Self-publishing\">self-published</a> a family memoir in 1889, omitting any mention of Mary Jane Roland.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In response, Roland wrote her own account of the flag, publishing <i>Old Glory, The True Story</i> in 1918. In that memoir, Roland \"disputed elements of Cooke's narrative and presented documentary evidence for her claim\" that the flag she owned was the true Old Glory. In 1922, Roland gave her Old Glory to President <a href=\"/wiki/Warren_G._Harding\" title=\"Warren G. Harding\">Warren G. Harding</a> as a gift; Harding had the flag sent to the <a href=\"/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution\" title=\"Smithsonian Institution\">Smithsonian Institution</a>. The same year, the Peabody Essex Museum sent its own Old Glory to the Smithsonian as well on loan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Smithsonian_Institution_collection\">Smithsonian Institution collection</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Old_Glory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Smithsonian Institution collection\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Smithsonian Institution historically has regarded the Roland flag, rather than the Peabody flag, as the more authentic, important Old Glory, since \"documentary evidence in the <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee_State_Library_and_Archives\" title=\"Tennessee State Library and Archives\">Tennessee State Library and Archives</a> strongly suggested it was the one hidden in the quilt and presented to Union troops who took Nashville\" and since common sense indicated that as the larger flag, it would have been the one chosen by Driver to fly over the Capitol.  The Roland flag is 17 by 10 feet, while the Peabody flag is smaller, 12 by 6 feet.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In June 2006, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History (NMAH) loaned the Roland flag to the <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee_State_Museum\" title=\"Tennessee State Museum\">Tennessee State Museum</a> in Nashville for an eight-month exhibit entitled <i>Old Glory: An American Treasure Comes Home</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The flag was in fragile condition and had to be carefully shipped and displayed. The museum's senior <a href=\"/wiki/Textile_conservator\" title=\"Textile conservator\">textile conservator</a>, Suzanne Thomassen-Krauss, stated that \"This loan was an exception because of its local ties to Nashville. It's probably the last time it will be loaned out.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Returns_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Returns-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A conservation evaluation of both flags by NMAH <a href=\"/wiki/Curator\" title=\"Curator\">curator</a> Jennifer Locke Jones and Thomassen-Krauss began in 2012. Preliminary findings indicate that the larger Roland flag \"still has the much stronger claim,\" but the analysis also indicated that the Peabody flag \"clearly dates to the same era as the larger Old Glory\" and \"is a legitimate Driver family heirloom and Civil War-era relic.\" The Peabody flag does not appear to have been frequently flown; the fly edge is intact and unworn, which is inconsistent with the wear and tear that would be expected of a seagoing flag. The Peabody flag also has \"baffling soil lines on the flag, and parts of it appear to be newer than others,\" which lead Smithsonian staff to believe that parts of the flag were remade at a later date. The larger Roland Old Glory is heavily worn on the fly edges, consistent with the wear of a seagoing flag.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The findings do not mean that the Peabody flag is insignificant, however, since Driver as a sea captain would have owned more than one flag. \"Driver family memoirs and other records contain references to a 'merino' flag owned by the captain, a storm flag, and then there was the flag that was draped over his coffin.\" The Peabody Essex Museum also has in its collection fragmentary scraps from what was claimed to be Old Glory; these might have been \"souvenir\" patches cut from an original flag, \"a common practice with treasured Civil War banners.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jenkins_1-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jenkins-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Old_Glory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-Jenkins-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-6\"><sup><i><b>g</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-7\"><sup><i><b>h</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-8\"><sup><i><b>i</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-9\"><sup><i><b>j</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-10\"><sup><i><b>k</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-11\"><sup><i><b>l</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-12\"><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-13\"><sup><i><b>n</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Jenkins_1-14\"><sup><i><b>o</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Sally Jenkins, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-flag-came-to-be-called-old-glory-18396/?all\">How the Flag Came to be Called Old Glory</a>, <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i> (October 2013).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Paine-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Paine_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Paine_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Paine_2-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Paine_2-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ophelia Paine, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=399\">William Driver</a>, <i>Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture</i> (last updated January 1, 2010).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Returns-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Returns_3-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Returns_3-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kristen M.
