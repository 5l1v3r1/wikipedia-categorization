The Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht ("Utrecht Early Music Festival") is an annual music festival that showcases and celebrates early European art music. The ten-day festival takes place in the Dutch city of Utrecht, and begins in August. The programme comprises concerts, activities, lectures, exhibitions, and a symposium.  The primary venue is TivoliVredenburg, which opened in 2014. TivoliVredenburg is on the former site of an earlier music venue, Muziekcentrum Vredenburg. The Muziekcentrum was the festival's primary venue until it was demolished in 2008, to allow for new construction. The main concert hall of the Muziekcentrum was subsumed into the TivoliVredenburg.  Each year, the festival's organisers adopt a theme, which focuses attention on a particular place, time, and style in early music. The theme shapes not only the style and musical repertoire of the performances, but the period instruments used.
