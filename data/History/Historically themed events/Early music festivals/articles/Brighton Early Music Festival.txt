Brighton Early Music Festival is an annual music festival which includes concerts, workshops and other educational events. The festival explores the connections between classical music, folk music and world music from the Middle Ages until the early 19th century. The organisation supports and promotes musicians who specialise in historically informed performance, performing on period instruments and exploring the sound world that composers of the past would have had in mind when writing their music. The festival was established in 2002 with a small pilot series.  It is programmed and managed by Co-Artistic Directors and sopranos, Deborah Roberts and Clare Norburn.  In 2003, the festival became formally constituted and set up as a registered charity.  The festival is supported by a dedicated committee of volunteers who are responsible for all areas of managing the festival. Brighton Early Music Festival takes place each autumn from October to November in venues across Brighton and Hove, including St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton, The Royal Pavilion, St George's Church, Brighton, The Old Market and the Brighton Dome complex.  Each year, BBC Radio 3 broadcasts a number of concerts from the festival. Artists who have appeared in the festival include:
