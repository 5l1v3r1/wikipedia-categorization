 The Valletta International Baroque Festival is one of the biggest music festivals of Malta. The programmatic focus is on baroque music. Since its establishment in 2013, the Valletta International Baroque Festival is held every year in January and organized by the direction of Manoel Theatre.  The concerts and opera performances are presented in several Baroque buildings in the city of Valletta. Among the famous artists who have performed at the festival are Mahan Esfahani, Philippe Herreweghe, Christophe Rousset and Jordi Savall.  On 26 January 2017 Reuben Pace's Concertino for guitar, harpsichord and orchestra was premiered at Manoel Theatre under the slogan Inspired by Baroque with the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Michelle Castelletti as well as the soloists Johanna Beisteiner (guitar) and Joanne Camilleri (harpsichord).   It was the first world premiere during the Valletta International Baroque Festival and signaled an artistic expansion of the festival's programme to contemporary works inspired by baroque music.
