The Second Battle Group controversy refers to the BBC investigation into a World War II reenactment group that portrays the SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany. The SBG were the focus of a BBC documentary broadcast on the evening of the 27 August 2007, entitled Weekend Nazis. Two SBG members were covertly filmed expressing racist views.    The SBG later issued the following statement through their lawyers: "The views alleged to have been made by members of the SBG are, in the opinion of the SBG, fascist, racist and utterly reprehensible and as such are views we strongly oppose."
