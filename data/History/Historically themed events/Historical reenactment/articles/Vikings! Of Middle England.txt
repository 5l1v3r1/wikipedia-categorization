     Vikings! of Middle England (also known as Tÿrslið) is a Viking re-enactment and living history group based in Leicester, UK. They portray the people who lived, travelled to and invaded Britain in the Viking-Age. The organisation once owned a scale replica Longship called Ratatosk.  Tÿrslið's aim is to entertain and educate an audience using a mix of drama, pageant, historical context, demonstration and audience participation.  Vikings of Middle England perform at events throughout the UK, including at places of historical interest such as Rockingham Castle,  carnivals,  festivals  and local events,  and also at other visitor attractions such as Conkers.  Vikings of Middle England also provide displays and resources for education, at schools and for seminars. The organisation has lent expertise  and kit to researchers for books,    websites  and conferences while also publishing articles on their website suitable for UK Key Stage 2 students. Vikings of Middle England's membership is mostly based in the city of Leicester. However, some members hail from the surrounding East Midlands  and further afield.
