The following is a list of tourist attractions, by country, that regularly use "living history" or historical reenactments either with professional actors or amateur groups. Most castles which open to the public use reenactment in some form or another, even if not noted on this list. Similarly, anything labeled a Renaissance fair will use reenactment, though the level of authenticity may vary.
