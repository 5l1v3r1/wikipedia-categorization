A loving cup is a shared drinking container traditionally used at weddings and banquets. It usually has two handles and is often made of silver. Loving cups are often given as trophies to winners of games or other competitions.    They can be found in several European cultures, including the Celtic quaich and the French coupe de mariage.   The Russian bratina ("fraternity cup" or "brotherhood cup") is a wine bowl also used for banquets. It is considered the "Russian version of the loving cup".  It is often without handles.
