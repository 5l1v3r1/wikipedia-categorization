 John MacInnes (Iain MacAonghuis, Iain mac Ruairidh mhic Iain mhic Iain mhic Néill mhic Mhaol Mhoire mhic Iain mhic Mhaol Chaluim) is a Scottish Gaelic scholar and authority on Scottish Gaelic oral tradition.  He was born in 3 April 1930 in Uig, Lewis.  He took an active interest in Gaelic tradition while still young and made a conscious effort to seek it out amongst his family and community.  In 1948 John MacInnes went to study at the University of Edinburgh and was awarded a scholarship in Gaelic established by the Church of Scotland.  In 1958, MacInnes was appointed to a Junior Research Fellowship in the School of Scottish Studies and spent years conducting fieldwork amongst Gaelic speakers in Scotland and in Nova Scotia, Canada. MacInnes formally retired from the School of Scottish Studies in 1993. John MacInnes penned a significant body of seminal articles on aspects of Scottish Gaelic linguistics, folklore, oral narrative, song, dance, history and indigenous beliefs which continue to inform contemporary scholarship. A thorough bibliography and selection of these essays was published as Dùthchas nan Gàidheal. A special issue of the journal Scottish Studies contains biographical information and a range of articles celebrating and extending MacInnes’ intellectual and cultural legacy.  In 2015 John MacInnes was recognised with Services to Gaelic Award by The Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.
