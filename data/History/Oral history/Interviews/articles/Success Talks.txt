Success Talks is an organisation that creates interviews with successful individuals from across the world with a focus on digital media and mobile phone applications to promote key messages which challenges current stereotypes about success. The majority of the content can be found on its YouTube channel which was started in December 2012. Other interviews can also be found on its Facebook page and mobile phone app. Its channel has gained thousands of views as well as a good following on Facebook and Twitter. Success Talks have diversified into creating events and have worked with organisations such as PwC, Linklaters, Credit Suisse, Pearson and Teach First.  The concept arose when founder Dennis Owusu-Sem was having a conversation with a colleague about successful black individuals who were not in the fields of music, sport or entertainment. From this he decided to find as many people as he could interview to answer this and many other questions around success. Success Talks have also been quoted in publications such as the Financial Times.  Success Talks have amassed over 40 interviews which have been released on YouTube, Facebook, Podcasts and its own app. Below are some of individuals currently on the series:
