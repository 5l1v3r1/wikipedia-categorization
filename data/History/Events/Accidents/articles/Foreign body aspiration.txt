Foreign body aspiration occurs when a foreign body enters the airways and causes choking.  A foreign body in the bronchi usually causes a cough. In one study, peanuts were the most common obstruction.  In addition to peanuts, hot dogs, and grapes, latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the Heimlich maneuver.  If the person is awake and able to breathe often all that is requires is providing extra oxygen while the operating room is prepared for bronchoscopy.  If a children less than one and is unable to breathe at all then five back blows followed by five chest thrusts should be done.  In children over the age of one abdominal thrusts are recommended.  If this is not effective than bag mask ventilation is recommended.  Next laryngoscopy can be tried to look and see if the foreign body can be removed.  If the above is not effective than intubation or cricothyrotomy can be tried.
