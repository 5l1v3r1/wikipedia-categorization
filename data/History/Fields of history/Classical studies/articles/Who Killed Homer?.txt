Who Killed Homer?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom, is a 1988 book by Classics scholars Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath.   Reviewing Who Killed Homer? for Foreign Affairs, Francis Fukuyama described it as "ostensibly" focused on the decline of classical studies, but "really about the loss of a common, humanistic core in contemporary education and culture."  Who Killed Homer?, was a polemic book criticizing classics scholars including Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz, Judith Hallett, and Amy Richlin, who, in the authors' opinion, misinterpreted and debased classical texts in the service of critical theory, feminism, identity politics and other political causes.
