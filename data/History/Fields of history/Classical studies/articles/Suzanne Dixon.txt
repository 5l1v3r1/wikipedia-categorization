Suzanne Dixon (born 1946)  is an Australian classical scholar, widely recognised as an authority on women's history and particularly marriage and motherhood.   Dixon's career spans posts at the Australian National University as well as the University of Queensland, where she was first reader, then Professor, in Classics and Ancient History.   Her expertise on the position of women in the ancient world was recognised by the BBC History website, by whom she was asked to curate an educational resource on Roman women.  Amy Richlin, currently professor of Classics at the University of California, Los Angeles, has cited Dixon as a great influence in shaping her own work on gender politics.  Her 1992 monograph 'The Roman Family' is credited with being one of the key texts in the field.  She is currently without an academic post, but continues writing about the ancient world in a freelance capacity,  such as her contribution as Honorary Research Consultant to a chapter on Roman marriage in The Wiley Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds.  Dixon lives on an island in Moreton Bay, off the coast of South Queensland, Australia.  Articles Monographs Edited collections Book chapters
