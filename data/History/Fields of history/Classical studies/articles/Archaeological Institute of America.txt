The Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) is a North American nonprofit organization devoted to the promotion of public interest in archaeology, and the preservation of archaeological sites. It has offices on the campus of Boston University and in New York City. The institute was founded in 1879, with Charles Eliot Norton as its first President until 1890.  It was chartered in 1906 by the United States Congress.  The institute currently has over 200,000 members and more than 100 local societies.  The American Journal of Archaeology, AJA, is the AIA's peer-reviewed academic journal that appears four times each year.  The institute has also been publishing the magazine Archaeology since 1948. The AIA is governed by a Council that meets once per year during the annual meeting.  At other times the Governing Board acts on behalf of the Council, with an Executive Committee of the board further acting on the board's behalf between meetings. An Executive Director, who is also known as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is appointed by the board to run day-to-day operations. Actor Harrison Ford, who portrayed the fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones in the titular series, has served as a General Trustee.  The current president of the AIA is Jodi Magness, while the first vice president is Laetitia La Follette.  Andrew M. T. Moore is the immediate past president of the institute.
