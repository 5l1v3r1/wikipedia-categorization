Mary Harlow, FSA (born 20 October 1956) is an English archaeologist and classical scholar. Her research focuses on various aspects of Roman social history―such as age, family, dress and textiles―and their impact on the formation of ancient identity. Her approach strongly promotes interdisciplinarity.  Harlow studied at the University of Leicester gaining a BA in Classical Studies and PhD in Ancient History. After the completion of her PhD she taught briefly at St Andrews, before joining the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity at the University of Birmingham as Senior Lecturer in Roman History (1995–2012). Between 1995 and 2000 she was also an Associate Lecturer at the Open University. In 2000–2002 she held a Leverhulme Research Fellowship to study Dress and Identity in Late Antiquity. In 2013 Harlow returned to the University of Leicester where she is now Associate Professor in Ancient History in the school of Archeology and Ancient History.  Between 2011 and 2013 Harlow was also Guest Professor at the Danish National Research Foundation's Centre for Textile Research (CTR) in Copenhagen, where she took part in the TEMA (Textile Economies in the Mediterranean Area) research project.  Since 2015, Harlow has been involved in the international research group ATOM (Ancient Textiles from the Orient to the Mediterranean), in collaboration with CTR and the CNRS, Paris.  On 15 March 2018, Harlow was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA).
