While predictions of the future can never be absolutely certain,  present understanding in various scientific fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.  All projections of the future of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must rise over time.  Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.  Eventually, matter itself is expected to come under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles.  Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time,  and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.  The timelines displayed here cover events from the beginning of the 11th millennium[note 1] to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternative future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether protons decay, and whether the earth survives when the sun expands to the red giant. Niagara Falls will have eroded away the remaining 32 km to Lake Erie, and ceased to exist.  The many glacial lakes of the Canadian Shield will have been erased by post-glacial rebound and erosion.  Even without a mass extinction, by this time most current species will have disappeared through the background extinction rate, with many clades gradually evolving into new forms.  Africa's collision with Eurasia closes the Mediterranean Basin and creates a mountain range similar to the Himalayas.  The Appalachian Mountains peaks will largely erode away,  weathering at 5.7 Bubnoff units, although topography will actually rise as regional valleys deepen at twice this rate.  During this era, Saturn's moon Titan may reach surface temperatures necessary to support life.  The universe's expansion, assuming a constant dark energy density, multiplies the wavelength of the cosmic microwave background by 1029, exceeding the scale of the cosmic light horizon and rendering its evidence of the Big Bang undetectable. However, it may still be possible to determine the expansion of the universe through the study of hypervelocity stars.  Collisions between brown dwarfs will create new red dwarfs on a marginal level: on average, about 100 stars will be shining in what was once the Milky Way. Collisions between stellar remnants will create occasional supernovae.  By this point, the Sun will have cooled to five degrees above absolute zero.  Because the total number of ways in which all the subatomic particles in the observable universe can be combined is                                    10                                       10                                115                                                                 {\displaystyle 10^{10^{115}}}    ,   a number which, when multiplied by                                    10                                       10                                                   10                                        56                                                                                                     {\displaystyle 10^{10^{10^{56}}}}    , disappears into the rounding error, this is also the time required for a quantum-tunnelled and quantum fluctuation-generated Big Bang to produce a new universe identical to our own, assuming that every new universe contained at least the same number of subatomic particles and obeyed laws of physics within the range predicted by string theory.  To date five spacecraft (Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and New Horizons) are on trajectories which will take them out of the Solar System and into interstellar space. Barring an extremely unlikely collision with some object, the craft should persist indefinitely.  Estimated lifespan of the HD-Rosetta analog disc, an ion beam-etched writing medium on nickel plate, a technology developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and later commercialized. (The Rosetta Project uses this technology, named after the Rosetta Stone). Various public monuments composed of hard granite will have eroded one meter, in a moderate climate, assuming a rate of 1 Bubnoff unit (1 mm / 1,000 years, or ~1 inch / 10,000 years).  Without maintenance, the Great Pyramid of Giza will erode into unrecognizability.  On the Moon, Neil Armstrong's "one small step" footprint at Tranquility Base will erode by this time, along with those left by all twelve Apollo moonwalkers, due to the accumulated effects of space weathering.   (Normal erosion processes active on Earth are not present due to the Moon's almost complete lack of atmosphere.) Extremely rare astronomical events beginning in the 11th millennium AD (year 10,001) will be: For graphical, logarithmic timelines of these events see:
