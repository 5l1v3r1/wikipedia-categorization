The Group is headed by Paul Barnaby \u201cPB\u201d Scott, who serves as Chairman and CEO. &#160;\n</p><p>Formed in 1962 by the Hon. Desmond Blades, Musson (Jamaica) acted originally as a commission agency dealing mainly in food, but eventually developed into a distribution company.&#160; The 1970s was marked by further expansion of its food distribution business and a very successful marketing relationship representing Max Factor. Insurance agency Orrett &amp; Musson was set up with Musson (Jamaica) as a major partner.\n</p><p>The services were further enhanced in 1981, as Musson made the historic step of setting up one of the first general insurance companies in Jamaica, General Accident Jamaica Insurance Company, of which Orrett &amp; Musson became a subsidiary doing premium financing for its mother company.\n</p><p>In the 1990s, whilst growing both the services and manufacturing businesses, Musson was able to expand its distribution by purchasing T Geddes Grant Distributors from the Neal &amp; Massy Group.\n</p><p><b>2000-2009</b>\n</p><p>In 2000, Musson diversified into IT distribution as well as telecommunications logistics and fulfillment. It also acquired Facey Commodity. Further diversification led to Facey starting distribution of cellular cards for Irish telecommunications company Digicel and, based on this relationship, it took over the distribution of the mobile handsets themselves by purchasing Brightstar Jamaica and rebranding it as Facey Telecom.\n</p><p>The expansion of Digicel throughout the Caribbean and Latin American region brought about a major boom for Facey Telecom. In every Digicel expansion, Facey Telecom has been its logistics partner, sourcing mobile handsets from the OEMs such as RIM, Nokia, Sony Ericsson. This telecom expansion was not limited to Digicel, as success in the market led to the acquisition of Radius in Ireland, the distributor for O2, and Meteor, and selling products from various manufacturers including Apple.\n</p><p>Musson was also able to purchase Xerox (Jamaica) Ltd from Xerox, and based on the success of this arrangement, went on to acquire the operations in Dominican Republic, and Aruba and Curacao. Today, this is branded as Productive Business Solutions (PBS), and operates across the region. It is the largest privately owned Xerox distributor globally and also distributes on behalf of Cisco and other technology brands.\n</p><p><b>2010\u2013present</b>\n</p><p>Following the death of Musson\u2019s&#160; founder, leadership of the Group was assumed by Paul Scott who sought to continue the expansion of the business, consolidate on growth, further professionalize the business, develop number of corporate structures, and restructure the Group.\n</p><p>Today, the The Musson Group has growing investments in consumer goods, distribution and manufacturing businesses, enjoying a world-class distribution platform in more than 36 countries in the Caribbean, Central America, Europe, and the Pacific. The Group also has a large footprint in telecommunications and information technology spanning 14 Latin American and Caribbean countries.\n</p><p>The group invested over US$40 million (J$5 billion) in Jamaica\u2019s fledgling sugar industry; US$15 million (J$2 billion) in the island\u2019s dairy sector and is currently completing the development of 58 HWTR, a first of its kind Integrated Tech Park in Kingston, to create in excess of 5,000 jobs.\n</p><p>The Musson Group has established a strong international presence as a result of of acquisitions and new businesses and boasts annual revenue exceeding US$1.6 billion.\n</p><p><b>Subsidiaries</b>\n</p><p>The list of Musson subsidiaries include the Facey Group, Sky Solutions, Transaction E-pins, Productive Business Solutions (PBS), Global Products Alliance Inc (GPA Inc), Radius, General Accident, Eppley Limited, T.
