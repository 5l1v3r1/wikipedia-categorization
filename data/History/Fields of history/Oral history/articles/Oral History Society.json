By the second half of the 1970s the Society also included feminist historians and others interested in women's history. The <i>Oral History</i> journal, founded by <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Thompson_(oral_historian)\" title=\"Paul Thompson (oral historian)\">Paul Thompson</a>, has echoed these interests and many more in the articles it has published. Often featuring oral histories of individuals or groups who have been under-represented in historical accounts, from the first edition <i>Oral History</i> has also provided a forum for oral historians to discuss the methods and challenges involved in the collection, interpretation and dissemination of oral testimonies.\n</p><p>The journal has long maintained a news section that includes reports from community projects as well as a reviews section. This reflects the Society's policy of representing oral historians no matter where they work whether it is in education, community organisations or the media.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_activities\">Current activities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oral_History_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Current activities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Current activities include providing more than 300 training places each year; supporting over 40 experienced oral historians as locally based Regional Networkers - a point of contact for anyone interested in oral history; offering technical, legal and ethical advice; providing information on the funding of oral history work; and publishing two editions of <i>Oral History</i> each year.

Trustees are responsible for the governance of the Society and are elected at the Society's Annual General Meeting which is held at the Society's annual conference. Officers' positions of the Society include a Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer who are also elected annually.\n</p><p>A key structure of the Society is the Regional Network consisting of oral historians who offer a first point of contact in localities throughout Britain and Northern Ireland. The Trustees' sub-committees reflect the priority areas and include a Nominations Committee, Higher Education Group, Trainers Group and an Archives Sub-Committee. The journal has its own Editorial Committee.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oral_History_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Historiography_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Historiography of the United Kingdom\">Historiography of the United Kingdom</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oral_History_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">George Ewart Evans, Thea Thompson, Tony Green, Theo Barker and Patrick Saul, \u2018The Leicester Conference on the problems of Oral History',  <i>Oral History</i>, Vol. 1, No. 3 (1972), p. 12.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oral_History_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><span class=\"official-website\"><span class=\"url\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.oralhistory.org.uk/\">Official website</a></span></span></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/oral_history.html\">Making Oral History -
