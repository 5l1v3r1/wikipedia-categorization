Kidder</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Sylvanus_Morley\" title=\"Sylvanus Morley\">Sylvanus Morley</a>, were trained at SAR field labs at Tyuonyi Ruin on El Rito de los Frijoles (now part of <a href=\"/wiki/Bandelier_National_Monument\" title=\"Bandelier National Monument\">Bandelier National Monument</a>), <a href=\"/wiki/Chaco_Canyon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chaco Canyon\">Chaco Canyon</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Puye_Cliff_Dwellings\" title=\"Puye Cliff Dwellings\">Puye Cliff Dwellings</a>, and other sites. The school also sponsored excavations in Mexico, Guatemala, and South America, and led the effort to preserve 22 Spanish missions in New Mexico. While directing the school, Hewett founded departments of anthropology at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Southern_California\" title=\"University of Southern California\">University of Southern California</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico\" title=\"University of New Mexico\">University of New Mexico</a>.\n</p><p>Through the Museum of New Mexico, the school took an early interest in promoting and preserving the artistic traditions of Southwestern Indians. Indian workers assisted at the School's excavations on the Pajarito Plateau, and their interactions with Hewett, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kenneth_M._Chapman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kenneth M. Chapman (page does not exist)\">Kenneth M. Chapman</a>, and other archaeologists led to a recognition of individual talents and traditional aesthetics. Hewett and Chapman, an artist hired by Hewett to head the art department at New Mexico Normal School, and later one of the first employees of the School of American Archaeology, provided extensive support for Indian artists.  They offered studio facilities, as well as collecting and exhibiting their work. Early Native artists promoted by SAR included <a href=\"/wiki/Maria_Martinez\" title=\"Maria Martinez\">Maria Martinez</a>, Crescencio Martinez, <a href=\"/wiki/Awa_Tsireh\" title=\"Awa Tsireh\">Awa Tsireh</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Fred_Kabotie\" title=\"Fred Kabotie\">Fred Kabotie</a>, among many others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In 1922, the school sponsored the first Southwest Indian Fair, precursor of today's world-renowned <a href=\"/wiki/Santa_Fe_Indian_Market\" title=\"Santa Fe Indian Market\">Santa Fe Indian Market</a>.\n</p><p>Hewett led the school and museum until his death in 1946 at age 82. A 20-year period of relative inactivity followed. The School continued to pursue archaeological research projects on a modest scale.  It was headed, successively, by Sylvanus Morley, Boaz Long, Wayne L. Mauzy, Edward Weyer, Jr., and Eugene McCluney. This transition period ended in 1959, when the State Legislature formally separated the <a href=\"/wiki/Museum_of_New_Mexico\" title=\"Museum of New Mexico\">Museum of New Mexico</a> from the School. The School of American Research was gutted, left with a staff of two and an uncertain future.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rebuilding_the_school\">Rebuilding the school</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_for_Advanced_Research&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Rebuilding the school\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1967, <a href=\"/wiki/Douglas_W._Schwartz\" title=\"Douglas W.

Schwartz broadened the school's focus to embrace advanced scholarship in anthropology and the humanities worldwide; and to promote the study, preservation, and creation of Southwest Indian art. Schwartz also continued the school's archaeological research with field excavations in the <a href=\"/wiki/Grand_Canyon\" title=\"Grand Canyon\">Grand Canyon</a> in the late 1960s and, in the 1970s, the excavations of <a href=\"/wiki/Arroyo_Hondo_Pueblo\" title=\"Arroyo Hondo Pueblo\">Arroyo Hondo Pueblo</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arroyo_Hondo_Pueblo_Project_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arroyo_Hondo_Pueblo_Project-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Conrad_et_al._2016_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Conrad_et_al._2016-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Over the years, SAR's offices had relocated from the Palace of the Governors to the Hewett House on Lincoln Street. In 1973, the school moved into an old adobe estate on Santa Fe's east side. <i>El Delirio</i> had been the home of Martha Root White and Amelia Elizabeth White. Built in the 1920s by <a href=\"/wiki/William_Penhallow_Henderson\" title=\"William Penhallow Henderson\">William Penhallow Henderson</a>, the estate was a popular gathering place for Santa Fe artists, writers, and intellectuals\u2014among them Hewett, Morley, and others associated with the school. The White sisters were avid promoters of Indian art, and together they opened the first Native American art gallery in New York City. Elizabeth also was a founding member of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Indian_Arts_Fund&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Indian Arts Fund (page does not exist)\">Indian Arts Fund</a> (IAF) in Santa Fe and sat on SAR's Board of Managers for 25 years. When Elizabeth died in 1972 at age 94, she left El Delirio and other Santa Fe properties to the School. In that same year, the IAF disbanded and deeded its collections of Southwest Indian art to the School.\n</p><p>The new campus, with its many buildings, permitted the realization of Schwartz's vision for the school. The Advanced Seminar Program was inaugurated in 1968, and has since sponsored more than 120 seminars, the results of which are published by the school's SAR Press. The Resident Scholar Program, launched in 1972, has provided over 180 scholars with residential fellowships.\n</p><p>The construction of the Indian Arts Research Center in 1978 gave the collections inherited from the IAF a suitable home. In 1988, the J. I. Staley Prize was established to recognize books by living authors that exemplify outstanding research in anthropology. Over the succeeding two decades, several residential fellowships for Native artists were also established.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"New_century.2C_new_directions\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_century,_new_directions\">New century, new directions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_for_Advanced_Research&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: New century, new directions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 2001, SAR was under a new president, Richard M. Leventhal, an archaeologist from UCLA who assumed leadership of the school on the retirement of Dr. Schwartz. During his three-year tenure at the School, Dr. Leventhal worked to revitalize SAR\u2019s core programs and extend greater opportunities for scholars and visiting Native artists. Dr. Leventhal was succeeded in 2005 by Dr. James F. Brooks, formerly director of SAR Press. His term coincided with the school\u2019s centennial in 2007, when SAR changed its name from the School of American Research to the School for Advanced Research, to better reflect the global reach of its support for scholarship in the social sciences and humanities. Some of the highlights of Brooks\u2019s tenure include new initiatives such as the Campbell Program for Women Scholar Practitioners\u2014which has supported women from Morocco, Ethiopia, and Kenya in developing strategies for women\u2019s economic and social empowerment\u2014and an emphasis on collaborative research and exhibition projects with Native peoples; monthly Sparks Talks on local history and culture; and a field trip program serving more than two hundred participants annually, visiting locations as near as Pecos National Monument and as far as the borderlands of southeastern Turkey.\n</p><p>When Brooks resigned his post in June 2013, SAR\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Dr. David E. Stuart, an anthropologist and long-time teacher and senior administrator at the University of New Mexico, as interim president. In June 2014, Michael F. Brown assumed SAR\u2019s presidency after shifting to emeritus status at Williams College, on whose faculty he had long served. Brown, a cultural anthropologist familiar with SAR from participation in two advanced seminars and a term as resident scholar, has published extensively on new religious movements, the indigenous peoples of South America, and global efforts to protect indigenous cultural property from appropriation and misuse.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_programs\">Current programs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_for_Advanced_Research&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Current programs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The School for Advanced Research offers residential fellowships for scholars and Native artists, and internships are provided for Native students pursuing academic careers or professional careers in museums.
