The Medieval History Database (MHDB) is an online project with the goal of creating 3D virtual models of "cathedrals, towns, chateaux, and other locations", which users can move through in real-time on their personal computers. Linked to these locations are related historical source documents "such as military records, financial records, and eyewitness accounts" according to the project's official website.
