However, planning policies inevitably impact upon the way a place is used and what it feels like to be there, along with a range of other social, cultural, ecological, physical and economic factors that shape human settlements.

The way that character is regulated varies from place to place, with some planning systems making more overt references to it than others.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Australia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Australia</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Canada\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Canada</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#UK\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">UK</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neighbourhood_character&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Neighbourhood character has become a key term in the planning system of <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria,_Australia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Victoria, Australia\">Victoria, Australia</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Since 2001, it has been the mandatory starting point for assessing all permit applications for residential development in established urban areas in that state. In its formal use in the planning system, it refers to the qualities that make one neighbourhood distinct from another, and encompasses a range of physical components of the built environment, architectural style, street width and layout, vegetation, fence height and style, and so on. Every urban place has a neighbourhood character. \n</p><p>There has been much dispute in Victoria with regard to the use of this term because of its qualitative aspects, which rely mainly on subjective judgement. The planning system is focused on physical planning and the built environment, but residents groups such as <a href=\"/wiki/Save_Our_Suburbs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Save Our Suburbs\">Save Our Suburbs</a> have suggested that the term is too vague on the one hand, and not broad enough on the other as it doesn't incorporate an understanding of the social and cultural character of residential neighbourhoods.\n</p><p>Neighbourhood character is regulated in Victoria through a variety of planning instruments within <a href=\"/wiki/ResCode\" title=\"ResCode\">ResCode</a>, the statutory code for residential development. The <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neighbourhood_Character_Overlay&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Neighbourhood Character Overlay (page does not exist)\">Neighbourhood Character Overlay</a> is the most stringent regulatory device and works in a similar way to a <a href=\"/wiki/Heritage_Overlay\" title=\"Heritage Overlay\">heritage</a> control. Its first implementation was for the <a href=\"/wiki/Hedgeley_Dene_Gardens\" title=\"Hedgeley Dene Gardens\">Hedgeley Dene Gardens</a> precinct in the <a href=\"/wiki/Melbourne\" title=\"Melbourne\">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href=\"/wiki/Malvern_East\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Malvern East\">Malvern East</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Since the mid-1990s, local governments in Victoria have begun to develop policies to regulate neighbourhood character and the majority of the 32 Melbourne local governments now possess some form of locally based neighbourhood character policy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada\">Canada</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neighbourhood_character&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Canada\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Neighbourhood character is a prominent term in the Canadian planning system. For example, since its adoption in 1995, Vancouver's strategic policy 'City Plan' has focused on the creation of a city of distinct neighbourhoods, each with its own identity and neighbourhood character.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UK\">UK</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Neighbourhood_character&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: UK\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Neighbourhood character has become an important issue in planning policy in the UK, as a background study area for informing the Local Development Frameworks of the Core Strategies.
