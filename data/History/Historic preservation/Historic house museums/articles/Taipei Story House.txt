The Taipei Story House (Chinese: 台北故事館; pinyin: Táiběi Gùshì Guǎn), formerly known as the Yuanshan Mansion (Chinese: 圓山別莊; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Îⁿ-soaⁿ Pia̍t-chong), is a historic house in the Zhongshan District, Taipei, Taiwan. It is now open as a museum in Taipei Expo Park. The house was built in 1913–14 during Japanese rule by Tan Tiau-chun (陳朝駿), a Daitōtei tea merchant.    It was originally a guest house for rich merchants, and other important local people. The ground floor was built using brick and the upper floors of wood with English Tudor-style beams.  The staircase is constructed to look like a pagoda. The entrance portico is in the classical style with Ionic columns. The Story House museum now has exhibits related to tea and local history. It is located immediately adjacent to the Taipei Fine Arts Museum and close to Yuanshan Station. The building is within walking distance North East from Yuanshan Station of the Taipei Metro.
