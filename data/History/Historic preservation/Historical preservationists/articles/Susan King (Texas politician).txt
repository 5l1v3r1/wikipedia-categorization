In 2006, the Republican state Representative Robert Dean Hunter of Abilene, vice-president emeritus of Abilene Christian University, stepped down after more than ten years in his legislative position. He had first won a special election in 1986 held three months before the return of Republican Bill Clements to the Texas governorship. Hunter was the first Republican to have represented Taylor County in the legislature since Reconstruction.   King and three other Republicans hence ran in the primary election to choose a successor to Hunter. Kevin M.

King faced only weak Libertarian opponents in the general elections of 2008 and 2010 and had no opposition in 2012 in either her primary or in the general election. In the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014, she handily defeated the Mexican native Issac Matthew Castro (born 1956), an attorney from Hamlin in Jones County who is a former trustee of the Hamlin Independent School District and used to be affiliated with the Texas Republican County Chairmen's Association.

In 2013, King supported the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. She also voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers.  These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor.  King did not vote on two abortion restriction measures in 2011, one of which forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions; the other of which requires a woman procuring an abortion to undergo first a sonogram.

She supported legislation to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. She backed the redistricting bills for the state House, the state Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. King voted for term limits for certain state officials.

King supported picture identification for voters casting a ballot,  a measure which finally took effect in October 2013.
