The Historic Vehicle Association (HVA) was founded in 2009 in America to promote the cultural and historical significance of the automobile, and protect the future of automotive history. With over 375,000 members, the HVA claims to be the world’s largest historic vehicle owners’ organization. HVA was founded with philanthropic support of Hagerty, and became the designated North American representative of FIVA (Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens), the international federation of historic vehicle organizations – both for the U.S. and Canada.   The Historic Vehicle Association aims to achieve its mission in four ways:   1. Documenting and recognizing historically important vehicles in a National Historic Vehicle Register. 2. Establishing and sharing best practice guidelines to ensure that authentic examples of automotive history will be available for future generations. 3. Promoting the historical and cultural significance of the automobile through media and events.  4. Protecting the future of automotive history through affiliations with museums and academic institutions, educational programs, and support of legislative action.
