By 1920, there were hundreds of <a href=\"/wiki/Mill_towns\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mill towns\">mill towns</a> across the region built for the production of textiles and other goods, such as shoes, machinery and other items. However, the Northern textile industry would suffer greatly beginning in the early 1920s, with the failure of many of these companies, and the rise in competition from Southern mills. Other industries would follow, especially during the later part of the 20th century, when <a href=\"/wiki/Globalization\" title=\"Globalization\">globalization</a> changed the economy, and entire industries began to move overseas to developing nations. Through the 20th century, many mills carried on in a variety of industrial purposes, other than original intended use. Many were used for storage, or other small enterprises. Still, many more remained mostly vacant and underutilized through the middle part of the 20th century, and even today. Many vacant mill buildings have become a target for vandalism, <a href=\"/wiki/Arson\" title=\"Arson\">arson</a> and contribute to <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_blight\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Urban blight\">urban blight</a> in many communities.\n</p><p>A similar scenario has also played out in <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Britain\" title=\"Great Britain\">Great Britain</a> and elsewhere in <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">Europe</a> during this same timeframe.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Historic_awareness_movement\">Historic awareness movement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mill_conversion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Historic awareness movement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large public outcry throughout the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> for an increase in <a href=\"/wiki/Historic_preservation\" title=\"Historic preservation\">historic preservation</a>, to stop the loss of historic structures that began during the 1950s with <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_renewal\" title=\"Urban renewal\">urban renewal</a> projects in big cities and small towns across the nation. A similar movement occurred in <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Britain\" title=\"Great Britain\">Great Britain</a> decades earlier.\n</p><p>One result of this outcry was the establishment of the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places\" title=\"National Register of Historic Places\">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1966, by the <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_Government\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Federal Government\">Federal Government</a>. Since this time, more than one-million listings have been added to the National Register, on many types of structures and places across the country. While not a certain guarantee that a structure will never be demolished, the National Register provides owners with a tool to seek national and state tax credits, grants and other assistance that may enable the rehabilitation of the building.\n</p><p>Since the 1960s communities across the country have established <a href=\"/wiki/Historic_Districts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Historic Districts\">Historic Districts</a> and special by-laws in an attempt to preserve and prevent the destruction of properties deemed important to the context of history.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mill_to_museum_conversion\">Mill to museum conversion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mill_conversion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Mill to museum conversion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Slater_Mill_close.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Slater_Mill_close.jpg/220px-Slater_Mill_close.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Slater_Mill_close.jpg/330px-Slater_Mill_close.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Slater_Mill_close.jpg/440px-Slater_Mill_close.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"450\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Slater_Mill_close.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Slater Mill, Pawtucket</div></div></div>\n<p>The first successful textile mill in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> was <a href=\"/wiki/Slater_Mill\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slater Mill\">Slater Mill</a>, established by <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Slater\" title=\"Samuel Slater\">Samuel Slater</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Pawtucket,_Rhode_Island\" title=\"Pawtucket, Rhode Island\">Pawtucket, Rhode Island</a> in 1793. With its significant historic value, the drive to restore Slater Mill into a public museum began during the mid-20th century.\n</p><p>In 1971, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.brandywinemuseum.org\">Brandywine River Museum of Art</a> opened in <a href=\"/wiki/Chadds_Ford_Township,_Delaware_County,_Pennsylvania\" title=\"Chadds Ford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania\">Chadds Ford</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania\" title=\"Pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> in a converted <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">Civil War</a>-era <a href=\"/wiki/Gristmill\" title=\"Gristmill\">grist mill</a>. The mill (and an additional 8 1/2 acres) was purchased at auction by the newly formed Brandywine Conservancy. Renovations began in 1970 and the museum opened in 1971. The renovation was done by James R. Grieves Associates, Inc. of Baltimore. Grieves was the only professional consulted who wanted to keep the 19th structure intact.  Other architects recommended tearing it down and starting over. The museum exhibits Wyeth and American art, with galleries devoted to the works of N.C., Andrew, and Jamie Wyeth.\n</p><p>In 1976, <a href=\"/wiki/Lowell_Heritage_State_Park\" title=\"Lowell Heritage State Park\">Lowell Heritage State Park</a> was established in <a href=\"/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Lowell, Massachusetts\">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>. In 1978, the United States Congress established <a href=\"/wiki/Lowell_National_Historical_Park\" title=\"Lowell National Historical Park\">Lowell National Historical Park</a> and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission. The legislation to create the park was sponsored by United States Senator and Lowell native <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Tsongas\" title=\"Paul Tsongas\">Paul Tsongas</a>. The restoration gathered momentum in the 1980s, including the renovation of the canals and former mill facilities into museums, as well as the construction of a waterfront walkway.\n</p><p>During the 1980s, with the example of Lowell's National Historic Park coming into fruition, the <a href=\"/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Massachusetts\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Commonwealth of Massachusetts\">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> established a series of Heritage State Parks throughout the state to celebrate and preserve the state's valuable historic (mostly industrial) history. <a href=\"/wiki/Lawrence_Heritage_State_Park\" title=\"Lawrence Heritage State Park\">Lawrence Heritage State Park</a>, which occupies a former mill <a href=\"/wiki/Boardinghouse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Boardinghouse\">boardinghouse</a> in the city's industrial canal district, is an excellent example.\n</p><p>In 1999, the former Arnold Print Works mills in <a href=\"/wiki/North_Adams,_Massachusetts\" title=\"North Adams, Massachusetts\">North Adams, Massachusetts</a> was converted into the <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art\" title=\"Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art\">Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art</a> (MassMOCA).\n</p><p>Not all historic mills can be successfully transformed into museums however, only with the few, most significantly historic ones has this been possible.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mill_to_residential_conversion\">Mill to residential conversion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mill_conversion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Mill to residential conversion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Since most mills were initially zoned as \"industrial\" with the emergence of zoning ordinances during the mid- and late 20th century, an early obstacle of many planners and developers in transforming these vacant or underutilized mill spaces into residences was to convince local officials that the usefulness of the mills for continuing industry was limited. Business practices were changing, and the old mill buildings were no longer efficient or practical for industry. Even today, most jurisdictions require some sort of special permit or zoning change in order for the conversions to take place.\n</p><p>One of the earliest known conversions of a historic textile mill into residential apartments is the <a href=\"/wiki/Valley_Falls_Company\" title=\"Valley Falls Company\">Valley Falls Company</a> south mill located in <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Falls,_Rhode_Island\" title=\"Central Falls, Rhode Island\">Central Falls, Rhode Island</a>.

During the 1980s, many of the historic cotton mills in <a href=\"/wiki/Fall_River,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Fall River, Massachusetts\">Fall River, Massachusetts</a> were converted into factory outlet stores, although with minimal physical alteration other than some partitions and carpeting. The factory outlet stores in Fall River were highly successful for many years, but have in recent years declined, a victim of newer \"premium outlet\" malls opening up in nearby suburban areas such as <a href=\"/wiki/Wrentham,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Wrentham, Massachusetts\">Wrentham, Massachusetts</a>, and others.\n</p><p>One excellent example of a mill to mixed-use conversion in <a href=\"/wiki/New_England\" title=\"New England\">New England</a> is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080509081248/http://www.clocktowerplace.com/\">Clocktower Place</a>, located in the small town of <a href=\"/wiki/Maynard,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Maynard, Massachusetts\">Maynard, Massachusetts</a>. The huge mill complex was originally the Assabet Manufacturing Company, which grew during the 19th century to be one of the largest textile companies in the state, specializing in woolen goods.

Many of the old industrial sites contain levels of contamination, which can be very costly for the developers to mitigate.\n</p><p>In recent years, many states have enacted Historic Tax Credit programs in an attempt to enable the rehabilitation of older structures deemed to be \"historically significant\".
