Groups of Traditional Buildings (伝統的建造物群, Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun) is a Japanese category of historic preservation introduced by a 1975 amendment of the law which mandates the protection of groups of traditional buildings which, together with their environment, form a beautiful scene. They can be post towns, castle towns, mining towns, merchant quarters, ports, farming or fishing villages, etc.  The Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs recognizes and protects the country's cultural properties under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. Municipalities can designate items of particular importance as Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings (伝統的建造物群保存地区, Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun Hozon-chiku) and approve measures to protect them.

The Agency for Cultural Affairs then provides guidance, advice, and funds for repairs and other work. Additional support is given in the form of preferential tax treatment.
