A medina quarter (Arabic: المدينة القديمة‎ al-madīnah al-qadīmah "the old city") is a distinct city section found in a number of North African and Maltese cities. A medina is typically walled, with many narrow and maze-like streets.  The word "medina" (Arabic: مدينة‎ madīnah) itself simply means "city" or "town" in modern-day Arabic although it was borrowed from an Aramaic-Hebrew word (also "medina") referring to a city or populated area. Medina quarters often contain historical fountains, palaces, mosques, and sometimes churches. Because of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from car traffic, and in some cases even motorcycle and bicycle traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres. The Medina of Fes, or Fes el Bali, is considered one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world.
