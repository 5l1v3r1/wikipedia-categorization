A historic district or heritage district is a section of a city which contains older buildings considered valuable for historical or architectural reasons.  In some countries or jurisdictions, historic districts receive legal protection from certain types of development considered to be inappropriate.      Historic districts may or may not also be the center of the city.  They may be coterminous with the commercial district, administrative district, or arts district, or separate from all of these. In Canada, such districts are called "heritage conservation districts" or "heritage conservation areas" (known as "arrondissements historiques", "secteurs de conservation du patrimoine" or "districts de conservation du patrimoine" in French) and are governed by provincial legislation.  Many jurisdictions within the United States have specific legislation identifying and giving protection to designated historic districts. The term "Historic District" is not used in the United Kingdom. The equivalent urban areas are known as Conservation Areas. Iranian Heritage and Tourism organization has nominated and selected several cities for their valuable historical monuments and districts. Baft-e Tarikhi (In Persian: بافت تاریخی or historical texture) is the name such areas are labelled with. Naein, Isfahan and Yazd are examples of Iranian cities with historic districts.
