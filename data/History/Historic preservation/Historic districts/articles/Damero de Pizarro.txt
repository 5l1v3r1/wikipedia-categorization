The Damero de Pizarro (translated into English as Pizarro's Checkerboard), Cercado de Lima (Walled Lima) or Lima Cuadrada (Squared Lima) is as it is known an area of the historic center of Lima (capital of Peru) located within the old walls of the city.  This zone corresponds to the foundational layout of the city. Its current boundaries within the city are the RÃ­mac River to the north, Abancay Avenue to the east, Colmena Avenue to the south and Tacna Avenue to the west. It is named because it is the oldest and most central part of the city and because its urban layout maintains the classic Spanish style of streets and perpendicular avenues that form homogeneously square blocks.  Also, in this area are the main historical monuments of the city and several of the public buildings of the government of Peru including the Government Palace and the Cathedral of Lima.
