Prior to this, St Vincent's Place, as it is known now, was used as a race track for horses for a period of 9 months or so.  The current layout is the work of Clement Hodgkinson, the noted surveyor, engineer and topographer, who adapted the design in 1857 to allow for its intersection by the St Kilda railway. The precinct, which in its original configuration extended from Park Street in the north to Bridport Street in the south, and from Howe Crescent in the east to Nelson Road and Cardigan Street in the west, was designed to emulate similar 'square' developments in London, although on a grander scale. The main streets were named after British naval heroes. The development of the special character of St Vincent Place has been characterised, since the first land sales in the 1860s, by a variety of housing stock which has included quality row and detached houses dominated by Rochester Terrace (Heritage Register Number 813), and by the gardens which, although they have been continuously developed, remain faithful to the initial landscape concept</i>.\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.heritage.vic.gov.au/page_239.asp?ID=239&amp;submit_action=detailed_result&amp;search_type=DLVHR&amp;query=registerAll/0C8CB1A3944493D9CA2571CD007B743B?OpenDocument\">[2]</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Historical_significance\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Historical significance</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#People_&amp;_literature\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">People &amp; literature</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Significant_buildings_and_facilities\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Significant buildings and facilities</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Historical_significance\">Historical significance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=St_Vincent_Place&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Historical significance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is registered with the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Trust_of_Australia\" title=\"National Trust of Australia\">National Trust of Australia</a> and on the <a href=\"/wiki/Victorian_Heritage_Register\" title=\"Victorian Heritage Register\">Victorian Heritage Register</a> for its <i>aesthetic, historical, architectural and social significance to the State of Victoria</i>.\n</p><p>The Victorian Heritage Register states St Vincent Place is \"<i>aesthetically important for the outstanding quality of its urban landscape. The major elements that reflect this importance are the gardens with their gardenesque style layout and fine collections of mature specimen trees, and the harmonious relationship of the gardens with the residential buildings facing them around St Vincent Place.   The St Vincent Place Precinct is historically important as the premier 'square' development in Victoria based on similar models in London. It is significant as the largest development of its type in Victoria and for its unusual development as gardens rather than the more usual small park as at, for example Macarthur, Murchison, Lincoln and Argyle Squares in Carlton. The precinct is also historically significant for its associations with Surveyor General Andrew Clarke, and more particularly with Clement Hodgkinson, a prolific and influential surveyor engineer in early Melbourne.  The St Vincent Place Precinct is architecturally important for the consistent quality of its built form and its high degree of intactness from its earliest phase of development, characterised by a mixture of one and two storey terraces and detached houses.  The St Vincent Place Precinct is socially important as a reflection of the aspirations of middle class residents in South Melbourne. Because of the shared outlook on and use of the gardens, the precinct has developed a sense of community cohesion unusual in the Melbourne context. The gardens are also socially important as a focus of community life for the surrounding district with the maintenance of their amenity a priority of municipal government since their inception. The existence of the tennis and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.albertparkbowlsclub.com.au\">bowls club</a> s in the gardens for over a century is a further manifestation of this social importance</i>.\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.heritage.vic.gov.au/page_239.asp?ID=239&amp;submit_action=detailed_result&amp;search_type=DLVHR&amp;query=registerAll/0C8CB1A3944493D9CA2571CD007B743B?OpenDocument\">[3]</a>\n</p><p>The Australian Demographer Bernard Salt included the precinct as first among his \"favourite places that have been designed by planners\"&#160;:  \"<i>St Vincent Place, Albert Park: Where would such a list start but in my home city of Melbourne?
