A diamond jubilee is a celebration held to mark a 60th anniversary of an event related to a person (e.g. accession to the throne, wedding, etc.). The 60-year reign of Queen Victoria, which was commemorated as the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria was celebrated on 22 June 1897. The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was celebrated across the Commonwealth of Nations throughout 2012.  George III of the United Kingdom died a few months before his diamond jubilee was due in 1820.[clarification needed] In East Asia, the diamond jubilee coincides with the traditional sixty-year sexagenary cycle, which is held in special importance despite not being called a "diamond jubilee." Monarchs such as the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of China, and Hirohito of emperor of Japan held celebrations for their sixtieth year of reign, as did King Bhumibol Adulyadej the King of Thailand on 10 June 2006. National governments also mark their sixtieth anniversary as diamond jubilees, as did the Republic of Korea in 2005 and the People's Republic of China in 2009. In South Asia, the term is also used for certain 100-week anniversaries. For instance, in both India and Pakistan, a diamond jubilee film is one shown in cinemas for 100 weeks or more. The longest reigning monarch in history, Sobhuza II of Swaziland, celebrated his diamond jubilee in 1981, dating from when he gained direct rule.
