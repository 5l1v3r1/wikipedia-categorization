A platinum jubilee is a celebration held to mark an anniversary. Among monarchies, it usually refers to a 70th anniversary.   Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand was the most recent monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee; he died shortly after official celebrations in Thailand took place. The next currently reigning monarch who would celebrate a platinum jubilee is Queen Elizabeth II (technically only as Queen of the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as all of the other countries she is at present queen of had yet to gain independence at the time of her accession), should she still be reigning on 6 February 2022. In South Asian usage, a "platinum jubilee" refers not to an anniversary, but the celebration of 75 weeks. For instance, in Pakistan and India, a platinum jubilee film is one shown in cinemas for 75 weeks or more. The success measure for a 'super hit film' is minimum six months release on its main cinema.   The next level of celebration, an anniversary of 100 years, is simply called a centenary.
