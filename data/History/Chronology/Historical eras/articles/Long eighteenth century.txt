 The long 18th century is a phrase used by many British historians to cover a more natural historical period than the simple use of the standard calendar definition. They expand the century to include larger British historical movements, with their subsequent "long" 18th century typically running from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.   Other definitions, perhaps those with a more social or global interest, extend the period further to, for example, 1660â€“1830.
