The Chronicle of Edessa is a record of the history of Edessa written in the mid 6th century in Syriac language. The Chronicle of Edessa is generally agreed to have been written around 540-550 CE.[a] The Chronicle primarily used old Edessan royal archives as its source, as well as some more recent church records,  and accordingly is thought to be historically reliable.    It is extant in only a single manuscript, Vatican Syriac 163.  This manuscript was acquired by Giuseppe Simone Assemani during a trip to the Near East from 1715-1717 CE taken at the request of Pope Clement XI.  The Chronicle begins with a record of a flood during the reign of Abgar VIII in November 201 CE which damaged a Christian church building in Edessa.   This is the earliest mention of a building dedicated exclusively to Christian worship,  as well as one of few records of Christianity in Edessa at this time.   Also, unlike other Syriac literature, the Chronicle does not contain any legends of the Apostle Thaddeus.
