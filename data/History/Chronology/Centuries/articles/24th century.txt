The 24th century of the Anno Domini (common era) will span from January 1, 2301 to December 31, 2400 of the Gregorian calendar. Unlike most century years, the year 2400 will be a leap year, and the next century leap year in the Gregorian calendar after 2000. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager, as well as Star Trek Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, and Star Trek: Nemesis are set in the 24th century.
