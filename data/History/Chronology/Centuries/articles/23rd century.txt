The 23rd century will be the century of the Anno Domini or Common Era which, in the Gregorian calendar, will begin on January 1, 2201, and end on December 31, 2300. Unless changes are made in the religious calendar, in 2285, the Western Easter will fall on March 22 for the first time since 1818, the earliest possible date on which Easter can occur.  See Eschatology: Judaism. The majority of Star Trek and the first six movies as well as the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth movies are set in the 23rd century. Dates were calculated from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Neutral Zone", which provided an exact calendar year for the first time.
