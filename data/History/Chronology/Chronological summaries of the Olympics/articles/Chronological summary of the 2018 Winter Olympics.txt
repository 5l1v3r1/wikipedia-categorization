 This is a chronological summary of the major events of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea. Two events, the curling mixed doubles tournament and the men's normal hill ski jumping competition, held their preliminary rounds on 8 February. The opening ceremony took place one day later on 9 February. The last day of competition and the closing ceremony was on 25 February.  The games featured 102 events in 15 sports, making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Four new disciplines in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic programme in Pyeongchang, including big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.  A Unified Korea women's ice hockey team competed under a separate IOC country code designation (COR); in all other sports, there was a separate North Korea team and a separate South Korea team.  As a result of the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee due to the Russian doping controversy, Russian athletes competed as "Olympic Athletes from Russia" (OAR) under a neutral flag and with the Olympic anthem playing in any ceremony.     *   Host nation (South Korea)
