Yesterday is a temporal construct of the relative past; literally of the day before the current day (today), or figuratively of earlier periods or times, often but not always within living memory. Philosophers have treated "yesterday" in various ways including as a relative but distinct concept of time. For example, John Locke in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding 1760 treated the concept of "yesterday" as follows: I suppose, nobody thinks it conceivable that any thing does, or has existed in that future duration. Nor is it possible to join our idea of future duration with present or past existence, any more than it is possible to make the idea of yesterday, today, and tomorrow to be the same; or bring ages past and future together, and make them contemporary. In Chinese philosophy also the meaning of "today" and "yesterday" is relative to contexts.  In the rhetoric of history "yesterday" can refer to the life framework of a past era,  such as the example in literature of memory recalled from a previous, but now lost, lifestyle or society, such as recent colonial life.  The concepts of "yesterday", "today" and "tomorrow" are among the first relative time concepts acquired by infants.  In language a distinctive noun or adverb for "yesterday" is present in most but not all languages, though languages with ambiguity in vocabulary also have other ways to distinguish the immediate past and immediate future.  "Yesterday" is also a relative term and concept in grammar and syntax.
