 The Croatian months used with the Gregorian calendar by Croats differ from the original Latin month names: Some names are derived from archaic Croatian-Slavic words that are no longer found in standard Croatian dictionaries. In some cases even the meaning of those words is ambiguous. In Macedonian, Listopad is also the (archaic) name for October but Polish/Czech listopad, Belarusian 'listapad' ('Лістапад') and Ukrainian "листопад" mean November.  Likewise, Polish sierpień, Czech srpen and Ukrainian Серпень mean August rather than July, Czech říjen means October rather than September, Slovenian prosinec means January rather than December, and Polish lipiec, Belarusian Лiпень, and Ukrainian Липень mean July rather than June.
