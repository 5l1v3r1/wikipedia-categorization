  William Cuninghame of Lainshaw (c.1775â€“1849) was a Scottish landowner, known as a writer on biblical prophecy. He dated the beginning of the reign of Antichrist to 533 A.D., to coincide with a claimed date at which Justinian I gave universal rule to the Papacy, by subtracting 1260 years from the date after the French Revolution at which it was seen to turn against the Roman Catholic Church.  He was the son of William Cunninghame (died 1804), a prosperous tobacco merchant of Glasgow, who in 1779 bought the Lainshaw estate, Stewarton, Ayrshire.   Educated at the University of Utrecht, he joined the Bengal civil service of the East India Company. While in India he was influenced by William Carey the Baptist missionary. He returned to Scotland in 1804.  Cuninghame was one of a group of British biblical interpreters of the early 19th century, including also Edward Bickersteth, Thomas Rawson Birks, Joshua William Brooks, and Edward Bishop Elliott, who combined premillennialism with a more traditional historicist reading of prophecy.  In this, he followed the earlier influence of Johann Heinrich Alsted in Diatribe mille annis apocalypticis (Frankfurt, 1627), and Joseph Mede in Clavis Apocalypticae. Departing from that traditional historicist hermeneutic, the premillennialism movement came to include futurist and dispensational contributors such as Hugh M'Neile, Edward Irving and John Nelson Darby.  From 1827 Cuninghame served as minister in a congregational church at Stewarton in Ayrshire. In 1839, under pressure from the presbytery of Irvine of the Church of Scotland, he began the "Stewarton case".   It led rather directly to the Disruption of 1843.
