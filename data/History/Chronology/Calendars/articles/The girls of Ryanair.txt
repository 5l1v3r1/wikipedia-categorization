The girls of Ryanair is a calendar made by low-cost airline Ryanair using female cabin crew as models. The calendar raises money for Charity work. The 2009 Calendar raised money for homeless charity Dublin Simon Community  and it drew seven hundred contenders to appear in it.  The 2010 calendar gives the proceeds to KIDS  (for disabled children and their families).    and it drew over eight hundred of Ryanair's 4,000 female crew employees to appear.  The National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) has strongly criticized the calendar.
