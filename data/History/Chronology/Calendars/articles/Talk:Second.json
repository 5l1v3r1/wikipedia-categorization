We need not be concerned with the distinction between B and H (both point quantities) because it only exists in the metric system, or rationalized mks units. In CGS electromagnetic units they are one and the same, because permeability is the dimensionless unit 1.

I don't have a reference but I am sure I am not the first one to have thought about the issue. The point is that I think it highly unlikely that the start point was a higher frame of reference, e.g. a day which was divided arbitrarily into 24th and 60ths twice to arrive at a set time span the second. Why 60ths?  I doubt very much that the concept of this short and humanly meangingful time span came into existence in the Middle Ages! It is age old.  The second is an easy to reference for humans to reckon with, as are days and months. Whether its the time to say a word or the time to take one pace forward. Intermediate times are not. It is therefore much more likey that the divisors were created break the relatively high number of seconds in a day into meaningful chunks such as minutes and hours.

Although the Babylonians did not use the equinoctial hour (our modern hour), a seasonal hour does occur in some Babylonian texts (I just read). The principal Babylonian unit of time was the <i>u\u0161</i> (\u0161 is pronounced sh) which is translated as a <i>time-degree</i> because it is the time it takes for the Sun or a star to move 1\u00b0 across the sky (1/360 of a nychthemeron, Greek for night+day), four modern minutes. Babylonian astronomical diaries gave observations of lunar eclipses in terms of u\u0161 or beru before or after sunrise or sunset. See <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.shpltd.co.uk/goldstein-ancient.pdf\">Ancient and medieval values for the mean synodic month</a> by Bernard R. Goldstein. The beru was 30 time-degrees or 1/12 of a nychthemeron, which is the time it takes a zodiacal sign (30\u00b0) to pass the observer's meridian, two modern hours. The <i>cubit</i> was 180 barleycorns or 10 time-degrees, 40 modern minutes. The <i>finger</i> was 1/12 of a time-degree or six barleycorns, 20 modern seconds. Thus the <i>\u0161e</i> (pronounced shay), translated as a \"barleycorn\", was 1/72 or a time-degree, 3\u2153 modern seconds.

They just don't say that, at least not explicitly.  The SI specification (the one I linked above) defines a meter based on \"light in a vacuum\", and for the definition of a second, it just refers to a caesium 133 atom at 0K.  One presumes that 0K is unattainable, but it is approachable as a limit, in which case there are no other atoms colliding with the caesium atom, and thus it is in a <i>de facto</i> vacuum.  In either case, I don't see how <i>vaccum</i> means anything other than a literal laboratory container with (almost) all of the air pumped out of it.  The gravitation in the laboratory distorts spacetime a little bit (as seen from someone far from Earth), but we assume that distance and time durations are both relative to an observer in the same frame.  You would want to measure your distance and time standards horizontally, if done on Earth, to minimize the effects of climbing out of (or into) the gravity well.  But once you made your calibrated meter-stick and second-clock, I would assume you could take them out into intergalactic space and use them, and they would work just as well as ones that were made in an intergalactic laboratory. <a href=\"/wiki/User:CosineKitty\" title=\"User:CosineKitty\">CosineKitty</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:CosineKitty\" title=\"User talk:CosineKitty\">talk</a>) 22:55, 28 January 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Don't worry about relativistic effects.

We divided each minute into five seconds.\" Jagged 85 omitted the last sentence which meant that Taqi al-Din divided each minute on his clock into twelve five-second periods. Although he did not divide each minute into 60 one-second periods, his clock did indeed \"show seconds\", which is all the Swiss clock citation stated. I don't know whether that Swiss clock marked every second, or only some, because its citation is quite inferior to the Taqi al-Din citation. \u2014 <a href=\"/wiki/User:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User:Joe Kress\">Joe Kress</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User talk:Joe Kress\">talk</a>) 02:57, 22 June 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>Despite what Taqi SAID (and what the clock actually did), it is misleading for us to flatly say the clock showed \"seconds\" in an article about the <a href=\"/wiki/Second\" title=\"Second\">second</a>. The clock showed 1/12ths of a minute (or intervals of 5 seconds, or 12 equal subdivisions of a minute).

The \"second\" meant both 1/3600 hour and 1/3600 day throughout medieval and early modern astronomy (probably 830\u20131740). I cited both <a href=\"/wiki/Al-Biruni\" title=\"Al-Biruni\">al-Biruni</a> (1000) and <a href=\"/wiki/Roger_Bacon\" title=\"Roger Bacon\">Roger Bacon</a> (1267) who used both meanings, but both may have been used as early as 830 by <a href=\"/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Al-Khwarizmi\">al-Khwarizmi</a> and both were used as late as 1740 by <a href=\"/wiki/Jacques_Cassini\" title=\"Jacques Cassini\">Jacques Cassini</a>. Modern seconds (seoonds of hours) were not used by the Hellenistic astronomers <a href=\"/wiki/Hipparchus\" title=\"Hipparchus\">Hipparchus</a> (150 BC), <a href=\"/wiki/Ptolemy\" title=\"Ptolemy\">Ptolemy</a> (140 AD) and <a href=\"/wiki/Theon_of_Alexandria\" title=\"Theon of Alexandria\">Theon</a> (360) although all of them used seconds of days. All of them also used the modern hour, but did not subdivide it sexagesimally. No other seconds have been attested, certainly not a period of 12 modern seconds (1/5 minute). Babylonian astronomers first subdivided the day sexagesimally into minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, fifths, and sixths (using Engish terms equivalent to medieval Latin terms). This second sexagesimal fraction of a day was 24 modern seconds. Thus medieval astronomers used two different \"seconds\" within the same book, and even on the same page. Because the English translation of Taqi al-Din used \"five seconds\" (or \"five-second [intervals]\") alongside hours, the seconds dial was subdivided into twelve five-second periods that I assume were marked 5, 10, 15, etc., even though individual seconds were not marked. This numbering is not in the article because it is only my opinion. Taqi al-Din was quite familiar with Western European time units and their numbering system because he complained that cheap Western European clocks were being imported into Istanbul. \u2014 <a href=\"/wiki/User:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User:Joe Kress\">Joe Kress</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User talk:Joe Kress\">talk</a>) 01:10, 27 June 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>Do we know if the movement from one second marker on the dial to the next was smooth or pulsed?

The second is rather 1/86400 of the average length of a day (noon to noon).  This is closely related but not exact.  In a (julian) year of 365.2425 days, the earth rotates 366.2425 times which makes the rotational period about 23 hours 56 minutes.  This is because earth also rotates around the sun and it advances a little less than one degree a day.  Earth has to rotate for 361 degrees that the sun is over the same meridian again and it takes about 4 minutes to rotate the additional degree.  \nAs an additional complication, the angle earth advances each day varies over the year, because earth is in an elliptic orbit and rotates faster when closer to the sun.  That makes the time from noon to noon much less stable than the rotational period of Earth. Therfore the length of the day has to be averaged over one year to define a stable day on which the second was based\n<a href=\"/wiki/User:Sconden\" title=\"User:Sconden\">Sconden</a> (<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sconden&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User talk:Sconden (page does not exist)\">talk</a>) 17:00, 22 June 2010 (UTC)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>I've rewritten it to make more sense.

The al-Biruni citation is to the 1879 English translation which used the English word second. <i>The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i> states \"second\" as a unit of time entered the English language during late 16th century, and is derived from old French <i>seconde</i> from medieval Latin <i>secunda</i> used as a noun (compare <i>minuta</i> minute), the feminine form of the Latin adjective <i>secundus</i>, the ordinal number word for \"second\" (being the result of the second operation of dividing by sixty). It also states that a \"minute\" of time entered English during the late Middle English period, derived from medieval Latin <i>pars minuta prima</i> first minute part, the 1/60 of a unit in a system of sexagesimal fractions. Roger Bacon in 1267 used <i>hora</i> (hour), <i>minuta</i> and <i>secunda</i> because he wrote in Latin. All later Latin writers, including Tycho, Kepler, etc., would have used the same terms. \u2014 <a href=\"/wiki/User:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User:Joe Kress\">Joe Kress</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User talk:Joe Kress\">talk</a>) 18:58, 27 May 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>According to the SI brochure, the second first became part of the metric system in 1832 when Gauss used it - See <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_the_metric_system\" title=\"History of the metric system\">History of the metric system</a> for full reference. <small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014 Preceding <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures\" title=\"Wikipedia:Signatures\">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href=\"/wiki/User:Martinvl\" title=\"User:Martinvl\">Martinvl</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Martinvl\" title=\"User talk:Martinvl\">talk</a> \u2022 <a href=\"/wiki/Special:Contributions/Martinvl\" title=\"Special:Contributions/Martinvl\">contribs</a>) 23:17, 27 May 2012</span></small></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the cite, but according to the SI brochure the second did not become part of the metric system in 1832, instead Gauss \"strongly promoted\" the metric system with the second from astronomy as a coherent system of units for use in the physical sciences.

The second replaced or began to replace the mean solar day as the basic unit of time in 1670 when William Clement began to regulate clocks with a <a href=\"/wiki/Seconds_pendulum\" title=\"Seconds pendulum\">seconds pendulum</a>, which had a period of two seconds, one second to swing forward and another second to swing back. The resulting longcase or grandfather clock was able to tick every second with good accuracy. This is already mentioned in the article. At the same time, the Royal Observatory, Greenwich installed two Thomas Tompion clocks with pendulums 3.96 meters long and a peirod of four seonds in order to achieve much better accuracy. The last pendulum clocks to be used by observatories (1920s to 1940s) were <a href=\"/wiki/Shortt_clock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shortt clock\">Shortt clocks</a> which also had a seconds pendulum. \u2014 <a href=\"/wiki/User:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User:Joe Kress\">Joe Kress</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Joe_Kress\" title=\"User talk:Joe Kress\">talk</a>) 07:18, 28 May 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edit_by_JimWae\">Edit by JimWae</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Talk:Second&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Edit by JimWae\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Jim Wae made <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second&amp;curid=26873&amp;diff=496176253&amp;oldid=496117930\">an edit</a> which changed\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>This definition abandoned any explicit relationship between the scientific second and the length of a <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_day\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil day\">day</a>, as most people understand the term.</p></blockquote>\n<p>to\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are 31,556,925.9747 seconds in 365.24220 24-hour days.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The point of the existing version was a change in the nature of the definition. The definition had been based on mean solar time, which in practice was found by recording the time when stars crossed the observing plane of a <a href=\"/wiki/Meridian_circle\" title=\"Meridian circle\">meridian circle</a>, and converting the observed sidereal time to mean solar time according to an equation derived by <a href=\"/wiki/Simon_Newcomb\" title=\"Simon Newcomb\">Simon Newcomb</a>.

So it was measured by observing the position of the planets, and especially, the position of the Moon. The rotation of the Earth became irrelevant. However, this definition was not very practical; the calculation of the results meant that time, Ephemeris Time, was not available for months after the observations.

The meaning and definition of second as we know it, is an interval of clock time, 1/60 of a minute which is 1/60 of an hour, which is 1/24 of a day. It's about the time between resting heartbeats.

No, 11-3/4 days isn't any kind of week.  And listing powers of ten multiples of seconds is absolutely useless anyway. It's marginally useful or just interesting to list ordinary units of time in multiples of seconds, i.e., an hour is 3600 seconds, a day is 86,400 seconds, a year is 31.5 million seconds, a century is a little over 3 billion (3.15*10<sup>9</sup> seconds, and the age of the universe is about 434 trillion seconds.

In that sense, anyone writing and publicizing (expensive in those days) could define a second.  But definition and realization were different things: it'd require a clock that could keep time to the second for a month between recalibrations. Not only that, but a meaningful definition is one that is adopted by law, by practice, or realized by a scientific or metrologic body for use by others. France in the 18th century briefly flirted with decimal time adopted by law, for example. The experiment lasted less than three months.  I'd consider that a definition of units of time. There's no evidence I can find of seconds as part of a lunar cycle in popular timekeeping systems or devices.  I think this section should be moved to a footnote at best.

There was no effective way to time repeatable short events.  As noted, none of these old divisions of time was a predecessor of the modern second.

In particular, the other poster made some rather sweeping changes that seemed to have the effect of dethroning the SI definition of the second in favor of some general notion of \"clock time\", and then I thought some of the points were valid - in particular <a href=\"/wiki/User:Sbalfour\" title=\"User:Sbalfour\">User:Sbalfour</a> wanted to make it more accessible which is commendable, but at the same time it seemed to change the focus away from the SI which today forms the generally-accepted standard as to what \"a second\" is, and modern clocks are made based to tick SI seconds, since they are based on variously either synchronization to the atomic clock (which ticks such seconds or the best realization we have thereof), or a quartz oscillator calibrated to the SI definition (unless you have some sources explaining that the oscillators of modern clocks are commonly set to some other interval in which case you should present such here) within its range of accuracy. I then re-edited it to bring back the SI focus but without trying to compromise the new information brought in. In general I do think that some WP articles can get too technical, and I'd also like to try for a similar remake of articles like about the <a href=\"/wiki/Metre\" title=\"Metre\">metre</a>, for example, which does not give a lot of intuition for what exactly that distance is and while that may be a common thing to like 95% of the World population or so, there is some 5% at least who does not know it and is disproportionately concentrated in the Anglosphere to which this encyclopedia, being English, would be most primarily well-received in (although those from other nations who speak English due to its prominence as a second language can also avail themselves of it, of course.). I think it's pretty uncontroversial that the second <i>as a unit</i> is the SI base unit for time, <i>and</i> it's what almost all clocks manufactured now tick in. To me, saying the \"second is an interval of clock time\" is like saying a \"metre is the length of a metre stick\". That's true, but it's defining it by something which is based on how it is defined.\n</p><p>So I'd like to bring it here for discussion. To start that I left another <i>very minimal</i> revert edit limited to the <i>lead sentence only</i> restoring that it is the SI base unit of time and am offering to hear from <a href=\"/wiki/User:Sbalfour\" title=\"User:Sbalfour\">User:Sbalfour</a> his objections to this. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Mike4ty4\" title=\"User:Mike4ty4\">mike4ty4</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Mike4ty4\" title=\"User talk:Mike4ty4\">talk</a>) 09:04, 31 January 2018 (UTC)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>I gave the definition of second as stated in the lead to my nephew who has a degree in the sciences from a prominent university. He immediately asked \"What's the SI?\"  I asked him if he knew what SI stands for, and he stalled, then tentatively answered \"Silicon?\" Hmmmmm..... So I asked him what are base units? And he replied, \"base units of what?\" It wouldn't do any good to say \"the SI\", since he already doesn't know what that is. So I asked him how ordinary things are measured.  And he replied somewhat quizically, \"pounds, feet, inches, ounces,...\".  I also asked him about atomic clocks.  He pointed out that his swim meet timers were accurate to 1/1000 second and probably atomic clocks were more accurate, but weren't the pool timers pretty good? I carefully questioned him about what a second was, and about the rotation of the earth. He knew a day was 24 hours and an hour was 60 minutes and a minute 60 seconds.  He did the multiplication immediately and stated that a day was 86,400 seconds. I asked him if a day was EXACTLY 86,400 seconds and he seemed confused, as if I was asking him to check his math. He eventually stated that it was the definition of a day, i.e. 24 hours of 60 minutes, and etc.  I asked him about leap seconds, and he said they were like leap years and Feb.29.s and skipping leap years every 100 years, and etc. to fix clocks and calendars to agree with the sun and the earth. Hmmmmmmm.... I asked him how he knew his clock was setting the right time, and he replied, the internet tells the correct time.  And I asked him how the internet sets its time, and he replied after some thinking, Greenwich Mean time?  That's not a bad answer, actually.  Most Americans do not have a college degree. Most Americans do not have so much knowledge of time as my nephew.  Bank on it.  The time, and second they know is the clock on the wall.</dd>\n<dd>We need to be very careful what we think accessibility is.  We cannot use terms like SI and \"base unit\" in the opening sentence of an article about an every day object, like \"mouse\", \"baseball\" or \"second\".  Even if we expanded the cryptic \"SI\" to \"International System of Units\" (my nephew didn't know what those were, either), it's still useless. The 2nd paragraph states prominently that the second is the metric system unit of time.  The opening sentence is duplicative, and should say something else.  It says: <i>The second is the SI base unit of time, equal to 1/60th minute, which is 1/60th hour, which is 1/24th day</i>; that's NOT true: an SI second is NOT 1/86,400 of the day. The statement cannot remain. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Sbalfour\" title=\"User:Sbalfour\">Sbalfour</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Sbalfour\" title=\"User talk:Sbalfour\">talk</a>) 04:24, 2 February 2018 (UTC)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>I find that rather odd because it's common in all the sources I've used. On my desk I have Hill and Petrucci's <i>General Chemistry</i> and in the very first chapter on measurement units it mentions that the system used is called the International System of Units, or SI. I also have Kleppner and Kolenkow's <i>Introduction to Mechanics</i> and the name of the SI is mentioned there as well. And these aren't obscure sources but rather introductory-level texts; <i>Gen Chem</i> is fairly typical par for a University introductory course in its subject, K&amp;K is a bit more high-calibre text for physics aimed at a more mathematically well-prepared student or for a later course in the subject (was not used at my University, I got it myself for self studies, but is used at MIT.). That's about two hard science references that feature it and I know many more exist. Though I suppose of course some tidbits can escape one. However, for Wikipedia, the prevailing convention almost always seems to be to mention the system of units to which a unit belongs. The <a href=\"/wiki/Metre\" title=\"Metre\">metre</a> is called an SI unit in its article; why can't the second be called as such? On \"<a href=\"/wiki/Inch\" title=\"Inch\">Inch</a>\" it is said that \"The inch (abbreviation: in or \u2033) is a unit of length in the (British) imperial and United States customary systems of measurement ... \" I would wonder how many Americans know that the system of American units is called the \"United States customary system\", versus just \"you know, miles and all that stuff\". Someone reading that, if they did not know what the \"United States customary system\" was might not get that, or maybe now they'd know what it is. Regarding your other points, the sentence as it stands as of this writing was not the one I originally had because you had reverted those changes - the original one I put there said \"_notionally_ equal to...\", which is a key distinction. When reverting back I thought I'd start with the _minimum_ of reverted changes so as to avoid getting an edit war going and to test the waters. Given your concerns I nudged it forward now to hopefully make it more accurate, and also closer in spirit to what I had there originally. <a href=\"/wiki/User:Mike4ty4\" title=\"User:Mike4ty4\">mike4ty4</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Mike4ty4\" title=\"User talk:Mike4ty4\">talk</a>) 15:26, 3 February 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>Words like \"conceptually\", \"intuitively\", \"notionally\" and even \"historically\" are all waffle words.  The 'mouse' in my backyard isn't a 'conceptual mouse', and a baseball thrown out on the field isn't a 'conceptual baseball'.  The clock on my wall isn't a 'conceptual clock' and the second hand \"ticks\" seconds I can count.  I don't need to know anything about atomic clocks (2 mentions in the lead?) or SI seconds (also twice named in the lead) to set my watch. The way this is written wouldn't pass muster in a college composition.</dd>\n<dd>I'm sure if I asked my coach whether the timers we use tick SI seconds or clock seconds (i.e. 1/86,400 of a day) he'd be confounded.  The timer isn't actually a time-of-day clock, it just ticks seconds. So which are they?  We don't need to know - the timer isn't accurate enough to tell the difference, nor are most clocks.  My original text stated that the second is a unit of the metric system (i.e. SI) in the second paragraph.  It was covered. I did consult Encyclopedia Britannica, Webster's Third New International Dictionary and Oxford English Dictionary. Their brief definitions of second did not mention the SI or metric system in the opening sentence/paragraph. I'm in the United State; we don't use the metric system here, and we still have seconds.</dd>\n<dd>I do find your effort to reach a compromise exemplary, and I'm not going to enter into a conflict, i.e. an edit war, so we have to resolve the issue here.  <a href=\"/wiki/User:Sbalfour\" title=\"User:Sbalfour\">Sbalfour</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Sbalfour\" title=\"User talk:Sbalfour\">talk</a>) 19:02, 3 February 2018 (UTC)\n<dl><dd>Thank your for your kind words. I would like to say that I really do appreciate you trying to make the articles more readable and comprehensible - that is something that is sadly lacking in a great many articles on the WP especially about technical subjects (and while timekeeping and measurements are common, everyday items, they are nonetheless very technical at heart in how they are conceptualized, defined, understood, constructed and used.). Bravo, good sir, bravo. The only thing I see is that to me I don't think we necessarily have to compromise all the \"technical\" aspects if they are properly measured out. Regarding your other points, you say that a timer is not accurate enough to actually determine if it truly and exactly follows an SI second and for that I'd actually say no timekeeper in the world will _exactly_ follow one, not even the atomic clock itself, because they're all approximate and imperfect in their construction. They also don't follow \"1/86400 day\" seconds either for the same reason.  In like manner it's probably going to be that actual metre sticks are going to very \"significantly\" (when considering the standards of scientific work) from a true metre as defined by the SI's lightspeed definition, which itself differs from the earlier definitions. They could be made according to the Equator and North Pole definition too and you'd be none the wiser though I'd find that doubtful unless you can provide some evidence it's actually going on, viz. the same with clocks and timers. But an article should not be about any particular and imperfect artifact used to provide a usable realization of the unit in which case you'd need countless articles, but rather about the unit itself as it is understood as a concept, independent of any particular physical realization. You say there's no \"conceptual\" definition, that this is not a good word, okay, but then what would you suggest that is better? There needs to be a distinction between the way a common person relates to a second (as the fraction of a day) and its technical definition in the SI standard, while at the same time not negating either and moreover the understanding it <i>is</i> a standard unit. And furthermore the SI standard definition was designed to mimic the fraction-of-day one just as the metre definition was made to mimic earlier definitions perhaps (though there is some contest on this) ultimately going back to the original definition of John Wilkins, FRS and others that it should be based on the length of a pendulum that takes one second to do one swing in Earth gravity, and thus drive an escapement forward one second per tick - see here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0412078\">https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0412078</a>, a paper titled \"Why does the metre beat the second?\". Perhaps maybe \"<i>originally</i> defined and commonly understood as\" would work? I just did another change&#160;:) <a href=\"/wiki/User:Mike4ty4\" title=\"User:Mike4ty4\">mike4ty4</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/User_talk:Mike4ty4\" title=\"User talk:Mike4ty4\">talk</a>) 03:57, 4 February
