Every year, the European Union chooses to address a subject in order to encourage debate and dialogue within and between member states. Raising the awareness of European citizens to a specific problem.  Beginning in 1983, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have chosen an annual theme of action each year, based on a European Commission proposal. European Years are an awareness campaign to educate European citizens and attract the attention of national governments of Member States to a particular issue, in order to change attitudes and behaviours at both the national and European level.
