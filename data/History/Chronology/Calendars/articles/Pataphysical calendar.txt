The pataphysical calendar is a calendar that is inspired by Alfred Jarry, the creator of the 'pataphysics and the author of Ubu Roi. The first version of the calendar was published in L'Almanach du Père Ubu in 1889. The second version was released in 1901 in the L'Almanach illustré du Père Ubu. The calendar started to get used in the Collège de 'Pataphysique in 1948, after the death of Jarry. The calendar has 13 months with each 29 days. The 29th day however, is not used, except for 29 Gidouille (as an exception) and 29 Gueule in a leap year. The months always start on a Sunday, so that every month has a Friday the 13th. The names of the days are equal to the general calendar (the French names are mostly used), except for the 29th (the imaginary day), which name is Hunyadi. 29 Gueule is called Hunyadi gras (fat hunyadi). To make it not that hard for the reader, one places the vulgar (standard) date after the date. The year has the following months: The names are inspired by the exceptional terminology and neologisms in the work of Jarry. In his play, he wrote merdre instead of merde, which literally means poop - oneille instead of oreille, which means ear. The calendar era starts on 1 Absolu 1 EP (= Ère 'Pataphysique), the birth day of Alfred Jarry (September 8, 1873). The calendar has its own saints, like the holy Guillotine, medic (13 Décervelage = January 10), the holy Hieronymus Bosch (17 Clinamen = April 8) and the Childbirth of the holy Johanna Pausin (1 Merdre = May 18)
