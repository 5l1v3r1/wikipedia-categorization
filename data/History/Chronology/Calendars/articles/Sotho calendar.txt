  The Sesotho language has traditional names for the months of the familiar Gregorian calendar. The names reflect a deep connection that the Basotho people traditionally have with the natural world and the importance of agriculture. Although the month names are often not used by the general public (being considered part of "deep Sesotho"), they are regularly used in news broadcasts and other media and are more common than English imports. Additionally, the names of the seasons and the days of the week are regularly used by all speakers. The names of the months (likhoeli) indicate special natural and agricultural events which traditionally happened during the period. Being cattle breeders who lived in the semi-arid regions of Southern Africa, a deep understanding of agriculture and the natural world was essential for the survival of the Basotho people. The year begins roughly in the month of August, when the seeds are planted in anticipation of the next month's explosion of life.  Like many other sub-Saharan African societies who historically lived in tropical regions, Sesotho speaking people generally recognise only 2 seasons (dihla). However, names do exist for all four of the traditional Western European seasons. The year begins in approximately August or September, when the crops are planted. The concept of dividing the month into four 7-day weeks (libeke, from Afrikaans "week") is a recent European innovation. The week begins on Monday.
