Pre-industrial society refers to social attributes and forms of political and cultural organization that were prevalent before the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which occurred from 1750 to 1850. Pre-industrial is a time before there were machines and tools to help perform tasks en masse. Pre-industrial civilization dates back to centuries ago, but the main era known as the Pre-Industrial Society occurred right before the industrial society. Pre-Industrial societies vary from region to region depending on the culture of a given area or history of social and political life. Europe is known for its feudal system and Medieval era. Harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel â€“ child labour, dirty living conditions, and long working hours were equally as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.
