The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth &amp; Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine.  This machine separated the fibres into long \"Tops\" and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by <a href=\"/wiki/Prince-Smith_baronets\" title=\"Prince-Smith baronets\">Prince Smith and Stells</a> in 1959).  The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a <a href=\"/wiki/Sliver_(textiles)\" title=\"Sliver (textiles)\">sliver</a>. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. \nThe next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a <a href=\"/wiki/Bobbin\" title=\"Bobbin\">bobbin</a>. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for <a href=\"/wiki/Aran_sweater\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aran sweater\">Aran</a> yarn production, it is termed a <a href=\"/wiki/Roving\" title=\"Roving\">roving</a>, and is sent on to the <a href=\"/wiki/Spinning_frame\" title=\"Spinning frame\">spinning frame</a>. However, if the slubbing is for <a href=\"/wiki/Double_knitting\" title=\"Double knitting\">double knitting</a> yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_museum_today\">The museum today</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coldharbour_Mill_Working_Wool_Museum&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: The museum today\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The museum is owned and run by a not-for-profit charitable trust, Registered Charity No. 1123386.
