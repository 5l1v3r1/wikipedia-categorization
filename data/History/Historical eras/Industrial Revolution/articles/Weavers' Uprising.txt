Weavers' Uprising (German:Weberaufstand) refers to late medieval weavers' uprising from 1369 to 1371 or the Silesian Weavers' Uprising of 1844. In 1844, several thousand weavers smashed the newly-introduced machinery that had driven down their wages in Silesia. Thereafter, Prussian government repressed them with great brutality. This uprising attracted extensive attention among then German thinkers and writers such as Heine and Marx. Heine's well-known works, "The Silesian Weavers", premiered in Vorw√§rts!, depicted this uprising.
