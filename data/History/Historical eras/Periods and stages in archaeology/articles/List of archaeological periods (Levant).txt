The following is a refined listing of Levantive archeological periods, expanded from the basic three-age system with finer subdivisions and extension into the modern historical period.  The particular dates selected as the boundary between ages, as well as the period names for the historical era, are specific to Levantine archaeology and therefore are most accurate in that context.  Beginning and ending dates of prehistoric ages are based on the introduction and prevalence of certain technologies, which varied from culture to culture (note: "BP" = "Before Present"); similarly, historical eras are named after cultures in whose sphere of influence the Levant was included.  However, archaeologists studying other regions have sometimes found it useful to apply the same or similar eras to their fields of research (particularly prehistoric eras), and thus this list represents the most common interpretation of broad archaeological periods.
