There had already been smaller-scale immigration to Ireland as far back as the 12th century, which had resulted in a distinct ethnicity in Ireland known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Old_English_(Ireland)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Old English (Ireland)\">Old English</a>, or Hiberno-Normans. Unofficial plantations carried out privately by landlords also took place, such as those in County Antrim and County Down.\n</p><p>The 16th-century plantations were established through large areas of the country by the confiscation of lands occupied by <a href=\"/wiki/Gael\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gael\">Gaelic</a> clans and <a href=\"/wiki/Hiberno-Norman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hiberno-Norman\">Hiberno-Norman</a> dynasties, but principally in the <a href=\"/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland\" title=\"Provinces of Ireland\">provinces</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Munster\" title=\"Munster\">Munster</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Leinster\" title=\"Leinster\">Leinster</a>. The Crown granted these lands to colonists (\"planters\") from <a href=\"/wiki/Kingdom_of_England\" title=\"Kingdom of England\">England</a>.

It was accelerated under <a href=\"/wiki/James_I_of_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"James I of England\">James I</a>, when the <a href=\"/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster\" title=\"Plantation of Ulster\">Plantation of Ulster</a> took place on land escheated from those Gaelic chiefs who broke the terms of surrender and regrant,  <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_I_of_England\" title=\"Charles I of England\">Charles I</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell\" title=\"Oliver Cromwell\">Oliver Cromwell</a>; in their time, land was also granted to Scottish planters.\n</p><p>The early <a href=\"/wiki/Plantation_(settlement_or_colony)\" title=\"Plantation (settlement or colony)\">plantations</a> in the 16th century tended to be based on small \"exemplary\" colonies. The later plantations were based on mass confiscations of land from Irish landowners and the subsequent importation of numerous settlers and labourers from <a href=\"/wiki/England_and_Wales\" title=\"England and Wales\">England and Wales</a>, and later from Scotland.\n</p><p>The final government-planned plantations were established under the <a href=\"/wiki/English_Commonwealth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English Commonwealth\">English Commonwealth</a> and Cromwell's <a href=\"/wiki/The_Protectorate\" title=\"The Protectorate\">Protectorate</a> during the 1650s, when thousands of <a href=\"/wiki/Roundhead\" title=\"Roundhead\">Parliamentarian</a> soldiers were settled in Ireland.

The Crown government at Dublin intended to pacify and <a href=\"/wiki/Anglicise\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anglicise\">Anglicise</a> the country under English rule and incorporate the native ruling classes into the English <a href=\"/wiki/Aristocracy\" title=\"Aristocracy\">aristocracy</a>. The government intended to develop Ireland as a peaceful and reliable possession, without risk of rebellion or foreign invasion. Wherever the policy of <a href=\"/wiki/Surrender_and_regrant\" title=\"Surrender and regrant\">surrender and regrant</a> failed, land was confiscated and English plantations were established.\n</p><p>To this end, two forms of plantation were adopted in the second half of the 16th century. The first was the \"exemplary plantation\", in which small colonies of English would provide model farming communities that the Irish could emulate. One such colony was planted in the late 1560s, at <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kerrycurrihy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kerrycurrihy (page does not exist)\">Kerrycurrihy</a> near <a href=\"/wiki/Cork_(city)\" title=\"Cork (city)\">Cork city</a>, on land leased from the <a href=\"/wiki/Earl_of_Desmond\" title=\"Earl of Desmond\">Earl of Desmond</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The second form set the trend for future English policy in Ireland. It was punitive in nature, as it provided for the plantation of English settlers on lands confiscated following the suppression of rebellions. The first such scheme was the <b>Plantation of King's County</b> (now <a href=\"/wiki/Offaly\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Offaly\">Offaly</a>) and <b>Queen's County</b> (now <a href=\"/wiki/Laois\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Laois\">Laois</a>) in 1556, naming them after the new <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Catholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman Catholic\">Catholic</a> monarchs <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain\" title=\"Philip II of Spain\">Philip</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Mary_I_of_England\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Queen Mary I of England\">Mary</a> respectively.

An Act was passed \"whereby the King and Queen's Majesties, and the Heires and Successors of the Queen, be entituled to the Counties of Leix, Slewmarge, Irry, Glinmaliry, and Offaily, and for making the same Countries Shire Grounds.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The O'Moore and O'Connor clans, which occupied the area, had traditionally raided the English-ruled <a href=\"/wiki/The_Pale\" title=\"The Pale\">Pale</a> around <a href=\"/wiki/Dublin\" title=\"Dublin\">Dublin</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Deputy_of_Ireland\" title=\"Lord Deputy of Ireland\">Lord Deputy of Ireland</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Earl_of_Sussex\" title=\"Earl of Sussex\">Earl of Sussex</a>, ordered that they be dispossessed and replaced with an English settlement. However, the plantation was not a great success. The O'Moores and O'Connors retreated to the hills and <a href=\"/wiki/Bogs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bogs\">bogs</a> and fought a local insurgency against the settlement for much of the following 40 years. In 1578, the English finally subdued the displaced O'Moore clan by <a href=\"/wiki/Massacre_of_Mullaghmast\" title=\"Massacre of Mullaghmast\">massacring</a> most of their <i>fine</i> (or ruling families) at <a href=\"/wiki/Mullaghmast\" title=\"Mullaghmast\">Mullaghmast</a> in Laois, having invited them there for peace talks. <a href=\"/wiki/Rory_O%27More\" title=\"Rory O&#39;More\">Rory Oge O'More</a>, the leader of rebellion in the area, was hunted down and killed later that year.

It was instituted as punishment for the <a href=\"/wiki/Desmond_Rebellions\" title=\"Desmond Rebellions\">Desmond Rebellions</a>, when the <a href=\"/wiki/FitzGerald_dynasty\" title=\"FitzGerald dynasty\">Geraldine</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Earl_of_Desmond\" title=\"Earl of Desmond\">Earl of Desmond</a> had rebelled against English interference in <a href=\"/wiki/Munster\" title=\"Munster\">Munster</a>. The Desmond dynasty was annihilated in the aftermath of the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Desmond_Rebellion\" title=\"Second Desmond Rebellion\">Second Desmond Rebellion</a> (1579\u201383) and their estates were confiscated by the Crown. The English authorities took the opportunity to settle the province with colonists from England and Wales, who, it was hoped, would be a bulwark against further rebellions. In 1584, the <a href=\"/wiki/Surveyor_General\" title=\"Surveyor General\">Surveyor General</a> of Ireland, <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Valentine_Browne\" title=\"Sir Valentine Browne\">Sir Valentine Browne</a> and a commission surveyed Munster, to allocate confiscated lands to English <b>Undertakers</b> (wealthy colonists who \"undertook\" to import tenants from England to work their new lands). The English Undertakers were obligated to develop new towns and provide for the defence of planted districts from attack.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As well as the former Geraldine estates (spread through the modern counties of <a href=\"/wiki/County_Limerick\" title=\"County Limerick\">Limerick</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/County_Cork\" title=\"County Cork\">Cork</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/County_Kerry\" title=\"County Kerry\">Kerry</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/County_Tipperary\" title=\"County Tipperary\">Tipperary</a>), the survey took in the lands belonging to other families and clans that had supported the rebellions in Kerry and southwest Cork. However, the settlement here was rather piecemeal because the ruling clan \u2013 the <a href=\"/wiki/MacCarthy_M%C3%B3r\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MacCarthy M\u00f3r\">MacCarthy M\u00f3r</a> line \u2013 argued that the rebel landowners were their subordinates and that the lords actually owned the land. In this area, lands once granted to some English Undertakers was taken away again when native lords, such as the MacCarthys, appealed the dispossession of their dependants.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Other sectors of the plantation were equally chaotic. <a href=\"/wiki/John_Popham_(Lord_Chief_Justice)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"John Popham (Lord Chief Justice)\">John Popham</a> imported 70 tenants from <a href=\"/wiki/Somerset\" title=\"Somerset\">Somerset</a>, only to find that the land had already been settled by another undertaker, and he was obliged to send them home.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, 500,000 acres (202,343&#160;ha) were planted with English colonists. The Crown hoped that the settlement would attract in the region of 15,000 colonists, but a report from 1589 showed that the English Undertakers had imported only about 700 English tenants between them. Historians have noted that each tenant was the head of a household, and that he therefore likely represented at least 4\u20135 other people. This would put the English population in Munster at nearer to three or four thousand persons, but it was still substantially below the projected figure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Munster Plantation was supposed to develop compact defensible settlements, but the English settlers were spread in pockets across the province, wherever land had been confiscated. Initially the English Undertakers were given detachments of English soldiers to protect them, but these were abolished in the 1590s. As a result, when the <a href=\"/wiki/Nine_Years_War_(Ireland)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nine Years War (Ireland)\">Nine Years War</a> \u2014 an Irish rebellion against English rule \u2013 reached Munster in 1598, most of the settlers were chased off their lands without a fight.

So rather than settling the planters in isolated pockets of land confiscated from convicted rebels, they confiscated all of the land and redistributed it, creating concentrations of British settlers around new towns and garrisons. The new landowners were explicitly banned from taking on Irish tenants, and had to import their tenant farmers from England and Scotland. The remaining Irish landowners were granted one quarter of the land in Ulster.

The principal landowners were to be English <b>Undertakers</b>, wealthy men from England and Scotland who undertook to import tenants from their own estates. The planters were granted around 3,000 acres (1,214&#160;ha)  each, on condition that they settle there a minimum of 48 adult males (including at least 20 families), who had to be <a href=\"/wiki/English_language\" title=\"English language\">English-speaking</a> Protestants.

By the 1630s, there were 20,000 adult male English and Scottish settlers in Ulster, which meant that the total settler population could have been as high as 80,000 to 150,000.

This policy was used against the Kavanaghs in Wexford and subsequently elsewhere, to break up Catholic Irish estates (especially the Gaelic ones) around the country.

But, Charles' <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalier\" title=\"Cavalier\">Royalists</a> were defeated in the English Civil War by the <a href=\"/wiki/Roundhead\" title=\"Roundhead\">Parliamentarians</a>, who committed themselves to re-conquering Ireland and punishing those responsible for the rebellion of 1641. In 1649, Cromwell landed in Ireland with his New Model Army and by 1652, he had all but completed the conquest. The English Parliament published punitive terms of surrender for Catholics and Royalists in Ireland, which included the mass confiscation of all Catholic-owned land.\n</p><p>Cromwell held all Irish Catholics responsible for the rebellion of 1641 and said he would deal with them according to their \"respective de-merits\" \u2013 meaning sanctions varying from execution in worst cases, to partial land confiscation even for those who had taken no part in the wars. The <a href=\"/wiki/Long_Parliament\" title=\"Long Parliament\">Long Parliament</a> had been committed to mass confiscation of land in Ireland since 1642, when it passed the <a href=\"/wiki/Adventurers_Act\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Adventurers Act\">Adventurers Act</a>, which raised loans secured with the lands of Irish rebels' that it anticipated confiscating. The <a href=\"/wiki/Act_of_Settlement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Act of Settlement\">Act of Settlement</a> (1652) stated that anyone who had held arms against Parliament was to forfeit their lands. Those who did not would lose only three-quarters of their lands \u2013 and were compensated with other land, in <a href=\"/wiki/Connacht\" title=\"Connacht\">Connacht</a>. The policy was to promote an Irish Catholic Connacht and award the confiscated land to assorted European minor aristocracy and military colonists for their support against the lands' previous owners. In practice, those Protestants who had fought for the Royalists avoided confiscation by paying fines to the Commonwealth regime, but the Irish Catholic land-owning class was utterly destroyed. In some respects, what Cromwell had achieved was the logical conclusion of the plantation process.\n</p><p>The work was aided by the compilation of the Irish Civil Survey of 1654\u20135. The purpose of the survey was to secure information on the location, type, value and ownership of lands in the year 1641, before the outbreak of the <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1641\" title=\"Irish Rebellion of 1641\">Irish Rebellion of 1641</a>. Twenty-seven counties were surveyed and a survey produced for each. The <a href=\"/wiki/Down_Survey\" title=\"Down Survey\">Down Survey</a> of 1655\u20136 was a measured map survey, organised by Sir <a href=\"/wiki/William_Petty\" title=\"William Petty\">William Petty</a>, of the lands confiscated.\n</p><p>Over 12,000 veterans of the <a href=\"/wiki/New_Model_Army\" title=\"New Model Army\">New Model Army</a> were awarded land in Ireland in place of their wages due, which the <a href=\"/wiki/English_Commonwealth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English Commonwealth\">Commonwealth</a> was unable to pay. Many of these soldiers sold their land grants to other Protestants rather than settle in war-ravaged Ireland, but 7,500 fighters did settle in Ireland. They were required to keep their weapons to act as a reserve militia in case of future rebellions. Taken together with the <b>Merchant Adventurers</b>, probably over 10,000 Parliamentarians settled in Ireland after the civil wars. Most of these were single men, however, and many of them married Irish women (although banned by law from doing so). Some of the Cromwellian soldiers thus began to be integrated into Irish Catholic society. In addition to the Parliamentarians, thousands of Scottish <a href=\"/wiki/Covenanter\" title=\"Covenanter\">Covenanter</a> soldiers, who had been stationed in Ulster during the war, settled there permanently after its end.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Some Parliamentarians had argued that all the Irish should be deported to west of the <a href=\"/wiki/River_Shannon\" title=\"River Shannon\">Shannon</a> and replaced with English settlers. However, this would have required hundreds of thousands of English settlers willing to come to Ireland, and such numbers of aspirant settlers were never recruited. A land-owning class of British Protestants was created in Ireland, and they ruled over Irish Catholic tenants. A minority of the \"Cromwellian\" landowners were Parliamentarian soldiers or creditors. Most were pre-war Protestant settlers, who took the opportunity to obtain confiscated lands. Before the wars, Catholics had owned 60% of the land in Ireland. During the Commonwealth period, Catholic landownership fell to 8\u20139%.

During the 1680s and 90s, another major wave of settlement took place in Ireland (though not another plantation in terms of land confiscation). At this time, the new settlers were principally Scots, tens of thousands of whom fled a <a href=\"/wiki/Famine\" title=\"Famine\">famine</a> in the lowlands and border regions of <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland\" title=\"Scotland\">Scotland</a> to come to Ulster. At this point Protestants and people of Scottish descent (who were mainly <a href=\"/wiki/Presbyterian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Presbyterian\">Presbyterians</a>) became an absolute majority of the population in Ulster.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>French <a href=\"/wiki/Huguenots\" title=\"Huguenots\">Huguenots</a>, who were Protestant, were also encouraged to settle in Ireland; they had been expelled from France after the Crown's revocation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes\" title=\"Edict of Nantes\">Edict of Nantes</a> in 1685.

The large Protestant population in Ulster preferred to remain as part of the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland\" title=\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> as opposed to the rest of the country, where the Catholic majority favoured independence.

Consequently, following the <a href=\"/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty\" title=\"Anglo-Irish Treaty\">Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921</a>, these four counties \u2013 and two others in which they formed a sizeable minority near half the population \u2013 remained in the United Kingdom to form <a href=\"/wiki/Northern_Ireland\" title=\"Northern Ireland\">Northern Ireland</a>. This new state contained a sizeable Catholic minority, many of whom identified as descendants of those dispossessed in the Plantations. <a href=\"/wiki/The_Troubles\" title=\"The Troubles\">The Troubles</a> in Northern Ireland in some respects can be interpreted as a continuation of the conflict arising from the land confiscations and other injustices during the plantations period.\n</p><p>The Plantations also had a major cultural influence. Gaelic Irish culture was sidelined and English replaced Irish as the official language of power and business. Although by 1700 <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_language\" title=\"Irish language\">Irish</a> was still the majority language in Ireland, English was the dominant language for use in Parliament, the courts, and trade. In the next two centuries, the use of English advanced westwards across the country. After the decimation of society due to the <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_Potato_Famine_(1845-1849)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)\">Great Famine</a> of the 1840s, and the emigration of nearly two million people, the use of Irish collapsed in much of the territory.\n</p><p>Finally, the plantations and their related agricultural development radically altered Ireland's ecology and physical appearance.  In 1600, most of Ireland was heavily wooded, apart from the bogs. Most of the population lived in small townlands, many migrating seasonally to fresh pastures for their cattle. By 1700, Ireland's native woodland had been decimated; it was intensively exploited by the new settlers for commercial ventures such as shipbuilding, as much of the English forests had been destroyed and the navy was becoming a great power. Several native species, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Wolf\" title=\"Wolf\">wolf</a>, were hunted to extinction during this period. Most of the settler population was urbanized, living in permanent towns or villages. Some of the Irish peasantry continued their traditional practices. By the end of the plantation period, almost all of Ireland had become integrated into a <a href=\"/wiki/Market_economy\" title=\"Market economy\">market economy</a>.
