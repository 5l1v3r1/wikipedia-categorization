On 26 November 1642 the Committee for the Advance of Money for the Service of the Parliament was established  at Haberdashers Hall under Lord Howard of Escrick.  The committee was established by the Long Parliament under An Ordinance for the assessing of all such as have not contributed upon the Propositions of both Houses of Parliament for the raising of money, plate, horse and horsemen, etc From 1642 to 1650 the Committee investigated people's wealth and  obtained forced loans for the use of Parliament but repaid the money annually with interest.  Initially, funds were obtained from all parties but, from August 1646, only Royalists were forced to contribute and goods could be seized for non compliance.  Contributors included the Royalist Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester who was assessed in November 1645 at Â£3,000 and given a year to pay. Howard was later exposed for receiving bribes from Royalists.
