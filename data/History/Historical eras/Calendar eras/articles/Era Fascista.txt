The Era Fascista was a calendar used in Fascist Italy. The March on Rome, or more precisely the accession of Mussolini as prime minister on 29 October 1922, is day 1 of year I of the Era Fascista. The calendar was introduced in 1926 and became official in Year 5 (1927).   The Era Fascista calendar was inspired by the French Republican Calendar.   Era Fascista dates consisted of the Gregorian date appended by the corresponding Era Fascista year in Roman numerals, thus the date of Italy's declaration of war on Greece was written as "28 October 1940 - XIX". The Era Fascista year was sometimes written as "Anno XIX", "A. XIX", or marked "E.F.". ,  The calendar was intended to replace the "bourgeois" Gregorian calendar in Italian public life to the extent that, in 1939, newspapers were forbidden to write about New Year's Day.  The tenth anniversary of the March on Rome, Year X, was called the Decennale (evoking the ancient Roman Decennalia). The propaganda centerpiece of Year X was the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution.  The calendar was abandoned with the fall of Fascism in 1943 (Anno XXI), but many monuments in Italy still bear Era Fascista dates.
