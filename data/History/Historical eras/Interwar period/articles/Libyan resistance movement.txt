 Kingdom of Italy 40,000 -70,000 dead  (battles, deportation, starvation etc.).  The Libyan resistance movement was the name given to the Libyans side during the during the "Pacification of Libya." it occurred between 1923 and 1932, for more than twenty years. The Italian Empire seized the territory that is modern day Libya from the Ottoman Empire, and implemented a genocide campaign on its occupants, killing 20% of its population. The Italians committed many war crimes during the 'pacification,' including chemical warfare, not taking prisoners of war and instead, killing even if they surrendered, and many more horrendous acts. women were raped and disembowelled, libraries were burned, homes and religious institutes were bombed. The Libyans were fighting against the Italians' tanks and aerial warfare with guns. They were also pushed into concentration camps, an idea that would later be used by Hitler against the Jews, and ethical cleansing was also done. The Libyan resistance was initially led by Omar Mukhtar (Arabic عمر المختار ‘Umar Al-Mukhtār) (1862 – 16 September 1931), who was from the tribe of Mnifa, born in a small village called Janzour located in the eastern part of Barqa.  Later King Idris and his Senussi tribe in the provinces of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania started to become opposed to the Italian colonization after 1929, when Italy changed its political promises of moderate "protectorate" to the Senussi (done in 1911) and – because of Benito Mussolini – started to take complete colonial control of Libya. Resistance was totally crushed by General Rodolfo Graziani in the 1930s and the country was again controlled by the Italians with the help of Arab fascists, to the point that many Libyan colonial troops fought on the side of Italy between 1940 and 1943: two divisions of Libyan colonial troops were created in the late 1930s and 30,000 native Libyans fought for Italy during World War II.
