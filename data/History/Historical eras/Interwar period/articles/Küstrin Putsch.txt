The Küstrin Putsch, also known as the Buchrucker Putsch, was a reaction to the September 26, 1923 quelling of resistance by the German government to the occupation of the Ruhr region.  Led by Bruno Ernst Buchrucker, groups of the Black Reichswehr wanted to bring down the Reich government of Chancellor Gustav Stresemann and replace the parliamentarian-democratic Republic with a national dictatorship. Another motive for the putsch was the Reichswehr's decision to disband work details, causing many of their members to lose their livelihood.  The attempt to occupy Küstrin, a garrison city, was prevented by units of the Reichswehr. Buchrucker and other officers were arrested and sentenced for high treason to imprisonment in a fortress or prison. The bulk of the rebels were soon released and were not punished.  For a short time, the putsch controlled the citadel and Fort Hahneberg, but were then forced to surrender to the Reichswehr.
