Empire\">the British Empire</a> achieved the height of its power. Germany and Italy, which came into existence as unified nations in the second half of the 19th century, grew in power, challenging the traditional hegemony of <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland\" title=\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\">Britain</a> and France.  With nationalism in full force at this time, the European powers competed with each other for land, military strength and economic power. On the very first day of the century, January 1st 1901, the British colonies of <a href=\"/wiki/New_South_Wales\" title=\"New South Wales\">New South Wales</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tasmania\" title=\"Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Queensland\" title=\"Queensland\">Queensland</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/South_Australia\" title=\"South Australia\">South Australia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)\" title=\"Victoria (Australia)\">Victoria</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Australia\" title=\"Western Australia\">Western Australia</a>, federated to become the nation of <a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a>.\n</p><p>Asia and Africa were for the most part still under control of their European colonizers. The major exceptions were China and Japan.  The <a href=\"/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War\" title=\"Russo-Japanese War\">Russo-Japanese War</a> in 1904-1905 was the first major instance of a European power being defeated by a so-called inferior nation.  The war itself strengthened Japanese <a href=\"/wiki/Militarism\" title=\"Militarism\">militarism</a> and enhanced using economic backwardness, and contributed to the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Russian Revolution of 1905\">Russian Revolution of 1905</a>, the dress rehearsal for <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Russian Revolution of 1917\">the conclusive one in 1917</a>.\n</p><p>Already in the 19th century, the United States had become an influential actor in world politics. It had made its presence known on the world stage by challenging Spain in the <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War\" title=\"Spanish\u2013American War\">Spanish\u2013American War</a>, gaining the colonies of <a href=\"/wiki/Puerto_Rico\" title=\"Puerto Rico\">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Philippines\" title=\"Philippines\">Philippines</a> as <a href=\"/wiki/Protectorate\" title=\"Protectorate\">protectorates</a>. Now, with growth in immigration and a resolution of the national unity issue through the bloody <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">American Civil War</a>, America was emerging as an industrial power as well, rivaling Britain, Germany, and France.\n</p><p>With increasing rivalry among the European powers and the rise of Japan and the United States, the stage was set for a major upheaval in world affairs.\n</p><p>The Wright brothers invent the airplane in 1903.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"World_War_I\">World War I</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: World War I\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>From 1914 to 1918, the First World War, and its aftermath, caused major changes in the power balance of the world, destroying or transforming some of the most powerful empires.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\".22The_war_to_end_all_wars.22:_World_War_I_.281914.E2.80.931918.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"&quot;The_war_to_end_all_wars&quot;:_World_War_I_(1914\u20131918)\">\"The war to end all wars\": World War I (1914\u20131918)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;The war to end all wars&quot;: World War I (1914\u20131918)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I</a></div>\n<p>The First World War (or simply WWI), termed \"The Great War\" by contemporaries, started in 1914 and ended in 1918. It was ignited by the <a href=\"/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria\">Assassination in Sarajevo</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Austro-Hungarian Empire\">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>'s heir to the throne, Erzherzog <a href=\"/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria\" title=\"Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria\">Franz Ferdinand</a>, by <a href=\"/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip\" title=\"Gavrilo Princip\">Gavrilo Princip</a> of the organization \"<a href=\"/wiki/Young_Bosnia\" title=\"Young Bosnia\">Young Bosnia</a>,\" Bosnian Serbs' liberation movement. Bound by Slavic nationalism to help the small Serbian state, the Russians came to the aid of the Serbs when they were attacked.  Interwoven alliances, an increasing arms race, and old hatreds dragged Europe into the war. The Allies, known initially as \"The <a href=\"/wiki/Triple_Entente\" title=\"Triple Entente\">Triple Entente</a>\", comprised the British Empire, France and Russia. Germany, <a href=\"/wiki/Austria-Hungary\" title=\"Austria-Hungary\">Austria-Hungary</a>, Italy, <a href=\"/wiki/Bulgaria\" title=\"Bulgaria\">Bulgaria</a>, and later the <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\" title=\"Ottoman Empire\">Ottoman Empire</a>, were known as \"The <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Powers\" title=\"Central Powers\">Central Powers</a>\".\n</p><p>In 1917, Russia ended hostile actions against the Central Powers after the fall of the Tsar. The Bolsheviks negotiated the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk\" title=\"Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> with Germany, although it was at huge cost to Russia.  In the treaty, Bolshevik Russia ceded the <a href=\"/wiki/Baltic_States\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Baltic States\">Baltic States</a> to Germany, and its province of <a href=\"/wiki/Kars_Oblast\" title=\"Kars Oblast\">Kars Oblast</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/South_Caucasus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"South Caucasus\">south Caucasus</a> to the <a href=\"/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\" title=\"Ottoman Empire\">Ottoman Empire</a>. It also recognized the independence of <a href=\"/wiki/Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic\" title=\"Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic\">Ukraine</a>. Although Germany shifted huge forces from the eastern to the western front after signing the treaty, it was unable to stop the Allied advance, especially with the entrance of American troops in 1918.\n</p><p>The war itself was also a chance for the combatant nations to show off their military strength and technological ingenuity. The Germans introduced the machine gun, <a href=\"/wiki/U-Boats\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U-Boats\">U-Boats</a> and deadly gases. The British first used the <a href=\"/wiki/Tank\" title=\"Tank\">tank</a>. Both sides had a chance to test out their new aircraft to see if they could be used in warfare. It was widely believed that the war would be short. Unfortunately, since <a href=\"/wiki/Trench_warfare\" title=\"Trench warfare\">trench warfare</a> was the best form of defense, advances on both sides were very slow, and came at a terrible cost in lives.\n</p><p>When the war was finally over in 1918, the results would set the stage for the next twenty years. First and foremost, the Germans were forced to sign the <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles\" title=\"Treaty of Versailles\">Treaty of Versailles</a>, forcing them to make exorbitant payments to repair damages caused during the War. Many Germans felt these reparations were unfair because they did not actually \"lose\" the war nor did they feel they caused the war (see <a href=\"/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_legend\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stab-in-the-back legend\">Stab-in-the-back legend</a>). Germany was never occupied by Allied troops, yet it had to accept a liberal democratic government imposed on it by the victors after the abdication of <a href=\"/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor\" title=\"Wilhelm II, German Emperor\">Kaiser Wilhelm</a>.\n</p><p>Much of the map of Europe was redrawn by the victors based upon the theory that future wars could be prevented if all ethnic groups had their own \"homeland\".  New states like <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslavia\" title=\"Yugoslavia\">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Czechoslovakia\" title=\"Czechoslovakia\">Czechoslovakia</a> were created out of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire to accommodate the nationalist aspirations of these groups.  An international body called the <a href=\"/wiki/League_of_Nations\" title=\"League of Nations\">League of Nations</a> was formed to mediate disputes and prevent future wars, although its effectiveness was severely limited by, among other things, its reluctance and inability to act.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Russian_Revolution_and_Communism\">The Russian Revolution and Communism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The Russian Revolution and Communism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Russian Revolution of 1917\">Russian Revolution of 1917</a></div>\n<p>The Russian Revolution of 1917 (ending in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the brutal execution of His Imperial Majesty <a href=\"/wiki/Nicholas_II\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nicholas II\">Nicholas II</a> and his family) sparked a wave of <a href=\"/wiki/Communist_revolution\" title=\"Communist revolution\">communist revolutions</a> across Europe, prompting many to believe that a socialist <a href=\"/wiki/World_revolution\" title=\"World revolution\">world revolution</a> could be realized in the near future. However, the European revolutions were defeated, <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin\" title=\"Vladimir Lenin\">Vladimir Lenin</a> died in 1924, and within a few years, <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a> displaced <a href=\"/wiki/Leon_Trotsky\" title=\"Leon Trotsky\">Leon Trotsky</a> as the <i>de facto</i> leader of the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>. The idea of worldwide revolution was no longer in the forefront, as Stalin concentrated on \"<a href=\"/wiki/Socialism_in_one_country\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Socialism in one country\">socialism in one country</a>\" and embarked on a bold plan of collectivization and industrialization. The majority of socialists and even many communists became disillusioned with Stalin's autocratic rule, his purges and the assassination of his \"enemies\", as well as the news of <a href=\"/wiki/Famine\" title=\"Famine\">famines</a> he imposed on his own people.\n</p><p>Communism was strengthened as a force in Western democracies when the global economy crashed in 1929 in what became known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">Great Depression</a>. Many people saw this as the first stage of the end of the capitalist system and were attracted to Communism as a solution to the economic crisis, especially as the Soviet Union's economic development in the 1930s was strong, unaffected by the capitalist world's crisis.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Between_the_wars\">Between the wars</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Between the wars\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Interwar_period\" title=\"Interwar period\">Interwar period</a></div>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Economic_depression\">Economic depression</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Economic depression\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">Great Depression</a></div> \n<p>After World War I, the global economy remained strong through the 1920s.  The war had provided a stimulus for industry and for economic activity in general.  There were many warning signs foretelling the <a href=\"/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929\" title=\"Wall Street Crash of 1929\">collapse</a> of the global <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_system\" title=\"Economic system\">economic system</a> in 1929 that were generally not understood by the political leadership of the time.  The responses to the crisis often made the situation worse, as millions of people watched their savings become next to worthless and the idea of a steady job with a reasonable income fading away.\n</p><p>Many sought answers in alternative ideologies such as communism and fascism. They believed that the capitalist economic system was collapsing, and that new ideas were required to meet the crisis. The early responses to the crisis were based upon the assumption that the free market would correct itself.  This, however, did very little to correct the crisis or to alleviate the suffering of many ordinary people. Thus, the idea that the existing system could be reformed by government intervention in the economy, rather than by continuing the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Laissez-faire\" title=\"Laissez-faire\">laissez-faire</a></i> approach, became prominent as a solution to the crisis. Democratic governments assumed the responsibility to provide needed services in society, and to alleviate poverty.  Thus was born the <a href=\"/wiki/Welfare_state\" title=\"Welfare state\">welfare state</a>. These two politico-economic principles, the belief in government intervention and the welfare state, as opposed to the belief in the free market and private institutions, would define many political battles for the rest of the century.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_rise_of_dictatorship\">The rise of dictatorship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: The rise of dictatorship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main articles: <a href=\"/wiki/Fascism\" title=\"Fascism\">Fascism</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Totalitarianism\" title=\"Totalitarianism\">Totalitarianism</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Dictatorship\" title=\"Dictatorship\">Dictatorship</a></div>\n<p>Fascism first appeared in Italy with the rise to power of <a href=\"/wiki/Benito_Mussolini\" title=\"Benito Mussolini\">Benito Mussolini</a> in 1922.  The ideology was supported by a large proportion of the upper classes as a strong challenge to the threat of communism.\n</p><p>When <a href=\"/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\" title=\"Adolf Hitler\">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power in Germany in 1933, a new variant of fascism called <a href=\"/wiki/Nazism\" title=\"Nazism\">Nazism</a> took over Germany and ended the German experiment with democracy. The <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi_Party\" title=\"Nazi Party\">Nazi Party</a> in Germany was dedicated to the restoration of German honor and prestige, the unification of German-speaking peoples, and the annexation of Central and Eastern Europe as vassal states, with the <a href=\"/wiki/Slavic_peoples\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slavic peoples\">Slavic</a> population to act as slave labor to serve German economic interests.  There was also a strong appeal to a mythical racial purity (the idea that Germans were the <i>Herrenvolk</i> or the \"master race\"), and a vicious <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-semitism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anti-semitism\">anti-semitism</a> which promoted the idea of Jews as subhuman (<i>Untermensch</i>) and worthy only of extermination.\n</p><p>Many people in Western Europe and the United States greeted the rise of Hitler with relief or indifference.  They could see nothing wrong with a strong Germany ready to take on the communist menace to the east. Anti-semitism during the <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">Great Depression</a> was widespread as many were content to blame the Jews for causing the economic downturn.\n</p><p>Hitler began to put his plan in motion, annexing Austria in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Anschluss\" title=\"Anschluss\">Anschluss</a></i>, or reunification of Austria to Germany, in 1938.  He then negotiated the annexation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sudetenland\" title=\"Sudetenland\">Sudetenland</a>, a German-speaking mountainous area of <a href=\"/wiki/Czechoslovakia\" title=\"Czechoslovakia\">Czechoslovakia</a>, in the <a href=\"/wiki/Munich_Conference\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Munich Conference\">Munich Conference</a>.  The British were eager to avoid war and believed Hitler's assurance to protect the security of the Czech state.  Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech state shortly afterwards, indicating that he had ulterior motives.\n</p><p>Fascism was not the only form of dictatorship to rise in the post-war period.  Almost all of the new democracies in the nations of Eastern Europe collapsed and were replaced by <a href=\"/wiki/Authoritarian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Authoritarian\">authoritarian</a> regimes.

Totalitarian states attempted to achieve total control over their subjects as well as their total loyalty.

See main article for a fuller discussion.</i>\n</p><p>Soon after the events in Czechoslovakia, Britain and France issued assurances of protection to Poland, which seemed to be next on Hitler's list.  World War II officially began on September 1, 1939.  On that date, Hitler unleashed his <a href=\"/wiki/Blitzkrieg\" title=\"Blitzkrieg\">Blitzkrieg</a>, or lightning war, against Poland.  Britain and France, much to Hitler's surprise, immediately declared war upon Germany, but the help they delivered to Poland was negligible. At the same time, Poland was attacked from the East by Soviet Union, acting in a secret alliance with Nazi Germany. After only a few weeks, the Polish forces were overwhelmed, and its government fled to exile in London (see <a href=\"/wiki/Polish_government_in_Exile\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polish government in Exile\">Polish government in Exile</a>).\n</p><p>In starting World War II, the Germans had unleashed a new type of warfare, characterized by highly mobile forces and the use of massed aircraft.  The German strategy concentrated upon the devotion of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wehrmacht\" title=\"Wehrmacht\">Wehrmacht</a></i>, or German army, to the use of tank groups, called <a href=\"/wiki/Panzer\" title=\"Panzer\">panzer</a> divisions, and groups of mobile infantry, in concert with relentless attacks from the air.  Encirclement was also a major part of the strategy.  This change smashed any expectations that the Second World War would be fought in the trenches like the first.\n</p><p>As Hitler's forces conquered Poland, the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>, under General Secretary <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a>, was acting out guarantees of territory under a secret part of a <a href=\"/wiki/Nonaggression_pact\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nonaggression pact\">nonaggression pact</a> between the USSR and Germany known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi-Soviet_Pact\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nazi-Soviet Pact\">Nazi-Soviet Pact</a>.  This treaty gave Stalin free rein to take the Baltic republics of <a href=\"/wiki/Estonia\" title=\"Estonia\">Estonia</a>, Latvia, and <a href=\"/wiki/Lithuania\" title=\"Lithuania\">Lithuania</a>, as well as Eastern Poland, all of which would remain in Soviet possession after the war.  Stalin also launched an attack on Finland, which he hoped to reduce to little more than a Soviet puppet state, but the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Army\" title=\"Red Army\">Red Army</a> met staunch Finnish resistance in what became known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Winter_War\" title=\"Winter War\">Winter War</a> and succeeded in gaining only limited territory from the Finns.  This action would later cause the Finns to ally with Germany when its attack on the Soviet Union came in 1941.\n</p><p>After the defeat of Poland, a period known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Phony_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Phony War\">Phony War</a> ensued during the winter of 1939\u20131940.  All of this changed on May 10, 1940, when the Germans launched a massive attack on the <a href=\"/wiki/Low_Countries\" title=\"Low Countries\">Low Countries</a> (Belgium, the Netherlands, and <a href=\"/wiki/Luxembourg\" title=\"Luxembourg\">Luxembourg</a>), most probably to surmount the <a href=\"/wiki/Maginot_Line\" title=\"Maginot Line\">Maginot Line</a> of defenses on the Franco-German border.  This witnessed the incredible fall of <a href=\"/wiki/Eben_Emael\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eben Emael\">Eben Emael</a>, a Belgian fort considered impregnable and guarded by 600 Belgians, to a force of only 88 German <a href=\"/wiki/Paratrooper\" title=\"Paratrooper\">paratroopers</a>.  The worst of this was that King <a href=\"/wiki/L%C3%A9opold_III_of_Belgium\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"L\u00e9opold III of Belgium\">L\u00e9opold III of Belgium</a> surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.  Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940.  Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish <a href=\"/wiki/Ore\" title=\"Ore\">ore</a> to the Nazi war machine.  Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered after only four days.\n</p><p>With the disaster in the Low Countries, France, considered at the time to have had the finest army in the world, lasted only four weeks, with Paris being occupied on June 14.  Three days later, Marshal <a href=\"/wiki/Philippe_P%C3%A9tain\" title=\"Philippe P\u00e9tain\">Philippe P\u00e9tain</a> surrendered to the Germans.  The debacle in France also led to one of the war's greatest mysteries, and Hitler's first great blunder, <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk\" title=\"Battle of Dunkirk\">Dunkirk</a>, where a third of a million trapped British and French soldiers were evacuated by not only British war boats, but every boat the army could find, including fishing rafts.  Hitler refused to \"risk\" his panzers on an action at Dunkirk, listening to the advice of Air Minister <a href=\"/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring\" title=\"Hermann G\u00f6ring\">Hermann G\u00f6ring</a> and allowing the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Luftwaffe\" title=\"Luftwaffe\">Luftwaffe</a></i>, or German Air Force, to handle the job.  The irony of this was that the escaped men would form the core of the army that was to invade the beaches of <a href=\"/wiki/Normandy\" title=\"Normandy\">Normandy</a> in 1944.  Hitler did not occupy all of France, but about three-quarters, including all of the Atlantic coast, allowing Marshal P\u00e9tain to remain as dictator of an area known as <a href=\"/wiki/Vichy_France\" title=\"Vichy France\">Vichy France</a>.  However, members of the escaped French Army formed around General <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle\" title=\"Charles de Gaulle\">Charles de Gaulle</a> to create the <a href=\"/wiki/Free_French\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free French\">Free French</a> forces, which would continue to battle Hitler in the stead of an independent France.  At this moment, Italy, under <a href=\"/wiki/Benito_Mussolini\" title=\"Benito Mussolini\">Benito Mussolini</a>, declared war on the Allies on June 10, thinking that the war was almost over, but he managed only to occupy a few hundred yards of French territory.  Throughout the war, the Italians would be more of a burden to the Nazis than a boon, and would later cost them precious time in Greece.\n</p><p>Hitler now turned his eyes on Great Britain, which stood alone against him.  He ordered his generals to draw up plans for an invasion, code named <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion\" title=\"Operation Sea Lion\">Operation Sea Lion</a>, and ordered the Luftwaffe to launch a massive air war against the British isles, which would come to be known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Britain\" title=\"Battle of Britain\">Battle of Britain</a>.  The British at first suffered steady losses, but eventually managed to turn the air war against Germany, taking down 2,698 German planes throughout the summer of 1940 to only 915 <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Air_Force\" title=\"Royal Air Force\">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) losses.  The key turning point came when the Germans discontinued successful attacks against British airplane factories and radar command and coordination stations and turned to civilian bombing known as <a href=\"/wiki/Terror_bombing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Terror bombing\">terror bombing</a> using the distinctive \"bomb\" sound created by the German dive-bomber, the <a href=\"/wiki/Stuka\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stuka\">Stuka</a>.  The switch came after a small British bombing force had attacked Berlin.  Hitler was infuriated.  However, his decision to switch the attacks' focus allowed the British to rebuild the RAF and eventually force the Germans to indefinitely postpone Sea Lion.\n</p><p>The importance of the Battle of Britain is that it marked the first of Hitler's defeats, however its overall impact was overshadowed by his later blunders in the east.  Secondly, it marked the advent of <a href=\"/wiki/Radar\" title=\"Radar\">radar</a> as a major weapon in modern air war.  With radar, squadrons of fighters could be quickly assembled to respond to incoming bombers attempting to bomb civilian targets.  It also allowed the identification of the type and a guess at the number of incoming enemy aircraft, as well as tracking of friendly airplanes.\n</p><p>Hitler, taken aback by his defeat over the skies of Britain, now turned his gaze eastward to the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>.  Despite having signed the non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler despised communism and wished to destroy it in the land of its birth.  He originally planned to launch the attack in early spring of 1941 to avoid the disastrous Russian winter.  However, a pro-allied coup in <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslavia\" title=\"Yugoslavia\">Yugoslavia</a> and Mussolini's almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupied <a href=\"/wiki/Albania\" title=\"Albania\">Albania</a> prompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time.  The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts; the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the USSR.\n</p><p>On June 22, 1941, Hitler attacked Stalin with the largest army the world had ever seen.  Over three million men and their weapons were put into service against the Soviet Union.  Stalin had been warned about the attack, both by other countries and by his own intelligence network, but he had refused to believe it.  Therefore, the Soviet army was largely unprepared and suffered incredible setbacks in the early part of the war, despite Stalin's orders to counterattack the Germans.  Throughout 1941, German forces, divided into 3 army groups (Army Group A, Army Group B, and Army Group C), occupied the territories of the present day <a href=\"/wiki/Ukraine\" title=\"Ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Belarus\" title=\"Belarus\">Belarus</a>, laid siege to <a href=\"/wiki/Saint_Petersburg\" title=\"Saint Petersburg\">Leningrad</a> (present day Saint Petersburg), and advanced to within 15 miles of Moscow.  At this critical moment, the Soviet people stalled the German <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wehrmacht\" title=\"Wehrmacht\">Wehrmacht</a></i> to a halt at the gates of Moscow.  Stalin had planned to evacuate the city, and had already moved important government functions, but decided to stay and rally the city.  Recently arrived troops from the east under the command of Marshal <a href=\"/wiki/Georgi_Zhukov\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Georgi Zhukov\">Georgi Zhukov</a> counterattacked the Germans and drove them from Moscow.\n</p><p>Here marks the third great blunder of Hitler's.  He could have won the war in the USSR except for a few reasons.  One, he tried to capture too much too fast; he wanted the German army to advance all the way to the <a href=\"/wiki/Urals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Urals\">Urals</a>, which amounted to one million square miles (2,600,000&#160;km\u00b2) of territory, when he probably should have concentrated on taking Moscow and thereby driving a wedge into heart of the Soviet Union.  Second, he ignored the similar experiences of <a href=\"/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Napoleon Bonaparte\">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> nearly one hundred and fifty years earlier in his attempt to conquer Russia.  Despite this, Stalin was not in a good position.  Roughly two-fifths of the USSR's industrial might was in German hands.  Also, the Germans were at first seen by many as liberators fighting the communists.  Stalin was also not a very able general, and like Hitler, at first tried to fight the war as a military strategist.  However, Hitler managed to turn all of his advantages against himself, and lost the only remaining hope for Germany: seizing the <a href=\"/wiki/Caucasus\" title=\"Caucasus\">Caucasus</a> and taking control of North Africa and the <a href=\"/wiki/Petroleum\" title=\"Petroleum\">oil</a>-rich Middle East.\n</p><p>Mussolini had launched an offensive in North Africa from Italian-controlled <a href=\"/wiki/Libya\" title=\"Libya\">Libya</a> into British-controlled Egypt.  However, the British smashed the Italians and were on the verge of taking Libya.  Hitler decided to help by sending in a few thousand troops, a <i>Luftwaffe</i> division, and the first-rate general <a href=\"/wiki/Erwin_Rommel\" title=\"Erwin Rommel\">Erwin Rommel</a>.  Rommel managed to use his small force to repeatedly smash massively superior British forces and to recapture the port city of <a href=\"/wiki/Tobruk\" title=\"Tobruk\">Tobruk</a> and advance into <a href=\"/wiki/Egypt\" title=\"Egypt\">Egypt</a>.  However, Hitler, embroiled in his invasion of the Soviet Union, refused to send Rommel any more troops.  If he had, Rommel might have been able to seize the Middle East, where Axis-friendly regimes had taken root in <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq\" title=\"Iraq\">Iraq</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Iran\" title=\"Iran\">Persia</a> (present-day <a href=\"/wiki/Iran\" title=\"Iran\">Iran</a>).  Here, Rommel could have cut the major supply route of the Soviets through Persia, and helped take the Caucasus, virtually neutralizing Britain's effectiveness in the war and potentially sealing the fate of the Soviet Union.  However, Hitler blundered again, throwing away the last vestiges of the German advantage on his coming offensive in 1942.\n</p><p>After the winter, Hitler launched a fresh offensive in the spring of 1942, with the aim of capturing the oil-rich Caucacus and the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Stalingrad\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stalingrad\">Stalingrad</a>.  However, he repeatedly switched his troops to where they were not needed.  The offensive bogged down, and the entire <a href=\"/wiki/6th_Army_(Wehrmacht)\" title=\"6th Army (Wehrmacht)\">6th Army</a>, considered the best of German troops, was trapped in Stalingrad.  Hitler now refused to let 6th Army break out.  He insisted that the German army would force its way in.  Hermann G\u00f6ring also assured Hitler that the <i>Luftwaffe</i> could supply the 6th Army adequately, when it could in reality only supply a minute fraction of the needed <a href=\"/wiki/Ammunition\" title=\"Ammunition\">ammunition</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Ration\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ration\">rations</a>.  Eventually, the starved 6th Army surrendered, dealing a severe blow to the Germans.  In the end, the defeat at Stalingrad was the turning point for the war in the east.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, the Japanese had attacked the United States at <a href=\"/wiki/Pearl_Harbor\" title=\"Pearl Harbor\">Pearl Harbor</a> in Hawaii on December 7, 1941.  This disastrous attack forced the Americans into the war.  Hitler need not have declared war on the United States, and kept its continued neutrality in Europe, but he did not.  Both he and Mussolini declared war only a few days after the attack.  At the time, most German generals, preoccupied with war in the USSR, did not even notice America's entrance.  It was to be a crucial blunder.\n</p><p>Throughout the rest of 1942 and 1943, the Soviets began to gain ground against the Germans.  The tank battle of <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk\" title=\"Battle of Kursk\">Kursk</a> is one example.  However, by this time, Rommel had been forced to abandon North Africa after a defeat by <a href=\"/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery\" title=\"Bernard Montgomery\">Montgomery</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/El_Alamein\" title=\"El Alamein\">El Alamein</a>, and the <i>Wehrmacht</i> had encountered serious casualties that it could not replace.  Hitler also insisted on a \"hold at all costs\" policy which forbade relinquishing any ground.  He followed a \"fight to the last man\" policy that was completely ineffective.  By the beginning of 1944, Hitler had lost all initiative in the Soviet Union, and was struggling even to hold back the tide turning against him.\n</p><p>From 1942 to 1944, the United States and Britain acted in only a limited manner in the European theater, much to the chagrin of Stalin.  They drove out the Germans in Africa, invading <a href=\"/wiki/Morocco\" title=\"Morocco\">Morocco</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Algeria\" title=\"Algeria\">Algeria</a> on November 8, 1942.  Then, on July 10, 1943, the Allies invaded <a href=\"/wiki/Sicily\" title=\"Sicily\">Sicily</a>, in preparation for an advance through Italy, the \"soft underbelly\" of the Axis, as <a href=\"/wiki/Winston_Churchill\" title=\"Winston Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a> called it.  On September 9, the invasion of Italy began.  By the winter of 1943, the southern half of Italy was in Allied hands.  The Italians, most of whom did not really support the war, had already turned against Mussolini.  In July, he had been stripped of power and taken prisoner, though the Italians feigned continued support of the Axis.  On September 8, the Italians formally surrendered, but most of Italy not in Allied hands was controlled by German troops and those loyal to Mussolini's (Mussolini had been freed by German paratroopers) new <a href=\"/wiki/Italian_Social_Republic\" title=\"Italian Social Republic\">Italian Social Republic</a>, which in reality consisted of the shrinking zone of German control.  The Germans offered staunch resistance, but by June 4, 1944, Rome had fallen.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic\" title=\"Battle of the Atlantic\">Battle of the Atlantic</a> took place from 1942 to 1944.  The Germans hoped to sever the vital supply lines between Britain and America, sinking many tons of shipping with <a href=\"/wiki/U-boats\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U-boats\">U-boats</a>, German submarines.  However, the development of the <a href=\"/wiki/Destroyer\" title=\"Destroyer\">destroyer</a> and aircraft with a longer patrol range were effective at countering the U-boat threat. By 1944, the Germans had lost the battle.\n</p><p>On June 6, 1944, the Western Allies finally launched the long-awaited assault on \"Fortress Europe\" so wanted by Stalin.  The offensive, codenamed <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Overlord\" title=\"Operation Overlord\">Operation Overlord</a>, began the early morning hours of June 6.  The day, known as <a href=\"/wiki/D-day\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"D-day\">D-day</a>, was marked by foul weather.  Rommel, who was now in charge of defending France against possible Allied attack, thought the Allies would not attack during the stormy weather, and was on holiday in Germany.  Besides this, the Germans were expecting an attack, but at the natural harbor of <a href=\"/wiki/Calais\" title=\"Calais\">Calais</a> and not the beaches of <a href=\"/wiki/Normandy\" title=\"Normandy\">Normandy</a>; a blunder that sealed the operation's success.  They did not know about the Allies' <a href=\"/wiki/Mulberry_Harbour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mulberry Harbour\">artificial harbours</a>, and clues planted by the Allies suggested Calais as the landing site.\n</p><p>By this time, the war was looking ever darker for Germany.  On July 20, 1944, a group of conspiring German officers attempted to assassinate Hitler.  The bomb they used did injure him, but the second was not used, and a table shielded Hitler in a stroke of luck.  The plotters still could have launched a coup, but only the head of occupied Paris acted, arresting <a href=\"/wiki/SS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SS\">SS</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Gestapo\" title=\"Gestapo\">Gestapo</a> forces in the city.  The German propaganda minister, <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels\" title=\"Joseph Goebbels\">Joseph Goebbels</a>, rallied the Nazis, and saved the day for Hitler.\n</p><p>In France, the Allies took Normandy and finally Paris on August 25.  In the east, the Soviets had advanced almost to the former Polish-Soviet border.  At this time, Hitler introduced the <a href=\"/wiki/V-weapons\" title=\"V-weapons\">V-weapons</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/V-1_flying_bomb\" title=\"V-1 flying bomb\">V-1 flying bomb</a> and, later, the <a href=\"/wiki/V-2\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"V-2\">V-2</a>, the first rockets used in modern warfare.  The V-1 was often intercepted by air pilots, but the V-2 was extremely fast and carried a large payload.  However, this advance came too late in the war to have any real effect.  The Germans were also on the verge of introducing a number of terrifying new weapons, including advanced jet aircraft, which were too fast for ordinary propeller aircraft, and submarine improvements which would allow the Germans to again fight effectively in the Atlantic.  All this came too late to save Hitler.  Although a September invasion of The Netherlands failed, the Allies made steady advances.  In the winter of 1944, Hitler put everything into one last desperate gamble in the West, known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge\" title=\"Battle of the Bulge\">Battle of the Bulge</a>, which, despite an initial advance, was a failure, because the introduction of new Allied tanks and low troop numbers among the Germans prevented any real action being taken.\n</p><p>In early February 1945, the three Allied leaders, <a href=\"/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt\">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Winston_Churchill\" title=\"Winston Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a>, met at newly liberated <a href=\"/wiki/Yalta\" title=\"Yalta\">Yalta</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Crimean_Peninsula\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crimean Peninsula\">Crimea</a> in the Soviet Union in the <a href=\"/wiki/Yalta_Conference\" title=\"Yalta Conference\">Yalta Conference</a>.  Here, they agreed upon a plan to divide post-war Europe.  Most of the east went to Stalin, who agreed to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, which he never did.  The west went to Britain, France, and the U.S.  Post-war Germany would be split between the four, as would Berlin.  Here the territory of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cold_War\" title=\"Cold War\">Cold War</a> was set.  The boundaries of a new Europe, stripped of some of its oldest ruling families, were drawn up by the three men at Yalta.\n</p><p>At the beginning of 1945, Hitler was on his last strings.  The Soviets launched a devastating attack from Poland into Germany and Eastern Europe, intending to take Berlin.  The Germans collapsed in the West, allowing the Allies to fan out across Germany.  However, the Supreme Allied Commander, American general <a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" title=\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, refused to strike for Berlin, and instead became obsessed with reports of possible guerrilla activity in southern Germany, which in reality existed only in the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels.  By April 25, the Soviets had besieged Berlin.  Hitler remained in the city in a bunker under the <a href=\"/wiki/Reich_Chancellery\" title=\"Reich Chancellery\">Chancellery</a> garden.  On April 30, he committed suicide, after a ritual wedding with his longtime mistress <a href=\"/wiki/Eva_Braun\" title=\"Eva Braun\">Eva Braun</a>.  The Germans held out another 7 days under Admiral Doenitz, their new leader, but the Germans surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945, ending the war in Europe (see <a href=\"/wiki/V-E_Day\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"V-E Day\">V-E Day</a>).\n</p><p>Rivalries that had begun during the war, combined with the sense of strength in the victorious powers, laid the foundations of the <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_Curtain\" title=\"Iron Curtain\">Iron Curtain</a> and of the Cold War.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_war_in_the_Pacific\">The war in the Pacific</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: The war in the Pacific\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Asiatic-Pacific_Theater\" title=\"Asiatic-Pacific Theater\">Asiatic-Pacific Theater</a></div>\n<p>There once was a war in the pacific\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Holocaust\">The Holocaust</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: The Holocaust\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/The_Holocaust\" title=\"The Holocaust\">The Holocaust</a></div>\n<p>The Holocaust (which roughly means \"great fire\") was the deliberate, systematic murder of millions of Jews and other minorities during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later.  Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Kristallnacht\" title=\"Kristallnacht\">Kristallnacht</a></i> (literally \"Crystal Night\", Night of Broken Glass).  The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.\n</p><p>After the conquest of Poland, the <a href=\"/wiki/Third_Reich\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Third Reich\">Third Reich</a>, which had previously deported Jews and other \"undesirables\", suddenly had within its borders the largest concentration of Jews in the world.  The solution was to round up Jews and place them in <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps\" title=\"Nazi concentration camps\">Nazi concentration camps</a> or in <a href=\"/wiki/Ghetto\" title=\"Ghetto\">ghettos</a>, cordoned off sections of cities where Jews were forced to live in deplorable conditions, often with tens of thousands starving to death, and the bodies decaying in the streets.  As appalling as this sounds, they were the lucky ones.  After the invasion of the Soviet Union, armed killing squads of <a href=\"/wiki/SS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SS\">SS</a> men known as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Einsatzgruppen\" title=\"Einsatzgruppen\">Einsatzgruppen</a></i> systematically rounded up Jews and murdered an estimated one million Jews within the country.  As barbaric and inhuman as this seems, it was too slow and inefficient by Nazi standards.\n</p><p>In 1942, the top leadership met in <a href=\"/wiki/Wannsee\" title=\"Wannsee\">Wannsee</a>, a suburb of Berlin, and began to plan a more efficient way to slaughter the Jews.  The Nazis created a system of <a href=\"/wiki/Extermination_camp\" title=\"Extermination camp\">extermination camps</a> throughout Poland, and began rounding up Jews from the Soviet Union, and from the Ghettos.  Not only were Jews shot or gassed to death en masse, but they were forced to provide slave labor and they were used in horrific medical experiments (see <a href=\"/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_Nazi_Germany\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Human experimentation in Nazi Germany\">Human experimentation in Nazi Germany</a>).

When World War II broke out, scientists and advisors among the Allies feared that Nazi Germany may have been trying to develop its own atomic weapons, and the United States and the United Kingdom pooled their efforts in what became known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Manhattan_Project\" title=\"Manhattan Project\">Manhattan Project</a> to beat them to it. At the secret <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory\" title=\"Los Alamos National Laboratory\">Los Alamos laboratory</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/New_Mexico\" title=\"New Mexico\">New Mexico</a>, scientist <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Oppenheimer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert Oppenheimer\">Robert Oppenheimer</a> led a team of the world's top scientists to develop the first nuclear weapons, the first of which was tested at the <a href=\"/wiki/Trinity_site\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trinity site\">Trinity site</a> in July 1945. However, Germany had surrendered in May 1945, and it had been discovered that the <a href=\"/wiki/German_nuclear_energy_project\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"German nuclear energy project\">German atomic bomb program</a> had not been very close to success.\n</p><p>The Allied team produced two nuclear weapons for use in the war, one powered by <a href=\"/wiki/Uranium-235\" title=\"Uranium-235\">uranium-235</a> and the other by <a href=\"/wiki/Plutonium\" title=\"Plutonium\">plutonium</a> as <a href=\"/wiki/Nuclear_fission\" title=\"Nuclear fission\">fissionable</a> material, named \"<a href=\"/wiki/Little_Boy\" title=\"Little Boy\">Little Boy</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/wiki/Fat_Man\" title=\"Fat Man\">Fat Man</a>\". These were dropped on the Japanese cities of <a href=\"/wiki/Hiroshima\" title=\"Hiroshima\">Hiroshima</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Nagasaki\" title=\"Nagasaki\">Nagasaki</a> on August 6 and 9, 1945 each.  This, in combination with the Soviet entrance into the war, convinced the Japanese to surrender unconditionally.  These two weapons remain the only two nuclear weapons ever used against other countries in war.\n</p><p>Nuclear weapons brought an entirely new and terrifying possibility to warfare: a <a href=\"/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust\" title=\"Nuclear holocaust\">nuclear holocaust</a>.  While at first the United States held a monopoly on the production of nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union, with some assistance from espionage, managed to detonate its first weapon (dubbed \"<a href=\"/wiki/Joe-1\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Joe-1\">Joe-1</a>\" by the West) in August 1949.  The post-war relations between the two, which had already been deteriorating, began to rapidly disintegrate.  Soon the two were locked in a massive stockpiling of nuclear weapons.  The United States began a crash program to develop the first <a href=\"/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hydrogen bomb\">hydrogen bomb</a> in 1950, and detonated its first <a href=\"/wiki/Thermonuclear\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thermonuclear\">thermonuclear</a> weapon in 1952. This new weapon was alone over 400 times as powerful as the weapons used against Japan.

Oddly, these two <a href=\"/wiki/Axis_Powers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Axis Powers\">Axis</a> powers, despite military occupation, soon rose to become the second (Japan) and third (West Germany) most powerful economies in the world.\n</p><p>Following the end of the war, the <a href=\"/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II\" title=\"Allies of World War II\">Allies</a> famously prosecuted numerous German officials for <a href=\"/wiki/War_crime\" title=\"War crime\">war crimes</a> and other offenses in the <a href=\"/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nuremberg Trials\">Nuremberg Trials</a>.

The first computers, room-sized electro-mechanical devices built to break <a href=\"/wiki/Cryptographic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cryptographic\">cryptographical</a> codes during World War II, quickly became at least 20 times smaller using transistors. Computers became <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_programming\" title=\"Computer programming\">reprogrammable</a> rather than fixed-purpose devices. The invention of <a href=\"/wiki/Programming_language\" title=\"Programming language\">programming languages</a> meant computer operators could concentrate on problem solving at a high-level, without having to think in terms of the individual instructions to the computer itself. The creation of <a href=\"/wiki/Operating_systems\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Operating systems\">operating systems</a> also vastly improved <a href=\"/wiki/Programming_productivity\" title=\"Programming productivity\">programming productivity</a>.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\" title=\"Graphical user interface\">graphical user interface</a>, piloted by a <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_mouse\" title=\"Computer mouse\">computer mouse</a> made it simple to harness the power of the computer. <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_storage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Computer storage\">Storage</a> for computer programs progressed from <a href=\"/wiki/Punched_card\" title=\"Punched card\">punched cards</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Paper_tape\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Paper tape\">paper tape</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Magnetic_tape\" title=\"Magnetic tape\">magnetic tape</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Floppy_disk\" title=\"Floppy disk\">floppy disks</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Hard_disk\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hard disk\">hard disks</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/Core_memory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Core memory\">Core memory</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bubble_memory\" title=\"Bubble memory\">bubble memory</a> fell to <a href=\"/wiki/Random_access_memory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Random access memory\">random access memory</a>.\n</p><p>The invention of the <a href=\"/wiki/Word_processor\" title=\"Word processor\">word processor</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Spreadsheet\" title=\"Spreadsheet\">spreadsheet</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Database\" title=\"Database\">database</a> greatly improved office productivity over the old paper, <a href=\"/wiki/Typewriter\" title=\"Typewriter\">typewriter</a> and filing cabinet methods.

Crucially, IBM developed the PC from third-party components that were available on the open market. The only impediment to another company duplicating the system's architecture was the proprietary <a href=\"/wiki/BIOS\" title=\"BIOS\">BIOS</a> software. Other companies, starting with <a href=\"/wiki/Compaq\" title=\"Compaq\">Compaq</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Reverse_engineered\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reverse engineered\">reverse engineered</a> the BIOS and released <a href=\"/wiki/PC_compatible\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PC compatible\">PC compatible</a> computers that soon became the dominant architecture. <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft\" title=\"Microsoft\">Microsoft</a>, which produced an operating system for the PC, rode this wave of popularity to become the world's leading software company.\n</p><p>The 1980s heralded the <a href=\"/wiki/Information_Age\" title=\"Information Age\">Information Age</a>. The rise of computer applications and <a href=\"/wiki/Data_processing\" title=\"Data processing\">data processing</a> made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of <a href=\"/wiki/Software_patent\" title=\"Software patent\">software patents</a>. The controversy over these and <a href=\"/wiki/Proprietary_software\" title=\"Proprietary software\">proprietary software</a> led <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Stallman\" title=\"Richard Stallman\">Richard Stallman</a> to create the <a href=\"/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation\" title=\"Free Software Foundation\">Free Software Foundation</a> and begin the <a href=\"/wiki/GNU\" title=\"GNU\">GNU Project</a>.\n</p><p>Computers also became a usable platform for entertainment. Computer games were first developed by software programmers exercising their creativity on large systems at universities, but these efforts became commercially successful in <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade games</a> such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pong\" title=\"Pong\">Pong</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Space_Invaders\" title=\"Space Invaders\">Space Invaders</a></i>. Once the home computer market was established, young programmers in their bedrooms became the core of a youthful games industry. In order to take advantage of advancing technology, <a href=\"/wiki/Games_console\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Games console\">games consoles</a> were created. Like arcade systems, these machines had custom hardware designed to do game-oriented operations (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Sprite_(computer_science)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sprite (computer science)\">sprites</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Parallax_scrolling\" title=\"Parallax scrolling\">parallax scrolling</a>) in preference to general purpose computing tasks.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Computer_network\" title=\"Computer network\">Computer networks</a> appeared in two main styles; the <a href=\"/wiki/Local_area_network\" title=\"Local area network\">local area network</a>, linking computers in an office or school to each other, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Wide_area_network\" title=\"Wide area network\">wide area network</a>, linking the local area networks together. Initially, computers depended on the <a href=\"/wiki/PSTN\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PSTN\">telephone networks</a> to link to each other, spawning the <a href=\"/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\" title=\"Bulletin board system\">Bulletin Board</a> sub-culture. However, a <a href=\"/wiki/DARPA\" title=\"DARPA\">DARPA</a> project to create bomb-proof computer networks led to the creation of the Internet, a network of networks. The core of this network was the robust <a href=\"/wiki/TCP/IP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TCP/IP\">TCP/IP</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Network_protocol\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Network protocol\">network protocol</a>. Thanks to efforts from <a href=\"/wiki/Al_Gore\" title=\"Al Gore\">Al Gore</a>, the Internet grew beyond its military role when universities and commercial businesses were permitted to connect their networks to it. The main impetus for this was <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_mail\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Electronic mail\">electronic mail</a>, a far faster and convenient form of communication than a conventional letter and memo distribution, and the <a href=\"/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol\" title=\"File Transfer Protocol\">File Transfer Protocol</a> (FTP). However, the Internet remained largely unknown to the general public, who were used to Bulletin Boards and services like <a href=\"/wiki/Compuserve\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Compuserve\">Compuserve</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/AOL\" title=\"AOL\">America Online</a>. This changed when <a href=\"/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\" title=\"Tim Berners-Lee\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> devised a simpler form of <a href=\"/wiki/Vannevar_Bush\" title=\"Vannevar Bush\">Vannevar Bush</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Hypertext\" title=\"Hypertext\">hypertext</a>, which he dubbed the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wide_Web\" title=\"World Wide Web\">World Wide Web</a>. \"The Web\" suddenly changed the Internet into a printing press beyond the geographic boundaries of physical countries; it was termed \"<a href=\"/wiki/Cyberspace\" title=\"Cyberspace\">cyberspace</a>\". Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could write pages in the simple <a href=\"/wiki/HTML\" title=\"HTML\">HTML</a> format and publish their thoughts to the world.\n</p><p>The Web's immense success also fueled the commercial use of the Internet. Convenient home shopping had been an element of \"visions of the future\" since the development of the telephone, but now the race was on to provide convenient, interactive consumerism. Companies trading through websites became known as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Dot_com_company\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dot com company\">dot coms</a>\", due to the \".com\" suffix of commercial Internet addresses.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_world_at_the_end_of_the_century\">The world at the end of the century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=20th-century_events&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: The world at the end of the century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By the end of the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history.  Communications and information technology, transportation technology, and medical advances had radically altered daily lives.  Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history.  The people of the Indian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the century, had attained an indigenous independence for the first time in centuries.  China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, was finally open to the world in a new and powerful synthesis of west and east, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order.  With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left with truly independent new nation states, some cut from whole cloth, standing up after centuries of foreign domination.\n</p><p>The world was undergoing its second major period of <a href=\"/wiki/Globalization\" title=\"Globalization\">globalization</a>; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I.  Since the US was in a position of almost unchallenged domination, a major part of the process was <a href=\"/wiki/Americanization\" title=\"Americanization\">Americanization</a>. This led to anti-Western and <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-Americanism\" title=\"Anti-Americanism\">anti-American</a> feelings in parts of the world, especially the Middle East.  The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations, long marginalized by the West and by their own rulers, were rapidly integrating with the world economy.\n</p><p>However, several problems faced the world.  The gap between rich and poor nations continued to widen.  Some said that this problem could not be fixed, that there was a set amount of wealth and it could only be shared by so many.  Others said that the powerful nations with large economies were not doing enough to help improve the rapidly evolving economies of the <a href=\"/wiki/Third_World\" title=\"Third World\">Third World</a>.  However, developing countries faced many challenges, including the scale of the task to be surmounted, rapidly growing populations, and the need to protect the environment and the cost that goes along with it.\n</p><p>Terrorism, dictatorship, and the spread of <a href=\"/wiki/Nuclear_weapons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nuclear weapons\">nuclear weapons</a> were other issues requiring attention. The world was still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts. <a href=\"/wiki/Despotism\" title=\"Despotism\">Despots</a> such as <a href=\"/wiki/Kim_Jong-il\" title=\"Kim Jong-il\">Kim Jong-il</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/North_Korea\" title=\"North Korea\">North Korea</a> continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons.\n</p><p>Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world.  New viruses such as <a href=\"/wiki/SARS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SARS\">SARS</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/West_Nile_virus\" title=\"West Nile virus\">West Nile</a> continued to spread.  In poor nations, <a href=\"/wiki/Malaria\" title=\"Malaria\">malaria</a> and other diseases affected the majority of the population.  Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.  The virus was becoming an <a href=\"/wiki/AIDS_in_Africa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS in Africa\">epidemic in southern Africa</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:282px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg/280px-Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg\" width=\"280\" height=\"204\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg/420px-Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"559\" data-file-height=\"408\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Global_Warming_Predictions_Map.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The geographic distribution of surface warming during the 21st century calculated by the <a href=\"/wiki/HadCM3\" title=\"HadCM3\">HadCM3</a> climate model if a business as usual scenario is assumed for economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions.
