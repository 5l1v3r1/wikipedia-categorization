Kansei (寛政) was a Japanese era name (年号, nengō, "year name") after Tenmei and before Kyōwa. This period spanned the years from January 1789 through February 1801.  The reigning emperor was Kōkaku-tennō (光格天皇). The broad panoply of changes and new initiatives of the Tokugawa shogunate during this era became known as the Kansei Reforms. Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759–1829) was named the shogun's chief councilor (rōjū) in the summer of 1787; and early in the next year, he became the regent for the 11th shogun, Tokugawa Ienari.  As the chief administrative decision-maker in the bakufu hierarchy, he was in a position to effect radical change; and his initial actions represented an aggressive break with the recent past. Sadanobu's efforts were focused on strengthening the government by reversing many of the policies and practices which had become commonplace under the regime of the previous shogun, Tokugawa Ieharu. These reform policies could be interpreted as a reactionary response to the excesses of his rōjū predecessor, Tanuma Okitsugu (1719–1788);  and the result was that the Tanuma-initiated, liberalizing reforms within the bakufu and the relaxation of sakoku (Japan's "closed-door" policy of strict control of foreign merchants) were  reversed or blocked.
