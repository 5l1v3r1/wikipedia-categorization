Manji (万治) was a Japanese era name (年号, nengō, "year name") after Meireki and before Kanbun.  This period spanned the years from July 1658 through April 1661.  The reigning emperor was Go-Sai-tennō (後西天皇).  The source of this era name comes from the Records of the Grand Historian:  "When the common people know their place, then all under heaven is ruled"  (衆民乃定、万国為治) Katsushika Hokusai published this view of the Ryōgoku Bridge as an ukiyo-e print.
