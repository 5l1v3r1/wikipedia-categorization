The Suiko period  is a chronological timeframe during the Asuka period of Japanese history.  This period overlaps all but 7 years of Empress Suiko's reign (604-628) or it is used as a synonym for her reign (593-628).  The  adoption of the Sexagenary cycle calendar (Jikkan Jūnishi) was a significant event in the reign of Empress Suiko.   This pre-dates the system of Japanese era names (年号,, nengō,, lit. "year name") which was introduced in 645.
