Ansei (安政) was a Japanese era name (年号, nengō, "year name") after Kaei and before Man'en.  This period spanned the years from November 1854 through March 1860.   The reigning emperor was Kōmei-tennō (孝明天皇). The new era name was derived from an hortatory aphorism: "Rule peacefully over the masses, then the ruler will remain in his place"  (庶民安政、然後君子安位矣). Although the notion seems appealing, the arrival of the Black Ships and Commodore Matthew C. Perry is not specifically recognized as a factor in the change of era names.
