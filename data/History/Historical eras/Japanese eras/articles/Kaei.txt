Kaei (嘉永) was a Japanese era name (年号,, nengō,, lit. "year name") after Kōka and before Ansei. This period spanned the years from February 1848 through November 1854.  The reigning emperor was Kōmei-tennō (孝明天皇). The era name is derived from an aphorism in the Book of Song:  "A wise Emperor receives much help, One who esteems comfort is on the outside"  (思皇享多祐、嘉楽永無央).
