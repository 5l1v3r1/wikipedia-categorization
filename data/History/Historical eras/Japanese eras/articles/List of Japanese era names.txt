The list of Japanese era names is the result of a periodization system which was established by Emperor Kōtoku in 645. The system of Japanese era names (年号, nengō, "year name") was irregular until the beginning of the 8th century.  After 701, sequential era names developed without interruption across a span of centuries.  To convert a Japanese year to a Western or Gregorian calendar year, find the first year of the nengō (the nengō = the era name, see list below). When found, subtract 1, and add the number of the Japanese year. For example, the 23rd year of the Shōwa period (Shōwa 23) corresponds to 1926 + 23 − 1 = Common Era 1948. Unofficial non-nengō periodization (shinengō) prior to 701 are called itsunengō (逸年号).  Pre-Taika chronology intervals include: Post-Taika chronology intervals not encompassed within the ambit of the nengō system include:
