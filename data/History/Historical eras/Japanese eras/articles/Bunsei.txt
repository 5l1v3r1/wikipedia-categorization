Bunsei (文政) was a  Japanese era name (年号, nengō, "year name") after Bunka and before Tenpō.  This period spanned the years from April 1818 through December 1830.  The reigning emperor was Ninkō-tennō (仁孝天皇). The new era name was drawn from an aphorism attributed to the ancient Chinese emperor, Great Shun (大舜): "Shun reads the Heavens, and so brings together all seven governments" (舜察天文、斉七政).
