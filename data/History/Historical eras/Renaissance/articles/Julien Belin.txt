Julien Belin was a French composer and lutenist active in the second half of the 16th century; he died after 1584. The only elements one possesses about his life come from the Bibliothèque de La Croix Du Maine:  he is said to be a Manceau", therefore a native of Le Mans or surroundings in 1584 in the Maine. His collection, published in 1556, reveals René de Saint-François, the great archdeacon of Le Mans, as a probable protector, and shows him as a capable lutenist, developing his own style, notwithstanding the influence of lutenists Francesco Canova da Milano and Albert de Rippe.  In 1556, he published his Premier livre contenant plusieurs motetz, chansons & fantasies reduictz en tabulature de leut by Nicolas Du Chemin in Paris  with a dedication to René de Saint-François.
