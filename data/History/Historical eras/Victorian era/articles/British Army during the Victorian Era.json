Her long reign was marked by the steady expansion and consolidation of the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Empire\" title=\"British Empire\">British Empire</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\" title=\"Industrial Revolution\">industrialisation</a> and the enactment of liberal reforms (by both <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)\" title=\"Liberal Party (UK)\">Liberal</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)\" title=\"Conservative Party (UK)\">Conservative</a> governments) within Britain.\n</p><p>The British Army began the period with few differences from the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Army_during_the_Napoleonic_Wars\" title=\"British Army during the Napoleonic Wars\">British Army of the Napoleonic Wars</a> that fought at <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo\" title=\"Battle of Waterloo\">Waterloo</a>. There were three main periods of the Army's development during the era. From the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the mid-1850s, the <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington\" title=\"Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington\">Duke of Wellington</a> and his successors attempted to maintain its organisation and tactics as they had been in 1815, with only detail changes. In 1854, the <a href=\"/wiki/Crimean_War\" title=\"Crimean War\">Crimean War</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857\" title=\"Indian Rebellion of 1857\">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a> highlighted the shortcomings of the Army, but entrenched interests prevented major reforms from taking place. From 1868 to 1881, sweeping changes were made by <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)\" title=\"Liberal Party (UK)\">Liberal</a> governments, giving it the broad structure it retained until 1914.\n</p><p>On Victoria's death, the Army was still engaged in the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Boer_War\" title=\"Second Boer War\">Second Boer War</a>, but other than expedients adopted for that war, it was recognisably the army that would enter the <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">First World War</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\" title=\"Industrial Revolution\">Industrial Revolution</a> had changed its weapons, transport and equipment, and social changes such as better education had prompted changes to the terms of service and outlook of many soldiers. Nevertheless, it retained many features inherited from the Duke of Wellington's army, and since its prime function was to maintain the expanding <a href=\"/wiki/British_Empire\" title=\"British Empire\">British Empire</a>, it differed in many ways from the conscripted armies of continental Europe.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\"

class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>From the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the outbreak of the Crimean War, the British army's organisation, and to an extent its senior personnel, remained largely unchanged. The Duke of Wellington remained as Commander-in-Chief until 1852 (except when serving as Prime Minister).<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> His successors were men who had served him closely, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Hardinge,_1st_Viscount_Hardinge\" title=\"Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge\">Sir Henry Hardinge</a>. None of them saw any need for major reform of the existing administrative systems, dress or tactics.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Enlistments_and_conditions\">Enlistments and conditions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_Victorian_Era&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Enlistments and conditions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A soldier often enlisted after being plied with drink by a recruiting sergeant in a <a href=\"/wiki/Public_house\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Public house\">public house</a>. Having ritually accepted the Queen's shilling, however, he was allowed twenty-four to ninety-six hours to reconsider. The recruit was then medically examined (as much to detect the scars from flogging, to prevent deserters or discharged soldiers re-enlisting for the enlistment bounty as to detect other weaknesses or illness), and then formally took the oath of allegiance before a magistrate.\n</p><p>Soldiers enlisted either for life, or for a period of twenty-one years, which effectively was a lifelong enlistment. \"Limited Service\" enlistments of only seven years (longer in the cavalry and artillery), which were introduced in 1806 to allow the Army to be rapidly expanded during the Napoleonic Wars, were abolished in 1829. Enlistments of ten or twelve years were introduced in 1847, but at the end of this prolonged period of service, most soldiers were skilled only for menial civilian occupations and immediately re-enlisted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Re-enlistment was also encouraged by a bounty of several guineas. The long-term effect of this was to produce regiments with many experienced or veteran soldiers, but no trained reserves that could reinforce the regular army. Though some regiments had territorial designations, soldiers enlisted on a basis of <i>general service</i>, and recruits could find themselves drafted to any unit, often to bring a unit about to be posted overseas up to full establishment.\n</p><p>Soldiers' pay was nominally one shilling per day, but this was decreased by \"stoppages\" of up to sixpence (half a shilling) for their daily rations, and other stoppages for the issue of replacement clothing, damages, medical services and so on. In 1847, it was laid down that a soldier must receive at least one penny per day, regardless of all stoppages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Many old soldiers were debilitated after serving for years in harsh climates or disease-ridden areas, although this was not the only threat to the soldiers' health; many barracks built in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were insanitary and more overcrowded than prisons<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and the death rate among men in their prime in barracks in Britain and Ireland was higher than that among the general population of Britain. Long term over-indulgence in drink also affected the health of many soldiers,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> though this was rarely admitted in official records. It also was the cause of most disciplinary infractions.\n</p><p>The disciplinary system was not notably more harsh than the contemporary civil Penal System, although soldiers stood less chance of severe penalties being commuted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The death sentence could apply for crimes such as mutiny or striking an officer, but was generally reserved for actions that were capital crimes in common law, such as murder. Minor infractions could be summarily punished with extra duties or stoppages of pay, but flogging remained a punishment for many offences, including minor offences, on the discretion of a <a href=\"/wiki/Court_martial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Court martial\">court martial</a>. A court martial could be held at regimental level (which might well be influenced by the attitude of the colonel or other senior officers), or district level where convenient, or a General Court Martial might be convened under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief for serious matters or offences involving officers.\n</p><p>The maximum number of strokes inflicted on a soldier sentenced to flogging (which had been a barbaric 2,000 in 1782, essentially a death sentence for nearly any man) was reduced to 300 in 1829, and then to 50 in 1847.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Some regiments nevertheless rejoiced in the nicknames of the \"bloodybacks\" or the \"bendovers\" if they were notorious for the number of floggings ordered.\n</p><p>Only a small portion of soldiers were permitted to marry. Soldiers' wives and children shared their barracks, with only blankets slung over a line for privacy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Wives often performed services such as laundry for their husbands' companies or barracks. A particularly cruel feature of the Army's practices was that fewer soldiers' wives were allowed to accompany a unit overseas (one per eight cavalrymen or twelve infantrymen)<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> than were permitted when serving at home. Those wives not chosen by lot to accompany the unit when it embarked were forcibly separated from their husbands, for years or for life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Officers\">Officers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_Victorian_Era&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Officers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The system of <a href=\"/wiki/Sale_of_commissions\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sale of commissions\">Sale of commissions</a> determined the selection and promotion of officers in the infantry and cavalry. Once officers gained their first commissions through a combination of recommendation and purchase, subsequent promotion was nominally determined by seniority, with officers purchasing their successive ranks. However, the purchase system and widely condoned abuses of it worked against either the proper training of officers or any consistently applied career structure. Some impecunious officers who had served as subalterns at Waterloo were languishing in the same rank decades later, while wealthy officers such as the notorious <a href=\"/wiki/James_Brudenell,_7th_Earl_of_Cardigan\" title=\"James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan\">Lord Cardigan</a> could rapidly become the commanding officers of regiments, and subsequently become generals from their seniority as colonels.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During the Napoleonic Wars, a combination of large-scale expansion of the army and intensive campaigning resulting in heavy casualties had resulted in many officers being commissioned from the ranks or from middle-class backgrounds.

One of the field companies was designated the grenadier company, and another was designated the light company. Rifle, light and fusilier regiments that historically lacked grenadier and light companies had a slightly different establishment. The establishments of battalions serving overseas was enlarged to allow for losses to disease or on campaign that could not be quickly replaced from the depot in Britain.\n</p><p>Most infantry wore scarlet <a href=\"/wiki/Coatee\" title=\"Coatee\">coatees</a> or tailless jackets, with greatcoats for cold weather.

The false-fronted \"Belgic\" shako, made famous by depictions of the Battle of Waterloo, was replaced soon after the Napoleonic Wars by a flaring, \"bell-topped\" shako. In the 1840s, the tapering \"Albert\" shako, with peaks both fore and aft, was adopted. Guards units wore the towering bearskin adopted after Waterloo, while most Highland regiments wore the 'feather bonnet', decorated with ostrich plumes. On campaign in India, the low-crowned \"Kilmarnock\" forage cap was often worn, sometimes with a white cloth cover that shaded the neck and the back of the head from the sun. The infamous leather stock, designed to force the wearer to keep his head erect, was retained until 1855. Trimming it down, or even soaping it to reduce the discomfort to the wearer, was a disciplinary offence.\n</p><p>With the exception of the rifle regiments, the infantry were armed with the <a href=\"/wiki/Brown_Bess\" title=\"Brown Bess\">Brown Bess</a> musket, essentially the same weapon the Army had used since the early eighteenth century (though a version with a <a href=\"/wiki/Percussion_cap\" title=\"Percussion cap\">percussion cap</a> firing mechanism replaced the <a href=\"/wiki/Flintlock\" title=\"Flintlock\">flintlock</a> in 1842).

The <a href=\"/wiki/British_East_India_Company\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British East India Company\">British East India Company</a> had grown in less than two centuries from a trading concern to be the agency for the British Government in India. It had started recruiting its own Indian troops in the mid-eighteenth century. The company administered its territory as three Presidencies based in <a href=\"/wiki/Madras\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Madras\">Madras</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mumbai\" title=\"Mumbai\">Bombay</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bengal\" title=\"Bengal\">Bengal</a>, each with its own army. By the start of Victoria's reign, there was little opposition to British rule in Madras and Bombay, and the Bengal Army was consequently the largest and most often employed. In 1806, at the time of the <a href=\"/wiki/Vellore_Mutiny\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vellore Mutiny\">Vellore Mutiny</a>, the combined strength of the three presidencies' armies was 154,500, making them one of the largest <a href=\"/wiki/Standing_army\" title=\"Standing army\">standing armies</a> in the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Company also recruited its own \"European\" white units, which included some infantry battalions and several companies of field or horse artillery, mainly from Ireland. These were supplemented by units of the British Army, referred to in India as \"Queen's\" troops, whose maintenance was paid for by the Company. The most senior appointments in the Company's armies were reserved for British Army officers.\n</p><p>The establishment of Native Infantry regiments included twenty-six British officers and two British warrant officers. All Indian personnel were subordinate to even the most junior British officers, although junior British officers were required to become proficient in <a href=\"/wiki/Urdu\" title=\"Urdu\">Urdu</a>, or whatever other Indian language was in use in their units, before they could be eligible for promotion. The highest rank an Indian soldier could aspire to was Subadar-Major (Rissaldar-Major in regular cavalry units), effectively a senior subaltern rank. In Irregular cavalry and infantry units, which were locally recruited from distinct communities or absorbed from the armies of annexed \"princely\" states, there were usually only seven British officers and Indian personnel had more influence.\n</p><p>The Company maintained its own institution for training its British officers at the <a href=\"/wiki/Addiscombe_Military_Seminary\" title=\"Addiscombe Military Seminary\">Addiscombe Military Seminary</a>. Promotion in the Company's army went strictly by seniority for both British and Indian personnel. Like the system of Purchase, this worked against the proper development of officers' careers and abilities, as the system did not encourage merit or initiative, promotion was slow and ill-suited soldiers or officers could nevertheless succeed to high rank merely by surviving long enough. Many promising junior British officers were tempted away from regimental duty to serve on the staff or as civil administrators, while Indian officers often became embittered at their lack of authority or opportunities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Company's army was dressed and equipped much the same as the British Army, although the Irregular units generally wore uniforms derived from the area where they were recruited.

Obsessed with the idea that Afghanistan's Emir <a href=\"/wiki/Dost_Mohammed_Khan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dost Mohammed Khan\">Dost Mohammed Khan</a> was courting a Russian presence, the British sent an expedition to replace him with <a href=\"/wiki/Shuja_Shah_Durrani\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shuja Shah Durrani\">Shuja Shah Durrani</a>, a former ruler of Afghanistan who had been ousted in 1809 and who was in exile in British India.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> This triggered the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Anglo-Afghan_War\" title=\"First Anglo-Afghan War\">First Anglo-Afghan War</a>, in which the expedition successfully captured <a href=\"/wiki/Kabul\" title=\"Kabul\">Kabul</a>.

The use of tinned rations simplified the provision of supplies. The war, however, exposed the Army's inadequacies. Although the armies of all the nations involved suffered defeats and losses as a result of lack of preparation and incompetent leadership, the shortcomings revealed in the British Army caused greater public concern.

The new Secretary of State for War was <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Cardwell,_1st_Viscount_Cardwell\" title=\"Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell\">Edward Cardwell</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Cardwell_Reforms\" title=\"Cardwell Reforms\">Cardwell Reforms</a>, which he introduced in the 1870s, were profound.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Terms_of_service\">Terms of service</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_Victorian_Era&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Terms of service\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Cardwell introduced the <i>Army Enlistment Act (1870),</i> which reduced the normal period of service from 21 years to 12 years. Furthermore, only about half this period was served with the regulars. Most men passed into the Army reserve after a few years' service, being liable for recall to the colours for a further six years in the event of a serious national emergency. Although the benefits took several years to appear, the Act gave the army both a trained cadre and the power to expand, which it had lacked in the past.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Cardwell also reorganised the regimental system by introducing a Localisation Scheme in 1872. This gave every cavalry and infantry regiment and artillery brigade a fixed depot and recruiting area. (Recruits who expressed a reasoned preference were nevertheless allowed to join any regiment of their choice, provided there were vacancies.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Single-battalion infantry regiments were paired via administrative <a href=\"/wiki/Military_base\" title=\"Military base\">depots</a> on a county-based system. One battalion would serve overseas while the other was stationed in Britain. After a few years, the two battalions would exchange roles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> The establishments were supposedly standardised for all infantry battalions serving both overseas and at home, eliminating many anomalies. This in part resulted from the adoption of steamships to replace sailing ships and later the construction of the Suez Canal, which made the movement of troops between Britain and India a matter of a few weeks rather than several months.\n</p><p>A major step was the abolition of the system of purchase of commissions, which was replaced by a system of advancement by seniority and merit. This was expensive (as most serving officers had to be compensated for their outlay for their existing commissions, and in effect the War Office had to buy back the army from its officers), but it made possible further internal reforms by unblocking the avenues of promotion to deserving officers, regardless of their personal means.<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_to_organisation\">Changes to organisation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_Victorian_Era&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Changes to organisation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>In addition to these reforms brought in by legislation, there were other administrative reforms introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Order_in_Council\" title=\"Order in Council\">Order in Council</a>.

The rank structure and nomenclature for Commissariat and Ordnance officers differed from those of the infantry, cavalry and artillery until 1888 in the case of the Commissariat, when the Department was finally merged into the Army Service Corps.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Colonial_units_2\">Colonial units</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_Victorian_Era&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Colonial units\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Following the Crimean War, and the French invasion scare resulting from the 1858 <a href=\"/wiki/Orsini_affair\" title=\"Orsini affair\">Orsini affair</a>, it was decided that the British Army needed to be repositioned to better protect the British homeland, and to better allow for expeditionary campaigns such as that to the Crimea. As an increase of the British Army was not being funded, this meant withdrawing units from garrison duty around the world. In some territories, such as India, this was not possible, as removing British soldiers could invite invasion by competing empires or insurgencies. Replacing them with native soldiers of questionable loyalty to Britain could potentially lead to rebellions.\n</p><p>In quieter locations of strategic importance, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Bermuda\" title=\"Bermuda\">Bermuda</a> (where the <a href=\"/wiki/North_America_and_West_Indies_Squadron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"North America and West Indies Squadron\">North America and West Indies Squadron</a> of the Royal Navy was based, and where a sizable portion of the Imperial defence budget was being lavished on fortifying the archipelago), weakening the defences could also not be permitted. In such colonies with populaces whose loyalties were more reliable, and where locally raised units (such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Malta_Artillery\" title=\"Royal Malta Artillery\">Royal Malta Artillery</a>) did not already exist, the colonial governments or administrations were encouraged to raise part-time units along the lines of the Militia and the <a href=\"/wiki/Volunteer_Force\" title=\"Volunteer Force\">Volunteer Force</a> to enable professional soldiers to be withdrawn.

Most infantry regiments had a third militia battalion, which would be filled with recalled reservists in an emergency, and a fourth volunteer battalion (or more), although the volunteer battalions often retained their original titles. This association allowed regular units to detach instructors and administrative staff to the militia and volunteer units, raising their efficiency.\n</p><p>On the other hand, the cavalry were less affected by the reforms. Including the three regiments of Household Cavalry, the cavalry numbered 31 regiments, but the regiments were small, generally deploying no more than two squadrons on active service. An attempt was made to link regiments in threes, in the same way that Cardwell had linked pairs of infantry battalions, but this broke down.<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> Nor were the Yeomanry (volunteer cavalry) regiments linked to regular cavalry units.

This minimum period of regular service varied over time and with arms of service, from as little as four years in the infantry, to as much as eight in the cavalry and artillery. The maximum length of service remained at twenty-one years. Generally, only those soldiers who became <a href=\"/wiki/Warrant_officers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Warrant officers\">warrant officers</a> or senior <a href=\"/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer\" title=\"Non-commissioned officer\">non-commissioned officers</a>, or specialists such as armourers, served this full term, though in most units there were \"old sweats\" who served for two decades without rising above the rank of private soldier.\n</p><p>Pay was raised to one shilling and two pence per day before Cardwell took office. He nevertheless greatly improved the common soldiers' conditions by making the basic ration allowance of bread, potatoes and meat free, and also reduced other stoppages e.g. that for hospital care. Stoppages for damages to barracks or to a soldier's equipment remained, and were resented as this might result from ordinary wear and tear on campaign or exercise. However, Cardwell also introduced a system of extra pay for soldiers who earned good-conduct badges after several years of service. Some soldiers could also supplement their pay by undertaking extra duties such as those of cook, groom, officer's servant or (in the artillery and engineers) in road-making and bridge-building.<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The army insisted on minimum standards of education for soldiers promoted to the rank of <a href=\"/wiki/Corporal\" title=\"Corporal\">corporal</a>, and higher standards for those promoted to <a href=\"/wiki/Sergeant\" title=\"Sergeant\">sergeant</a> or above. From 1871, there were compulsory education classes for new recruits, though this was discontinued in 1888 as most recruits had received at least rudimentary education to the age of thirteen. The illiteracy rate within the army declined from 90% in 1871 to almost zero by the 1890s, though fewer than 40% of soldiers achieved (or perhaps troubled to achieve) more than the lowest standard of education required.<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Restrictions on the number of soldiers who could marry were eased, and all soldiers' wives could accompany their husbands when they changed station (though not on campaign).

British staff methods were never tested in war on a large scale until the Second Anglo-Boer War.\n</p><p>Britain had no General Staff until the early twentieth century, and the work of some departments at the War Office was sometimes poorly supervised and inefficient.

Within a few years, a closer-fitting double-breasted tunic was adopted. This was eventually replaced by a single-breasted tunic, of the form still worn by the Brigade of Guards when on public duties (e.g. when mounting guard during the summer months at <a href=\"/wiki/Buckingham_Palace\" title=\"Buckingham Palace\">Buckingham Palace</a>.) Highland units wore a <a href=\"/wiki/Doublet_(clothing)#Highland_Dress\" title=\"Doublet (clothing)\">doublet</a> instead of a tunic. The carrying of equipment on crossbelts and shoulder straps, which constricted the chest and restricted movement, was replaced by pouches suspended from the waistbelt and various patterns of \"valise\", intended to be practical in hot climates and to distribute the weight evenly. Experimentation with soldiers' equipment continued throughout the period.\n</p><p>Until 1870, the usual infantry headgear was a version of <a href=\"/wiki/Shako\" title=\"Shako\">shako</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Kepi\" title=\"Kepi\">kepi</a>. Successive patterns were steadily reduced in size, following French styles. After that date, a conical \"home service\" helmet inspired by the Prussian <a href=\"/wiki/Pickelhaube\" title=\"Pickelhaube\">pickelhaube</a> was adopted. Highland regiments wore variations on the <a href=\"/wiki/Glengarry\" title=\"Glengarry\">scotch bonnet</a>. For service in India and Africa, a <a href=\"/wiki/Pith_helmet\" title=\"Pith helmet\">pith helmet</a> was used by almost all troops.\n</p><p>For campaign purposes, British troops have often been portrayed in films as toiling in hot climates in heavy <a href=\"/wiki/Red_coat_(British_army)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Red coat (British army)\">scarlet serge</a> uniforms, and this was certainly the case in the <a href=\"/wiki/Anglo-Zulu_War\" title=\"Anglo-Zulu War\">Anglo-Zulu War</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_War_(1882)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)\">Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)</a> for example.<sup id=\"cite_ref-60\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-60\">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> However, many officers took a far more practical approach. Wolseley had lightweight grey linen uniforms purpose-made for his expeditions in the <a href=\"/wiki/Anglo-Ashanti_wars\" title=\"Anglo-Ashanti wars\">Anglo-Ashanti wars</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mahdist_War\" title=\"Mahdist War\">Mahdist War</a>. In India, almost all troops soon copied the neutral <i><a href=\"/wiki/Khaki\" title=\"Khaki\">Khaki</a></i> (an <a href=\"/wiki/Urdu\" title=\"Urdu\">Urdu</a> word meaning \"dust\") shade of cloth first adopted by Indian irregular units on the <a href=\"/wiki/North-West_Frontier_(military_history)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"North-West Frontier (military history)\">North-West Frontier</a> in the late 1850s.

Khaki was officially adopted for troops in Africa in 1882, but the last battle in which British troops wore scarlet was the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Gennis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Battle of Gennis\">Battle of Gennis</a> in the Sudan in 1885. Khaki became general campaign wear after that date, and became official overseas dress in 1897.<sup id=\"cite_ref-61\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-61\">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup> A slightly darker shade of khaki subsequently became the official colour for home service dress in 1902. The white pith helmet was often stained with tea or other improvised dyestuffs on campaign to provide rudimentary camouflage. Later, it was provided with a khaki cloth cover.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Snider%E2%80%93Enfield\" title=\"Snider\u2013Enfield\">Snider\u2013Enfield</a> rifle, a breech-loading conversion of the Enfield rifle, was introduced starting in 1866.

From the early 1880s, the infantry tentatively introduced various rapid-firing crew-served weapons. Early versions such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Gatling_gun\" title=\"Gatling gun\">Gatling gun</a> proved unreliable, but the <a href=\"/wiki/Maxim_gun\" title=\"Maxim gun\">Maxim gun</a> (which was first introduced in 1893) was both reliable and devastatingly effective against an enemy charging in masses across open terrain, such as occurred at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Omdurman\" title=\"Battle of Omdurman\">Battle of Omdurman</a>.\n</p><p>Officers remained responsible for purchasing their own uniforms and equipment, although they were expected to abide by various regimental and general regulations. They were required to carry swords that conformed to various <a href=\"/wiki/Gothic_Hilted_British_Infantry_Swords_(1822,_1827,_1845,_1854_and_1892_Patterns)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gothic Hilted British Infantry Swords (1822, 1827, 1845, 1854 and 1892 Patterns)\">official patterns</a>. Before 1856, officers often purchased their own firearms.

Britain was able to mobilise unprecedented numbers of troops including reserves and volunteers to fight in South Africa, and to transport and maintain them there thanks to Britain's industrial resources, the Royal Navy and Britain's merchant fleet. However, many shortcomings in administration, training, tactics and <a href=\"/wiki/Military_intelligence\" title=\"Military intelligence\">intelligence</a> were revealed.\n</p><p>The war began in 1899 after tension between the British and the two Dutch <a href=\"/wiki/Boer\" title=\"Boer\">Boer</a> republics culminated in the Boers declaring war. The outnumbered British forces in Natal and Cape Colony were quickly surrounded and besieged, but it was generally expected that a quickly mobilised Army Corps under General Redvers Buller, GOCinC of <a href=\"/wiki/Aldershot_Command\" title=\"Aldershot Command\">Aldershot Command</a> and one of Wolseley's most famous prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, would soon overcome the Boers. Buller's command was \"about the equivalent of the <a href=\"/wiki/I_Corps_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"I Corps (United Kingdom)\">First Army Corps</a> of the existing mobilization scheme.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-66\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-66\">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup> However, once in South Africa the corps was never able to operate as a cohesive force and the three divisions and one cavalry division were widely dispersed.\n</p><p>The British suffered a number of defeats at the hands of Boers using magazine rifles and modern field artillery, culminating in <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Week\" title=\"Black Week\">Black Week</a>. It was evident that British tactics had not kept up with improvements in weapons technology. Experience gained against enemies such as the Zulus or Sudanese proved irrelevant against the Boers. Troops trained in the field for only two months each year; the rest of the time was spent in ceremonial or routine barrack duties. Officers, where not preoccupied with sporting or social activities, were engaged in tedious paperwork; each company required monthly returns totalling 400 pages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-67\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-67\">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Royal Artillery several times deployed guns in exposed positions within rifle range of concealed Boers. This was sometimes the result of a misleading analysis of Prussian artillery tactics during the <a href=\"/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War\" title=\"Franco-Prussian War\">Franco-Prussian War</a>, when guns had often been pushed into the front line to suppress enemy infantry. The same tactics applied in South Africa resulted only in needless casualties.\n</p><p>The infantry were not as good at marksmanship and fieldcraft as the Boers. Individual fire was discouraged, and troops still relied on firing volleys on the orders of an officer. Attempts to repeat Wolseley's tactics at Tel-el-Kabir against the Boers resulted in heavy losses at battles such as <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Magersfontein\" title=\"Battle of Magersfontein\">Magersfontein</a>. The infantry finally won decisive victories only once properly coordinated with artillery, for example at the <a href=\"/wiki/Relief_of_Ladysmith\" title=\"Relief of Ladysmith\">Relief of Ladysmith</a>.\n</p><p>The cavalry, obsessed with the charge with cold steel, had \"ceased to be in any useful sense mobile\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-68\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-68\">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup> They used heavy chargers as mounts rather than lighter horses. The heavy mounts required acclimatisation and recovery after long sea voyages, and needed plenty of forage when grazing was sparse. They were also overloaded with unnecessary or over-decorated equipment and saddlery.<sup id=\"cite_ref-69\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-69\">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> The average life expectancy of a British horse from the time of its arrival in South Africa was around six weeks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-70\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-70\">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although reformers such as Major <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Henry_Havelock-Allan,_1st_Baronet\" title=\"Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, 1st Baronet\">Henry Havelock</a> and the Canadian Lieutenant Colonel George Denison had long advocated the adoption of <a href=\"/wiki/Mounted_infantry\" title=\"Mounted infantry\">mounted infantry</a> tactics, they merely provoked varying degrees of opposition and obstruction from the cavalry's senior officers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-71\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-71\">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> Most of the tactical and strategic tasks traditionally undertaken by light cavalry were therefore performed by mounted infantry detachments or by colonial (Australian, New Zealand, Canadian and South African) contingents of Light Horse.<sup id=\"cite_ref-72\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-72\">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> Later in the war, the dispersal of many of the Boers into small guerrilla bands made artillery units redundant, and several units of Royal Artillery Mounted Rifles were formed from among the RA.<sup id=\"cite_ref-73\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-73\">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The supply arrangements often broke down, though this was partly caused during the early part of the war by the existence of three separate establishments (Home, Indian and Egyptian) for units and formations. Lord Kitchener's attempts to impose a single system in early 1900 led to him being nicknamed \"Kitchener of Chaos\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-74\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-74\">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Even before Black Week, concerns over the overall direction of the war had caused the government to mobilise yet more troops, including contingents of volunteers, and appoint Lord Roberts to command in South Africa. Roberts used his superiority in strength to overwhelm the Boer armies, and capture the capitals of both Boer republics. Although his forces suffered few casualties in battle, shortcomings in the transport and medical sections resulted in many needless casualties through shortage of supplies and enteric fevers.\n</p><p>Having announced the annexation of the Boer republics, Roberts returned to an appointment as Commander in Chief in Ireland, leaving Lord Kitchener to oversee the final operations. In fact, the Boers maintained a guerilla fight for over a year. The British response was marked by the indiscriminate removal of Boer non-combatants including women and children into <a href=\"/wiki/Concentration_camp\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Concentration camp\">concentration camps</a> where many died, again through poor rations and sanitation. Kitchener's methods against the very mobile Boer fighters were often expensive and wasteful, until near the end of the war when the Boers were finally worn down by exhaustion.\n</p><p>The war also saw the first substantial deployment outside their own borders of troops from the present and future <a href=\"/wiki/Dominion\" title=\"Dominion\">Dominions</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a>, Canada, <a href=\"/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland\" title=\"Dominion of Newfoundland\">Newfoundland</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/New_Zealand\" title=\"New Zealand\">New Zealand</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/South_Africa\" title=\"South Africa\">South Africa</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"End_of_the_Victorian_era\">End of the Victorian era</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_Victorian_Era&amp;action=edit&amp;section=42\" title=\"Edit section: End of the Victorian era\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>During the second Boer War, a fourth regiment of guards (the <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_Guards\" title=\"Irish Guards\">Irish Guards</a>) had been formed, at the instigation of Lord Roberts.\n</p><p>Queen Victoria died in 1901, a few months before the end of the Boer War. At her death, the differences between the British Army and those of most nations in Europe had become accentuated in many ways. The British soldier's jargon illustrated that almost all soldiers would serve in India or Africa at some time during their enlistments. <a href=\"/wiki/Hindi\" title=\"Hindi\">Hindi</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Urdu\" title=\"Urdu\">Urdu</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Arabic_language\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arabic language\">Arabic</a> or to a lesser extent <a href=\"/wiki/Bantu_languages\" title=\"Bantu languages\">Bantu</a> words and phrases sprinkled soldiers' conversation.\n</p><p>Most British Army officers and many of the longer-serving soldiers had first-hand experience of active service and combat, though not of the large-scale manoeuvres and operations for which the conscript armies of Europe planned and trained. Indeed, the Chobham Manoeuvres of 1853 involving 7,000 troops were the first such manoeuvres since the Napoleonic Wars.<sup id=\"cite_ref-75\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-75\">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Few armies other than those of the dominions within the British empire had attempted to emulate the British Army's systems. From 1856 to 1870, the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Army\" title=\"French Army\">French Army</a> had to some extent inspired the organisation, dress and tactics of many other armies, including the British; after the <a href=\"/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War\" title=\"Franco-Prussian War\">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870, which ended in French defeat, the Prussian Army became the model to which others aspired.\n</p><p>It was recognised by many British politicians that the period of <a href=\"/wiki/Splendid_isolation\" title=\"Splendid isolation\">splendid isolation</a> was ending and the Army might well be committed to conflict in Europe. Others aspects of British society were unfavourable for a large-scale expansion of the Army. Many of the Army's recruits during the Boer War had proved to be of inadequate physique or in poor health, through squalid housing or lack of medical provision. Within a few years of Victoria's death, a Liberal government committed to <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_welfare_reforms\" title=\"Liberal welfare reforms\">welfare reforms</a> was elected.\n</p><p>The lessons the Army had learned during the Boer War were addressed at several levels.
