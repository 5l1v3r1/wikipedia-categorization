Sanborn Seminary is a historic educational facility in Kingston, New Hampshire. Its main building was built in 1883 by Major Edward S. Sanborn (died 1885) to serve as a secular secondary boarding school. The school ran continuously until 1966 when it was sold to the Town of Kingston. The campus became known as Sanborn Regional High School and served students from the towns of Kingston, Newton, and Fremont. The last class at this campus graduated in June 2006. The former Sanborn Seminary is located north of the village center of Kingston, on the east side of Church Street north of Depot Road. It is a large 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of brick with limestone trim. It is covered by an elaborate multicolored slate mansard roof. The main facade is five bays wide, with the center bay projecting and rising to a three-story mansard roofed tower with iron cresting. The facade bays are otherwise articulated by brick pilasters, and have pairs of narrow windows, each with stone keystones, shoulders, and sills.  The Seminary building was designed in the Victorian Gothic style popular at the time of its construction, and was completed in 1883. The architect is unknown. In preparation for the building's 100th anniversary in 1983, an exterior restoration project was completed, and the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Seminary is the centerpiece of a campus complex that originally included five additional wood frame structures and a beach recreation area on nearby Greenwood Pond. The bell tower was removed from the building's roof and located on the East Lawn until 2006, when it was relocated to the new Sanborn Regional High School atrium. A new building for Sanborn Regional High School opened on August 28, 2006. The Seminary and other campus buildings are expected to be adapted for School Administrative Unit 17 office uses. One of the buildings on the campus is now being used by the Seacoast Charter school.
