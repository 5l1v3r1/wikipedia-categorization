 Petru Maior (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈpetru ˈmajor]; 1761 in Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureș, Romania) – 14 February 1821 in Budapest) was a Romanian writer who is considered one of the most influential personalities of the Age of Enlightenment in Transylvania (the Transylvanian School). Maior was a member of the Greek-Catholic clergy, a historian, philosopher, and linguist. The Buda Lexicon, a book published in 1825, included two texts by Petru Maior, Orthographia romana sive latino-valachica una cum clavi and Dialogu pentru inceputul linbei române, in which he introduced the letters ș for /ʃ/ and ț for /ts/, which have since been in use in the Romanian alphabet.
