The Monitor was one of the first newspapers in Poland, printed from 1765 to 1785, during the Polish Enlightenment. It was founded in March 1765 by Ignacy Krasicki and Franciszek Bohomolec, with active support from King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. It came out weekly, later semi-weekly. Its title was a tribute to the "small" Monitor published by Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.  Inspired by the English Spectator and the spirit of rationalism and religious tolerance, Monitor has contributed to a negative view of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth under the Wettin dynasty. The Monitor advocated reforms and criticized a degenerate Sarmatian culture and the abuses of "Golden Liberty." Editors:
