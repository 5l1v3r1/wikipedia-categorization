In the 1770s and 1780s, there was an effort among liberal-minded <a href=\"/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Parliament of the United Kingdom\">Members of Parliament</a> to reform the <a href=\"/wiki/British_electoral_system\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British electoral system\">British electoral system</a>. A disproportionately small number of electors voted for MPs and many seats were simply bought. <a href=\"/wiki/Christopher_Wyvill\" title=\"Christopher Wyvill\">Christopher Wyvill</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger\" title=\"William Pitt the Younger\">William Pitt the Younger</a> argued for additional seats to be added to the House of Commons and the <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Lennox,_3rd_Duke_of_Richmond\" title=\"Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond\">Duke of Richmond</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/John_Cartwright_(political_reformer)\" title=\"John Cartwright (political reformer)\">John Cartwright</a> advocated a more radical reform: \"the payment of MPs, an end to corruption and patronage in parliamentary elections, annual parliaments (partly to enable the speedy removal of corrupt MPs) and, preeminently and most controversially, universal manhood suffrage\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Both efforts failed and the reform movement appeared moribund in the mid-1780s.\n</p><p>Once the revolution in France began to demonstrate the power of popular agitation, the <a href=\"/wiki/Radicalism_(historical)#United_Kingdom\" title=\"Radicalism (historical)\">British reform movement</a> was reinvigorated. Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s in Britain was sparked by the publication of <a href=\"/wiki/Edmund_Burke\" title=\"Edmund Burke\">Edmund Burke's</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France\" title=\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a></i> (1790). Surprising his friends and enemies alike, Burke, who had supported the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Revolution\" title=\"American Revolution\">American Revolution</a>, criticized the French Revolution and the British radicals who had welcomed its early stages. While the radicals saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own <a href=\"/wiki/Glorious_Revolution\" title=\"Glorious Revolution\">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the <a href=\"/wiki/Monarchy\" title=\"Monarchy\">monarchy</a>, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the <a href=\"/wiki/English_Civil_War\" title=\"English Civil War\">English Civil War</a> (1642\u20131651) in which <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_I_of_England\" title=\"Charles I of England\">Charles I</a> had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In <i>Reflections</i> he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were challenged, the result would be endless anarchy. There was an immediate response from the British supporters of the French revolution, most notably <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft\" title=\"Mary Wollstonecraft\">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> in her <i><a href=\"/wiki/Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Men\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vindication of the Rights of Men\">Vindication of the Rights of Men</a></i> and <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Paine\" title=\"Thomas Paine\">Thomas Paine</a> in his <i><a href=\"/wiki/Rights_of_Man\" title=\"Rights of Man\">Rights of Man</a></i>. In this lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Revolution_Controversy\" title=\"Revolution Controversy\">Revolution Controversy</a>\", British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>1792 was the \"<i><a href=\"/wiki/Annus_mirabilis\" title=\"Annus mirabilis\">annus mirabilis</a></i> of eighteenth-century radicalism\": its most important texts, such as <i>Rights of Man</i>, were published and the influence of the radical associations was at its height. In fact, it was as a result of the publication of the <i>Rights of Man</i> that such associations began to proliferate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The most significant groups, made up of artisans, merchants and others from the middling and lower sorts, were the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sheffield_Society_for_Constitutional_Information&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information (page does not exist)\">Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/London_Corresponding_Society\" title=\"London Corresponding Society\">London Corresponding Society</a> (LCS) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Society_for_Constitutional_Information\" title=\"Society for Constitutional Information\">Society for Constitutional Information</a> (SCI).<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> But it was not until these groups formed an alliance with the more genteel <a href=\"/wiki/Friends_of_the_People_Society\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friends of the People Society\">Society of the Friends of the People</a> that the government became concerned. When this sympathy became known, the government issued a <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_Against_Seditious_Writings_and_Publications\" title=\"Royal Proclamation Against Seditious Writings and Publications\">royal proclamation against seditious writings</a> on 21 May 1792. In a dramatic increase compared to the rest of the century, there were over 100 prosecutions for sedition in the 1790s alone.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals. They made an increasing number of political arrests and infiltrated the radical groups; they threatened to \"revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicized debating societies and to carry reformist literature\"; they seized the mail of \"suspected dissidents\"; and they supported groups that disrupted radical events and attacked radicals in the press.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, the British Government initiated the <a href=\"/wiki/Aliens_Act_1793\" title=\"Aliens Act 1793\">Aliens Act of 1793</a> in order to regulate the entrance of immigrants into Great Britain. Essentially, the Aliens Act enforced that aliens be recorded upon arrival and register with the local justice of the peace. Specifically, immigrants were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Overall, the Aliens Act reduced the number of immigrants into Great Britain out of fear that one of them may be an unwanted spy. Radicals saw this period as \"the institution of a system of terror, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Prelude:_Trials_of_Thomas_Paine.2C_John_Frost_and_Daniel_Isaac_Eaton\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prelude:_Trials_of_Thomas_Paine,_John_Frost_and_Daniel_Isaac_Eaton\">Prelude: Trials of Thomas Paine, John Frost and Daniel Isaac Eaton</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1794_Treason_Trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Prelude: Trials of Thomas Paine, John Frost and Daniel Isaac Eaton\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thomas_Paine\">Thomas Paine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1794_Treason_Trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Thomas Paine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Trial_of_Thomas_Paine\" title=\"Trial of Thomas Paine\">Trial of Thomas Paine</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Thomas_Paine.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Thomas_Paine.jpg/220px-Thomas_Paine.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"286\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Thomas_Paine.jpg/330px-Thomas_Paine.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Thomas_Paine.jpg/440px-Thomas_Paine.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2400\" data-file-height=\"3122\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Thomas_Paine.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Paine\" title=\"Thomas Paine\">Thomas Paine</a>; a painting by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Auguste_Milli%C3%A8re&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Auguste Milli\u00e8re (page does not exist)\">Auguste Milli\u00e8re</a> (1880), after an engraving by <a href=\"/wiki/William_Sharp_(engraver)\" title=\"William Sharp (engraver)\">William Sharp</a> after a portrait by <a href=\"/wiki/George_Romney_(painter)\" title=\"George Romney (painter)\">George Romney</a> (1792)</div></div></div>\n<p>The administration did not immediately begin to prosecute all of its detractors after the proclamation against seditious writings was issued.

Even then, the government did not actively pursue him, apart from spying on him and continuing its propaganda campaign against \"Mad Tom\". Paine's trial was delayed until December and he fled to France in the intervening months, apparently with the government's blessing, which was more interested in getting rid of such a troublesome citizen than trying him in person. Moreover, afraid that Paine might use his trial as a political platform, the government may not have wanted to prosecute Paine personally.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When the trial finally took place on 18 December 1792, its outcome was a foregone conclusion. The government, under Pitt's direction, had been lambasting Paine in the papers for months and the trial judge had negotiated the prosecution's arguments with them ahead of time. The radical <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Erskine,_1st_Baron_Erskine\" title=\"Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine\">Thomas Erskine</a> defended Paine by arguing that his pamphlet was part of an honorable English tradition of political philosophy that included the writings of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Milton\" title=\"John Milton\">John Milton</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/John_Locke\" title=\"John Locke\">John Locke</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/David_Hume\" title=\"David Hume\">David Hume</a>; he also pointed out that Paine was merely responding to the philosophical work of an MP, Burke. The Attorney-General argued that the pamphlet was clearly aimed at readers \"whose minds cannot be supposed to be conversant with subjects of this sort\" and cited its cheap price as evidence of its lack of serious intent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The prosecution did not even have to rebut Erskine's arguments; the jury informed the judge they had already decided Paine was guilty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"John_Frost\">John Frost</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1794_Treason_Trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: John Frost\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/John_Frost_(republican)\" title=\"John Frost (republican)\">John Frost</a> was a member of the SCI, a former associate of Pitt, an attorney and a friend of Paine's. On 6 November 1792 he got involved in a dispute with a friend over the French revolution in a tavern and was heard to say \"Equality, and No King\". This dispute was reported by publicans to government informers. When Frost went to Paris later that month, the government declared him an outlaw and encouraged him to stay in France. Frost, challenging the government to act, returned and surrendered himself to the authorities. Suggestions began to float around, from government and radical sources alike, that the government was embarrassed to prosecute Frost because of his former friendship with Pitt. But on 27 May, he was brought to trial for sedition. Erskine defended Frost, arguing that there was no seditious intent to his statement, his client was drunk, he was in a heated argument, and he was in a private space (the tavern). The Attorney-General contended that Frost \"was a man whose seditious intent was carried with him wherever he went\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The jury convicted him.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Daniel_Isaac_Eaton\">Daniel Isaac Eaton</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1794_Treason_Trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Daniel Isaac Eaton\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Daniel_Isaac_Eaton\" title=\"Daniel Isaac Eaton\">Daniel Isaac Eaton</a>, the publisher of the popular periodical <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Politics_for_the_People&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Politics for the People (page does not exist)\">Politics for the People</a></i>, was arrested on 7 December 1793 for publishing a statement by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Thelwall\" title=\"John Thelwall\">John Thelwall</a>, a radical lecturer and debater. Thelwall had made a speech that included an anecdote about a tyrannical gamecock named \"King Chanticleer\" who was beheaded for its despotism and Eaton reprinted it. Eaton was imprisoned for three months before his trial in an effort to bankrupt him and his family. In February 1794, he was finally brought to trial and defended by John Gurney. Gurney argued that the comment was an indictment of tyranny in general or of <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_XVI\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Louis XVI\">Louis XVI</a>, the king of France, and announced his dismay that anyone could think that the author meant <a href=\"/wiki/George_III\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George III\">George III</a>. \"Gurney went so far as to cheekily suggest that it was the Attorney-General who was guilty of <a href=\"/wiki/Seditious_libel\" title=\"Seditious libel\">seditious libel</a>; by supplying those innuendos he, not Eaton or Thelwall, had represented George III as a tyrant.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Everyone laughed uproariously and Eaton was acquitted; the membership of the radical societies skyrocketed.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Treason_Trials_of_1794\">Treason Trials of 1794</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=1794_Treason_Trials&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Treason Trials of 1794\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:John_Horne_Tooke.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/John_Horne_Tooke.jpg/220px-John_Horne_Tooke.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"269\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/John_Horne_Tooke.jpg/330px-John_Horne_Tooke.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/John_Horne_Tooke.jpg/440px-John_Horne_Tooke.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"655\" data-file-height=\"800\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:John_Horne_Tooke.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/John_Horne_Tooke\" title=\"John Horne Tooke\">John Horne Tooke</a></div></div></div>\n<p>The radical societies were briefly enjoying an upsurge in membership and influence. In the summer of 1793 several of them decided to convene in <a href=\"/wiki/Edinburgh\" title=\"Edinburgh\">Edinburgh</a> to decide on how to summon \"a great Body of the People\" to convince Parliament to reform, since it did not seem willing to reform itself. The government viewed this assembly as an attempt to set up an anti-parliament. In Scotland, three leaders of the convention were tried for sedition and sentenced to fourteen years of service in <a href=\"/wiki/Botany_Bay\" title=\"Botany Bay\">Botany Bay</a>. Such harsh sentences shocked the nation and while initially the societies believed that an insurrection might be necessary to resist such an overbearing government, their  rhetoric never materialized into an actual armed rebellion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Plans were made by some of the societies to meet again if the government became more hostile (e.g. if they <a href=\"/wiki/Habeas_corpus\" title=\"Habeas corpus\">suspended <i>habeas corpus</i></a>). In 1794, a plan was circulated to convene again, but it never got off the ground. The government, frightened however, arrested six members of the SCI and 13 members of the LCS on suspicion of \"treasonable practices\" in conspiring to assume \"a pretended general convention of the people, in contempt and defiance of the authority of parliament, and on principles subversive of the existing laws and constitution, and directly tending to the introduction of that system of anarchy and confusion which has fatally prevailed in France\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Over thirty men were arrested in all.

After the first committee report, the government introduced a bill in the <a href=\"/wiki/British_House_of_Commons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British House of Commons\">House of Commons</a> to suspend habeas corpus; thus, those arrested on suspicion of treason could be held without bail or charge until February 1795. In June 1794 the committee issued a second report, asserting that the radical societies had been planning at least to \"over-awe\" the sovereign and Parliament by the show of \"a great Body of the People\" if not to overthrow the government and install a French-style republic. They claimed that the societies had attempted to assemble a large armory for this purpose, but no evidence could be found for it, in the end.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> They were eventually charged with an assortment of crimes, but <a href=\"/wiki/Seditious_libel\" title=\"Seditious libel\">seditious libel</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Treason\" title=\"Treason\">treason</a> were the most severe. The government propagated the notion that the radicals had committed a new kind of treason, what they called \"modern\" or \"French\" treason.
