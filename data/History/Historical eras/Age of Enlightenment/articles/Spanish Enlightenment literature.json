In this century, Europe critically reviewed the established order. Reason and the critique prevailed, and the experimental method and studies founded on reason are impelled.\n</p><p>The anxiety for knowledge became general. Court meetings left place to the bourgeois salons, caf\u00e9s or cultural institutions. A necessity was felt to travel by reasons of study or pleasure, to know other languages, to make sport to keep the body fit or to improve the conditions of life of the citizens.\n</p><p>In this new attitude, the illustrated person is a philanthropist that worries about others, and proposes and undertakes reforms in the aspects related to the poor and society. They defended religious tolerance, and skepticism was put into practice and it was even reached to attack religions. In opposition to the absolute monarchies, <a href=\"/wiki/Montesquieu\" title=\"Montesquieu\">Montesquieu</a> defended the bases of modern democracy and the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers. The illustrated people wanted to enjoy freedom and to choose their own governors. All that inspired the motto of the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Revolution\" title=\"French Revolution\">French Revolution</a>: Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood.\n</p><p>The illustrated theories had their origin in England, although they reached their peak in France, where they were gathered in the <b><a href=\"/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die\" title=\"Encyclop\u00e9die\">Encyclop\u00e9die</a></b> (Encyclopedie, or reasoned dictionary of the sciences, the arts and the offices, 1751\u20131772), published by Jean Le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot.

The delay with regard to Europe was evident at the beginning of the 18th century. Nevertheless, some intellectuals since the end of the 17th century refused to leave the investigation; not exent of risks, they were always up-to-date about the European discoveries in astronomy, medicine, mathematics or botany. These scholars are the so-called <i>novatores</i> (\"innovating ones\", contemptuously called this way). They spread the theories of Galileo Galilei, Kepler, Linnaeus or Isaac Newton. Among the <i>novatores</i>, Juan de Cabriada, Antonio Hugo de Omerique, <a href=\"/wiki/Juan_Caramuel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Juan Caramuel\">Juan Caramuel</a>, Mart\u00ednez, Tosca and Corach\u00e1n stand out. In the 18th century, the legacy that they left was continued by other scientists like <a href=\"/wiki/Jorge_Juan_y_Santacilia\" title=\"Jorge Juan y Santacilia\">Jorge Juan</a>, Cosme Bueno, <a href=\"/wiki/Antonio_de_Ulloa\" title=\"Antonio de Ulloa\">Antonio de Ulloa</a>, etc.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Penetration_of_the_Enlightenment_in_Spain\">Penetration of the Enlightenment in Spain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Penetration of the Enlightenment in Spain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After the <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_War_of_Sucession\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spanish War of Sucession\">War of Succession</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Bourbon_house\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bourbon house\">Bourbons</a> found a Spain sunk in misery and ignorance. The <a href=\"/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula\" title=\"Iberian Peninsula\">Iberian Peninsula</a> hardly had seven million and a half inhabitants. With a French political conception, <a href=\"/wiki/Felipe_V\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Felipe V\">Felipe V</a> fortified the monarchic power and harnessed a process of centralization in the nation, abolishing the <a href=\"/wiki/Fuero\" title=\"Fuero\">fueros</a> and the laws of Arag\u00f3n and Catalonia. The Church maintained its dominion, although some religious orders like the <a href=\"/wiki/Company_of_Jesus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Company of Jesus\">Company of Jesus</a> fell, already at time of <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain\" title=\"Charles III of Spain\">Carlos III</a>. On the other hand, the common people, formed by livestock farmers, crop farmers, civil employees and marginalized people, lacked rights. The monarchs gradually reduced some privileges of the hereditary aristocracy and adopted a <i>regalista</i> or critical position in front of the Church, with the purpose of making a series of basic reforms. At the end of century, the quality of life of the Spaniards had been improved, as it is demonstrated by the increase of the population in almost three million inhabitants, a figure which is nevertheless smaller than the ones of other European countries.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg/220px-Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"337\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg/330px-Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"439\" data-file-height=\"672\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Estatutos_rae_1715big.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Cover of the first edition of <i>Foundation and statutes of the Royal Spanish Academy</i> (1715)</div></div></div>\n<p>Enlightenment ideas entered Spain through diverse ways:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The diffusion of the ideas of some illustrated people like <a href=\"/wiki/Gregorio_Mayans\" title=\"Gregorio Mayans\">Gregorio Mayans</a> and Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feijoo, <i>novatores</i> of the 18th century.</li>\n<li>The propagation of the French encyclopedic ideas (<a href=\"/wiki/Rousseau\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rousseau\">Rousseau</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Voltaire\" title=\"Voltaire\">Voltaire</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Montesquieu\" title=\"Montesquieu\">Montesquieu</a>), in spite of the censorship of the time to avoid its introduction in the Peninsula and the monitoring of the Inquisition.</li>\n<li>The translation of French books of all genres and the hiring of foreign or erudite professors in certain matters.</li>\n<li>The trips of study and knowledge of the European life and customs made by the scholars and intellectuals.</li>\n<li>The appearance of newspapers or publications where the illustrated ideas spread.</li>\n<li>The creation of a series of cultural institutions and \"Economic societies of friends of the country\" destined to promote the cultural, social and economic progress of Spain by means of the extension of the culture. The first of the societies was founded in the Basque Country in 1765, and soon they spread all over the nation. They were constituted by illustrated people coming from the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the clergy. In this century organisms of great importance were created, like the <a href=\"/wiki/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola\">Royal Spanish Academy</a>, founded for the benefit of the language, under the motto \"cleans, fixes and gives splendor\".

In 1813, after the War of Independence, the Meeting created by the Regency to make a general reform of education ordered the exclusive use of the Spanish in the university.\n</p><p>Many of the illustrated people, for the modernization of Spain, defended the implantation of education in other languages (French, English, Italian) in the centers, and the translation of outstanding works to Castilian. To the first were opposed those who defended the priority of the classic languages (Latin and Greek) as opposed to the modern ones, and to the second were opposed those who rejected the translations because they would introduce unnecessary foreign words in the Spanish language and would endanger its identity. Two positions arose thus: <b>casticismo</b>, that defended a pure language, without neither mixture of voices nor strange turns, with words documented by the authorities (the Royal Spanish Academy); and <b>purismo</b>, that was totally against the penetration of neologisms, mainly the foreign ones, blaming its opponents for being stainers of the language.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stages_of_the_literature_of_the_18th_century\">Stages of the literature of the 18th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Stages of the literature of the 18th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Three stages in the Spanish Literature of the 18th century can be distinguished:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Antibaroquism</b> (until 1750 approximately): Writers fought against the style of the last Baroque, considered to be excessively rhetorical and convoluted.

Feijoo saw the necessity of writing to move Spain away from its delay; with this intention, he gave a didactic character to his work, noticeably catholic, but with the intention that the new European currents penetrated, at least, in the illustrated classes. He was very critical with the superstitions and the false miracles.\n</p><p>Feijoo contributed to the consolidation of the Castilian as a cultured language by defending its use as opposed to the Latin, that still was used in the universities. He also accepted the introduction of new voices, when they were necessary, without concerning where they came.

Coming from an accommodated family, he studied law and he was destined to Seville, where he made epistolar contact with the Salmantine poetic School. In Madrid, as Mayor of House and Court, his political activity was in constant increase. After an exile, he was named minister of Grace and Justice by Godoy, and later, Advisor of State. When the confidence in the minister was lost, he was imprisoned in Majorca in the Castle of Bellver until the Riot of Aranjuez, that overthrew Godoy, gave him back the freedom. In 1808 he took part in the Central Meeting that confronted the Napoleonic army. He was persecuted by the French and he tried to be transferred to Cadiz, but the meteorological inclemencies forced him to take refuge in the Vega de Navia port, where he died.\n</p><p>Jovellanos began to write lyric poetry with the pastoral name (very common in his time) of Jovino, and with illustrated ideals. Like Cadalso, he satirized the uneducated aristocracy in his satire <i>A Arnesto</i>. But soon he got tired of the poetry, which he considered to be an adolescent game to which the reason was not applied, and which was improper of a respectable man. Curiously, years later he invites in verse to the insurrection of 1808 in the <i>Song for the Astures against the French</i>.\n</p><p>He also composed <i>The honest delinquent</i>, an illustrated reformist drama. A law had been promulgated that condemned the survivor of the duels to death, considering the offender and the victim equally guilty; Jovellanos based his drama on this, because for him only the offender was the culprit. The work follows the line of the sentimental comedy, so admired in France, and its tone is already Preromantic.\nClarity, concision and sobriety are the characteristic features of the didactic work of Jovellanos.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Jos.C3.A9_Cadalso\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jos\u00e9_Cadalso\">Jos\u00e9 Cadalso</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Jos\u00e9 Cadalso\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Josecadalso.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Josecadalso.jpg/220px-Josecadalso.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"257\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Josecadalso.jpg/330px-Josecadalso.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Josecadalso.jpg/440px-Josecadalso.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"658\" data-file-height=\"769\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Josecadalso.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Jos\u00e9 Cadalso</div></div></div>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Cadalso\" title=\"Jos\u00e9 Cadalso\">Jos\u00e9 Cadalso</a></div>\n<p>Jos\u00e9 Cadalso y V\u00e1zquez de Andrade (1741\u20131782) is another of the great prose writers of the 18th century. He wrote important literary works, whose most important creation was <i>Moroccan Letters</i>. It was said of him that he had a vast culture, probably enriched by his trips to England, France, Germany and Italy. He was a military man and he received the colonel rank. He was deeply in love with the actress Mar\u00eda Ignacia Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, whose excesses that she committed caused her death at a very early age. Cadalso tried to unearth her, action which caused his exile to Salamanca (ordered so that he was cured of his insanity). He was later destined to Extremadura, Andalusia, Madrid and finally Gibraltar, place where he died during the Great Siege of Gibraltar. His body was laid to rest in Santa Maria la Coronada Parish Church in <a href=\"/wiki/San_Roque,_C%C3%A1diz\" title=\"San Roque, C\u00e1diz\">San Roque, C\u00e1diz</a>.\n</p><p>As poet, and under the name of \"Dalmiro\", he composed the work <i>Leisures of my youth</i> (1771). His love towards the actress Mar\u00eda Ignacia Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez made him approach the dramatic world. Although he wrote three tragedies, only one of them was represented, and with little success, <i>Don Sancho Garc\u00eda, count of Castile</i> (1771). His work in prose is however more extensive. In <i>Dismal nights</i> he narrates in dialogue form his frustrated yearning for rescuing the body of Mar\u00eda Ignacia from the tomb. Entirely neoclassical is the book <i>The erudites to the violet</i>, against the false intellectuals; seven lessons that satirize those who try to know much studying little.\n</p><p>Nevertheless, the <i>Moroccan Letters</i> (1789), published posthumously, are the ones that give the most importance to the literary production of Cadalso. According to a very cultivated model in France (for example, the Persian Letters of <a href=\"/wiki/Montesquieu\" title=\"Montesquieu\">Montesquieu</a>), the author composes a book with ninety letters written between Gazel, moor that visits Spain, his Moroccan teacher and friend Ben-Beley, and Nu\u00f1o N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Christian friend of Gazel. They comment on the historical past of Spain and its present life, and they judge the work of the governors and the customs of the country.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lyric\">Lyric</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Lyric\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1737, <a href=\"/wiki/Ignacio_de_Luz%C3%A1n_Claramunt_de_Suelves_y_Gurrea\" title=\"Ignacio de Luz\u00e1n Claramunt de Suelves y Gurrea\">Ignacio de Luz\u00e1n</a> gathered the aesthetic ideas of the Neoclasicism in his <i>Po\u00e9tica</i>. This style prevailed in Spain imposing criteria of utility and service to the humanity, next to desires of aesthetic pleasure. The artistic ideals imported from France and the \"good taste\" and the courtesy dominated, while feelings and passions were repressed. The subjection to the norms was general, fleeing from the spontaneity and the imagination, which were replaced by the didactic eagerness.\n</p><p>The neoclassical poetry treated historical, customary and satirical subjects. In the variant denominated \"<a href=\"/wiki/Rococo\" title=\"Rococo\">Rococ\u00f3</a>\", more luxurious and recharged, the pastoral themes that raised the pleasure and the gallant love dominated. Habitual forms were odes, epistles, \"eleg\u00edas\" and romances.\n</p><p>Important names of the Spanish poetry are Juan Mel\u00e9ndez Vald\u00e9s, the maximum Spanish representative of the Rococ\u00f3, Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn and the story-tellers Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte and F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Samaniego.\n</p><p>The neoclassical literature was developed mainly in three cities: <a href=\"/wiki/Salamanca\" title=\"Salamanca\">Salamanca</a>, by people related to its University; <a href=\"/wiki/Seville\" title=\"Seville\">Seville</a>, with the influence of its assistant (position similar to mayor) Pablo de Olavide; and <a href=\"/wiki/Madrid\" title=\"Madrid\">Madrid</a>, around its boarding house of San Sebasti\u00e1n.

He was university professor in Salamanca, where he maintained friendship with Cadalso and Jovellanos. He worked as a jurist, occupying destinies in Zaragoza, Valladolid and finally in Madrid, where he worked as public prosecutor of the Supreme Court. Once that his mentor, Jovellanos, fell in misfortune before Godoy, his exile to Medina del Campo was ordered, later to Zamora and finally to Salamanca. He was pro-French during the War of Independence and he avoided being shot in Oviedo, but he had to exile himself after the defeat of the French army.\n</p><p>Two stages in the lyric of Mel\u00e9ndez Vald\u00e9s can be differentiated:\n</p>\n<ul><li>In the first one he feels attracted in his youth by the predominant Rococo poetry and the influence of Jos\u00e9 Cadalso. He composed anacreontic and pastoral poems with the love as predominant theme. From this first stage it is possible to emphasize the \u00e9gloga <i>Batilo</i>.</li>\n<li>Nevertheless, after the death of Cadalso, and following the advice of Jovellanos, he thought that the pastoral lyric was inappropriate of a magistrate, so he composed another type of poetry which would be in more agreement with his occupation. Like Jovellanos, he is aware of the social inequalities, he defends the necessity to undertake reforms that improve the life of the town, he criticizes the customs of the court, and his poetry becomes philosophical, sentimental and reflective.</li></ul>\n<p>His style in the beginnings was artificial and conventional, but later it became very well cared for and precise. He himself defined his intention when writing: \"I have taken care of explaining myself with nobility and of using a language worthy of the great subjects that I have treated\".\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Madrilenian_group:_the_story-tellers_Iriarte_and_Samaniego\">The Madrilenian group: the story-tellers Iriarte and Samaniego</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: The Madrilenian group: the story-tellers Iriarte and Samaniego\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main articles: <a href=\"/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_de_Iriarte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte\">Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Mar%C3%ADa_de_Samaniego\" title=\"F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda de Samaniego\">F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda de Samaniego</a></div>\n<p>In the court and in the bourgeois environment the reformist ideas of the 18th century penetrated quickly.

With the purpose of correcting defects and showing the rational values, they wrote fables.\nThey were Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte (La Orotava, Tenerife, 1750 - Madrid, 1791) and F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Samaniego: (La Guardia, \u00c1lava, 1745\u20131801).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Sevillian_school\">The Sevillian school</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: The Sevillian school\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Like Salamanca, the Sevillian city also had a great poetic tradition. In 1751 the <i>Academy of the Good Letters</i> was founded, which promoted the literary activity. As of 1760, and as a result of the arrival of Pablo de Olavide as intendant of the Government of Andalusia, the culture in that city was impelled remarkably. In 1776, that illustrated person is persecuted and jailed by the Inquisition.\n</p><p>By influence of Jos\u00e9 Cadalso and Mel\u00e9ndez, more recharged and colorist poems were written than in the Salmantine school, also influenced by <a href=\"/wiki/Fernando_de_Herrera\" title=\"Fernando de Herrera\">Fernando de Herrera</a>. In the Sevillian school poets like Manuel Mar\u00eda Arjona (1771\u20131820), Jos\u00e9 Marchena (1768\u20131820), Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Blanco (1775\u20131841) and Alberto Lista (1775\u20131848) stood out. They wrote patriotic poems urging to fight by the freedom, after the invasion of the French and the return of Fernando VII, already in the 19th century. Some of them finished in the exile.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Theater\">Theater</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Theater\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In theater, the main cultivators were those of the Madrilenian group. They were put under which the classic and modern rulers taught, and they created a theater which followed the political and moral interests of the time. Three tendencies existed:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The traditional tendency. During the first half of the 18th century the theater is in decay.</li>\n<li>The neoclassical tendency.</li>\n<li>The popular tendency. The <a href=\"/wiki/G%C3%A9nero_chico\" title=\"G\u00e9nero chico\">sainetes</a> enjoyed popular support. They were written in verse, related to the <a href=\"/wiki/Paso\" title=\"Paso\">pasos</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Entrem%C3%A9s\" title=\"Entrem\u00e9s\">entremeses</a> of the previous centuries. The most important author of sainetes was Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz.</li></ul>\n<p>Theater adopted the new fashions that arrived from France. In the neoclassical theater also the reason and the harmony prevailed as norm. The so-called \"rule of the three units\" was obeyed, which demanded a single action, a single scene and a coherent chronological time in the development of the dramatic action. The separation between the comical and the tragic was established. The imaginative containment prevailed, eliminating everything which was considered exaggerated or of \"bad taste\". An educative and moralizing purpose was adopted, which would serve to spread the universal values of culture and the progress.\n</p><p>Although less rationalist than other genres, tragedy cultivated historical subjects, as is the case of the most known, <i>Raquel</i>, of <a href=\"/wiki/Vicente_Garc%C3%ADa_de_la_Huerta\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vicente Garc\u00eda de la Huerta\">Vicente Garc\u00eda de la Huerta</a>. But without doubt the most representative theater of the moment was that of Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn, creator of what has been called \"moratinian comedy\". As opposed to the tragic genre, the most common then, and which his father Nicol\u00e1s practiced, and as opposed to the customary and kind sainete of Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz, Morat\u00edn Jr ridiculed the vices and the customs of his time, in a clear attempt to turn the theater into a vehicle to moralize the custom.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Leandro_Fernandez_de_Morat.C3.ADn\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Leandro_Fernandez_de_Morat\u00edn\">Leandro Fernandez de Morat\u00edn</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Leandro Fernandez de Morat\u00edn\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg/220px-Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg/330px-Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg/440px-Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"768\" data-file-height=\"1024\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn (1799), by <a href=\"/wiki/Goya\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Goya\">Goya</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Real_Academia_de_Bellas_Artes_de_San_Fernando\" title=\"Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando\">Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando</a></div></div></div>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Leandro_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn\" title=\"Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn\">Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn</a></div>\n<p>Son of <a href=\"/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Morat%C3%ADn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn\">Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn</a>, Leandro (Madrid, 1760 - Paris, 1828) is the main author of theater in the 18th century. His neoclassical direction is due to his father. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jovellanos and Godoy, he traveled by England, France (he was present at the outbreak of the French Revolution) and Italy. He fell enamored with Paquita Mu\u00f1oz, much younger than him, whom he did not marry according to his desire of not contracting commitments. He was pro-French and he accepted from Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte the position of Great Librarian, reason why he was exiled to France, where he died  after the defeat of the invaders.\n</p><p>As poet, he wrote satirical poems like the <i>Satire against the introduced vices in the Castilian poetry</i>, theme that he returns to treat in prose in <i>The defeat of the pedantic ones</i>. The present critic considers Moratinos to be the most outstanding lyric writer of the 18th century. In the poem <i>Eleg\u00eda a las musas</i>, being already old, he sayd goodbye to the poetry and the theater, which had been his reason of living.\n</p><p>As dramatic author, he wrote solely five comedies that gave a great reputation to him among illustrated people. In <i>The old man and the girl</i> and <i>The yes of the girls</i> (1806), he defends the right that the woman has to accept or not her spouse against the imposition of the family, because until then it was frequent to marry young girls with wealthy old men. In <i>La mojigata</i>, he criticizes the hypocrisy and the false devotion. Another comedy is <i>The baron</i>, and finally <i>The new comedy or The coffee</i> (1792) is a ridicule towards the authors who ignore the aristotelian rules.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ram.C3.B3n_de_la_Cruz\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ram\u00f3n_de_la_Cruz\">Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_de_la_Cruz\" title=\"Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz\">Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz</a></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/G%C3%A9nero_chico\" title=\"G\u00e9nero chico\">sainete</a>-writer Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz (Madrid, 1731\u20131794) was one of the most applauded authors by the public and most criticized by the illustrated people (although some of them, seeing the popular support of his work, withdrew). He began writing tragedies of neoclassical cut, rejecting the \"out of order\" theater that people preferred. Nevertheless, his economic necessities made him approach less illustrated genres but more acclaimed by the public and the actors. This way he began to write <a href=\"/wiki/Zarzuela\" title=\"Zarzuela\">zarzuelas</a> of Spanish thematic and, simultaneously, sainetes. Of these he wrote more than four hundred, generally in octosyllabic verses, and some in endecasyllabic. The personages of this theater subgenus are popular (nerve girls, smart boys, deceived husbands, ruined bricklayers, chestnut sellers, nobleman of low grade, etc.) and the action usually happens in Madrid: <i>The prairie of San Isidro</i>, <i>El Prado in the evening</i>, <i>El Rastro in the morning</i>; its end sometimes wants to be exemplary. The most famous of his sainetes is <i>Manolo</i>, satire of the theater that his neoclassical enemies wrote. With his maxim \"I write and the truth dictates\", he could find in the people an inexhaustible source, the same that, with greater depth, would inspire <a href=\"/wiki/Francisco_de_Goya\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Francisco de Goya\">Francisco de Goya</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Preromanticism\">Preromanticism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Enlightenment_literature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Preromanticism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some works of the Salmantine school augur the beginning of the Romanticism.
