Social Age  encompasses both societal and technological changes succeeding the Information Age.  It is divergent from the Information Age as it gives more prominence to social factors when adopting and/or extending technology and information.  It further broadens the definition of Attention Age because the Social Age focuses on many forms of societal interactions including online relationships, collaboration and sharing.
