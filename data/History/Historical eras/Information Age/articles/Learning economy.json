Different kinds of learning and economically relevant types of knowledge can likewise be identified. It is argued that pure <a href=\"/wiki/Market_economy\" title=\"Market economy\">market economies</a>, if such existed, would have severe problems in terms of learning and innovation. The 'learning economy' is a <a href=\"/wiki/Mixed_economy\" title=\"Mixed economy\">mixed economy</a> in a fundamental sense.\n</p><p>In the public debate, knowledge is increasingly presented as the crucial factor in the development of both society and the economy. In a growing number of publications from the <a href=\"/wiki/European_Commission\" title=\"European Commission\">European Commission</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> it is emphasised that we, citizens of member countries, currently operate in \u2018a <a href=\"/wiki/Knowledge-based_economy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Knowledge-based economy\">knowledge-based economy</a>\u2019.

This literature was initially known more for its hyperbole and faddishness than for its academic/empirical integrity. More recently [2011] however, empirical research from cross-disciplinary fields such as innovation studies are altering that perception.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Learning_economy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Knowledge_economy\" title=\"Knowledge economy\">Knowledge economy</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Learning_economy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Lundvall and Johnson 1994, Lundvall 1996</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1326\nCached time: 20180909151310\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.028 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.038 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 91/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 332/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 80/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 327/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.004/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 525 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   25.725      1 Template:Reflist\n100.00%   25.725      1 -total\n 10.80%    2.778      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:624918-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909151310 and revision id 757053818\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Learning Economy","*":"Business_terms"},{"sortkey":"Learning Economy","*":"Economics_catchphrases"},{"sortkey":"Learning Economy","*":"Information_Age"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"European Commission"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Knowledge-based economy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Knowledge economy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Market economy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Mixed economy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"NASDAQ"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Criticism and scarcity of empirical studies","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Learning_economy","byteoffset":1023,"anchor":"Criticism_and_scarcity_of_empirical_studies"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Learning_economy","byteoffset":1753,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Learning_economy","byteoffset":1790,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Learning economy","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Learning Economy"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6510172"}]}}
