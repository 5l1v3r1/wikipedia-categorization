  The Ikshvaku dynasty, in Puranic literature, was a dynasty  founded by the legendary king Ikshvaku. Ikshvaku, literally means "bitter cucumber" . The dynasty is also known as Sūryavaṁśa (the Solar dynasty). Lord Rama belonged to the Ikshavaku dynasty.  Twenty-two out of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankara belonged to this dynasty.  Rishabha is present in both Hindu as well as Jain mythology. Both refers to the same person. According to the Buddhist texts, Prince Siddhartha belonged to this dynasty. The important personalities belonging to this royal house are Mandhatri , Muchukunda , Ambarisha , Bharata Chakravartin, Bahubali, Harishchandra, Dilīpa, Sagara,  Raghu, Rama and Pasenadi. Although, both the Hindu Puranas and the Buddhist texts include Shuddodhana, Gautama Buddha and Rahula in their accounts of the Ikshvaku dynasty, but according to the Buddhist texts, Mahasammata, an ancestor of Ikshvaku was the founder of this dynasty,  who was elected by the people as the first king of the present era. According to the Puranas, supreme preceptor of the Ikshvaku dynasty was sage Vashishta. In Hinduism, Ikshvaku, is the grandson of Vivasvan or Surya and son of Vaivasvata Manu. They ruled from the Kosala Kingdom, today known as Awadh in the state of Uttar Pradesh along the banks of river Sarayu with saketa, Ayodhya today as their capital. Ikshvaku is the first king who executed the Manusmrti or religious rules of Hindu living which were composed by his father Manu. Ikshvaku, ruled as Monarch at the beginning of the Satya Yuga or  First yuga, had hundred sons. His estates descended to his eldest son Vikukshi.  The lists of kings of Ikṣvāku or Aikṣvāka dynasty are found in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Harivamsha and the Puranas. The Raghuvamsha of Kalidasa also mentions the names of the kings of this dynasty.   The genealogy of the Ikshvaku dynasty  to Rama is mentioned in the Ramayana in two lists . The only difference between the two lists is that, Kukshi is mentioned only in the second list . In the first list, Vikukshi is mentioned as the son of Ikshavaku. The descendants of Vikukshi are known as Vikauwa.   The Puranas provide a genealogical list from Kusha to Brihadbala, who was killed by Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata war. This list is corroborated by the Raghuvamsha till Agnivarna:  83 Atithi (Contemporary to Chandravanshi King Turvasu -2) 84 Nishadha was the founder of Nishada Kingddom. 85 Nala 86 Nabhas 87 Pundarika 88 Kshemadhanvan 89 Devanika 90 Ahinagu 91 Roop 92 Rudra 93 Paripatra 94 Dala (or Balasthala) 95 Chhal (or Anal) 96 Ukya 97 Vajranabha 98 Avalash (or Shankhanaad) 99 Vighruti (or Vyushitashva) 100 Vishvasaha-2 101 Hiranyanabha (He was student of Sage Jaimini, Yagnyavalkya has accepted him as his teacher) 102 Pushya 103 Dhruvasandhi 104 Sudarshana-2 106 Agnivatna-2 107 Shighra 108 Maru-2 109 Prasushruta 110 Susandhi (or Sugandhi) 111 Amarshana and Sahasvanta, the sons of Susandhi 112 Mahasvan 113 Vishwasahav 114 Prasenjit-1 115 Takshaka  from Sri Rama to Brihadbalam 36 generation were passed in ikshvakuvansha. Average lifespan of Ikshvakuvanshi Kings in Dwaparayuga was 24,682 years. Maximum Lifespan of human became 200 years in last 400 years of Dwaparayuga. The Puranas also provide the list of the kings from Brihadbala to the last ruler Sumitra. But these lists mention Shakya as an individual, and incorporate the names of Shakya, Shuddodhana, Siddhartha (Gautama Buddha) and Rahula between Sanjaya and Prasenajit. The names of the kings are:  117 Brihatkshaya (or Bruhadrunam) 118 Urukriya (or Gurukshep) 119 Vatsavyuha 120 Prativyoma 121 Bhaanu 122 Divakara (or Divak) 123 Veer Sahadeva 124 Brihadashva-2 125 Bhanuratha (or Bhanumaan) 126 Pratitashva 127 Supratika 128 Marudeva 129 Sunakshatra 130 Pushkara (or Kinnara) 131 Antariksha 132 Suvarna (or Sutapaa) 133 Sumitra (or Amitrajit) 134 Bruhadaraaj (Okkaka) 135 Barhi  (Okkamukha) 136 Kritanjaya  (Sivisamjaya) 137 Ranajjaya (Sihassara) 138 Sanjaya (Mahakoshala or Jayasena) 139 Shakya (Sihahanu) 140 Śuddhodana (ruler of Shakya Republic of Kapilavastu) 141 Siddhartha (or Gautama Buddha)  142 Rāhula, the only son of Gautam Buddha 143 Prasenajit (Born when Siddhartha was of age 27 years) 144 Kshudraka (or Kuntala) 145 Ranaka (or Kulaka) 146 Suratha 147 Sumitra King Sumitra was Last ruler of Ikshvakuvansh/Suryavansha.

[page needed] The Buddhist text, Mahavamsa (II, 1-24) traces the origin of the Shakyas to king Okkaka (Pali equivalent to Sanskrit Ikshvaku) and gives their genealogy from Mahasammata, an ancestor of Okkaka. This list comprises the names of a number of prominent kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty, namely, Mandhata and Sagara.  The genealogy according to the Mahavamsa is as follows:   The Ikshvaku dynasty has a significant place in Jainism, as twenty-two Tirthankaras were born in this dynasty.
