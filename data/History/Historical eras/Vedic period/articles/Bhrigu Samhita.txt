 The Bhrigu Saṃhitā is a Sanskrit astrological (Jyotisha) treatise attributed in its introduction to Maharishi Bhrigu, one of the Saptarishis (seven sages) of the Vedic period. Its introductory chapter states that it was compiled by the sage out of compassion for humanity so that humanity could cope with the pressures of its existence and move towards a more spiritual nature.  The Bhrigu Samhita claims to contain predictions about current and future lives as well as information about past lives. Bhrigu's ashram 'Deepostak' was located near Dhosi Hill in present-day Haryana-Rajasthan border in India. Major parts of the Bhṛgu Saṃhitā were lost or destroyed.  Maharishi Bhrigu was the first compiler of predictive astrology. He compiled about 500,000 horoscopes and recorded the life details and events of various persons. This formed a database for further research and study. This study culminated in the birth of the science (Śāstra) of determining the quality of time (Horā) and is the Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra. These Horoscopes were based upon the planetary positions of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rāhu (North Node of the Moon) and Ketu (South Node of the Moon). After that, Maharishi Bhṛigu gave his predictions on different types of horoscopes compiled by him with the help of Lord Gaṇeśa in a brief and concise manner. The total permutations/possible horoscope charts that can be drawn with this is about 45 million. Maharishi taught this art of predictions to his son (Śukra) and other pupils.
