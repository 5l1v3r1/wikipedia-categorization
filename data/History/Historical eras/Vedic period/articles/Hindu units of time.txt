 Hindu texts describe units of Kala measurements, from microseconds to Trillions of years.  According to these texts, time is cyclic, which repeats itself forever.  Various fragments of time are used in Hindu Scriptures like Vedas, Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Puran, Mahabharata, Suryasidhanta etc. A summary of the Hindu metrics of time (kāla vyavahāra) follows.  The Lifespan of the pitras is 100 years of pitras (3,000 Solar years).  The life span of any Hindu deva spans nearly (or more than) 4.5 million years. Statistically, we can also look it as: The Viṣṇu Purāṇa Time measurement section of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa Book I Chapter III explains the above as follows: (2 Kalpas constitute a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion human years) One day of Brahma is divided into 1000 parts called charaṇas.  The four yugas which come one after the other are as follows (along with their durations):  The cycle repeats itself, so altogether there are 1,000 cycles of Mahā-Yuga in one day of Brahma. Currently, 50 years of Brahma have elapsed. The last Kalpa at the end of the 50th year is called Padma Kalpa. We are currently in the first 'day' of the 51st year.  This Brahma's day, Kalpa is named as Shveta-Varaha Kalpa. Within this Day, six Manvantaras have already elapsed  and this is the seventh Manvantara, named as – Vaivasvatha Manvantara (or Sraddhadeva Manvantara). Within the Vaivasvatha Manvantara, 27 Mahayugas  (4 Yugas together is a Mahayuga), and the Krita,  Treta and Dwapara Yugas of the 28th Mahayuga have elapsed. This Kaliyuga is in the 28th Mahayuga. This Kaliyuga began in the year 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian Calendar.  Since 50 years of Brahma have already elapsed, this is the second Parardha, also called as Dvithiya Parardha. 432000 × 10 × 1000 × 2 = 8.64 billion years (2 Kalpa (day and night)) 8.64 × 109 × 30 × 12 = 3.1104 Trillion Years (1 year of Brahma)3.1104 × 1012 × 50 = 155.52 trillion years (50 years of Brahma) (6 × 71 × 4320000) + 7 × 1.728 × 10^6 = 1852416000 years elapsed in first six Manvataras, and Sandhi Kalas in the current Kalpa 27 × 4320000 = 116640000 years elapsed in first 27 Mahayugas of the current Manvantara 1.728 × 10^6 + 1.296 × 10^6 + 864000 = 3888000 years elapsed in current Mahayuga 3102 + 2017 = 5119 years elapsed in current Kaliyuga. So the total time elapsed since current Brahma is 155520000000000 + 1852416000 + 116640000 + 3888000 + 5119 = 155,521,972,949,120 years (one hundred fifty-five trillion, five hundred twenty-one billion, nine hundred seventy-two million, nine hundred forty-nine thousand, one hundred twenty years) as of 2018 AD Total age of Brahma is 100 (Brahma Years) which is equal to 311,040,000,000,000 Human years The current Kali Yuga began at midnight 17 February / 18 February in 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar.  As per the information above about Yuga periods, only 5,120 years are passed out of 432,000 years of current Kali Yuga, and hence another 426,880 years are left to complete this 28th Kali Yuga of Vaivaswatha Manvantara.[note 1]
