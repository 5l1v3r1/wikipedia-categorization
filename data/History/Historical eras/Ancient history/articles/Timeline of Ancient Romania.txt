This section of the timeline of Romanian history concerns events from Late Neolithic (c. 3900 BC) till Late Antiquity (c. 400 AD), who took place in or are directly related with the territory of modern Romania. The date used as the end of the ancient era is entirely arbitrary. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. Western scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the fall of Rome in AD 476, the death of the emperor Justinian I in AD 565, or the coming of Islam in AD 632 as the end of ancient European history.
