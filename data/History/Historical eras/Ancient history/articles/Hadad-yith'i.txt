Hadad-yith'i (Adad-it'i, Hadd-yith'i) was governor of the land of Guzana located in northern Syria (c. 850 B.C.E.)  He was the son of Sassu-nuri, who was also the governor of the land of Guzana.  Knowledge of Hadad-yith'i's rule comes largely from the statue found at the Tell el Fakhariya.  The carving known as the Tell el Fakhariya bilingual inscription provides information about his reign.  During this time, Guzana was a vassal to Assyria making Hadad-yith'i the governor of Guzana, however to the local people of Guzana he was their king, thus making his role a dual status.  In February 1979 a farmer uncovered a life-size basalt statue of a man at the edge of Tell el Fakhariya on a branch of the Khabur River, opposite Tell Halaf.  The standing figure is carved in Assyrian style, without any emblems of rank.  During the Neo-Assyrian period stone statues are found depicting either Assyrian kings or gods. Currently there are only three known stone statues with images of more common people.  The statue of Hadad-yith'i is one of the three.
