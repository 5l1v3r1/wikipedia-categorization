Adrián de Moxica (1453 – c. 1499) was a Spanish nobleman and explorer. Adrian de Moxica was born to a Spanish noble family of Basque descent. In 1498 he accompanied Christopher Columbus on his third journey to the Americas, where he participated in the rebellion against Columbus in 1499 led by Francisco Roldán. Although the rebellion was successful, de Moxica was arrested by Columbus' troops and hanged. Adrián de Moxica was portrayed by Michael Wincott in the Ridley Scott's 1992 film 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Moxica fills a prominent role in the film as Columbus' nemesis, who assumes the role as the leader of Roldán's rebellion with his friend Hernando de Guevara. In the film, Moxica cuts off the hand of a Native American who claimed to have found no gold to pay for his taxes. In reality, it was Columbus who introduced the practice of mutilation as punishment, as discovered in a 2006 report . This contrasts with the benevolent Columbus portrayed in the movie.
