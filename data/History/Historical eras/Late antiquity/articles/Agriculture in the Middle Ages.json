Compared to the Roman period, agriculture in the Middle Ages in western Europe became more focused on self-sufficiency. The <a href=\"/wiki/Feudalism\" title=\"Feudalism\">Feudal</a> period began about 1000 CE.  The agricultural population under feudalism in northern Europe was typically organized into <a href=\"/wiki/Manor\" title=\"Manor\">manors</a> consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a <a href=\"/wiki/Lord\" title=\"Lord\">Lord</a> of the Manor, with a <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Catholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman Catholic\">Roman Catholic</a> church and priest.  Most of the people living on the manor were <a href=\"/wiki/Peasant\" title=\"Peasant\">peasant</a> farmers or <a href=\"/wiki/Serf\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serf\">serfs</a> who grew crops for themselves and either labored for the lord and church or paid rent for their land.  <a href=\"/wiki/Barley\" title=\"Barley\">Barley</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Wheat\" title=\"Wheat\">wheat</a> were the most important crops in most of Europe; <a href=\"/wiki/Oats\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oats\">oats</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rye\" title=\"Rye\">rye</a> were also grown, along with a variety of vegetables and fruits. <a href=\"/wiki/Oxen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oxen\">Oxen</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Horses\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horses\">horses</a> were used as draft animals. <a href=\"/wiki/Sheep\" title=\"Sheep\">Sheep</a> were raised for wool and <a href=\"/wiki/Pigs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pigs\">pigs</a> for meat.    \n</p><p>Crop failures due to bad weather were frequent throughout the Middle Ages and famine was often the result.

First was the fall of the western <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_Empire\" title=\"Roman Empire\">Roman Empire</a> which began to lose territory to \"barbarian\" invaders about 400 CE. The last emperor abdicated in 476 CE.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Thereafter, the lands and people of the former western Roman Empire would be divided among different ethnic groups, whose rule was often ephemeral and constantly in flux. Unifying factors of Europe were the gradual adoption of the <a href=\"/wiki/Christianity\" title=\"Christianity\">Christian religion</a> by most Europeans<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Latin\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a> as a common language of international communication, scholarship, and science.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>    \n</p><p>Secondly was an era of global cooling which started in 536 CE and ended about 660 CE.  The cooling was caused by volcanic eruptions in 536, 540, and 547.  The Byzantine historian <a href=\"/wiki/Procopius\" title=\"Procopius\">Procopius</a> said that \"the sun put forth it's light without brightness.\" Summer temperatures in Europe dropped as much as 2.5 degrees centigrade (4.5 degrees fahrenheit) and the sky was dimmed from volcanic dust in the atmosphere for 18 months, sufficient to cause crop failures and famine. Temperatures remained lower than the preceding Roman period for more than one hundred years. The  <a href=\"/wiki/Late_Antique_Little_Ice_Age\" title=\"Late Antique Little Ice Age\">Late Antique Little Ice Age</a> preceded, and may have influenced, a number of disruptive events, including pandemics, human migration, and political turmoil.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Third, was the <a href=\"/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian\" title=\"Plague of Justinian\">Plague of Justinian</a> which began in 541 CE, spread throughout Europe, and recurred periodically until 750. The plague may have killed up to 25 percent of the people of the eastern Roman or <a href=\"/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\" title=\"Byzantine Empire\">Byzantine Empire</a> and a similar percentage in western and northern Europe. The double impact on population of climatic cooling and the plague led to reduced harvests of grain.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/John_of_Ephesus\" title=\"John of Ephesus\">John of Ephesus</a>'s account of travel through rural areas speaks of \"crops of wheat...white and standing but there was no one reap them and store the wheat\" and \"Vineyards, whose picking season came and went\" with nobody to pick and press the grapes. John also speaks of the \"severe winter\", presumably caused by volcanic dust.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The consequence of these factors was that the population of Europe was substantially less in 600 CE than it had been in 500 CE.

Historian Peter Sarris has identified the characteristics of feudal society in sixth century Italy, and even earlier in the Byzantine Empire and Egypt. One of the differences between the villa and medieval manor was that the agriculture of the villa was commercially oriented and specialized while the manor was directed toward self-sufficiency. <sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>  \n</p><p>Slavery, important for the agricultural labor force of the Roman Empire, died out in western Europe by 1100 CE.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> The slaves of the Roman Empire were property, like livestock, with no rights of personhood and could be sold or traded at the will of his owner.  Similarly, The serf was tied to the land and could not leave his servitude, but his tenure on the land was secure. If the manor changed owners the serfs remained on the land.

Moreover, with the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/Carolingian_Empire\" title=\"Carolingian Empire\">Carolingian Empire</a> (800-888 CE), the power of kings declined and the central authority was little felt.

Agricultural land in the Middle Ages under feudalism was usually organized in manors.  The medieval manor consisted of several hundred (or sometimes thousand) acres of land.  A large manor house served as the home or part-time home of the lord of the manor. Some manors were under the authority of <a href=\"/wiki/Bishop\" title=\"Bishop\">bishops</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Abbot\" title=\"Abbot\">abbots</a> of the Catholic church. Some lords owned more than one manor, and the church controlled large areas. Within the lands of a manor, a parish church and a nucleated village housing the farmers was usually near the manor house.  The manor house, church, and village were surrounded by cultivated and fallow land, woods, and pasture.  Some of the land was the demesne of the lord; some was allocated to individual farmers, and some to the parish priest. Some of the woods and pasture were held in common and used for grazing and wood-gathering. Most manors had a mill for grinding grain into flour and an oven to bake bread.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fields\">Fields</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agriculture_in_the_Middle_Ages&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Fields\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Three_Field_System.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Three_Field_System.svg/250px-Three_Field_System.svg.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Three_Field_System.svg/375px-Three_Field_System.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Three_Field_System.svg/500px-Three_Field_System.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Three_Field_System.svg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The three field system common to Medieval Europe.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Aiketrigs.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Aiketrigs.JPG/250px-Aiketrigs.JPG\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Aiketrigs.JPG/375px-Aiketrigs.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Aiketrigs.JPG/500px-Aiketrigs.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"2288\" data-file-height=\"1712\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Aiketrigs.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The distinctive ridge and furrow pattern of the Middle Ages survive in this open field in Scotland.</div></div></div>\n<p>The field systems in Medieval Europe included the <a href=\"/wiki/Open-field_system\" title=\"Open-field system\">open-field system</a>, so called because there were no barriers between fields belonging to different farmers. The landscape was one of long and uncluttered views.  In its archetypal form, cultivated land consisted of long, narrow strips of land in a distinctive <a href=\"/wiki/Ridge_and_furrow\" title=\"Ridge and furrow\">ridge and furrow</a> pattern.  Individual farmers owned or farmed several different strips of land scattered around the farming area.  The reason for farmers possessing scattered strips of land was apparently to reduce risk; if the crop in one strip failed, it might thrive in another strip.  The lord of the manor also had strips of land scattered around the fields as did the parish priest for the upkeep of the church. The open-field system required cooperation among the residents of the community and with the lord and the priest. \"Strips of land were cultivated individually, yet were subject to communal rotations and (typically) communal regulation of cropping.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>    \n</p><p>Two patterns of cultivation were typical of the open-field system.  In the first, the arable land was divided into two fields.  One half was cultivated and the other one was left fallow every year. Crops were rotated between the two fields every year, with the fallow field being allowed to recover its fertility and used for livestock grazing when not dedicated to crops. The two-field system continued to be  most prevalent throughout the Middle Ages in dry-summer Mediterranean climates in which grain crops were planted in fall and harvested in spring, the summer being too dry for spring-planted crops to prosper.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>     \n</p><p>A three-field pattern was typical of the later Middle Ages in northern Europe with its wetter climate.  One field was planted in fall, one field was planted in spring, and the third field was left fallow. Crops were rotated from year to year and field to field. Thus, cultivation was more intensive than it was under the two-field pattern.  In both patterns, common areas of wood and pasture as well as fallowed fields were used for communal grazing and wood-gathering.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>   \n</p><p>The woods and meadows comprising common lands were open to exploitation to all farmers in the manor, but under strict management of the number of livestock allowed each farmer to avoid over grazing.

The strips of land cultivated by farmers were more concentrated, sometimes into a single block of land rather than scattered holdings. Crop decisions were often made by individuals or a small group of farmers rather than a whole village.  An individual farmer might possess not only cultivated land, but woods and pastures, rather than the commons of the pure open-field system.

Moreover, because of population growth after 1000 CE, marginal lands, pasture, and woodlands were converted into arable lands which further reduced the number of farm animals and the quantity of manure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-63\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-63\">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup>    \n</p><p>The earliest evidence of progress in increasing productivity comes in the 14th and 15th centuries from the <a href=\"/wiki/Low_Countries\" title=\"Low Countries\">Low Countries</a> of the Netherlands and <a href=\"/wiki/Belgium\" title=\"Belgium\">Belgium</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Flanders\" title=\"Flanders\">Flanders</a> in northern France.

The Black Death of 1347-1352 was more lethal, but the Great Famine was the worst natural catastrophe of the later Middle Ages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-71\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-71\">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Technological_innovation\">Technological innovation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agriculture_in_the_Middle_Ages&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Technological innovation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg/300px-Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"91\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg/450px-Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg/600px-Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4327\" data-file-height=\"1311\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A medieval plow.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Medieval_horse_team.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Medieval_horse_team.jpg/250px-Medieval_horse_team.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"155\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Medieval_horse_team.jpg/375px-Medieval_horse_team.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Medieval_horse_team.jpg/500px-Medieval_horse_team.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2398\" data-file-height=\"1484\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Medieval_horse_team.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Plow horses.

These two plows enabled medieval farmers to exploit the fertile but heavy clay soils of northern Europe.  In the Roman era and on light soils, the <a href=\"/wiki/Ard_(plough)\" title=\"Ard (plough)\">ard</a> or scratch plow had sufficed. The mouldboard and heavy plows turned the soil over which facilitated the control of weeds and their incorporation into the soil, increasing fertility. Mouldboard plowing also produced the familiar <a href=\"/wiki/Ridge_and_furrow\" title=\"Ridge and furrow\">ridge and furrow</a> pattern of medieval fields which facilitated drainage of excess moisture.  \"By allowing for better field drainage, access [to] the most fertile soils, and saving of peasant labor time, the heavy plow stimulated food production and, as a consequence 'population growth, specialization of function, urbanization, and the growth of leisure.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-72\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-72\">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Two additional advances coming into general use in Europe about 1000 CE were the <a href=\"/wiki/Horse_collar\" title=\"Horse collar\">horse collar</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Horseshoe\" title=\"Horseshoe\">horseshoe</a>.  The horse collar increased the pulling capacity of a horse. The horseshoe protected a horse's hooves.

For example, in an examination of skeletons, the average height of males in northern Europe (<a href=\"/wiki/Scandinavia\" title=\"Scandinavia\">Scandinavia</a>, the Netherlands, and England) who died around the year 1000 CE was 173.4 centimetres (68.3&#160;in).  Average stature in northern Europe declined thereafter, reaching a low in the 17th and 18th century when the average height of males was 167 centimetres (66&#160;in). The average height of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its access to necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.  Cities were notoriously unhealthy until the 19th century and thus the rural life of the medieval farmer may have been healthy by comparison.<sup id=\"cite_ref-76\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-76\">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A study of 9,477 skeletons collected from all of Europe reached a similar conclusion that European men in the Middle Ages were slightly taller than their Roman ancestors and early modern successors. The average height of men during the Roman Empire was about 170.0 centimetres (66.9&#160;in).  In the 6th century, shortly after the traditional date for the  fall of Rome, average height jumped to 172.0 centimetres (67.7&#160;in), and men remained slightly taller than the Roman average for most of the Middle Ages.  Average height of men in Europe reached a low point of less than 169.0 centimetres (66.5&#160;in) in the 17th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-77\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-77\">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Agriculture_in_the_Middle_Ages&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Heather, Peter (2006), <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 193-199, 429-430</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Caltron, J.H Hayas (1953),<i>Christianity and Western Civilization</i>, Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, p.2</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dictionary of Medieval Latin,\" <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.dmlbs.ox.ac.uk/british-medieval-latin/language/latin-in-the-middle-ages\">http://www.dmlbs.ox.ac.uk/british-medieval-latin/language/latin-in-the-middle-ages</a>, accessed 24 Jul 2018</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Zielinski, Sarah (2015), <i>Smithsonian Magazine,</i> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/sixth-century-misery-tied-not-one-two-volcanic-eruptions-180955858/\">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/sixth-century-misery-tied-not-one-two-volcanic-eruptions-180955858/</a>, accessed 23 Jul 2018</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Buntgen, Ulf et al (2016), \"Cooling and societal change during the Late Antique Little Ice Age from 546 to around 600 AD, <i>Nature Geoscience</i>, Vol. 9, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2652\">https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2652</a>, accessed 23 Jul 2018</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Horgan, John, \"Justinian's Plague,\" <i>Ancient History Encyclopedia</i>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/\">https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/</a>, accessed 23 Jul 2018</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Little, Lester K., ed.
