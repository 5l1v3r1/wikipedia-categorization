The Late Antique Little Ice Age was a long-lasting Northern Hemisphere cooling period in the 6th and 7th century AD, during the period known as late antiquity. Its existence was proposed as a theory in 2015, and subsequently confirmed as the interval from 536 to about 660 AD.  This period followed three immense volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547. One of the suspected volcanic sites for those events is the Rabaul caldera, in the western Pacific, which erupted around 540. The extreme weather events of 535–536 were the early phenomena of the century-long global temperature decline. The evidence comes from a temperature reconstruction from the Euro-Med2k working group of the international PAGES (Past Global Changes) project, using new tree-ring measurements from the Altai Mountains, which closely matches the temperatures in the Alps in the last two centuries.
