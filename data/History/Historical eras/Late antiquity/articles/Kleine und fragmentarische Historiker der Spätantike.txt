Kleine und fragmentarische Historiker der Spätantike  (abbreviated KFHist), or ‘Minor and Fragmentary Historians of Late Antiquity’, is an edition of Greek and Latin historiographical texts from Late Antiquity. The fifteen-year project based at the University of Düsseldorf is directed by Bruno Bleckmann (professor of ancient history) and Markus Stein (professor of classics), and funded by the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts. The aim is to publish the minor and/or fragmentary texts of nearly 90 authors ranging from the 3rd through the 6th centuries, together with a German translation and a commentary covering both philological and historical matters. The series includes pagan and Christian works, chronicles, annotated consul lists, and larger works that are only transmitted as fragments or excerpts. It also includes works that are not directly attested, but whose content can be reconstructed (like the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte). The volumes are published by Ferdinand Schöningh. The first installment, the fragmentary Church History of Philostorgios, appeared in October 2015.
