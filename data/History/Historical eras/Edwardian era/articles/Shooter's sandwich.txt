The shooter's sandwich is a steak sandwich prepared by filling a hollowed-out long loaf of bread with cooked filet mignon steak, cooked mushrooms, salt and pepper.   Weights are then placed atop the sandwich to squeeze it down, and it is typically left weighed down overnight, which causes the juices from the meat to soak into the bread.  Other cuts of beef, such as rump steak, ribeye and sirloin, can be used to prepare the dish, and cooked onions or shallots are sometimes used.      Duxelles, a saut√©ed preparation of mushrooms, onions or shallots, and herbs that is reduced to a paste, is sometimes used in the sandwich.   Dijon mustard and horseradish are sometimes used as accompanying condiments.
