  Transmodernity is a philosophical concept used by the Spanish philosopher and feminist Rosa María Rodríguez Magda in her 1989 essay La sonrisa de Saturno: Hacia una teoría transmoderna. Her approach, based on Hegelian logic, views modernity, postmodernity, and transmodernity as a dialectic triad in which transmodernity is critical of both modernism and postmodernism, but incorporates elements of both.  Transmodernism, as first identified in the philosophical work of Rodriguez (2004), is an umbrella term that connotes the emerging socio-cultural, economic, political and philosophical shift way beyond postmodernity (Ateljevic, 2013:200) which is much more wide, deep and radical than what dominant economists and politicians call globalization (Ghisi, 2010)  Other interpretations on this term have been elaborated in conjunction with the cultural movement of transmodernism founded by Argentinian-Mexican philosopher Enrique Dussel. The concept of transmodernity has also been used to re-work the notion of postmodernity, highlighting its structural relation to globalization and informatisation.
