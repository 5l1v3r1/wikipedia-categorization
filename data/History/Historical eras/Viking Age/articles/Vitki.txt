Vitkar could be men or women, experts in the tradition of Magic Runes, knowledge of the runes and healing ability as healers.  A Vitki was a shamanic figure during the pre-Christian medieval Scandinavia, sometimes compared to prophets and oracles.

Many of these runes and spells are mentioned in Sigrdrífumál, although no other medieval evidence is giving support the existence of such magical signs.
