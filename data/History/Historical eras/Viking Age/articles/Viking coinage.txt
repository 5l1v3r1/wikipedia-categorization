Viking coins are those coins designed, minted and circulated as currency by Viking rulers during the Viking Age of northern Europe. The Viking kingdom of Jorvik (York) in northern England, for example, employed skilled craftsmen and moneyers to produce coinage during the first half of the 10th century. Despite the fact that many coins minted for Scandinavian rulers across the Viking world were almost purely imitative of other contemporary Western European currencies, several of the York designs are nonetheless unique for their time, bearing realistic motifs that include a sword, bow and arrow, a standard, a bird (perhaps one of Odin's ravens?) and Thor's Hammer. They implemented the method of currency by conquering many European countries and civilizing them which improved the economy for many places.
