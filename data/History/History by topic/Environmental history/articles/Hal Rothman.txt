Hal K. Rothman (1958â€“2007) was a historian,  professor, radio show host, editor, public intellectual, and prolific author.  Noted environmental history scholar Char Miller called him "a dynamic teacher, riveting speaker, compelling scholar, and sharp-tongued pundit."   The writer Will Sarvis called Rothman "one of the best editors" he had ever worked with.  University of Colorado historian Patricia Nelson Limerick (author of the famous book, Legacy of Conquest) described Rothman as a key contributor in the late 20th century renaissance of American West history.  Limerick confirmed Rothman's almost unworldly level of energy, "Especially [in] the rate of publications -- thoughtful, and really worthwhile books."   Rothman made numerous national media appearances in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune, and on CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, and other places.  He was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame in 2004.  Rothman died of Lou Gehrig's disease on Feb. 25, 2007.
