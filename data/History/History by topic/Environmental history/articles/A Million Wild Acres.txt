A Million Wild Acres: 200 years of man and an Australian forest is a non-fiction book  written by Eric Charles Rolls (1923â€“2007). It was first published in Melbourne by Nelson in 1981. A Million Wild Acres is not just a regional history of what is now known as the Pilliga Scrub, but also a history of European settlement in Australia. The book won The Age Book of the Year (1981), C.J. Dennis Prize and Talking Book of the Year. This will be seen as one of the great books about Australia. Eric Rolls gives the history of the forest the laconic power of an extended campfire yarn, spiced with the personal vision that comes from a lifetime of acute observationWatermark Literary Society https://web.archive.org/web/20110219162616/http://www.watermarkliterarysociety.asn.au/ Wyndham, Susan.
