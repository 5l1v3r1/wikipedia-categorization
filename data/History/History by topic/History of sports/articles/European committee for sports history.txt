  The European Committee for Sports History (CESH) is the non-profit organisation of the European sports historians. It was founded in Bordeaux in 1995. Founding President was Prof. Arnd Krüger. The Motto is 'Cognita historia futurum figurare' (you have to know history to develop the future). CESH holds an annual international congress, where historians are invited to present and discuss their research. Congresses comprise a social programme and a social dinner, where the winner of the Early Career Award winner is announced. The congresses have been staged in various countries: Italy (1996, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2015), Germany (2001), France (1995, 2002, 2007), Denmark (1998), Tunisia (2010), Spain (2000, 2005, 2014), Poland (1997, 2008), Greece (2003, 2014), Austria (2006), Portugal (2011), the UK (2016). A leading sports historian is invited to give the Horst Überhorst Memorial Address during the international congresses of CESH in memory of Prof. Dr. Horst Überhorst (1925-2010) who was a pioneer in international sports history. CESH has published an annual scientific journal since 2000. From 2000 to 2005, it was called Annual of CESH and published by NISH (Hanover, Germany). Since 2008, the CESH journal is entitled European Studies in Sports History. It has been published with Rouen and Le Havre University Press since 2010. Since its first congress in 1996, CESH has regularly organised an Early Career Award competition. CESH has a College of Fellows which co-opts the leading European sports historians. These are capable to work in more than one European language, have published at least one monograph and have participated in several CESH congresses. In 2015, the College had 62 members from 21 countries. James Riordan (1926-2012) has been President of the College of Fellows. The current president (2015-2017) is Angela Teja.
