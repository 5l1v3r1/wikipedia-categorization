that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.\n</p><p>Enfeoffment gave the vassal extensive, hereditary <a href=\"/wiki/Usufruct\" title=\"Usufruct\">usufruct</a> of the fief, founded and maintained on a relationship of mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary.

The lower vassals would then hire the land to be cultivated by unfree farmers.

Later, unfree ministeriales also rose to the knighthood. Vassalage consisted mainly of military campaigns (military service) and court duty (the presence of vassals at the court in order to offer advice). From court service, the state and imperial diets emerged. The fief was only given to the vassal to utilize; later, the vassal also became a sub-owner, but the feudal lord always retained the rights to this office.

In some cases, populations of conquered areas would become clients of the general who conquered the area. This required the client to accompany his patron to war and protect him if the latter so wished, to accompany him to court as a vocal supporter and, if the patron held public office, to act as his assistant and to accompany him on representational events in public.\n</p><p>In return, the patron had to ensure the legal and practical support of his client in all aspects of life. A Roman citizen, a non-Roman and even entire tribes in the Roman Empire could have a patron-client relationship.\n</p><p>In Late Antiquity, this form of relationship was increasingly adopted in rural areas, because the Roman nomenklatura increasingly saw their vast estates (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Latifundia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Latifundia\">Latifundia</a></i>) as their refuge and also as economically important pillars, over which they sometimes even had their own jurisdiction and fortified prisons.\n</p><p>Clients at that time were usually bound to their patrons through the allocation of land.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Germanic_clan_system\">Germanic clan system</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Germanic clan system\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>During the latter years of the period of <a href=\"/wiki/Sippe\" title=\"Sippe\">clan society</a> with Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil, it was common for all the land to belong to the <a href=\"/wiki/King\" title=\"King\">king</a>. Only he could distribute land to his subjects. These subjects were usually family members, warriors who had performed outstanding feats, and noblemen. This land did not become the property of the subject, but was handed over to him only <i>in persona</i>. On the death of king or vassal, the land was <a href=\"/wiki/De_facto\" title=\"De facto\">de facto</a> returned to the new king. Over time, a practice developed that the person <a href=\"/wiki/Enfeoffed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Enfeoffed\">enfeoffed</a> with the land, together with his family, became the beneficiaries of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fief\" title=\"Fief\">fief</a> and remained permanently bound to it. Upon the death of one party, a new act of homage (<i>Lehnseid</i>), a formal legal ceremony, had to take place. These transitions were fluid and there were exceptions to the practice of <a href=\"/wiki/Enfeoffment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Enfeoffment\">enfeoffment</a>.\n</p><p>The vassal often enfeoffed the estate, usually divided into smaller parcels of land, to other lesser vassals, who in turn had to swear fealty to him. In return for the lease of land, the king could demand loyalty and allegiance from the vassal and his sub-vassals. This means that, in the event of war, they had to provide soldiers and assistance, or if money ran short or a ransom was needed, they were expected to support the king.\n</p><p>The Roman patron-client relationship and the early clan-based feudal relationship in the Germanic kingdoms merged during the early Middle Ages into the feudal law, or <i>Lehnsrecht</i>, a legal and social set of relationships, which effectively formed a pyramid with the king at the top.\n</p><p>The enforcement of <i>Lehnsrecht</i> is associated with the reduced circulation of money in the <a href=\"/wiki/Late_Antiquity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Late Antiquity\">Late Antiquity</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Early_Medieval\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Early Medieval\">Early Medieval</a> periods. <a href=\"/wiki/Money\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> could not bind a <a href=\"/wiki/Vassal\" title=\"Vassal\">vassal</a> to a king, only land.

These institutions were:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The <i>antrustiones</i> - these were the inner circle of the king's retinue; they were distinguished by the fact that a multiple of the usual <a href=\"/wiki/Weregild\" title=\"Weregild\">weregild</a> had to be paid to them.</li>\n<li>The <i>vassi</i> - free lords who could no longer look after for themselves were able to <a href=\"/wiki/Commend\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Commend\">commend</a> themselves into the hands of a more powerful lord, receiving sustenance and shelter in return for an obligation of loyalty and service. They did not lose their status as free lords through the <a href=\"/wiki/Commendation_ceremony\" title=\"Commendation ceremony\">commendation</a> ceremony, but the royal court continued to be responsible for them. The commendation was enacted by the so-called <i>handgang</i> ceremony, i.e. the future <i>vassus</i> put his hands, folded, into the hands of his lord, who then enclosed them. This gesture made the relationship of the two very clear.</li>\n<li>The <i>beneficium</i> (original meaning of \"benefit\") - in the early Middle Ages land was leased, but there were also cases where estates were granted without requiring recompense, for example under duress or to do someone a favour. The lord then remained the true owner of the land, but was no longer its beneficiary.</li></ul>\n<p>It was from the combination of these institutions, especially as more and more lords achieved high social position, that the feudal system emerged.\nThe <i>handgang</i>, which together with the oath of loyalty (<i>Treueid</i>), became referred to as <i>homagium</i> (Latin), <i>homage</i> (French), or <i>mannschaft</i> (German), became the decisive legal device until well into the 12th century. Not until the spread of the system of legal deeds was the <i>handgang</i> dropped from the oath of allegiance, which was better recorded in writing.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Commendation_ceremony\" title=\"Commendation ceremony\">Commendations</a> were still carried out at all levels. In lower classes they were based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Manorial\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Manorial\">manorial</a> system (<i>Grundherrschaft</i>), at the high levels on feudalism (<i>Lehnswesen</i>).\n</p><p>The award of fiefs often replaced the remuneration for work. This was necessary because the <a href=\"/wiki/Monetary_system\" title=\"Monetary system\">monetary system</a> necessary to make regular payments was still far too underdeveloped during the early Middle Ages.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subsequent_development\">Subsequent development</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Subsequent development\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As the services of the vassal specifically included military service, under the Frankish monarchy the feudal system was for centuries the basis of the army as well as the social organization of the Holy Roman Empire. \n</p><p>It was not only the king who acquired vassals in this way. He was soon imitated by secular and ecclesiastical magnates. Gradually, the principle of the heritability of fiefs was established along with the admissibility of passing them on as <i>Afterlehen</i> to sub-vassals. The latter were also declared as heritable in 1037 by <a href=\"/wiki/Conrad_II_(HRR)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Conrad II (HRR)\">Conrad II</a> in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Constitutio_de_feudis\" title=\"Constitutio de feudis\">constitutio de feudis</a></i>. So it came to pass that as early as the 12th century, all duchies and counties were awarded as fiefs.\n</p><p>Within each of these ecclesiastical and secular territories, however, there was a variety of types of feudalism. Not until the 13th century, did the importance of the feudal system decline, because instead of vassals (<i>Vassallen</i>), liegemen (<i>Dienstmannen</i>) - well-educated men (c.f. the development of the <a href=\"/wiki/University\" title=\"University\">university</a> system) - were appointed. The kings encouraged this development, for political reasons, and so strengthened <a href=\"/wiki/Territorial_lordship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Territorial lordship\">territorial lordship</a> (<i>Landesherrschaft</i>), which replaced the feudal system empire-wide. This strengthening of territorial rulers had an impact that could not be reversed, so that the power of the various principalities did not reduce, unlike the situation in France and England.\n</p><p>In England, feudal ties were abolished as early as the Revolution of 1649, and then by an express decree by Charles II in 1660. In France they were abolished by the decisions of the National Assembly on 4 and 5 August 1789. In Germany, the dissolution of feudal associations (<i>Lehnsverband</i>) was a long process. Legally, it was abolished <i>inter alia</i> by the <a href=\"/wiki/Confederation_of_the_Rhine\" title=\"Confederation of the Rhine\">Confederation of the Rhine</a> acts, in the <a href=\"/wiki/Final_Recess_of_the_Reichsdeputation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation\">Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Frankfurt_Constitution\" title=\"Frankfurt Constitution\">Frankfurt Constitution</a> of 1849. One of the last fiefs was awarded in 1835, when the ailing Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlitz, known as G\u00f6rtz, was enfeoffed with the spring at <a href=\"/wiki/Bad_Salzschlirf\" title=\"Bad Salzschlirf\">Salzschlirf</a> and began to excavate it again. Those fiefs still in existence in the 20th century were abolished in 1947 by an <a href=\"/wiki/Allied_Control_Council\" title=\"Allied Control Council\">Allied Control Council</a> edict.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Important_principles_of_feudal_law_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire\">Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In general, the vassal (<i>Lehnsmann</i>) was granted land or <a href=\"/wiki/Freihaus\" title=\"Freihaus\">free houses</a> (<i>Freih\u00e4user</i>) in return for his services. He could also provide services at the lord's residence and be accommodated there.  Most of these so-called <i>servi non cassati</i> were given a fief as soon as one became available.\n</p><p>Official positions (<i>\u00c4mter</i>) and sovereign rights over a particular territory (feudal <a href=\"/wiki/Regalia\" title=\"Regalia\">regalia</a>) could be awarded as a fief. It was in this way that the <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Thurn_and_Taxis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"House of Thurn and Taxis\">House of Thurn and Taxis</a> received its <i><b>Postlehen</b></i> or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Stift\" title=\"Stift\">Stifte</a></i> or <i>feudal ecclesiastica</i>) and enfeoffments of <a href=\"/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Foundation (non-profit)\">foundations</a> associated with an <a href=\"/wiki/Altar\" title=\"Altar\">altar</a> (<i>feudum altaragli</i>). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Feoffment\">Feoffment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Feoffment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Feoffment (<i>constitutio feudi, infeudatio</i>) involved the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a <a href=\"/wiki/Commendation_ceremony\" title=\"Commendation ceremony\">commendation ceremony</a>. In Frankish times, commendation centered around the so-called handclasping ceremony (<i>Handgang</i>):  the vassal clasped his hands together and placed them in the hands of his lord, who then clasped his hands around those of his vassal. He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an <a href=\"/wiki/Oath_of_allegiance\" title=\"Oath of allegiance\">oath of allegiance</a>, which was usually sworn on a religious <a href=\"/wiki/Relic\" title=\"Relic\">relic</a>. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.\n</p><p>In the 11th century, the commendation ceremony required the liegeman to pay homage (<i>homagium</i> or <i>Mannschaft</i>), which involved the handclasping ceremony as well as a declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as <a href=\"/wiki/Livery_of_seizin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Livery of seizin\">livery of seizin</a> and could be a staff or a banner (called a <i>Fahnenlehn</i>). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called <i>Zepterlehen</i>). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the feoffed estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.\n</p><p>In the late Middle Ages, an entry fee was demanded for feoffment, which was often based on the fief's annual income.\n</p><p>The fief (benefice) that the vassal received could be owned by the lord or have been granted in fee by another. Sometimes the vassal even sold or gifted over his possessions to the lord (<i>Lehnsauftragung</i>) and then received it back as a fief (<a href=\"/wiki/Oblation_(legal)\" title=\"Oblation (legal)\"><i>oblatio feudi</i></a>). This was usually done in the hope that the liege lord could defend his estate better in the event of a dispute in the field or at court. The lord purchased or accepted the gift because he might have the intention or hope, for example, of merging unrelated fiefdoms into a whole and thus extending his sphere of influence, for example, in terms of jurisdiction, or the appointment of clergy.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legal_relationship_between_lords_and_vassals\">Legal relationship between lords and vassals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Legal relationship between lords and vassals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>From the 11th century, the obligations of vassals were usually described as <i>auxilium et consilium</i> (help and advice). <i>Auxilium</i> usually implied assistance in terms of military service that the vassal had to render. This could be unlimited, i.e. the vassal had to assist his lord in every conflict, or it could be limited in time, space and in the number of troops to be raised. With the advent of the mercenaries, the reliance on vassals became less important and their service increasingly took the form of administration and court duties. <i>Consilium</i> meant primarily the obligation to appear at imperial assemblies or <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hoftag\" title=\"Hoftag\">Hoftage</a></i>. Vassals whose feudal lord was not the king took part in the councils of their liege lords. They also had to administer justice over their subjects in the name of their master.\n</p><p>The vassal could even be required to pay money; though perhaps not to the extent of England, where military service became a requirement for war funds and the English king used the money to pay for his mercenaries. Monetary payments were also required in other cases, such as to pay a ransom for a captive lord, for the <a href=\"/wiki/Accolade\" title=\"Accolade\">accolade</a> of his eldest son, for the <a href=\"/wiki/Dowry\" title=\"Dowry\">dowry</a> of his eldest daughter, or for a journey to the <a href=\"/wiki/Holy_Land\" title=\"Holy Land\">Holy Land</a>.\n</p><p>The feudal lord could also demand recompense (<i>Lehnserneuerung</i> or <i>renovatio investiturae</i>) from his vassals if they lost their fief or upon changes of lord - changes of ruler at any level, local lord, prince or king (known as <i>Herrenfall, Hauptfall, Thronfall</i>) - as well as changes of vassal (known as <i>Lehnsfall, Vasallenfall</i> or <i>Mannfall, Nebenfall</i>). The latter had to submit a written application (<i>Lehnsmutung</i>) within a <a href=\"/wiki/Year_and_a_day_rule\" title=\"Year and a day rule\">year and a day</a> (actually 1 year, 6 weeks, 3 days) and ask for the renewal of his investiture, but this term could be extended by a decree from the lord (<i>Lehnsindult</i>).\n</p><p>Depending on <a href=\"/wiki/Local_law\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Local law\">local law</a>, the vassal might be liable, apart from the fee, for the renewal of the enfeoffment (called the <i>Schreibschilling</i> or <i>Lehnstaxe</i>), to pay a special tax (the <i>Laudemium, Lehnsgeld, Lehnsware</i> or <i>Handlohn</i>). Finally, in the event of a <a href=\"/wiki/Felony\" title=\"Felony\">felony</a> by the vassal, the lord could confiscate the fief under the so-called <i>Privationsklage</i> action or step in to prevent the deterioration of the estate, if necessary, by legal means. He could also assert his claim to ownership at any time against any unauthorized third parties.\n</p><p>The duties of the lords were less precisely defined, however, they were largely discharged on the handover of the fief. The vassal always had a claim to loyalty from his lord (<i>Lehnsprotektion</i>) and a breach of that by the lord meant the loss of his sovereignty over his vassal. The vassal had the \"right of use\" of the fief (the object of enfeoffment or  <i>Lehnsobjekt</i>). The lord also had to represent his vassals in court.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dissolution_of_a_feudal_relationship\">Dissolution of a feudal relationship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Dissolution of a feudal relationship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Originally, a lord-vassal tie (<i>Lehnsbindung</i>) was a lifelong, faithful relationship that could end only on death. It was also inconceivable that someone could be the vassal of more than one lord. In fact, multiple vassalage soon emerged and loosened the duty of loyalty for the liegeman (<i>Lehnsmann</i>) considerably. Also, the opportunity to inherit a fief diminished the ability of the lord to intervene and loosened the personal loyalty of liegemen. Over time, the importance of fiefdoms increased more and more, whilst the duty of loyalty faded increasingly into the background. In the end, a fief was simply an estate for which the heir had to perform a certain ceremony.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:172px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg/170px-Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"255\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg/255px-Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg/340px-Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2193\" data-file-height=\"3294\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Seegr%C3%A4ben_IMG_3630.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The <i>Lehenhof</i> built in 1710 in <a href=\"/wiki/Seegr%C3%A4ben\" title=\"Seegr\u00e4ben\">Seegr\u00e4ben</a>, Switzerland</div></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Feudalism_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Summary\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In summary, the feudal system was based on two main components - the personal and the material elements.\n</p><p>Personal element:\nThe lord and vassal committed themselves to mutual loyalty.
