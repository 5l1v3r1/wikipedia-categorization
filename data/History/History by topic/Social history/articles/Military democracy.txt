Military democracy is a term used to describe the war-based society of historical peoples. An example is Frederick Engels' characterization: According to Engels, the Greek Heroic Age was a typical example of military democracy.  Morgan[who?] spoke of two features: "the military state of society, and the system of administration consisting of an elective and removable supreme chief, a council of elders and a popular assembly."
