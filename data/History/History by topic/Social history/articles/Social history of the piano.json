Very few people knew of the piano until after the <a href=\"/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\" title=\"Seven Years&#39; War\">Seven Years' War</a> when a young man named Johann Zumpe fled Germany for London. While there he refined Cristofori's piano, introducing separate sections of black keys as well as treble and bass capabilities. This new piano was extremely difficult to play, and very few people learned how to play the instrument because of this. That changed when Zumpe convinced <a href=\"/wiki/Johann_Christian_Bach\" title=\"Johann Christian Bach\">Johann Christian Bach</a>, the personal music master to <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Charlotte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Queen Charlotte\">Queen Charlotte</a> and an international celebrity, to purchase and play on a Zumpe piano for the first ever Zumpe piano concert in 1768. Because of Bach's fame, the piano soon replaced the harpsichord as the predominant instrument of the time, and later composers such as Mozart and Beethoven chose to play on a Zumpe piano.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Bach's fame and the interest of Queen Charlotte helped the piano become a symbol of social status. The turn of the 19th century also saw the rise of the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_class\" title=\"Middle class\">middle class</a> in the Western world. This middle class was eager to showcase their social status, and it became the proper <a href=\"/wiki/Victorian_era\" title=\"Victorian era\">Victorian</a> man's goal to shower his wife and daughters with leisure time and leisure activities, as leisure was a symbol of social status. Consequently, the piano, which was often used for leisure, stood as a testament to a family's position on the socioeconomic ladder.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the middle class of Europe and North America increased in both numbers and prosperity. This increase produced a corresponding rise in the domestic importance of the piano, as ever more families became able to afford pianos and piano instruction. The piano also became common in public institutions, such as schools, hotels, and <a href=\"/wiki/Public_houses\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Public houses\">public houses</a>. As elements of the Western middle-class lifestyle gradually spread to other nations, the piano became common in these nations as well, for example in <a href=\"/wiki/Japan\" title=\"Japan\">Japan</a>.\n</p><p>To understand the rise of the piano among the middle class, it is helpful to remember that before mechanical and electronic reproduction, music was in fact performed on a daily basis by ordinary people. For instance, the working people of every nation generated a body of <a href=\"/wiki/Folk_music\" title=\"Folk music\">folk music</a>, which was transmitted orally down through the generations and sung by all. The parents of <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Haydn\" title=\"Joseph Haydn\">Joseph Haydn</a> (1732\u20131809) could not read music, yet <a href=\"/wiki/Mathias_Haydn\" title=\"Mathias Haydn\">Haydn's father</a> (who worked as a wheelwright) taught himself to play the <a href=\"/wiki/Harp\" title=\"Harp\">harp</a>, and the Haydn family frequently played and sang together. With rising prosperity, the many families that could now afford pianos and music adapted their home-grown musical abilities to the new instrument, and the piano became a major source of music in the home.\n</p><p>Amateur pianists in the home often kept track of the doings of the leading pianists and composers of their day. Professional virtuosi wrote books and methods for the study of piano playing, which sold widely. The virtuosi also prepared their own editions of classical works, which included detailed marks of tempo and expression to guide the amateur who wanted to use their playing as a model. (Today, students are usually encouraged to work from an <a href=\"/wiki/Urtext_edition\" title=\"Urtext edition\">Urtext edition</a>.) The piano compositions of the great composers often sold well among amateurs, despite the fact that, starting with Beethoven, they were often far too hard for anyone but a trained virtuoso to play well. Evidently, the amateur pianists obtained satisfaction from coming to grips with the finest music, even if they could not perform it from start to finish.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A favourite form of musical recreation in the home was playing works for <a href=\"/wiki/Four-hand_piano\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Four-hand piano\">four-hand piano</a>, in which the two players sit side by side at a single piano. These were frequently arrangements of orchestral works, and in the days before recordings served to spread knowledge of new orchestral music to places lacking an orchestra. Sometimes members of the household would sing or play other instruments along with the piano. This practice was often a part of <a href=\"/wiki/Courtship\" title=\"Courtship\">courtship</a>, for performing music together\u2014particularly in the presence or at least earshot of other members of the household\u2014was one of the few \"respectable\" ways for a young man and young woman from \"good\" families to be together.\n</p><p>Parents whose children showed unusual talent often pushed them toward professional careers, sometimes making great sacrifices to make this possible. <a href=\"/wiki/Artur_Schnabel\" title=\"Artur Schnabel\">Artur Schnabel</a>'s book <i>My Life and Music</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> vividly depicts his own experience along these lines, which took place in the <a href=\"/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Austro-Hungarian Empire\">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> in the late 19th century.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Decline\">Decline</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_history_of_the_piano&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Decline\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:SteinwayWelte1919.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/SteinwayWelte1919.jpg/220px-SteinwayWelte1919.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/SteinwayWelte1919.jpg/330px-SteinwayWelte1919.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/SteinwayWelte1919.jpg/440px-SteinwayWelte1919.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"800\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:SteinwayWelte1919.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Steinway_%26_Sons\" title=\"Steinway &amp; Sons\">Steinway</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Welte-Mignon\" title=\"Welte-Mignon\">Welte-Mignon</a> reproducing piano (1919)</div></div></div>\n<p>The piano's status in the home remained secure until technology made possible the enjoyment of music in passive form.

The pianos being bought today tend to be of higher quality and more expensive than those of several decades ago, suggesting perhaps that domestic piano playing may have concentrated itself in homes of wealthier or better-educated members of the middle class. It is unlikely that ability to play the piano contributes much these days to the marriageability of daughters, but many parents still feel today that piano lessons teach their children concentration and self-discipline, and open a door into the world of <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_music\" title=\"Classical music\">classical music</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_history_of_the_piano&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-met_museum-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-met_museum_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Powers, Wendy (2003). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm\">\"The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655\u20131731) &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art\"</a>.
