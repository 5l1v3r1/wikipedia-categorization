The history of Lorentz transformations comprises the development of linear transformations forming the Lorentz group or Poincaré group preserving the Lorentz interval                         −                    x                        0                                   2                             +         ⋯         +                    x                        n                                   2                                     {\displaystyle -x_{0}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}}     and the Minkowski inner product                         −                    x                        0                                   2                                        y                        0                                   2                             +         ⋯         +                    x                        n                                   2                                        y                        n                                   2                                     {\displaystyle -x_{0}^{2}y_{0}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}y_{n}^{2}}    . In mathematics, transformations equivalent to what was later known as Lorentz transformations in various dimensions were discussed in the 19th century in relation to the theory of quadratic forms, hyperbolic geometry, Möbius geometry, and sphere geometry, which is connected to the fact that the group of motions in hyperbolic space, the Möbius group or projective special linear group, and the Laguerre group are isomorphic to the Lorentz group. In physics, Lorentz transformations became known at the beginning of the 20th century, when it was discovered that they exhibit the symmetry of Maxwell's equations. Subsequently, they became fundamental to all of physics, because they formed the basis of special relativity in which they exhibit the symmetry of Minkowski spacetime, making the velocity of light invariant between different inertial frames. They relate the spacetime coordinates, which specify the position                         x         ,         y         ,         z                 {\displaystyle x,y,z}     and time                         t                 {\displaystyle t}     of an event, relative to a particular inertial frame of reference (the "rest system"), and the coordinates                                    x           ′                  ,                    y           ′                  ,                    z           ′                          {\displaystyle x',y',z'}     and                                    t           ′                          {\displaystyle t'}     of the same event relative to another coordinate system moving in the positive x-direction at a constant speed                         v                 {\displaystyle v}    , relative to the rest system.

(1826) and Lobachevsky (1829/30) and others, while variant (b) was given by Schur (1900/02). In the theory of relativity, Lorentz transformations exhibit the symmetry of Minkowski spacetime by using a constant                         c                 {\displaystyle c}     as the speed of light, and a parameter                         v                 {\displaystyle v}     as the relative velocity between two inertial reference frames. In particular, the hyperbolic angle                         η                 {\displaystyle \eta }     in (2b) can be interpreted as the velocity related rapidity                         η         =

were introduced by Voigt (1887) and by Lorentz (1892, 1895) who analyzed Maxwell's equations, they were completed by Larmor (1897, 1900) and Lorentz (1899, 1904), and brought into their modern form by Poincaré (1905) who gave the transformation the name of Lorentz.  Eventually, Einstein (1905) showed in his development of special relativity that the transformations follow from the principle of relativity and constant light speed alone by modifying the traditional concepts of space and time, without requiring a mechanical aether in contradistinction to Lorentz and Poincaré.  Minkowski (1907–1908) used them to argue that space and time are inseparably connected as spacetime. Minkowski (1907–1908) and Varićak (1910) showed the relation to imaginary and hyperbolic functions. Important contributions to the mathematical understanding of the Lorentz transformation were also made by other authors such as Herglotz (1909/10), Ignatowski (1910), Noether (1910) and Klein (1910), Borel (1913–14).

One can switch between the representations by using an imaginary radius coordinate                                    x                        0                             =         i         R                 {\displaystyle x_{0}=iR}     which gives                         λ                    (                                       x                                0                                               2                                         +             ⋯             +                            x                                n                                               2                                                  )                          {\displaystyle \lambda \left(x_{0}^{2}+\dots +x_{n}^{2}\right)}     (conformal transformation), or by using a real radius coordinate                                    x                        0                             =         R                 {\displaystyle x_{0}=R}     which gives                         λ                    (                        −                            x                                0                                               2                                         +             ⋯             +                            x                                n                                               2                                                  )                          {\displaystyle \lambda \left(-x_{0}^{2}+\dots +x_{n}^{2}\right)}     (spherical wave transformation). This group was studied by Lie (1871) and others in terms of contact transformations, in which                                    x                        0                                     {\displaystyle x_{0}}     is related to the radius                         R                 {\displaystyle R}    . It turns out that Con(3,1) is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(4,2), and contains the Lorentz group SO(3,1) as a subgroup by setting                         λ         =         1                 {\displaystyle \lambda =1}    . More generally, Con(p,q) is isomorphic to SO(p+1,q+1) and contains SO(p,q) as subgroup.  This implies that Con(p,0) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group of arbitrary dimensions SO(p+1,1). Consequently, the conformal group in the plane Con(2,0) – known as the group of Möbius transformations – is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(3,1).   This can be seen using tetracyclical coordinates satisfying the form                         −                    x                        0                                   2                             +                    x                        1                                   2                             +                    x                        2                                   2                             +                    x                        3                                   2                             =         0                 {\displaystyle -x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}=0}    , which were discussed by Pockels (1891), Klein (1893), Bôcher (1894). A special case of Lie's geometry of oriented spheres is the Laguerre group, transforming oriented planes and lines into each other. It's generated by the Laguerre inversion introduced by Laguerre (1882) and discussed by Darboux (1887) leaving invariant                                    x                        2                             +                    y                        2                             +                    z                        2                             −                    R                        2                                     {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-R^{2}}     with                         R                 {\displaystyle R}     as radius, thus the Laguerre group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group Stephanos (1883) argued that Lie's geometry of oriented spheres in terms of contact transformations, as well as the special case of the transformations of oriented planes into each other (such as by Laguerre), provides a geometrical interpretation of Hamilton's biquaternions. The relation between Lie's sphere transformations and the Lorentz transformation was noted by Bateman & Cunningham (1909–1910) and others. Furthermore, the group isomorphism between the Laguerre group and Lorentz group was pointed out by Bateman (1910), Cartan (1912, 1915/55), Poincaré (1912/21) and others.

After Cayley (1846) introduced transformations related to sums of positive squares, Hermite (1853/54, 1854) derived transformations for arbitrary quadratic forms, whose result was reformulated in terms of matrices (Q2) by Cayley (1855a, 1855b). For instance, the choice                                    A                  =         diag         ⁡         (         1         ,         1         ,         1         )                 {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\operatorname {diag} (1,1,1)}     gives the spatial rotation in terms of Euler-Rodrigues parameters discovered by Euler (1771) and Rodrigues (1840) (which can be interpreted as the coefficients of quaternions). Also the Lorentz interval and the Lorentz transformation can be produced by this formalism.[R 2][R 3]  The Lorentz transformation in 2 dimensions follows from (Q2) by setting

given by Cayley (1855). In relativity, equations similar to (4b, 4c) were first employed by Borel (1913) to represent Lorentz transformations. Lorentz transformations can also be formulated by using Cayley–Klein parameter                         α         β         γ         δ                 {\displaystyle \alpha \beta \gamma \delta }    , which were used by Helmholtz (1866/67), Cayley (1879) and Klein (1884) to connect Möbius transformations and rotations. There is also a close relation between Cayley–Klein parameters for ordinary 3d rotations and the corresponding Euler-Rodrigues parameters as discussed above:[M 2] In modern publications, the Cayley–Klein parameters are related to a spin-matrix                                    D                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} }    , the spin transformations of variables                                    ξ           ′                  ,                    η           ′                  ,                                                                 ξ                 ¯                                                  ′                  ,                                                                 η                 ¯                                                  ′                          {\displaystyle \xi ',\eta ',{\bar {\xi }}',{\bar {\eta }}'}     (the overline denotes complex conjugate), and the Möbius transformation of                                    ζ           ′                  ,                                                                 ζ                 ¯                                                  ′                          {\displaystyle \zeta ',{\bar {\zeta }}'}    . When defined in terms of hyperbolic motions, the Hermitian matrix                                    u                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }     associated with these transformations produces an invariant determinant                                    x                        0                                   2                             −                    x                        1                                   2                             −                    x                        2                                   2                             −                    x                        3                                   2                                     {\displaystyle x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{3}^{2}}     identical to the Lorentz interval. Therefore, these transformations were described by John Lighton Synge as being a "factory for the mass production of Lorentz transformations".  It also turns out that the related spin group Spin(3, 1) or special linear group SL(2, C) acts as the double cover of the Lorentz group (one Lorentz transformation corresponds to two spin transformations of different sign), while the Möbius group Con(2, 0) or projective special linear group PSL(2, C) is isomorphic to both the Lorentz group and the group of isometries of hyperbolic space. In four dimensions, these Lorentz transformations can be represented as follows:                                                                                     ζ                 =

The general transformation                                                 u                      ′                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '}     in (5c) was used in the theory of binary quadratic forms given by Lagrange (1773) and Gauss (1798/1801), while                                                 u                      ′                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '}     in (5a) was given by Cayley (1854) and Klein (1884) in relation to surfaces of second degree. The adaptation of (5a) to hyperbolic motions by which they become Lorentz transformations was provided by Klein (1889/90, 1896/97), Fricke & Klein (1897) and Hausdorff (1899). In relativity, (5a) was first employed by Herglotz (1909/10). The Lorentz transformations can also be expressed in terms of biquaternions having one real part                                    x                        1                                        e                        1                             +                    x                        2                                        e                        2                             +                    x                        3                                        e                        3                                     {\displaystyle x_{1}e_{1}+x_{2}e_{2}+x_{3}e_{3}}     and one purely imaginary part                         i                    x                        0                                     {\displaystyle ix_{0}}     (some authors use the opposite convention). Its general form (on the left) and the corresponding boost (on the right) are as follows (where the overline denotes Hamiltonian conjugation and * complex conjugation):

After Vincenzo Riccati introduced hyperbolic functions in 1757,[M 3] Johann Heinrich Lambert (read 1767, published 1768) gave the following relations, in which                         t         a         n         g                   ϕ                 {\displaystyle tang\ \phi }     or abbreviated                         t         ϕ                 {\displaystyle t\phi }     was equated by Lambert to the tangens hyperbolicus                                                                                                    e                                        u                                                     −                                    e                                        −                     u                                                                                                      e                                        u                                                     +                                    e                                        −                     u                                                                                                     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {e^{u}-e^{-u}}{e^{u}+e^{-u}}}}     of a variable                         u                 {\displaystyle u}    , or in modern notation                         tan         ⁡         ϕ         =         tanh         ⁡         u                 {\displaystyle \tan \phi =\tanh u}    :[M 4]  In (1770) he rewrote the addition law for the hyperbolic tangens (f) or (g) as:[M 5] The hyperbolic relations (a,b,c,d,e) are equivalent to the hyperbolic relations on the right of (2b). In addition, by setting                         t         a         n         g                   ϕ         =                                                v               c                                                  {\displaystyle tang\ \phi ={\tfrac {v}{c}}}    , (c) becomes the relative velocity between two frames, (d) the Lorentz factor, (e) the proper velocity, (f) or (g) the relativistic velocity addition formula for collinear velocities in (3a). Leonhard Euler (1771) demonstrated the invariance of quadratic forms in terms of sum of squares under a linear substitution and its coefficients, now known as orthogonal transformation, as well as under rotations using Euler angles. The case of two dimensions is given by[M 6] or three dimensions[M 7] These coefficiens                         A         ,         B         ,         C         ,         D         ,         E         ,         F         ,         G         ,         H         ,         I                 {\displaystyle A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I}     were related by Euler to four parameter                         p         ,         q         ,         r         ,         s                 {\displaystyle p,q,r,s}    , which where rediscovered by Olinde Rodrigues (1840) who related them to rotation angles[M 8] now called Euler–Rodrigues parameters:[M 9] The orthogonal transformation in four dimensions was given by him as[M 10] As shown by Minkowski (1907), the orthogonal transformation can be directly used as Lorentz transformation (2d) by making one of the variables imaginary. After the invariance of the sum of squares under linear substitutions was discussed by Euler (1771), the general expressions of a binary quadratic form and its transformation was discussed by Lagrange (1773).[M 11] which is equivalent to (Q1)                        (         n         =         1         )                 {\displaystyle (n=1)}    . The theory of binary quadratic forms was considerably expanded by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1798, published 1801) in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. He rewrote Lagrange's formalism as follows using integer coefficients                         α         β         γ         δ                 {\displaystyle \alpha \beta \gamma \delta }    :[M 12] which is equivalent to (Q1)                        (         n         =         1         )                 {\displaystyle (n=1)}    . As pointed out by Gauss,                         F                 {\displaystyle F}     and                                    F           ′                          {\displaystyle F'}     are called "proper equivalent" if                         α         δ         −         β         γ         =         1                 {\displaystyle \alpha \delta -\beta \gamma =1}    , so that                         F                 {\displaystyle F}     is contained in                                    F           ′                          {\displaystyle F'}     as well as                                    F           ′                          {\displaystyle F'}     is contained in                         F                 {\displaystyle F}    .

After the addition theorem for the tangens hyperbolicus was given by Lambert (1868), hyperbolic geometry was used by Franz Taurinus (1826), and later by Nikolai Lobachevsky (1829/30) and others, to formulate the hyperbolic law of cosines:    When solved for                         cos         ⁡                    (                        α                                             −                 1                                                  )                          {\displaystyle \cos \left(\alpha {\sqrt {-1}}\right)}     it corresponds to (2f), and by defining the rapidities                                                                (                                                   [                                                                                        U                         c                                                                 ,                                                                                           v                         c                                                                 ,                                                                                           u                         c                                                                                  ]                                  =                                    [                                        tanh                     ⁡                     α                     ,                                           tanh                     ⁡                     β                     ,                                           tanh                     ⁡                     γ                                      ]                                               )                                                  {\displaystyle {\scriptstyle \left(\left[{\frac {U}{c}},\ {\frac {v}{c}},\ {\frac {u}{c}}\right]=\left[\tanh \alpha ,\ \tanh \beta ,\ \tanh \gamma \right]\right)}}     it corresponds to the general velocity addition (3d) The Euler–Rodrigues parameters discoverd by Euler (1871) and Rodrigues (1840) leaving invariant                                    x                        0                                   2                             +                    x                        1                                   2                             +                    x                        2                                   2                                     {\displaystyle x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}}     were extended to                                    x                        0                                   2                             +         ⋯         +                    x                        n                                   2                                     {\displaystyle x_{0}^{2}+\dots +x_{n}^{2}}     by Arthur Cayley (1846) as a byproduct of what is now called the Cayley transform.[M 18] Following Cayley's methods, a general transformation for quadratic forms into themselves in three (1853) and arbitrary (1854) dimensions was provided by Charles Hermite[M 19][M 20]  Hermite's formula was simplified and brought into matrix form equivalent to (Q2) by Cayley (1855a)[M 21] which he abbreviated in 1858, where                         Υ                 {\displaystyle \Upsilon }     is any skew-symmetric matrix:[M 22]  The Cayley–Hermite transformation becomes equivalent to the Lorentz transformation (4a) by setting                         Ω         =         diag         ⁡                    (                        −             1             ,             1                      )                          {\displaystyle \Omega =\operatorname {diag} \left(-1,1\right)}     and  (4b) by setting                         Ω         =         diag         ⁡                    (                        −             1             ,             1             ,             1                      )                          {\displaystyle \Omega =\operatorname {diag} \left(-1,1,1\right)}     and (4c) by setting                         Ω         =         diag         ⁡                    (                        −             1             ,             1             ,             1             ,             1                      )                          {\displaystyle \Omega =\operatorname {diag} \left(-1,1,1,1\right)}    . Using the parameters of (1855a), Cayley in a subsequent paper (1855b) particularly discussed several special cases, such as:[M 23] This becomes equivalent to the Lorentz transformation (4a) in 1+1 dimensions by setting                         (         a         ,         b         )         =         (         −         1         ,         1         )                 {\displaystyle (a,b)=(-1,1)}    . or:[M 24] This becomes equivalent to the Lorentz transformation (4b) by setting                         (         a         ,         b         ,         c         )         =         (         −         1         ,         1         ,         1         )                 {\displaystyle (a,b,c)=(-1,1,1)}    . or:[M 25] This becomes equivalent to the Lorentz transformation (4c) by setting                         (         a         ,         b         ,         c         ,         d         )         =         (         −         1         ,         1         ,         1         ,         1         )                 {\displaystyle (a,b,c,d)=(-1,1,1,1)}    . Already in 1854, Cayley published an alternative method of transforming quadratic forms by using certain parameters                         α         β         γ         δ                 {\displaystyle \alpha \beta \gamma \delta }     in relation to a homographic transformation of a surface of second order into itself:[M 26] In the same paper, Cayley also introduced four different parameters                                    M                        2                             =                    a                        2                             +                    b                        2                             +                    c                        2                             +                    d                        2                                     {\displaystyle M^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}}     in order to demonstrate the invariance of                                    x                        1                                   2                             +                    y                        1                                   2                             +                    z                        1                                   2                             +                    w                        1                                   2                                     {\displaystyle x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+z_{1}^{2}+w_{1}^{2}}    , and subsequently showed the relation to quaternions. Fricke & Klein (1897) credited Cayley by calling the above transformation the most general (real or complex) space collineation of first kind of an absolute surface of second kind into itself.[M 27] Parameters                         α         ,         β         ,         γ         ,         δ                 {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta }     are similar to what was later called Cayley–Klein parameters in relation to spatial rotations (which was done by Cayley in 1879[M 28] and before by Hermann von Helmholtz (1866/67)[M 29]). Cayley's transformation becomes the Lorentz transformation                                                 u                      ′                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '}     in (5a) by setting                         α         β         −         γ         δ         =         1                 {\displaystyle \alpha \beta -\gamma \delta =1}     and: Subsequently solved for                                    x                        0                             ,                    x                        1                             ,                    x                        2                             ,                    x                        3                                     {\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}}     it becomes Lorentz transformation (5b). In 1845, Cayley showed that the Euler-Rodrigues parameters representing rotations can be related to quaternions using a pre- and a postfactor[M 30] and in 1848 he used the abbreviated form                                    Π                        1                             =         Λ         Π                    Λ                        −             1                                     {\displaystyle \Pi _{1}=\Lambda \Pi \Lambda ^{-1}}     with                         Λ         =         1         +         λ         i         +         μ         j         +         ν         k                 {\displaystyle \Lambda =1+\lambda i+\mu j+\nu k}     and                         Π         =         i         x         +         j         y         +         k         z                 {\displaystyle \Pi =ix+jy+kz}     and                                    Π                        1                             =         i                    x                        1                             +         j                    y                        1                             +         k                    z                        1                                     {\displaystyle \Pi _{1}=ix_{1}+jy_{1}+kz_{1}}    .[M 31] In 1854 he showed how to transform the sum of four squares into itself:[M 32] or in 1855:[M 33] Cayley's quaternion transformation of the sum of four squares, abbreviated                         Q         q                    Q                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle QqQ^{\ast }}    , served as a role model for the representation of the Lorentz transformation by Noether (1910), Klein (1910), Silberstein (1911), in which the scalar part is imaginary. In 1859, Cayley found out that a quadratic form or projective quadric can be used as an "absolute", serving as the basis of a projective metric (the Cayley–Klein metric).[M 34] For instance, using the absolute                                    x                        2                             +                    y                        2                             +                    z                        2                             =         0                 {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0}    , he defined the distance of two points as follows In the hands of Felix Klein, the Cayley absolute in various forms became essential for the discussion of non-Euclidean geometry and associated quadratic forms and transformations, including the Lorentz interval and Lorentz transformation. Eugenio Beltrami (1868a) introduced coordinates in terms of the Beltrami–Klein model:[M 35] (where a and R are real in spherical geometry, in hyperbolic geometry they are imaginary), and for arbitrary dimensions in (1868b)[M 36] Setting                         a         =                    a                        0                             =         c                 {\displaystyle a=a_{0}=c}     and                                    [                                       r                                0                                         ,                            u               ′                          ,                            u               ″                          ,                            v               ′                          ,                            v               ″                                   ]                  =                    [                        v             ,                            u                                x                                         ,                            u                                x                                               ′                                         ,                            u                                y                                         ,                            u                                y                                               ′                                                  ]                          {\displaystyle \left[r_{0},u',u'',v',v''\right]=\left[v,u_{x},u_{x}^{\prime },u_{y},u_{y}^{\prime }\right]}    , Beltrami's (1868a) formulas become the relativistic velocity addition formulas (2e or 3c).

(In 1890, Robert Fricke in his edition of Klein's lectures of elliptic functions and Modular forms, referred to the analogy of this treatment to the theory of quadratic forms as given by Gauss and in particular Dirichlet.)[M 27] In (1884) Klein related the linear fractional transformations (interpreted as rotations around the                         x         +         i         y                 {\displaystyle x+iy}    -sphere) to Cayley–Klein parameter                         α         ,         β         ,         γ         ,         δ                 {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta }    , to Euler–Rodrigues parameters                         a         ,         b         ,         c         ,         d                 {\displaystyle a,b,c,d}    , and to the unit sphere by means of stereographic projection, and also discussed transformations preserving surfaces of second degree equivalent to the transformation given by Cayley (1854):[M 45] The formulas on the left related to the unit sphere become equivalent to Lorentz transformations (5a) by setting The formulas on the right can be related to those on the left by setting and become equivalent to Lorentz transformation (5a) by setting and subsequently solved for                                    x                        1                             …                 {\displaystyle x_{1}\dots }     it becomes Lorentz transformation (5b). In his lecture in the winter semester of 1889/90 (published 1892–93), he discussed the hyperbolic plane by using (as in 1871) the Lorentz interval in terms of a circle with radius                         2         k                 {\displaystyle 2k}     as the basis of hyperbolic geometry, as well as the modified conic section to discuss the "kinematics of hyperbolic geometry", consisting of motions and congruent displacements of the hyperbolic plane into itself:[M 46] The formulas on the right become equivalent to Lorentz transformations (5c) by setting and subsequently solved for                                    x                        1                             …                 {\displaystyle x_{1}\dots }     it becomes Lorentz transformation (5d).

In (1896/97), Klein again defined hyperbolic motions and explicitly used                         t                 {\displaystyle t}     as time coordinate:[M 48] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (5a). All of this was summarized by Robert Fricke (supported by Klein) in the introduction to a treatise concerning automorphic functions (1897). Using a sphere as the absolute, in which the interior of the sphere is denoted as hyperbolic space, they defined hyperbolic motions, and stressed that any hyperbolic motion corresponds to "circle relations" (now called Möbius transformations):[M 27] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (5a). In 1890 Klein discussed a general type of Euclidean or Non-Euclidean motion in relation to a problem posed by Helmholtz (1868), with the following transformation[M 49] In 1893 he called the special case with                         a         =         b         =         0                 {\displaystyle a=b=0}     a "spiral transformation":[M 50] The Lorentz boost (2c) can be formulated by setting                                                                                 [                 β                 ,                                   i                 y                 ,                                   i                                    y                   ′                                  ]                                                                =                 [                 0                 ,                                   y                 ,                                                      y                   ′                                  ]                                                      (1,2)                                                                                          t                                                                =                 −                 t                                                      (1)                                                                                  {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}[][\beta ,\ iy,\ iy']&=[0,\ y,\ y']\ {\text{(1,2)}}\\t&=-t\ {\text{(1)}}\end{aligned}}}     In relation to line geometry, Klein (1871/72)[M 51] used coordinates satisfying the condition                                    s                        1                                   2                             +                    s                        2                                   2                             +                    s                        2                                   2                             +                    s                        2                                   2                             +                    s                        5                                   2                             =         0                 {\displaystyle s_{1}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{5}^{2}=0}    . They were introduced in 1868 (belatedly published in 1872/73) by Gaston Darboux[M 52] as a system of five coordinates in                                    R                        3                                     {\displaystyle R_{3}}     (later called "pentaspherical" coordinates) in which the last coordinate is imaginary. Sophus Lie (1871)[M 53] more generally used                         n         +         2                 {\displaystyle n+2}     coordinates in                                    R                        n                                     {\displaystyle R_{n}}     (later called "polyspherical" coordinates) satisfying                                                 ∑                            i               =               1                                         i               =               n               +               2                                                x                            i                                         2                                   =           0                          {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sum _{i=1}^{i=n+2}x_{i}^{2}=0}     in which the last coordinate is imaginary, as a means to discuss conformal transformations generated by inversions. These simultaneous publications can be explained by the fact that Darboux, Lie, and Klein corresponded with each other by letter. When the last coordinate is defined as real, the corresponding polyspherical coordinates satisfy the form of a sphere.  Initiated by lectures of Klein between 1889–1890, his student Friedrich Pockels (1891) used such real coordinates, emphasizing that all of these coordinate systems remain invariant under conformal transformations generated by inversions:[M 54] Special cases were described by Klein (1893):[M 55] Both systems were also described by Maxime Bôcher (1894) in an expanded version of a thesis supervised by Klein.[M 56] Polyspherical coordinates indicate that the conformal group Con(p,0) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(p+1,1).  For instance, Con(2,0) – known as Möbius group – is related to tetracyclical coordinates satisfying                                    x                        1                                   2                             +                    x                        2                                   2                             +                    x                        3                                   2                             −                    x                        4                                   2                             =         0                 {\displaystyle x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{4}^{2}=0}    , which is nothing other than the Lorentz interval invariant under the Lorentz group SO(3,1). In several papers between 1847 and 1850 it was shown by Joseph Liouville[M 57] that the relation                         λ                    (                        δ                            x                                2                                         +             δ                            y                                2                                         +             δ                            z                                2                                                  )                          {\displaystyle \lambda \left(\delta x^{2}+\delta y^{2}+\delta z^{2}\right)}     is invariant under the group of conformal transformations generated by "transformation by reciprocal radii" which transforms spheres into spheres (see spherical wave transformation, special conformal transformation, Möbius transformation).

Lie then defined the correspondence between contact transformations in                                    R                        n                                     {\displaystyle R_{n}}     and conformal point transformations in                                    R                        n             +             1                                     {\displaystyle R_{n+1}}    : The sphere of space                                    R                        n                                     {\displaystyle R_{n}}     consists of                         n         +         1                 {\displaystyle n+1}     parameter (coordinates plus radius), so if this sphere is taken as the element of space, it follows that                                    R                        n                                     {\displaystyle R_{n}}     corresponds to                                    R                        n             +             1                                     {\displaystyle R_{n+1}}    . Therefore, any transformation (to which he counted orthogonal transformation and inversions) leaving invariant the condition of contact between spheres in                                    R                        n                                     {\displaystyle R_{n}}    , corresponds to the transformation of points in                                    R                        n             +             1                                     {\displaystyle R_{n+1}}    . Eventually, Lie (1871/72) pointed out that the conformal point transformations of                                    R                        n                                     {\displaystyle R_{n}}     consist of motions, similarity transformations, and inversions.[M 61] The Lorentz group SO(3,1) is a subgroup of the conformal group Con(3,1) in terms of Lie sphere geometry in which the radius indicates the fourth coordinate. In (1885/86), Lie identified the projective group of a general surface of second degree                         ∑                    f                        i             k                                        x                        i                      ′                             x                        k                      ′                  =         0                 {\displaystyle \sum f_{ik}x_{i}'x_{k}'=0}     with the group of non-Euclidean motions.[M 62] In a thesis guided by Lie, Hermann Werner (1889) discussed this projective group by using the equation of a unit sphere as the surface of second degree, and also gave the corresponding infinitesimal projective transformations:[M 63]                                                                                                    x                                        1                                                           2                                                     +                                    x                                        2                                                           2                                                     +                 ⋯                 +                                    x                                        n                                                           2                                                     =                 1                                                                                            x                                        i                                                                        p                                        ϰ                                                     −                                    x                                        ϰ                                                                        p                                        i                                                     ,                                                     p                                        i                                                     −                                    x                                        i                                                                        ∑                                        1                                                           n                                                                                             j                                                                                          x                                        j                                                                        p                                        j                                                                      (                 i                 ,                 ϰ                 =                 1                 ,                 …                 ,                 n                 )                                                                                            where                                                                                                             (                                                               Q                                                i                                                                 ,                                            Q                                                ϰ                                                                                  )                                  =                                    R                                        i                     ,                     ϰ                                                     ;

This is the relation between the Beltrami coordinates in terms of Gudermann-Escherich coordinates, and the Weierstrass coordinates of the hyperboloid model introduced by Killing (1878–1893), Poincaré (1881), and Cox (1881). Both coordinate systems were compared by Cox (1881).[M 77] Wilhelm Killing (1878–1880) described non-Euclidean geometry by using Weierstrass coordinates (named after Karl Weierstrass who described them in lectures in 1872 which Killing attended) obeying the form or[M 80] where                         k                 {\displaystyle k}     is the reciprocal measure of curvature,                                    k                        2                             =         ∞                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=\infty }     denotes Euclidean geometry,                                    k                        2                             >         0                 {\displaystyle k^{2}>0}     elliptic geometry, and                                    k                        2                             <         0                 {\displaystyle k^{2}<0}     hyperbolic geometry. In (1877/78) he pointed out the possibility and some characteristics of a transformation (indicating rigid motions) preserving the above form.[M 81] In (1879/80) he wrote the corresponding transformations as a general rotation matrix[M 82] In (1885) he wrote the Weierstrass coordinates and their transformation as follows:[M 83] This is similar to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}     with                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}     In (1885) he also gave the transformation for                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     dimensions:[M 84]  This is similar to Lorentz transformation (1) with                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}     In (1885) he applied his transformations to mechanics and defined four-dimensional vectors of velocity and force.[M 85] Regarding the geometrical interpretation of his transformations, Killing argued in (1885) that by setting                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}     and using                         p         ,         x         ,         y                 {\displaystyle p,x,y}     as rectangular space coordinates, the hyperbolic plane is mapped on one side of a two-sheet hyperboloid                                    p                        2                             −                    x                        2                             −                    y                        2                             =         1                 {\displaystyle p^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}=1}     (known as hyperboloid model),[M 86]  by which the previous formulas become equivalent to Lorentz transformations and the geometry becomes that of Minkowski space. Finally, in (1893) he wrote:[M 87] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}     with                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}     and for                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     dimensions[M 88] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1) with                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}     The case of translation was given by Killing (1893) in the form[M 89] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b). In 1898, Killing wrote that relation in a form similar to Escherich (1874), and derived the corresponding Lorentz transformation for the two cases were                         v                 {\displaystyle v}     is unchanged or                         u                 {\displaystyle u}     is unchanged:[M 90] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b). Killing (1887/88)[M 91] defined the infinitesimal projective transformations in relation to the following quadratic form of second degree by: and in (1892) he defined the infinitesimal transformation for non-Euclidean motions in terms of Weierstrass coordinates:[M 92] In (1897/98) he pointed out (see the following formulas on the left) that the corresponding group of non-Euclidean motions in terms of Weierstrass coordinates is intransitive when related to form (1) and transitive when related to form (2), and he also showed (on the right) the relation of Weierstrass coordinates to the notation of Killing (1887/88) and Werner (1889), Lie (1890):[M 93] Setting                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}     denotes the group of hyperbolic motions and thus the Lorentz group. Henri Poincaré (1881) published a work which connected the work of Hermite and Selling (1873/74) on indefinite quadratic forms with non-Euclidean geometry (Poincaré already discussed such relations in an unpublished manuscript in 1880).  He used two indefinite ternary forms in terms of three squares and then defined them in terms of Weierstrass coordinates (without using that expression) connected by a transformation with integer coefficients:[M 94] He went on to describe the properties of "hyperbolic coordinates".[M 95]  Poincaré mentioned the hyperboloid model also in (1887).[M 96] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    . Homersham Cox (1881/82) – referring to similar rectangular coordinates used by Gudermann (1830)[M 73] and George Salmon (1862)[M 97] on a sphere, and to Escherich (1874) as reported by Johannes Frischauf (1876)[M 98] in the hyperbolic plane – defined the Weierstrass coordinates (without using that expression) and their transformation:[M 99] This is similar to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    . Cox also gave the Weierstrass coordinates in their transformation in hyperbolic space:[M 100] This is similar to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         3         )                 {\displaystyle (n=3)}    . The case of translation was also given by him, where the y-axis remains unchanged:[M 101] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b). Subsequently, Cox (1882/83) also described hyperbolic geometry in terms of an analogue to quaternions and Hermann Grassmann's exterior algebra. To that end, he used hyperbolic numbers, which were first introduced by James Cockle (1848) in the framework of his tessarine algebra as follows:[M 102] In the hands of Cox (who doesn't mention Cockle) this expression becomes a means to transfer point P to point Q in the hyperbolic plane, which he wrote in the form:[M 103] In (1882/83a) he showed the equivalence of                         P         Q         =         −         cosh         ⁡         θ         +         ι         sinh         ⁡         θ                 {\displaystyle PQ=-\cosh \theta +\iota \sinh \theta }     with "quaternion multiplication",[M 104] and in (1882/83b) he described                         Q                    P                        −             1                             =         cosh         ⁡         θ         +         ι         sinh         ⁡         θ                 {\displaystyle QP^{-1}=\cosh \theta +\iota \sinh \theta }     as being "associative quaternion multiplication".[M 105] He also showed that the position of point P in the hyperbolic plane may be determined by three quantities in terms of Weierstrass coordinates obeying the relation                                    z                        2                             −                    x                        2                             −                    y                        2                             =         1                 {\displaystyle z^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}=1}    .[M 106] Cox's associative quaternion multiplication using the hyperbolic versor is equivalent to the Lorentz boost (7) by setting                         Q         =                    x                        1                                   ′                             +         ι                    x                        0                                   ′                                     {\displaystyle Q=x_{1}^{\prime }+\iota x_{0}^{\prime }}     and                         P         =                    x                        1                             +         ι                    x                        0                                     {\displaystyle P=x_{1}+\iota x_{0}}    . Cox went on to develop an algebra for hyperbolic space analogous to Clifford's biquaternions. While Clifford (1873) used biquaternions of the form                         a         +         ω         b                 {\displaystyle a+\omega b}     in which                                    ω                        2                             =         0                 {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=0}     denotes parabolic space and                                    ω                        2                             =         1                 {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=1}     elliptic space, Cox discussed hyperbolic space using the imaginary quantity                                                 −             1                                     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}     and therefore                                    ω                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=-1}    .[M 107] He also obtained relations of quaternion multiplication in terms of Weierstrass coordinates:[M 108] After previous work by Albert Ribaucour (1870),[M 109] a transformation which transforms oriented spheres into oriented spheres, oriented planes into oriented planes, and oriented lines into oriented lines, was explicitly formulated by Edmond Laguerre (1882) as "transformation by reciprocal directions" which was later called „Laguerre inversion/transformation". It can be seen as a special case of the conformal group in terms of Lie's transformations of oriented spheres. In two dimensions the transformation or oriented lines has the form (R being the radius):[M 110] This is in agreement with Lorentz boost (2a) because                                                                (                                                                        1                     +                                            α                                                2                                                                                                       1                     −                                            α                                                2                                                                                                              )                                         2                                   −                                       (                                                                        2                     α                                                           1                     −                                            α                                                2                                                                                                              )                                         2                                   =           1                          {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \left({\frac {1+\alpha ^{2}}{1-\alpha ^{2}}}\right)^{2}-\left({\frac {2\alpha }{1-\alpha ^{2}}}\right)^{2}=1}    , thus                                                                                 1                 +                                    α                                        2                                                                                   1                 −                                    α                                        2                                                                                      =                        g                            00                                   =                        g                            11                                                  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {1+\alpha ^{2}}{1-\alpha ^{2}}}=g_{00}=g_{11}}     and                                                                                 2                 α                                               1                 −                                    α                                        2                                                                                      =                        g                            01                                   =                        g                            10                                                  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {2\alpha }{1-\alpha ^{2}}}=g_{01}=g_{10}}    . Cyparissos Stephanos (1883)[M 111] showed that Hamilton's biquaternion                                    a                        0                             +                    a                        1                                        ι                        1                             +                    a                        2                                        ι                        2                             +                    a                        3                                        ι                        3                                     {\displaystyle a_{0}+a_{1}\iota _{1}+a_{2}\iota _{2}+a_{3}\iota _{3}}     can be interpreted as an oriented sphere in terms of Lie's sphere geometry (1871), having the vector                                    a                        1                                        ι                        1                             +                    a                        2                                        ι                        2                             +                    a                        3                                        ι                        3                                     {\displaystyle a_{1}\iota _{1}+a_{2}\iota _{2}+a_{3}\iota _{3}}     as its center and the scalar                                    a                        0                                                     −             1                                     {\displaystyle a_{0}{\sqrt {-1}}}     as its radius. Its norm                                    a                        1                                   2                             +                    a                        2                                   2                             +                    a                        3                                   2                             +                    a                        4                                   2                                     {\displaystyle a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}+a_{4}^{2}}     is thus equal to the power of a point of the corresponding sphere. In particular, the norm of two quaternions                         N                    (                                       Q                                1                                         −                            Q                                2                                                  )                          {\displaystyle N\left(Q_{1}-Q_{2}\right)}     (the corresponding spheres are in contact with                         N                    (                                       Q                                1                                         −                            Q                                2                                                  )                  =         0                 {\displaystyle N\left(Q_{1}-Q_{2}\right)=0}    ) is equal to the tangential distance between two spheres. The general contact transformation between two spheres then can be given by a homography using 4 arbitrary quaternions                         A         ,         B         ,         C         ,         D                 {\displaystyle A,B,C,D}     and two variable quaternions                         X         ,         Y                 {\displaystyle X,Y}    :[M 112]   Stephanos pointed out that the special case                         A         =         0                 {\displaystyle A=0}     denotes transformations of oriented planes (see Laguerre's transformation of oriented planes (1882)). The Lorentz group SO(3,1) is a subgroup of the conformal group Con(3,1) in terms of Lie's transformations of orientied spheres in which the radius indicates the fourth coordinate. The Lorentz group is isomorphic to the group of Laguerre's transformation of oriented planes. Arthur Buchheim (1884, published 1885) applied Clifford's biquaternions and their operator                         ω                 {\displaystyle \omega }     to different forms of geometries (Buchheim mentions Cox (1882) as well). He defined the scalar                                    ω                        2                             =                    e                        2                                     {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=e^{2}}     which in the case                         −         1                 {\displaystyle -1}     denotes hyperbolic space,                         1                 {\displaystyle 1}     elliptic space, and                         0                 {\displaystyle 0}     parabolic space. He derived the following relations consistent with the Cayley–Klein absolute:[M 113] By choosing                                    e                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle e^{2}=-1}     for hyperbolic space, the Cayley absolute becomes the Lorentz interval. Clifford algebra (which includes quaternions as special cases) was used by Rudolf Lipschitz (1885/86) who introduced the orthogonal transformation                         Λ         X         =

Ferdinand von Lindemann discussed hyperbolic geometry in his (1890/91) edition of the lectures on geometry of Alfred Clebsch. Citing Killing (1885) and Poincaré (1887) in relation to the hyperboloid model in terms of Weierstrass coordinates for the hyperbolic plane and space, he set[M 117] In addition, by using the following quadratic form as the Cayley absolute related to surfaces of second degree and its transformation[M 118] into which he put[M 119] he obtained the following Cayley absolute and the corresponding most general motion in hyperbolic space comprising ordinary rotations (                        a         =         0                 {\displaystyle a=0}    ) or translations (                        α         =         0                 {\displaystyle \alpha =0}    ):[M 120] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b) with                         α         =         0                 {\displaystyle \alpha =0}     and                         2         k         =         1                 {\displaystyle 2k=1}    . Louis Gérard (1892) – in a thesis examined by Poincaré – discussed Weierstrass coordinates (without using that name) in the plane using the following invariant and its Lorentz transformation equivalent to (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    :[M 121] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    . He gave the case of translation as follows:[M 122] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b). Alexander Macfarlane (1892, 1893) – similar to Cockle (1848) and Cox (1882/83) – defined the hyperbolic versor in terms of hyperbolic numbers[M 123] and in 1894 he defined the "exspherical" versor[M 124] and used them to analyze hyperboloids of one- or two sheets. This was further extended by him in (1900) in order to express trigonometry in terms of hyperbolic quaternions                         r                    e                        b             β                                     {\displaystyle re^{b\beta }}    , with                                    β                        2                             =         +         1                 {\displaystyle \beta ^{2}=+1}     and                         r         =                                                x                                2                                         −                            y                                2                                                                 {\displaystyle r={\sqrt {x^{2}-y^{2}}}}    , the hyperbolic number                         x         +         y         β                 {\displaystyle x+y\beta }    , and the hyperbolic versor                                    e                        b             β                                     {\displaystyle e^{b\beta }}    .[M 125] The hyperbolic versor is the basis of Lorentz boost (7). Alfred North Whitehead (1898) discussed the kinematics of hyperbolic space as part of his study of universal algebra, and obtained the following transformation:[M 126] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b) with                         α         =         0                 {\displaystyle \alpha =0}    . Felix Hausdorff (1899) – citing Killing (1885) – discussed Weierstrass coordinates in the plane using the following invariant and its transformation:[M 127] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    . Hausdorff (1899) also discussed the relation of the above coordinates to conformal Möbius transformations:[M 128] This is similar to Lorentz transformation (5a) with                                    (           p           ,                       x           ,                       y           ,                       1           )           =                        (                                                                                     x                                            0                                                                                x                                            3                                                                                       ,                                                                                        x                                            1                                                                                x                                            3                                                                                       ,                                                                                        x                                            2                                                                                x                                            3                                                                                       ,                                                                                        x                                            3                                                                                x                                            3                                                                                                  )                                     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle (p,\ x,\ y,\ 1)=\left({\frac {x_{0}}{x_{3}}},\ {\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}},\ {\frac {x_{2}}{x_{3}}},\ {\frac {x_{3}}{x_{3}}}\right)}    . Friedrich Schur (1900/02) derived basic formulas of non-Eucliden geometry, including the case of translation for which he obtained the transformation similar to Beltrami (1868) and Escherich (1874):[M 129] where                                                 k                                     {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {k}}}     can have values                         >         0                 {\displaystyle >0}    ,                         <         0                 {\displaystyle <0}     or                         ∞                 {\displaystyle \infty }    . This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (2e) and therefore also equivalent to the relativistic velocity addition (3c) by setting                                                 k                             =         1                 {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {k}}=1}     and                         [         a         ,                   x         ,                   y         ]         =         [         v         ,                              u                        x                             ,                              u                        y                             ]                 {\displaystyle [a,\ x,\ y]=[v,\ u_{x},\ u_{y}]}     .

He also defined the triangle  This is equivalent to the hyperbolic law of cosines and the relativistic velocity addition (2f, b) or (3d) by setting                                                 k                             =         1                 {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {k}}=1}     and                         [         c         ,                   a         ,                   b         ]         =         [                    u           ′                  ,                   v         ,                   u         ]                 {\displaystyle [c,\ a,\ b]=[u',\ v,\ u]}    . Modifying Lipschitz's (1885/86) variant of Clifford numbers, Theodor Vahlen (1901/02) formulated Möbius transformations (which he called vector transformations) and biquaternions in order to discuss motions in n-dimensional non-Euclidean space, leaving the following quadratic form invariant (where                                    j                        2                             =         +         1                 {\displaystyle j^{2}=+1}     represents hyperbolic motions,                                    j                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle j^{2}=-1}     elliptic motions,                                    j                        2                             =         0                 {\displaystyle j^{2}=0}     parabolic motions):[M 130] The group of hyperbolic motions or the Möbius group are isomorphic to the Lorentz group. Frederick S. Woods (1901/02) defined the following invariant quadratic form and its projective transformation (he pointed out that this can be connected to hyperbolic geometry by setting                         k         =                                 −             1                             R                 {\displaystyle k={\sqrt {-1}}R}     with                         R                 {\displaystyle R}     as real quantity):[M 131] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}     by setting                         (         u         ,                   v         ,                   w         ,                   1         )         =                    (                                                                           x                                        1                                                                        x                                        0                                                                             ,                                                                              x                                        2                                                                        x                                        0                                                                             ,                                                                              x                                        3                                                                        x                                        0                                                                             ,                                                                              x                                        0                                                                        x                                        0                                                                                      )                          {\displaystyle (u,\ v,\ w,\ 1)=\left({\frac {x_{1}}{x_{0}}},\ {\frac {x_{2}}{x_{0}}},\ {\frac {x_{3}}{x_{0}}},\ {\frac {x_{0}}{x_{0}}}\right)}     with                         k         =                                 −             1                                     {\displaystyle k={\sqrt {-1}}}    . Alternatively, Woods (1903, published 1905) – citing Killing (1885) – used the invariant quadratic form in terms of Weierstrass coordinates and its transformation (with                         k         =                                 −             1                             k                 {\displaystyle k={\sqrt {-1}}k}     for hyperbolic space):[M 132] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         3         )                 {\displaystyle (n=3)}     with                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}    . and the case of translation:[M 133] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b) with                                    k                        2                             =         −         1                 {\displaystyle k^{2}=-1}    . and the loxodromic substitution for hyperbolic space:[M 134] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b) with                         β         =         0                 {\displaystyle \beta =0}    . Heinrich Liebmann (1904/05) – citing Killing (1885), Gérard (1892), Hausdorff (1899) – used the invariant quadratic form and its Lorentz transformation equivalent to (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    [M 135] This is equivalent to Lorentz transformation (1)                        (         n         =         2         )                 {\displaystyle (n=2)}    . and the case of translation:[M 136] This is equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b). Woldemar Voigt (1887)[R 4] developed a transformation in connection with the Doppler effect and an incompressible medium, being in modern notation:   If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by                         γ                 {\displaystyle \gamma }     they are the modern Lorentz transformation (3b). In Voigt's theory the speed of light is invariant, but his transformations mix up a relativistic boost together with a rescaling of space-time. Optical phenomena in free space are scale, conformal (using the factor                         λ                 {\displaystyle \lambda }     discussed above), and Lorentz invariant, so the combination is invariant too.  For instance, Lorentz transformations can be extended by using                         l         =                                 λ                                     {\displaystyle l={\sqrt {\lambda }}}    :[R 5]                         l         =         1                    /                  γ                 {\displaystyle l=1/\gamma }     gives the Voigt transformation,                         l         =         1                 {\displaystyle l=1}     the Lorentz transformation. But scale transformations are not a symmetry of all the laws of nature, only of electromagnetism, so these transformations cannot be used to formulate a principle of relativity in general. It was demonstrated by Poincaré and Einstein that one has to set                         l         =         1                 {\displaystyle l=1}     in order to make the above transformation symmetric and to form a group as required by the relativity principle, therefore the Lorentz transformation is the only viable choice.  Voigt sent his 1887 paper to Lorentz in 1908,  and that was acknowledged in 1909: In a paper „Über das Doppler'sche Princip", published in 1887 (Gött. Nachrichten, p. 41) and which to my regret has escaped my notice all these years, Voigt has applied to equations of the form (7) (§ 3 of this book) [namely                         Δ         Ψ         −                                                1                                c                                    2                                                                                                                                                     ∂                                        2                                                     Ψ                                               ∂                                    t                                        2                                                                                             =         0                 {\displaystyle \Delta \Psi -{\tfrac {1}{c^{2}}}{\tfrac {\partial ^{2}\Psi }{\partial t^{2}}}=0}    ] a transformation equivalent to the formulae (287) and (288) [namely                                    x                        ′                             =         γ         l                    (                        x             −             v             t                      )                  ,                              y                        ′                             =         l         y         ,                              z                        ′                             =         l         z         ,                              t                        ′                             =         γ         l                    (                        t             −                                                                v                                        c                                            2                                                                                                  x                      )                          {\displaystyle x^{\prime }=\gamma l\left(x-vt\right),\ y^{\prime }=ly,\ z^{\prime }=lz,\ t^{\prime }=\gamma l\left(t-{\tfrac {v}{c^{2}}}x\right)}    ]. The idea of the transformations used above (and in § 44) might therefore have been borrowed from Voigt and the proof that it does not alter the form of the equations for the free ether is contained in his paper.[R 6] Also Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Voigt responded in the same paper by saying that his theory was based on an elastic theory of light, not an electromagnetic one. However, he concluded that some results were actually the same.[R 7] In 1888, Oliver Heaviside[R 8] investigated the properties of charges in motion according to Maxwell's electrodynamics. He calculated, among other things, anisotropies in the electric field of moving bodies represented by this formula:  Consequently, Joseph John Thomson (1889)[R 9] found a way to substantially simplify calculations concerning moving charges by using the following mathematical transformation (like other authors such as Lorentz or Larmor, also Thomson implicitly used the Galilean transformation                         z         −         v         t                 {\displaystyle z-vt}     in his equation ): Thereby, inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equations are transformed into a Poisson equation.  Eventually, George Frederick Charles Searle[R 10] noted in (1896) that Heaviside's expression leads to a deformation of electric fields which he called "Heaviside-Ellipsoid" of axial ratio In order to explain the aberration of light and the result of the Fizeau experiment in accordance with Maxwell's equations, Lorentz in 1892 developed a model ("Lorentz ether theory") in which the aether is completely motionless, and the speed of light in the aether is constant in all directions. In order to calculate the optics of moving bodies, Lorentz introduced the following quantities to transform from the aether system into a moving system (it's unknown whether he was influenced by Voigt, Heaviside, and Thomson)[R 11]  where x* is the Galilean transformation x-vt. Except the additional                         γ                 {\displaystyle \gamma }     in the time transformation, this is the complete Lorentz transformation (3b).  While                         t                 {\displaystyle t}     is the "true" time for observers resting in the aether,                                    t           ′                          {\displaystyle t'}     is an auxiliary variable only for calculating processes for moving systems. It is also important that Lorentz and later also Larmor formulated this transformation in two steps. At first an implicit Galilean transformation, and later the expansion into the "fictitious" electromagnetic system with the aid of the Lorentz transformation. In order to explain the negative result of the Michelson–Morley experiment, he (1892b)[R 12] introduced the additional hypothesis that also intermolecular forces are affected in a similar way and introduced length contraction in his theory (without proof as he admitted). The same hypothesis was already made by George FitzGerald in 1889 based on Heaviside's work. While length contraction was a real physical effect for Lorentz, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation. In 1895, Lorentz further elaborated on his theory and introduced the "theorem of corresponding states". This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the ether) in his „fictitious" field makes the same observations as a resting observers in his „real" field for velocities to first order in                         v                    /                  c         .                 {\displaystyle v/c.}     Lorentz showed that the dimensions of electrostatic systems in the ether and a moving frame are connected by this transformation:[R 13] For solving optical problems Lorentz used the following transformation, in which the modified time variable was called "local time" (German: Ortszeit) by him:[R 14] With this concept Lorentz could explain the Doppler effect, the aberration of light, and the Fizeau experiment.  In 1897, Larmor extended the work of Lorentz and derived the following transformation[R 15] Larmor noted that if it is assumed that the constitution of molecules is electrical then the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction is a consequence of this transformation, explaining the Michelson–Morley experiment. It's notable that Larmor was the first who recognized that some sort of time dilation is a consequence of this transformation as well, because "individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio                         1                    /                  γ                 {\displaystyle 1/\gamma }    ".   Larmor wrote his electrodynamical equations and transformations neglecting terms of higher order than                         (         v                    /                  c                    )                        2                                     {\displaystyle (v/c)^{2}}     – when his 1897 paper was reprinted in 1929, Larmor added the following comment in which he described how they can be made valid to all orders of                         (         v                    /                  c         )                 {\displaystyle (v/c)}    :[R 16] Nothing need be neglected: the transformation is exact if                         v                    /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle v/c^{2}}     is replaced by                         ε         v                    /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle \varepsilon v/c^{2}}     in the equations and also in the change following from                         t                 {\displaystyle t}     to                                    t           ′                          {\displaystyle t'}    , as is worked out in Aether and Matter (1900), p. 168, and as Lorentz found it to be in 1904, thereby stimulating the modern schemes of intrinsic relational relativity. In line with that comment, in his book Aether and Matter published in 1900, Larmor used a modified local time                                    t           ″                  =                    t           ′                  −         ε         v                    x           ′                             /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle t''=t'-\varepsilon vx'/c^{2}}     instead of the 1897 expression                                    t                        ′                             =         t         −         v         x                    /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle t^{\prime }=t-vx/c^{2}}     by replacing                         v                    /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle v/c^{2}}     with                         ε         v                    /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle \varepsilon v/c^{2}}    , so that                                    t           ″                          {\displaystyle t''}     is now identical to the one given by Lorentz in 1892, which he combined with a Galilean transformation for the                                    x           ′                          {\displaystyle x'}    ,                                    y           ′                          {\displaystyle y'}    ,                                    z           ′                          {\displaystyle z'}    ,                                    t           ′                          {\displaystyle t'}     coordinates:[R 17] Larmor knew that the Michelson–Morley experiment was accurate enough to detect an effect of motion depending on the factor                                    v                        2                                        /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle v^{2}/c^{2}}    , and so he sought the transformations which were "accurate to second order" (as he put it). Thus he wrote the final transformations (where                                    x           ′                  =         x         −         v         t                 {\displaystyle x'=x-vt}     and                                    t           ″                          {\displaystyle t''}     as given above) as:[R 18] by which he arrived at the complete Lorentz transformation (3b). Larmor showed that Maxwell's equations were invariant under this two-step transformation, "to second order in                         v                    /                  c                 {\displaystyle v/c}    " – it was later shown by Lorentz (1904) and Poincaré (1905) that they are indeed invariant under this transformation to all orders in                         v                    /                  c                 {\displaystyle v/c}    . Larmor gave credit to Lorentz in two papers published in 1904, in which he used the term "Lorentz transformation" for Lorentz's first order transformations of coordinates and field configurations: p. 583: [..] Lorentz's transformation for passing from the field of activity of a stationary electrodynamic material system to that of one moving with uniform velocity of translation through the aether. p. 585: [..] the Lorentz transformation has shown us what is not so immediately obvious [..][R 19]  p. 622: [..] the transformation first developed by Lorentz: namely, each point in space is to have its own origin from which time is measured, its "local time" in Lorentz's phraseology, and then the values of the electric and magnetic vectors [..] at all points in the aether between the molecules in the system at rest, are the same as those of the vectors [..] at the corresponding points in the convected system at the same local times.[R 20] Also Lorentz extended his theorem of corresponding states in 1899. First he wrote a transformation equivalent to the one from 1892 (again,                                    x                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}     must be replaced by                         x         −         v         t                 {\displaystyle x-vt}    ):[R 21] Then he introduced a factor                         ε                 {\displaystyle \varepsilon }     of which he said he has no means of determining it, and modified his transformation as follows (where the above value of                                    t           ′                          {\displaystyle t'}     has to be inserted):[R 22] This is equivalent to the complete Lorentz transformation (3b) when solved for                                    x           ″                          {\displaystyle x''}     and                                    t           ″                          {\displaystyle t''}     and with                         ε         =         1                 {\displaystyle \varepsilon =1}    . Like Larmor, Lorentz noticed in 1899[R 23] also some sort of time dilation effect in relation to the frequency of oscillating electrons "that in                         S                 {\displaystyle S}     the time of vibrations be                         k         ε                 {\displaystyle k\varepsilon }     times as great as in                                    S                        0                                     {\displaystyle S_{0}}    ", where                                    S                        0                                     {\displaystyle S_{0}}     is the aether frame.  In 1904 he rewrote the equations in the following form by setting                         l         =         1                    /                  ε                 {\displaystyle l=1/\varepsilon }     (again,                                    x                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}     must be replaced by                         x         −         v         t                 {\displaystyle x-vt}    ):[R 24] Under the assumption that                         l         =         1                 {\displaystyle l=1}     when                         v         =         0                 {\displaystyle v=0}    , he demonstrated that                         l         =         1                 {\displaystyle l=1}     must be the case at all velocities, therefore length contraction can only arise in the line of motion. So by setting the factor                         l                 {\displaystyle l}     to unity, Lorentz's transformations now assumed the same form as Larmor's and are now completed. Unlike Larmor, who restricted himself to show the covariance of Maxwell's equations to second order, Lorentz tried to widen its covariance to all orders in                         v                    /                  c                 {\displaystyle v/c}    . He also derived the correct formulas for the velocity dependence of electromagnetic mass, and concluded that the transformation formulas must apply to all forces of nature, not only electrical ones.[R 25] However, he didn't achieve full covariance of the transformation equations for charge density and velocity.  When the 1904 paper was reprinted in 1913, Lorentz therefore added the following remark:  One will notice that in this work the transformation equations of Einstein’s Relativity Theory have not quite been attained. [..] On this circumstance depends the clumsiness of many of the further considerations in this work. Lorentz's 1904 transformation was cited and used by Alfred Bucherer in July 1904:[R 26] or by Wilhelm Wien in July 1904:[R 27] or by Emil Cohn in November 1904 (setting the speed of light to unity):[R 28] or by Richard Gans in February 1905:[R 29] Neither Lorentz or Larmor gave a clear physical interpretation of the origin of local time. However, Henri Poincaré in 1900 commented on the origin of Lorentz’s "wonderful invention" of local time.  He remarked that it arose when clocks in a moving reference frame are synchronised by exchanging signals which are assumed to travel with the same speed                         c                 {\displaystyle c}     in both directions, which lead to what is nowadays called relativity of simultaneity, although Poincaré's calculation does not involve length contraction or time dilation.[R 30] In order to synchronise the clocks here on Earth (the                                    x                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}    ,                                    t                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle t^{\ast }}     frame) a light signal from one clock (at the origin) is sent to another (at                                    x                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}    ), and is sent back. It's supposed that the Earth is moving with speed                         v                 {\displaystyle v}     in the                         x                 {\displaystyle x}    -direction (=                                    x                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle x^{\ast }}    -direction) in some rest system (                        x                 {\displaystyle x}    ,                         t                 {\displaystyle t}    ) (i.e. the luminiferous aether system for Lorentz and Larmor). The time of flight outwards is and the time of flight back is The elapsed time on the clock when the signal is returned is                         δ                    t                        o                             +         δ                    t                        b                                     {\displaystyle \delta t_{o}+\delta t_{b}}     and the time                                    t                        ∗                             =                    (                        δ                            t                                o                                         +             δ                            t                                b                                                  )                             /                  2                 {\displaystyle t^{\ast }=\left(\delta t_{o}+\delta t_{b}\right)/2}     is ascribed to the moment when the light signal reached the distant clock. In the rest frame the time                         t         =         δ                    t                        o                                     {\displaystyle t=\delta t_{o}}     is ascribed to that same instant. Some algebra gives the relation between the different time coordinates ascribed to the moment of reflection. Thus identical to Lorentz (1892).

Similar physical interpretations of local time were later given by Emil Cohn (1904)[R 31] and Max Abraham (1905).[R 32] On June 5, 1905 (published June 9) Poincaré simplified the equations which are algebraically equivalent to those of Larmor and Lorentz and gave them the modern form (3b):[R 33] Apparently Poincaré was unaware of Larmor's contributions, because he only mentioned Lorentz and therefore used for the first time the name "Lorentz transformation".   Poincaré set the speed of light to unity, pointed out the group characteristics of the transformation by setting                         l         =         1                 {\displaystyle l=1}    , and modified/corrected Lorentz's derivation of the equations of electrodynamics in some details in order to fully satisfy the principle of relativity, i.e. making them fully Lorentz covariant.  In July 1905 (published in January 1906)[R 34] Poincaré showed in detail how the transformations and electrodynamic equations are a consequence of the principle of least action; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called Lorentz group, and he showed that the combination                                    x                        2                             +                    y                        2                             +                    z                        2                             −                    c                        2                                        t                        2                                     {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}}     is invariant. He noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing                         c         t                                 −             1                                     {\displaystyle ct{\sqrt {-1}}}     as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. On June 30, 1905 (published September 1905) Einstein published what is now called special relativity and gave a new derivation of the transformation, which was based only on the principle on relativity and the principle of the constancy of the speed of light. While Lorentz considered "local time" to be a mathematical stipulation device for explaining the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein showed that the coordinates given by the Lorentz transformation were in fact the inertial coordinates of relatively moving frames of reference. For quantities of first order in v/c this was also done by Poincaré in 1900, while Einstein derived the complete transformation by this method. Unlike Lorentz and Poincaré who still distinguished between real time in the aether and apparent time for moving observers, Einstein showed that the transformations concern the nature of space and time.    The notation for this transformation is equivalent to Poincaré's of 1905 and (3b), except that Einstein didn't set the speed of light to unity:[R 35] Einstein also defined the velocity addition formula (3c) (which also has been done by Poincaré in May 1905 in unpublished letters to Lorentz):[R 36] The work on the principle of relativity by Lorentz, Einstein, Planck, together with Poincaré's four-dimensional approach, were further elaborated and combined with the hyperboloid model by Hermann Minkowski in 1907 and 1908.[R 37][R 38] Minkowski particularly reformulated electrodynamics in a four-dimensional way (Minkowski spacetime).  For instance, he wrote                         x         ,         y         ,         z         ,         i         t                 {\displaystyle x,y,z,it}     in the form                                    x                        1                             ,                    x                        2                             ,                    x                        3                             ,                    x                        4                                     {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}}    . By defining                         ψ                 {\displaystyle \psi }     as the angle of rotation around the                         z                 {\displaystyle z}    -axis, the Lorentz transformation assumes a form (with                         c         =         1                 {\displaystyle c=1}    ) in agreement with (2d):[R 39] Even though Minkowski used the imaginary number                         i         ψ                 {\displaystyle i\psi }    , he for once[R 39] directly used the tangens hyperbolicus in the equation for velocity Minkowski's expression can also by written as                         ψ         =         artanh         ⁡         (         q         )                 {\displaystyle \psi =\operatorname {artanh} (q)}     and was later called rapidity. He also wrote the Lorentz transformation in matrix form equivalent to (1b)                        (         n         =         3         )                 {\displaystyle (n=3)}    :[R 40] As a graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation he introduced the Minkowski diagram, which became a standard tool in textbooks and research articles on relativity:[R 41] Using an imaginary rapidity such as Minkowski, Arnold Sommerfeld (1909) formulated a transformation equivalent to Lorentz boost (2b), and the relativistc velocity addition (3c) in terms of trigonometric functions and the spherical law of cosines:[R 42]

conformal transformations. Not only the quadratic form                         λ                    (                        δ                            x                                2                                         +             δ                            y                                2                                         +             δ                            z                                2                                         +             δ                            u                                2                                                  )                          {\displaystyle \lambda \left(\delta x^{2}+\delta y^{2}+\delta z^{2}+\delta u^{2}\right)}    , but also Maxwells equations are covariant with respect to these transformations, irrespective of the choice of                         λ                 {\displaystyle \lambda }    . These variants of conformal or Lie's sphere transformations were called spherical wave transformations by Bateman.[R 43][R 44] However, this covariance is restricted to certain areas such as electrodynamics, whereas the totality of natural laws in inertial frames is covariant under the Lorentz group.[R 45] In particular, by setting                         λ         =         1                 {\displaystyle \lambda =1}     the Lorentz group can be seen as a 10-parameter subgroup of the 15-parameter spacetime conformal group. Bateman (1910/12)  also alluded to the identity between the Laguerre inversion and the Lorentz transformations. In general, the isomorphism between the Laguerre group and the Lorentz group was pointed out by Élie Cartan (1912, 1915/55), [R 46] Henri Poincaré (1912/21)[R 47] and others. Following Klein (1889–1897) and Fricke & Klein (1897) concerning the Cayley absolute, hyperbolic motion and its transformation, Gustav Herglotz (1909/10) classified the one-parameter Lorentz transformations as loxodromic, hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The general case (on the left) equivalent to Lorentz transformation (5a) and the hyperbolic case (on the right) equivalent to Lorentz transformation (2c) are as follows:[R 48] Following Sommerfeld (1909), hyperbolic functions were used by Vladimir Varićak in several papers starting from 1910, who represented the equations of special relativity on the basis of hyperbolic geometry in terms of Weierstrass coordinates. For instance, by setting                         l         =         c         t                 {\displaystyle l=ct}     and                         v                    /                  c         =         tanh         ⁡         u                 {\displaystyle v/c=\tanh u}     with                         u                 {\displaystyle u}     as rapidity he wrote the Lorentz transformation in agreement with (2b):[R 49] Varićak also related the velocity addition to the hyperbolic law of cosines:[R 50] Subsequently, other authors such as E. T. Whittaker (1910) or Alfred Robb (1911, who coined the name rapidity) used similar expressions, which are still used in modern textbooks.  While earlier derivations and formulations of the Lorentz transformation relied from the outset on optics, electrodynamics, or the invariance of the speed of light, Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) showed that it is possible to use the principle of relativity (and related group theoretical principles) alone, in order to derive the following transformation between two inertial frames:[R 51][R 52] The variable                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     can be seen as a space-time constant whose value has to be determined by experiment or taken from a known physical law such as electrodynamics. For that purpose, Ignatowski used the above-mentioned Heaviside ellipsoid representing a contraction of electrostatic fields by                         x                    /                  γ                 {\displaystyle x/\gamma }     in the direction of motion. It can be seen that this is only consistent with Ignatowski's transformation when                         n         =         1                    /                             c                        2                                     {\displaystyle n=1/c^{2}}    , resulting in                         p         =         γ                 {\displaystyle p=\gamma }     and the Lorentz transformation (3b). With                         n         =         0                 {\displaystyle n=0}    , no length changes arise and the Galilean transformation follows. Ignatowski's method was further developed and improved by Philipp Frank and Hermann Rothe (1911, 1912),[R 53] with various authors developing similar methods in subsequent years.  In an appedix to Klein's and Sommerfeld's "Theory of the top" (1910), Fritz Noether showed how to formulate hyperbolic rotations using biquaternions with                         ω         =                                 −             1                                     {\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {-1}}}    , which he also related to the speed of light by setting                                    ω                        2                             =         −                    c                        2                                     {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=-c^{2}}    . He concluded that this is the principal ingredient for a rational representation of the group of Lorentz transformations equivalent to (6):[R 54]

French version by Élie Cartan (1908).  Cartan's version contains a description of Study's dual numbers, Clifford's biquaternions (including the choice                         ω         =                                 −             1                                     {\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {-1}}}     for hyperbolic geometry), and Clifford algebra, with references to Stephanos (1883), Buchheim (1884/85), Vahlen (1901/02) and others. Already in 1908, while describing "Drehstreckungen" (orthogonal substitutions in terms of rotations leaving invariant a quadratic form up to a factor) by using Cayley's (1854) quaternion multiplication formalism, Felix Klein pointed out that the modern principle of relativity as provided by Minkowski is essentially only the consequent application of such Drehstreckungen, even though he didn't provide details.[R 55] Citing Noether, in August 1910 Klein published the following quaternion substitutions forming the group of Lorentz transformations:[R 56] or in March 1911[R 57] Independently, also Arthur W.

Then he demonstrated the connection to indefinite quadratic forms expressing hyperbolic motions and Lorentz transformations. In three dimensions equivalent to (4b):[R 62] In four dimensions equivalent to (4c):[R 63] In pursuing the history in years before Lorentz enunciated his expressions, one looks to the essence of the concept. In mathematical terms, Lorentz transformations are squeeze mappings, the linear transformations that turn a square into a rectangles of the same area. Before Euler, the squeezing was studied as quadrature of the hyperbola and led to the hyperbolic logarithm. In 1748 Euler issued his precalculus textbook where the number e is exploited for trigonometry in the unit circle. The first volume of Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite had no diagrams, allowing teachers and students to draw their own illustrations. There is a gap in Euler's text where Lorentz transformations arise. A feature of natural logarithm is its interpretation as area in hyperbolic sectors. In relativity the classical concept of velocity is replaced with rapidity, a hyperbolic angle concept built on hyperbolic sectors. A Lorentz transformation is a hyperbolic rotation which preserves differences of rapidity, just as the circular sector area is preserved with a circular rotation. Euler’s gap is the lack of hyperbolic angle and hyperbolic functions, later developed by Johann H. Lambert. Euler described some transcendental functions: exponetiation and circular functions. He used the exponential series                                    ∑                        0                                   ∞                                        x                        n                                        /                  n         !         .                 {\displaystyle \sum _{0}^{\infty }x^{n}/n!.}     With the imaginary unit i2 = – 1, and splitting the series into even and odd terms, he obtained This development misses the alternative: Here Euler could have noted split-complex numbers along with complex numbers. For physics, one space dimension is insufficient. But to extend split-complex arithmetic to four dimensions leads to hyperbolic quaternions, and opens the door to abstract algebra’s  hypercomplex numbers. Reviewing the expressions of Lorentz and Einstein, one observes that the Lorentz factor is an algebraic function of velocity. For readers uncomfortable with transcendental functions cosh and sinh, algebraic functions may be more to their liking.
