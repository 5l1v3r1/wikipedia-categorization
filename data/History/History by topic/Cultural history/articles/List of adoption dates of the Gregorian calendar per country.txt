This is a list of adoption dates of the Gregorian calendar per country. For explanation, see the article about the Gregorian calendar. If not stated otherwise, it concerns the transition from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar by the civil authorities. In religious sources it could be that the Julian calendar was used for a longer period of time, in particular on the Protestant and Eastern Orthodox side. The historic area does not necessarily match the present-day area or country. The column 'present country' only provides a logic search entry.
