Tejate [teˈxate] is a non-alcoholic maize and cacao beverage traditionally made in Oaxaca, Mexico, originating from pre-Hispanic times.  It remains very popular among the indigenous Mixtec and Zapotec peoples, especially in rural areas. It is also very popular in Oaxaca and the surrounding regions.  Principal ingredients include toasted maize, fermented cacao beans, toasted mamey pits (pixtle) and  flor de cacao (also known as rosita de cacao).  These are finely ground into a paste. The paste is mixed with water, usually by hand, and when it is ready, the flor de cacao rises to the top to form a pasty foam. It can be served as-is or with some sugar syrup to sweeten it. The drink is served cold. The origin of the Mexican Spanish name tejate is not known for certain, but is thought to derive from the Nahuatl "floury water" texatl [ˈteʃat͡ɬ], compounded from "flour" textli [ˈteʃt͡ɬi] and "water" ātl [aːt͡ɬ].  The Zapotec name for tejate is cu'uhb.
