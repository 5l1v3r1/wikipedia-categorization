Thorvald Eiriksson (Old Norse: Þōrvaldr Eirikssonr; Icelandic: Þorvaldur Eiríksson) was the son of Erik the Red and brother of Leif Erikson.  The only Medieval Period source material available regarding Thorvald Eiriksson are the two Vinland sagas; the Greenland Saga and the Saga of Erik the Red. Although differing in various detail, according to both sagas Thorvald was part of an expedition for the exploration of Vinland and became the first European to die in North America.   The Greenland Saga describes a voyage made by Bjarni Herjolfsson, and the subsequent voyages of Leif Eriksson, his brother Thorvald Eiriksson, his sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir, and the Icelandic merchant Thorfinn Karsefni. The Saga describes hostilities with skraelings, the Norse term for the native peoples they met in the lands visited south and west of Greenland which they called Vinland and Markland. The Saga of Erik the Red  tells the story as a single expedition led by Thorfinn Karsefni. The voyage  of Thorvald Eriksson is told here as part of the Karlsefni expedition.
