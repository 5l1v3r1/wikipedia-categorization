The A. Verville Fellowship is an American senior scholarship established in the name of aviation pioneer Alfred V. Verville at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. The Verville Fellowship is a competitive nine- to twelve-month in-residence fellowship for researching the history of aviation.  The fellowship includes a $50,000 stipend with limited additional funds for travel and miscellaneous expenses.  Candidates for the fellowship should pursue programs of research and writing that support publication of works that are scholarly in tone and substance.  These materials should appeal to an audience with broad interests. Outstanding manuscripts resulting from this program may be offered to the Smithsonian Institution Press for publication.
