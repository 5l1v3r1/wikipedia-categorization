The Abbot Payson Usher Memorial Prize, established in 1961 and named for Dr Abbott Payson Usher, is an award given annually by Society for the History of Technology for the best scholarly work on the history of technology published over the preceding three years under the auspices of the Society.

James Watt based the premiums for using his patent steam engine on the power theoretically developed.  Mill owners did not want to pay more than necessary, particularly when they were starting a new venture that might not have its full complement of machinery .  The problem of determining the actual power output of the steam engine was solved around 1800 through the development of the ‘indicator’, a device that recorded the pressure of the steam in the cylinder against the movement of the piston .  John Southern realised that the power of the engine could be calculated from the area of the graph described by the indicator .
