 The Holberg Prize is an international prize awarded annually by the government of Norway to outstanding scholars for work in the arts, humanities, social sciences, law and theology, either within one of these fields or through interdisciplinary work.  The prize was established by the Parliament of Norway in honour of Ludvig Holberg in 2003 and complements its sister prize in mathematics, the Abel Prize. Ludvig Holberg excelled in all of the sciences covered by the award. It has been described as the "Nobel prize" for the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology.  The Holberg Prize is funded by the government's budget through a direct allocation from the Ministry of Education and Research to the University of Bergen, and is administered by the University of Bergen on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Research. The Holberg Prize award ceremony takes place annually in Bergen, Norway in June. The Holberg Board awards the prize at the recommendation of the Holberg Committee who consists of five outstanding researchers in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology. The Holberg Committee gathers assessments on the short-list candidates from international recognized scholars before giving their recommendation to the Board. The Prize amount is 4.5 million Norwegian kroner (approximately €500,000), which are intended to be used to further the research of the recipient. The Holberg Prize Academic Committee is composed of five members: As part of its research dissemination targeting younger people, the committee also awards the Nils Klim Prize to an academic below the age of 35, and the Holberg Prize Schools Project to a high school.
