The Premio Friuli Storia (Friuli Book Prize for Contemporary History) is an annual Italian literary award established in 2013 to promote standards of excellence in the writing of history books for a general readership. It is the only national Italian literary prize for non-fiction which entrusts the selection of the winner to a committee of non-specialist readers.  A scientific committee composed of academic historians produces a shortlist of books each year at the end of May. For the period 2017-2019, the committee is chaired by Tommaso Piffer and composed of Elena Aga Rossi, Roberto Chiarini, Ernesto Galli della Loggia, Charles S. Maier, Paolo Pezzino, Silvio Pons and Andrea Zannini. The winner is selected by a group of 200 readers and the final result is announced in September in Udine.
