The Norfolk Record Society (NRS for short) is a text publication society in the county of Norfolk, England. The Society was founded to encourage the study and preservation of historical records relating to Norfolk, and to publish editions of these documents. The society has offices in Norwich and is registered as a charity. Its membership is drawn mainly from East Anglia; however, individuals and institutions from around the world are also members.  The Society was founded in 1930.  It has published annually a transcript of a significant and sometimes unusual manuscript or collection of manuscripts. The series now covers a time-span ranging from the 12th to 20th centuries. All publications are carefully edited, indexed and include introductions explaining the background of the documents they present. The Society continues to publish on a wide range of subjects and encourages new researchers and members to submit ideas for future publications. The Society holds an annual lecture in conjunction with its annual publication launch. The NRS maintains an extensive collection of historical resources, which are on deposit at the Norfolk Record Office at the Archive Centre in Norwich. Some information is provided on their website.
