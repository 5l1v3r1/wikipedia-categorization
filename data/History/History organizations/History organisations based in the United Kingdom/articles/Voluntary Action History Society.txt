While some excellent histories of charities were available, they were rarely disseminated in the voluntary sector. Since its inception the society has carried out a number of activities including running a series of seminars on the history of voluntary action, hosting conferences and workshops.

In 2011 VAHS launched a new campaign for charity archives. Today, the Voluntary Action History Society carries out a number of activities including:
