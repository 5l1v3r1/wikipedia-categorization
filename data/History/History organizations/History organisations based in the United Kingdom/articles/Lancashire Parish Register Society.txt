The Lancashire Parish Register Society is a historical society and registered charity. It was founded for the 'purpose of printing the registers of the ancient parishes' in Lancashire. The society was formed at a meeting at Chetham's Library on 26 November 1897, but the year 1898 was fixed as the first year of the society's existence. The society became a registered charity (No. 511396) in 1981.  Since 1898, the society has published 175 printed volumes of Lancashire's parish registers, as well as numerous CDs and CD-Roms.  The society published its 175th volume in 2012.  Membership is open to all individuals and institutions interested in the parish registers of the county.
