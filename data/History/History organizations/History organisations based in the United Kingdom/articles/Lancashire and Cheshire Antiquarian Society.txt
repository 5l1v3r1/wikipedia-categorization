The Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society is a historical society and a registered charity (No. 1105708).  It was founded on 21 March 1883 for the education of the public by fostering and promoting the study of any aspects of the archaeology (both traditional and industrial), history, social history, genealogy, architecture and the arts, trade and trades, the history of institutions and local government, customs, and traditions of the area covered by the Palatine counties of Lancashire and Cheshire and succeeding local authorities ranging from antiquity to the twenty-first century.     Although the Society is based upon Manchester, its studies and activities embrace the region.  The society became a registered charity in 2004. The society organises a varied programme of lectures and events including visits to exhibitions, libraries, museums, galleries and places of historical, architectural and archaeological interest. The society also possesses an extensive Library of materials relating to the history and antiquities of both counties. The Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society is the society's peer-reviewed periodical which is published annually, and includes papers covering a wide variety of subjects relating to the two counties. The society also produces other publications on occasion. The 109th volume of the society's Transactions was published in 2013.  Membership is open to all individuals and societies who are interested in the various historical aspects of the two counties Palatine.
