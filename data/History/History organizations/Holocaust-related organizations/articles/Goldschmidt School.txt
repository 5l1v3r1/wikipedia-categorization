The Goldschmidt School was a school that existed in Berlin, Germany in the 1930s. It was founded by Leonore Goldschmidt, a German Jew after Jews were banned from enrolling in German schools.  Stella Goldschlag, who passed as Aryan and betrayed Jews during the war, was a pupil of the school.  Peter H. Wyden also attended the school, and later wrote a biography on Goldschlag.
