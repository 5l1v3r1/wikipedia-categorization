Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah is a Shoah Foundation that was formed in 2000, with recovered money from the property taken from French Jews during World War II. The Foundation’s mission is to support projects in all areas of history and research into the Shoah, education and transmission, memory, solidarity and Jewish culture.   The Foundation was often represented internationally by their Présidente d’honneur, Mme. Simone Veil, a survivor of Auschwitz concentration camp who later became the first directly elected President of the European Parliament.
