The Chorus Association of Venetian Churches (Italian: Chorus Associazione per le Chiese del Patriarcato di Venezia), often shortened to Chorus Association, is a conservation organisation working within the city of Venice in Italy. It works to safeguard, conserve and restore the artistic, historical and cultural heritage contained within the sixteen Venetian churches that presently constitute its membership.  Chorus was founded in June 1997, set-up by public act as a non-profit association. Its initial members were the priests and rectors of the thirteen founding churches. It was added to Venice City Council's Register of Associations in August 1997 and in December 1999 the Veneto Region recognised it as a legal entity in accordance with Italian Civil Code.  In 2000, the Cass di Risparmio di Venezia Foundation joined Chorus along with a number of lay persons. The total membership currently stands at nineteen.  Chorus brings together a network of 16 of Veniceâ€™s churches (see list below) which between them house more than a thousand works of art. The concept has been defined as an "area museum" and is run such that the latest conservation practices are applied across the network. The project also follows the concept of "conservation through utilisation" whereby the demand from visitors to view the cultural history on offer is translated into self-financing so that maintenance, conservation and valorisation of the history, artwork and heritage can continue to take place.  The 18 churches which are presently members of the Chorus Association are:  Chorus encourages visitors to Venice by providing information and standardised payment means at all of the member Churches.  It also publishes a guidebook to the churches.
