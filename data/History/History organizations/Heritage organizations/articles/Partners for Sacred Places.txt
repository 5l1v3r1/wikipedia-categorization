Partners for Sacred Places is an American non-sectarian, non-profit organization whose mission is the support of older and historic sacred places by helping congregations and local communities sustain and actively use the structures. Founded in 1989, Partners has helped several thousand congregations and other local organizations protect their community-serving sacred places in towns and cities across America. Partners works with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to help communities adapt former religious properties for new usesâ€”and retained them as important anchors and architectural landmarks.
