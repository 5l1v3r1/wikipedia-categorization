The Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art is an American foundation, which honors the legacy of the men and women who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (known as the "Monuments Men")  during and after World War II. Their heroic work of protecting and safeguarding civilization’s most important artistic and cultural treasures from armed conflict is unprecedented. It was founded in 2007  by Robert M. Edsel, author of Rescuing Da Vinci, The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, and Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis. Raising public awareness is essential to the Foundation’s mission.  The Monuments Men Foundation is one of the recipients of the 2007 National Humanities Medals.  The award cited it for "sustained efforts to recognize the contributions of the scholar-soldiers of the Second World War."
