Global Heritage Fund (GHF) is a non-profit organization that operates internationally.  Founded in California in 2002, GHF says it has since then invested over $25 million and secured $20 million in co-funding for 19 global heritage sites to ensure their sustainable preservation and responsible development.   Projects are selected by GHF's Senior Advisory Board. GHF states that selection is based on a number of factors, including cultural significance of site, need of country or region in question, and high potential for sustainable preservation through community involvement.  Based on information from their website, GHF has 13 currently active projects:  (* indicates a UNESCO World Heritage Site) GHF has ended its work on six sites: (* indicates a UNESCO World Heritage Site) In 2010, GHF launched Global Heritage Network (GHN), an early warning and threats monitoring system that uses satellite imaging technology and ground reporting to enable international experts and local conservation leaders to clearly identify and solve imminent threats within the legal core and protected areas of each site.  In October 2010, GHF produced a report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage: Safeguarding Endangered Cultural Heritage Sites in the Developing World.  The report listed 500 major archaeological and heritage sites in developing countries, evaluating their current loss and destruction, conservation and development.  It identified nearly 200 of these sites as "At Risk” or “Under Threat,” and 12 as “On the Verge” of irreparable loss and destruction.  The Vanishing report stated that there were five accelerating man-made threats facing global heritage sites in developing countries: development pressures, unsustainable tourism, insufficient management, looting, and war and conflict.
