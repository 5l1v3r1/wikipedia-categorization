Civic Trust Awards is a Community Interest Company founded in June 2009 following the closure of the Civic Trust charity earlier that year.  Civic Trust Awards continued the annual awards scheme independently. The Civic Trust Awards were originally established in 1959 by Michael Middleton CBE  of the Civic Trust to recognise outstanding architecture, urban design, landscape and public are which improve the quality of life for local communities. After the Civic Trust went into Administration in April 2009, the Civic Trust Awards have continued as an independent scheme operating on a not-for-profit basis as a Community Interest Company.    Awards are given for buildings and schemes which were architecturally outstanding and made positive differences to their local community. Each entry is judged by a voluntary panel including an Architect, Inclusive Design Advisor, a representative from the Local Planning Authority and a Local Community Representative. Several awards are issued each year from a shortlist. Some are given a commendation and a selected few are considered for a sponsored Special Award.  The main annual winners are given the Civic Trust Award, which comes with a plaque, and previous award winners include:
