The International National Trusts Organisation (INTO) is a network of national trusts and similar non-governmental organizations committed to preserving cultural heritage, "built and natural, tangible and intangible," including architecturally or historically significant items, and areas of natural beauty. INTO's mandate includes developing and promoting best practices, supporting existing national trust organizations, establishing new trusts, and advocating for heritage conservation. INTO was formally established in December 2007 at the 12th International National Trusts Conference in New Delhi, India. It operates as a non-profit corporation registered in England and Wales, with headquarters in London.    According to INTO chairman Simon Molesworth, an impetus for the formation of INTO came from the requests of some developing nations for help in preserving their cultural heritage in the midst of rapid development.  INTO membership represents over 50 countries, and includes England's National Trust, the first such trust, established in 1895.
