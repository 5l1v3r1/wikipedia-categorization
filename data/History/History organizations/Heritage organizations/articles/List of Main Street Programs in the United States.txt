Main Street Programs aim to revitalize their downtowns and commercial districts through preservation-based economic development and community revitalization. The project commenced in 1977 with a pilot involving 3 towns: Galesburg, Illinois, Madison, Indiana, and Hot Springs, South Dakota.   Since then, the program has been expanded to include many other towns. These may be statewide or regional "coordinating programs" or "local programs." Programs determined to be "Designated" follow best-practices established by the National Main Street Center and/or statewide or regional coordinating programs. A main street manager is appointed to implement the program locally.
