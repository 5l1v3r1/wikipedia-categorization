Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance (Ukrainian: Український Інститут Національної Пам’яті, UINR), or Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (UINM) is the central executive body operating under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Established on 31 May 2006 as a special organ for the restoration and preservation of national memory of the Ukrainian people. From 2006 till 2010 it was a central governmental institution with a special status, while from 2010 to 2014 a research budget institution. On December 9, 2010, the UINR was discontinued by a decree issued by Viktor Yanukovych and on the same day the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance as a research institution instead, within the budget from the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. In May 2015 President Poroshenko signed four laws concerning Decommunization in Ukraine. The director of the Institute, Volodymyr Viatrovych, was involved in the drafting of two of these laws. The criminal sentences imposed by these acts and their phrasing came in for criticism within the country and abroad.  The law "On access to the archives of repressive bodies of the communist totalitarian regime from 1917-1991" placed the state archives concerning repression during the Soviet period under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance.
