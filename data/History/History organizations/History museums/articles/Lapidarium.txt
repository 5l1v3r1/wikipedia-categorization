A lapidarium is a place where stone (Latin: lapis) monuments and fragments of archaeological interest are exhibited. They can include stone epigraphs; statues; architectural elements such as columns, cornices, and acroterions; bas reliefs, tombstones; and sarcophagi.  Such collections are often displayed in the outdoor courtyards of archaeology museums and history museums.  Media related to Lapidariums at Wikimedia Commons
