Al Salam Palace is a historic palace and museum in Kuwait.   The original landmark palace was built in the 1960s to accommodate visiting heads of state.  In the 1990s, the palace was severely damaged during the Iraqi invasion and thought by many to be beyond repair.  The palace is part of the new Kuwait National Cultural District (KNCD).
