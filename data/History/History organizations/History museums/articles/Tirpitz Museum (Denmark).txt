Tirpitz Museum (Danish: Tirpitz Museet), also called Blåvand Bunker Museum,  is a museum in Blåvand, on the coast of Jutland. It is built in an old bunker from which it got its name, and features exhibitions on the Atlantic Wall, the west coast of Denmark, and an amber collection. The Tirpitz Bunker started construction in 1944, and was built as part of the defense around the city of Esbjerg. Following the surrender of the German forces, construction was halted, and the bunker was therefore never completed.  The bunker was designed to house 2 turrets with 2 38 cm SK C/34 naval guns each.  After the war, the bunker was abandoned and later turned into a small museum.  In 2012, it was decided to expand and completely redesign the museum, with Bjarke Ingels Group being chosen as designer for the new museum.   The new museum features open spaces and is build into the dunes.   On 29 June 2017, an opening ceremony was held, with the Crown Prince and Minister of Culture attending.  The Museum features 4 exhibition areas, 3 of which are permanent exhibitions.  Furthermore, it is possible to enter the old bunker and gun turret with a glass reconstruction of the artillery guns.  Tells about Atlantic Wall and personal stories from the surrounding areas.  Tells the story of the 20,000 year old history of the Danish West Coast.  Features the largest collection of amber in Denmark.  The first non permanent exhibition, is centered around mine clearance, and features props and sets from the movie Land of Mine.
