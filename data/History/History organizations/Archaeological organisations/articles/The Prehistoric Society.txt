The Prehistoric Society is an international learned society devoted to the study of the human past from the earliest times until the emergence of written history.  Now based at University College London in the United Kingdom, it was founded by V. Gordon Childe, Stuart Piggott and Grahame Clark in 1935  but also traces its founding to the earlier Prehistoric Society of East Anglia  which began in 1908.  The society is a registered charity under English law.  Membership is by subscription and includes the annual journal, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society ISSN 0079-497X  (Print), ISSN 2050-2729 (Online),  which continues Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia (1911-1934) ISSN 0958-8418 (Print),  and bulletins from the newsletter, PAST, which is published in April, July and November. It also organises regular conferences, lectures and other events and makes grants for archaeological research.
