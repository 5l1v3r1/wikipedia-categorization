The Canadian Archeological Association is the primary archaeological organization in Canada. The CAA was founded in 1968 by a group of archaeologists that included William E. Taylor, the head of the Archaeology Division at the National Museum of Canada. The organization's first publication was named the Bulletin. In 1977 it was renamed the Canadian Journal of Archaeology.  The Smith-Wintemberg Award (also known as the Smith-Wintemberg Medal) was established by the CAA in 1978.  It recognises outstanding lifetime contributions to Canadian archaeology and is named for the pioneering archaeologists Harlan I. Smith and William J. Wintemberg. The nomination process is rigorous, requiring at least two letters of recommendation from peers, and as such the award is not given every year, only on merit.  The Smith-Wintemberg Award is considered highly prestigious    and has been described as the "highest recognition in Canadian archaeology".   The recipients of the award as of  MarchÂ 2018[update] are:
