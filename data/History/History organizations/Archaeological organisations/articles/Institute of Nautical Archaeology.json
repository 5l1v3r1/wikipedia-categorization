INA\u2019s founder <a href=\"/wiki/George_Bass_(archeologist)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"George Bass (archeologist)\">Dr. George Bass</a> pioneered the science of underwater excavation in the 1960s through work at <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Gelidonya\" title=\"Cape Gelidonya\">Cape Gelidonya</a> and other ancient shipwreck sites off the coast of Turkey.  Since then, INA has expanded its scope and activities to work globally on shipwrecks and submerged sites and worked with <a href=\"/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University\" title=\"Texas A&amp;M University\">Texas A&amp;M University</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/College_Station,_Texas\" title=\"College Station, Texas\">College Station, Texas</a> to establish the <a href=\"/wiki/Nautical_Archaeology_Program\" title=\"Nautical Archaeology Program\">Nautical Archaeology Program</a> there.  Hundreds of archaeologists have received their training at Texas A&amp;M and today, after more than three decades of the Nautical Archaeology Program\u2019s existence, many of the world\u2019s leading scholars have received their degrees from Texas A&amp;M.\n</p><p>INA is a not-for-profit group founded in 1973.  Today it has members all over the world, and counts among them professional archaeologists, students, and many others from all walks of life.  INA\u2019s members are interested in seeking out lost ships, and applying the highest standards of science and art to excavating and studying them to unlock their secrets.  They do so to add to humanity\u2019s understanding of seafaring\u2019s role in the development of civilization.  Three-quarters of the earth is covered by water, and in the fabric of human history, the most pervasive thread is our association with the planet\u2019s oceans, rivers and lakes.\n</p><p>The Institute of Nautical Archaeology works for the public to share what nautical archaeologists do, with anyone with an interest.  INA is also committed to the preservation of the world\u2019s shipwrecks and other archaeological sites, but specifically to finding the most significant sites and excavating them to unlock their secrets.\n</p><p>INA\u2019s professional and volunteer members and affiliates have conducted fieldwork in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and Europe.  They have worked on the world\u2019s oldest known shipwrecks, and on wrecks as recent as <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>.  Their work has improved the understanding of ancient trade in the <a href=\"/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea\" title=\"Mediterranean Sea\">Mediterranean</a>, the development of the ship, shipbuilding in the Ancient World, the saga of European expansion into the New World, and wars for the control of the Americas.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selected_projects\">Selected projects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Institute_of_Nautical_Archaeology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Selected projects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Easter_Island\" title=\"Easter Island\">Easter Island</a> Survey</li>\n<li>related to the <a href=\"/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush\" title=\"Klondike Gold Rush\">Klondike Gold Rush</a>: Yukon River Survey, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush\" title=\"Klondike Gold Rush\">Gold Rush</a> Ghost Ships</i> film from the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Geographic_Society\" title=\"National Geographic Society\">National Geographic Society</a>, exploration of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/A._J._Goddard\" title=\"A.
