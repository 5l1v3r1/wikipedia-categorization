The Committee for the Prevention of Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount is an apolitical group of archaeologists, intellectuals and other prominent individuals from the left and right. Its most outspoken member is the prominent archaeologist, Dr. Eilat Mazar of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  The group was formed in response to concerns about damage to antiquities at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem by construction work being carried out there.
