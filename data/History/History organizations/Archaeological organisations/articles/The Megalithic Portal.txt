The Megalithic Portal is a web resource dedicated to prehistoric archaeology and closely related subjects. The Megalithic Portal's mission is to document, publicise and protect ancient sites and help to ensure their preservation for future generations. Founded by chartered engineer Andy Burnham, the site database began in 1997 as Megalithic Mysteries, and the Prehistoric Web Index,  from a database he originally compiled. The Megalithic Portal has existed in its current form since February 2001. The information is maintained by a team of voluntary editors and administrators and has become the centre of a keen user group. Contributors have been known to give up their jobs to travel, researching little-known ancient sites to add to the database. In 2002, Archaeology Magazine reviewed the Megalithic Portal, describing it as 'useful, fun, and accurate'.  As of January 2010 the Megalithic Portal has been constituted as a non profit making membership society  The information contributed by thousands of visitors from all over the world covers types of prehistoric monument from chambered tombs and standing stones to hillforts and settlements, and much in between. There are many tens of thousands of listings, and over the years the site has extended beyond prehistoric megaliths, extending to, for example Pictish symbol stones in Scotland. While the site still calls itself the Megalithic Portal, it has also become the biggest online repository of data on related areas of interest such as holy wells and ancient crosses in the UK.  Its listings are often referenced by noted web sites  and in recent books on megaliths  and Holy Wells.  A recent project (April 2010) has involved contributors finding over 1000 ancient sites pictured on Google Street View in the UK and elsewhere   Site features include:
