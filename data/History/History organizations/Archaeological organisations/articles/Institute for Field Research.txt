The Institute for Field Research (IFR) is a non profit organization  established in 2011 by a group of academic archaeologists. It operates as an independent, nonprofit academic organization that offers archaeology field research courses at various archaeological sites around the world. The IFR signed an affiliation agreement with Connecticut College in November 2012.   Through this agreement, students receive 8 semester credit units (equivalent to 12 quarter units) for attending any of the field schools offered by the IFR. These units are transferable to student's home institution through official Connecticut College transcripts. Students receive a letter grade for attending a field school.  All field schools provide a minimum of 192 direct instructional hours.
