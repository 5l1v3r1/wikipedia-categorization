The Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society is a learned society concerned with the history and antiquities of the City of Bristol and the historic county of Gloucestershire. It was founded on 21 April 1876; and is a registered charity, number 202014.  The aims of the society are to "promote the study of the history and antiquities of Bristol and the historic county of Gloucestershire, to encourage their conservation and to publish reports of excavations, research and original historical sources".  The activities of the society include:  The society has an extensive history of publication. Its annual journal, the Transactions, has been published continuously since 1876. All volumes to vol. 129 (2011) have been digitised, and are freely available on the society's website.  The society acts as a text publication society, and since 1988 has published annually in its Record Series a volume comprising an edition of some historical record or collection of records relating to the history of Gloucestershire. (The Record Series does not publish records relating exclusively to Bristol, to avoid undue overlap with the activities of the separate Bristol Record Society, founded in 1929.)  The society also publishes occasional monographs and thematic essay volumes relating to its areas of interest.  The society's library is held at the University of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham.
