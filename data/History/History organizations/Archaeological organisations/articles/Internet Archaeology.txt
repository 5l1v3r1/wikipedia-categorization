Internet Archaeology is an international scholarly journal and one of the first fully peer-reviewed electronic journals for archaeology. It published its first issue in 1996. The journal was part of the eLIb project's electronic journals.     The journal is produced and hosted at the Department of Archaeology at the University of York, UK and nominally published by the Council for British Archaeology. Internet Archaeology's first managing Editor was Dr Alan Vince (1996-1999). The journal is currently edited by Judith Winters (since 1999). The journal is co-directed by Prof. Julian Richards (University of York) and Dr Michael Heyworth (Council for British Archaeology) and supported by an Advisory Committee  made up from representatives from the Archaeology Data Service, the archaeological commercial sector, and a range of leading international universities.  Internet Archaeology was established with funding from the Jisc's Electronic Libraries (eLib)  programme and initially explored a subscription model.   In September 2014, the journal's editor Judith Winters announced that the publication had adopted an open access approach and that all past and future content would be freely available.  Journal content makes use of the potential of internet publication to present archaeological research (excavation reports, methodology, analyses, applications of information technology) in ways that could not be achieved in print, such as full colour images, photographs, searchable data sets, visualisations/virtual reality models and interactive mapping. The journal's content is archived by the Archaeology Data Service (ADS).
