The Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance (DÖW) was established in 1963.

Resistance was long seen as an act of cowardice, treason and murder. A landmark in the development of the center was the establishment of the DÖW Foundation in 1983, which is supported by the Austrian Federal Government, the City of Vienna, and the DÖW Society, thus putting the center on a sound financial footing. From its modest beginnings, when work was carried out mainly by idealistic victims of Fascism and later by a qualified younger staff, the center has developed into an authoritative institution, respected in Austria and abroad. The focal points of the center's broad range of tasks can be summarized as follows: The activity of the center encompasses the following areas:
