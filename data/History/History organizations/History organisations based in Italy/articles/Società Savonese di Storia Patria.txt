The Società Savonese di Storia Patria (SSSP) is a non-profit historical society founded in 1885. Its registered location is in Savona: its statutory interests are directed towards historical Liguria, and so they cover an area wider than the current homonym Italian region. The Società Savonese di Storia Patria was founded in 27 December 1885 with the name of Società storica savonese by a group of intellectuals at the request of Paolo Boselli, the future Prime Minister. In 1916 it assumed its present name. The social activity is coordinated by a board of council members and it is mainly expressed in the publication of an annual volume of Atti e memorie and other publishing activities (magazine Sabazia, editorial series Zetesis and Novecento). The non-publishing activities are very intense and they include historical conferences, also organized with other institutions, and interventions more closely linked to the cultural life. The Society owns a specialized library of more than 50,000 titles. The main ongoing research of the society is represented by the Progetto Toponomastica Storica (Historical Toponymy Project) that collects and studies historical place names; the project began in 2011 and up to now has published over 50,000 pre–19th century toponyms, related to Liguria and Piedmont.
