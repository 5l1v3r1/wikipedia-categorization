The building of the institute, finished in 1963, was the first in the world specially designed to promote the interdisciplinary approach to works of art. The building was designed by architect Charles Rimanque based on an initial technical concept by René Sneyers.

To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: http://balat.kikirpa.be/object/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for Lam Gods is 21, so its BALaT artwork page can be referenced.
