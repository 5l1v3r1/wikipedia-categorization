The Canadian Society for the Study of Rhetoric (CSSR) is a bilingual scholarly society based in Canada that is open to scholars involved in the teaching or researching of rhetoric. While the CSSR was founded as a Canadian version of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric, and while—as implied by its original name, the Canadian Seminar on the History of Rhetoric (CSHR) —it originally focused on the history of rhetoric, the CSSR now focuses on a range of rhetorical scholarship. Its membership typically includes scholars from North America and Europe (not just Canada) and its conferences typically include joint sessions with other societies as a "natural reflection of the interdisciplinary interests of [its] members."  The CSSR publishes an on-line refereed journal, Rhetor,  and meets annually for an academic conference, usually as part of the annual Congress of Humanities and Social Sciences run by the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences.
