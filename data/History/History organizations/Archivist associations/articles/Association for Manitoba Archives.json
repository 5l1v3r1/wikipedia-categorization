The membership is made up primarily of archivists and archival institutions, but anyone who is interested in supporting the mandate of the organization can join. \n</p><p>The AMA is an amalgamation of two organizations: the Association of Manitoba Archivists, founded in 1980, and the Manitoba Council of Archives, founded in 1986.  The Association of Manitoba Archivists provided a seasonal program of meetings on various archival subjects. It created a basic training program, implemented a field advisory service for new or emerging archives, published a newsletter and sponsored a number of outreach programs and events to promote the profession and archives.  The Manitoba Council of Archives was created specifically to distribute grants from the newly formed Canadian Council of Archives.  In support of the grant program, the Manitoba Council undertook a provincial archival needs assessment study entitled \"The Past is Present\" (1988).<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> A study of institutional standards and accreditation, the so-called Stunden Report, followed in 1990.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Plan2000_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Plan2000-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>A joint committee was created to look at the existence of the two organizations and published a report in 1991. \"Plan 2000: The Manitoba Archival Community in the 1990s\" stated that the archival community in Manitoba was not large enough to support two separate organizations dedicated to archives and that a single organization should be established.  The two organizations merged shortly thereafter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Plan2000_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Plan2000-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Today the AMA provides a number of services, including: support for its members; advisory services for both members and non-members; educational and training opportunities; advocacy to increase the awareness of archives in the wider community; publications; virtual and real exhibitions; grants and awards.  Of particular interest to the broader community is the <a href=\"/wiki/Manitoba_Day_Award\" title=\"Manitoba Day Award\">Manitoba Day Award</a>, which recognizes those users of archives who have completed an original work of excellence which contributes to the understanding and celebration of Manitoba history.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Association_for_Manitoba_Archives&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Haglund, Diane, Coordinator. \"The Past is Present: A Needs Assessment and Planning Study for Archives in Manitoba,\" Manitoba Council of Archives, 1988.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Plan2000-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Plan2000_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Plan2000_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"Plan 2000: The Manitoba Archival Community in the 1990s,\" the Association of Manitoba Archivists and the Manitoba Council of Archives, March 1991.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm\">AMA Website</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090412024436/http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm\">Archived</a> 2009-04-12 at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Association_for_Manitoba_Archives&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090412024436/http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm\">AMA Website</a> - provides information about the organization</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2237\nCached time: 20180915194357\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.034 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 59/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 352/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 1530/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.007/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 736 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   22.081      1 Template:Webarchive\n100.00%   22.081      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:22515425-0!canonical and timestamp 20180915194357 and revision id 859708155\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Webarchive_template_wayback_links"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Non-profit_organizations_based_in_Manitoba"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Archivist_associations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Professional_associations_based_in_Canada"},{"sortkey":"","*":"History_organizations_based_in_Canada"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Canada"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Manitoba"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Manitoba Day Award"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Wayback Machine"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Webarchive"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Webarchive"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Webarchive/data"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm","https://web.archive.org/web/20090412024436/http://www.mbarchives.mb.ca/index.htm"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Association_for_Manitoba_Archives","byteoffset":2849,"anchor":"References"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Association_for_Manitoba_Archives","byteoffset":2880,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Association for Manitoba Archives","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q4809480"}]}}
