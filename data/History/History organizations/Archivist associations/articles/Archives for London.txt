Archives for London (AfL) is the independent voice for archives in the United Kingdom's capital city. A membership organisation, AfL brings together archive users and practitioners who are passionate about archives in and about London. It runs events and networks that bring people together to share knowledge and experiences, keep up to date on what's happening in the archive scene and exchange the latest news on archives, local studies, records management and conservation in London. The seminar programme takes place on the first Thursday evening of each month, with guest speakers including archivists, heritage outreach officers, historical researchers and academics. The regular 'Behind the Scenes' programme provides exclusive opportunities for unique guided tours of London's archive repositories. The newsletter is published 4-5 times a year, written and produced exclusively by members for members. The annual conference is held in October of each year. AfL was launched in July 2005, growing out of the Greater London Archives Network, the London Archives Users Forum and the London Archives Regional Council.
