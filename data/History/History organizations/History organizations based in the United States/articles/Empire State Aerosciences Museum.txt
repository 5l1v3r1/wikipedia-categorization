The Empire State Aerosciences Museum (commonly referred to as ESAM) is a non-profit museum which strives to "educate, entertain and excite with experiences in air and space.” Established in 1984 and chartered by the New York State Department of Education, the museum is located on 27 acres (110,000 m2) of land on the western perimeter of the Schenectady County Airport in Glenville, New York, United States.   ESAM sponsors an annual air show at the Schenectady Airport. The museum has a collection of military aircraft outside the main building, in the Agneta Airpark including:  ESAM's two galleries contain more fragile aircraft, detailed models, artifacts, memorabilia, and photographs. Other exhibits include the Amelia Earhart Exhibit, the DePischoff "flying motorcycle," and a 32' scale model of the Japanese World War II aircraft carrier "Akagi". There are also several interactive displays. In addition, the museum houses the Wallace Holbrook Restoration Center which treats aircraft in various stages of restoration. Examples on display indoors include:  The primary mission of the Janz Vander Veer Research Center/Library is to support the Museum's Education, Exhibit and Restoration programs. In addition, it serves as a resource to the general public for historical and technical aeroscience related information.

The Library contents are made up of a broad collection of books, brochures, photographs, technical manuals, periodicals, scrapbooks, artwork and audiovisual items.
