The blog became a focus of controversy in libertarian and conservative circles when in the process of discussing a 2009 change to the mission statement two members <a href=\"/wiki/David_T._Beito\" title=\"David T. Beito\">David T. Beito</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thaddeus_Russell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Thaddeus Russell (page does not exist)\">Thaddeus Russell</a> used the blog to denounce the mission statement <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/blog/2009/03/haw-info-draft-of-haw-statement.html\">[11]</a>. Rather than posting their objection in the comments section as other members were doing, they posted their complaints as a new posts at the top of the blog. When HAW web editor <a href=\"/wiki/Marc_Becker\" title=\"Marc Becker\">Marc Becker</a> moved their post to the comments section, they reposted it again at the top of the blog. Fearing an attempt to subvert the organization's attempt to discuss a new mission statement, HAW's steering committee decided to remove their privilege of creating new posts. Beito and Russell contended that this move was ideologically motivated. Charging that the steering committee intended to maintain HAW as a closed \"leftist social club,\" Beito and Russell both resigned from HAW <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/121872.html\">[12]</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"HAW_at_the_AHA\">HAW at the AHA</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Historians_Against_the_War&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: HAW at the AHA\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>HAW has a regular presence at the annual meetings of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Historical_Association\" title=\"American Historical Association\">American Historical Association</a> (AHA).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2006\">2006</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Historians_Against_the_War&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: 2006\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At the 2006 AHA annual meeting in Philadelphia, HAW voted to join the \"Urgent Appeal to Save Iraq's Academics\" <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://wwwbrusselstribunal.org\">[13]</a> that publicized the indiscriminate killing that has taken the lives of 250 Iraqi colleagues as well as the United Nations University report that 84 percent of Iraq's institutions of higher education have already been burnt, looted or destroyed. HAW also debated resolutions scheduled for the AHA Business Meeting opposing the \"so-called\" academic bill of rights.  HAW played the lead role in this effort, initiating discussion, delegated drafting the text to Ellen Schrecker, and gathered almost one hundred co-sponsors.  The \u201cResolution opposing Academic and Student Bills of Rights and Similar Regulations of the Academic Community,\u201d was approved by HAW, the AHA Business Meeting and received unanimous approval from the American Historical Association Council.  HAW also sponsored two breakfasts and an evening social.\n</p><p>HAW also sponsored a well attended roundtable on \"Historical Perspectives on Bush's Foreign Policy.\"  Alan Dawley chaired the session and discussion which produced vibrant and vital debate and discussion on the central question of how U.S. foreign policy can be changed after elites run the country into a war. The speakers were John Prados, \"How We Were Hoodwinked on Iraq,\" Rusti Eisenberg, \"Historical Lessons from the Vietnam Era,\" and Larry Wittner, \"The Role of Peace Movements in Ending Wars.\"\n</p><p>John Prados talked about splits in ruling circles as a factor in undoing the policy of war.  In his opening comment, he showed how the Bush inner circle was so fixated on going to war with Iraq that it did not request CIA intelligence for fear that it might upset the applecart by showing there were no weapons of mass destruction.\n</p><p>To Rusti Eisenberg, on the other hand, there was no point in looking to the \u201cNational Security/Welfare State\u201d for a change of course. Having learned virtually nothing from the Vietnam experience, the Bush circle is almost as irrational as the Nixon-Kissinger team in pursuing a policy that is doomed to fail, though not before slaughtering countless innocents. The only hope for change is a mass movement that will pressure elected representatives to change course, just as Congress cut off funding for Vietnam. For those wanting to believe that the peace movement can effect policy change, Larry Wittner offered some hopeful evidence. In an insightful review of the role of peace movements in ending U.S. wars from 1812 to Vietnam, he argued that even warmongers like Reagan had to change course in response to the worldwide movement against nuclear weapons. Having been invited to comment, Bruno Cartosio (editor of the Italian U.S-studies journal <i>Acoma</i>) affirmed the importance of social movement in mobilizing opposition in Italy even before the Iraq war began.\n</p><p>In numerous exchanges between audience and panelists, analysis of the way to end war was deepened, often in reference to the anti-war movement of the Vietnam era. One important issue that emerged in discussion was that of \u201clinkage\u201d among movements. Where some felt strength lay in a single-issue focus on war, others felt worldwide opposition to the anticipated Iraq war was as strong as it was because it grew out of the post-Seattle <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-globalization_movement\" title=\"Anti-globalization movement\">anti-globalization movement</a>. This raised the question of whether the ultimate causes of war lay in the needs of capitalist expansion, the imperatives of the National Security State, the tribalism of US v. Them, or some other cause.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2007\">2007</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Historians_Against_the_War&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: 2007\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The AHA\u2019s annual business meeting, January 6, 2007, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the HAW-initiated resolution deploring the Iraq War\u2019s effect on open inquiry and democratic processes and calling on historians \u201cto do whatever they can to bring the Iraq war to a speedy conclusion.\u201d  The AHA Council referred the resolution to the membership via an electronic ballot and set up a blog for members to post comments prior to the voting.
