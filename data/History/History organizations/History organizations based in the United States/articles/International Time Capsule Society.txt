The International Time Capsule Society (ITCS), based at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, Georgia, is an organization established to promote the study of time capsules.         Since 1990, it has been documenting all types of time capsule projects worldwide.        In October 2016 its website reported that it is no longer active but continues to register time capsules. The founders are time capsule researchers from the United States and Europe.   The International Time Capsule Society states in their handout brochure as their mission: The International Time Capsule Society is an organization dedicated to tracking the world's time capsules to ensure that those that are created are not lost.    The ITCS has set up a registry of time capsules, and has 1,400 groups listed.    The ITCS estimates there are between 10,000 and 15,000 time capsules worldwide.   Paul Hudson of Oglethorpe University estimates that more than 80 percent of all time capsules are lost and will not be opened on their intended date. The ITCS held a series of conferences at Oglethorpe University at their campus in Atlanta, Georgia.  The International Time Capsule Society is based at Oglethorpe University, home of the Crypt of Civilization, the first modern time capsule. The International Time Capsule Society is also in search of several time capsules that supposedly at one time existed, however are presently lost.   It requests that the whereabouts of any of the lost capsules be reported to them.  New methods using GPS coordinates are underway to prevent time capsules from getting lost in time.
