The Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP) formed in 1991 in the United States on the initiative of scholars Jonathan Rose, Simon Eliot, and others.   Its members study the history of books and the "composition, mediation, reception, survival, and transformation of written communication."  The group maintains an electronic discussion list (SHARP-L), produces the academic journal Book History (est. 1998), and holds annual meetings.  Membership consists mostly of British and American scholars.
