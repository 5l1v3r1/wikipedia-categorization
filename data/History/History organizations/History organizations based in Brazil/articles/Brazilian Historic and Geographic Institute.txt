The Instituto Histórico e Geográfico (IHGB) (Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute), founded October 21, 1838, is the oldest and traditional authority to promote research and preservation of historical and geographical, cultural and social sciences in Brazil. Their creation, together with the Public Archives of Empire, which amounted to the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, joined the effort of the conservatives (Regency of Pedro de Araújo Lima), to build a strong and centralized imperial state.
