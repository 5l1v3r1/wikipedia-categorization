 The North American Society for Oceanic History (NASOH) is the national organization in the United States of America for professional historians, underwater archeologists, archivists, librarians, museum specialists and others working in the broad field of maritime history. NASOH is an affiliated society of the American Historical Association. NASOH was founded in 1973 to provide a forum for maritime history and remains actively devoted to the study and promotion of maritime history. The society's objectives are to promote the exchange of information among its members and others interested in the history of the seas, lakes, and inland waterways; to call attention to books, articles, and documents pertinent to naval and maritime history; and to work with local, regional, national, international, and government organizations toward the goal of fostering a more general awareness and appreciation for North America's naval and maritime heritage. NASOH also houses the U.S. Commission on Maritime History which is a constituent member of the International Commission for Maritime History. NASOH's organizational records are deposited in the Joyner Library at East Carolina University. Every year NASOH holds an academic conference, where its members present papers on current research in maritime history.  Each year, the conferences are held in a different location. The site is usually at a maritime location, which will allow members to link a broad national and global understanding of maritime history to local and regional maritime activities. Meetings have been held on the West Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Great Lakes, the Mid- and Southern-Atlantic coasts of the United States as well as in Canada and in Bermuda. 2017 - Charleston, SC 2016 - Portland, ME 2015 - Monterey, CA 2014 – Erie, PA 2013 – Alpena, MI 2012 - Galveston, TX 2011 – Norfolk, VA 2010 – Mystic, CT 2009 – Vallejo, CA 2008 – Pensacola, FL 2007 – Kings Point, NY 2006 – Manitowoc, WI 2005 – Savannah, GA 2004 – St. Michaels, MD 2003 – Bath, ME 2002 – Honolulu, HI 2001 – Kingston, ON 2000 – Point Clear, AL 1999 – Lake George, NY 1998 – San Diego, CA 1997 – Newport, RI 1996 – Boston, MA 1995 – Wilmington, North Carolina 1994 – Vancouver, BC 1993 – Bermuda 1992 – Washington, DC 1991 – New York City & Fort Schuyler 1990 – Newport News, VA 1989 – San Francisco, CA 1988 – Woods Hole, MA 1987 – Kingston, ON 1986 – Galveston, TX 1985 – Salem, MA 1984 – Kings Point, NY 1983 – Mystic, CT 1982 – Charleston, SC 1981 – Cleveland, OH 1980 – Halifax, NS 1979 – Newport News, VA 1978 – Annapolis, MD 1977 – Salem, MA 1973 – Orono, ME 1971 – Orono, ME The President of NASOH awards on occasion the K.

The Society publishes at regular intervals the NASOH Newsletter to inform members about activities within the field of maritime history. From 2007, NASOH also publishes in association with the Canadian Nautical Research Society the refereed academic journal The Northern Mariner (TNM). From time to time, NASOH publishes books of collected papers from its annual conferences and NASOH will be publishing a series of handbooks for use in teaching aspects of maritime history.
