The International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID) was an international organization that was created to promote universal access to all recorded knowledge. FID was established on 12 September 1895, in Brussels, as the International Institute of Bibliography (originally Institut International de Bibliographie, IIB) by two Belgian lawyers, Paul Otlet (1868–1944) and Henri La Fontaine (1854–1943). It was popularly known as the Brussels Institute. Its headquarters was changed to The Hague after 1934. It had gone through a number of changes in name that reflect changes of conceptualisation of the field in which it operates. The changes in names and years are : The Institute was one of the sponsors of the first World Congress of Universal Documentation, held in Paris in 1937.  One of the publications of FID was FID Communications.
