The Siam Society Under Royal Patronage (Thai: สยามสมาคมในพระบรมราชูปถัมภ์) is a society in Bangkok, Thailand, which aims to promote knowledge of Thailand. Its headquarters and library are on Asok Montri Road and it also runs the Kamthieng House Museum. It was founded on 26 February 1904 at a meeting at the Oriental Hotel.  The first resolution proposed was to the effect that those there assembled should form themselves into a society for research and investigation in matters appertaining to Siam. There were 103 founding members,  and currently the society has close to 1800 members.  The society has published the Journal of the Siam Society (JSS) since 1904 and the articles aged over a hundred years are available online.  The proceedings of the society were submitted to UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.
