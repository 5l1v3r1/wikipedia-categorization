The Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma or CEGES-SOMA) is a research institute and archive in Anderlecht, Belgium which focusses on World War II and the contemporary history of Belgium. Administratively, the centre is part of the Belgian State Archives. Nico Wouters is the Director of the institute. The Centre is a member of the European Network for Contemporary History (EURHISTXX).  The Centre was founded in 1967 as the Centre for Research and Historical Study into the Second World War (Centre de Recherches et dâ€™Etudes historiques de la Seconde Guerre mondiale). Its creation was a response to the legal acquittal of a Flemish collaborator, Robert Jan Verbelen, in 1965 as a result of insufficient documentary records. From 1969, the institution began to actively collect publications and archives relating to the Second World War.  Subsequently, the institution began to expand the scope of its research into World War I and other aspects of contemporary history. In 1997, it was renamed the Centre for Study and Documentary on War and Contemporary Society. In 2016, it became an administrative part of the Belgian State Archives.
