The Sequoyah National Research Center (SNRC), located in Little Rock, Arkansas, is home of the American Native Press Archives (ANPA).  ANPA is one of the largest repositories of Native American publications in the world.  The Center is also home to the J.W. Wiggins Native American Art Collection, a collection of over 2400 pieces of art by contemporary Native American artists. From the SNRC website: The American Native Press Archives began in 1983 as a clearinghouse for information on American Indian and Alaska Native newspapers and periodicals. In the ensuing years, it has evolved from a joint effort of the Department of English and the Ottenheimer Library [the UALR library] to a freestanding unit in the University. Its mission has changed from an information exchange to a research facility that collects and archives the products of the Native press and materials related to Native press history, collects and documents the works of Native writers, constructs bibliographic guides to Native writing and publishing, creates digital editions of writers' works, and conducts and publishes original research on topics of importance to Indian communities. It stands today as one of the world's largest repositories of Native thought.ANPA was founded in 1983 by Dr. Daniel F. Littlefield and Dr. James W. Parins.  The SRC is the physical housing, educational, and research portion of ANPA, and ANPA is usually just referred to as "SRC".  The SRC is housed and supported by the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. The name "Sequoyah Research Center", comes from Sequoyah, a Cherokee silversmith and inventor of that tribe's syllabary.
