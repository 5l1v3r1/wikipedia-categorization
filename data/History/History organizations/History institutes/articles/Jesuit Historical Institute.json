The century\u2019s atmosphere of religious controversies and polemical anti-clerical and anti-Jesuit pamphlets and diatribes required, for appropriate rejoinders, that access be given to the foundational documents of Jesuit life and history. Historical science had also made great progress. New methods had been developed.\n</p><p>Encouraged by <a href=\"/wiki/General_Congregation\" title=\"General Congregation\">General Congregation</a> XXIV (of 1892) the <a href=\"/wiki/Superior_General_of_the_Society_of_Jesus\" title=\"Superior General of the Society of Jesus\">Superior General</a> of the Jesuits <a href=\"/wiki/Luis_Martin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Luis Martin\">Luis Martin</a> established in 1893 a 'College of writers' in Madrid, with mission to establish critical editions of the foundational documents of the <a href=\"/wiki/Society_of_Jesus\" title=\"Society of Jesus\">Society of Jesus</a>, particularly those regarding the life and times of the founders, Saint <a href=\"/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola\" title=\"Ignatius of Loyola\">Ignatius of Loyola</a> and his first companions. The purpose was also to provide material for accurate regional and national histories of the Society to be prepared in various European countries. The historians entrusted with the task adopted the critical methods of contemporary historical research. In January 1894 the first volume of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Monumenta_Historica_Societatis_Iesu\" title=\"Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu\">Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu</a></i> came out of the press.\n</p><p>In 1911 the Institute extended its field of work and research and began to publish historical monographs on particular aspects of Jesuit life, spirituality and apostolic works. In 1930 the Superior General <a href=\"/wiki/Wlodimir_Ledochowski\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wlodimir Ledochowski\">Wlodimir Ledochowski</a> decided to transfer it to Rome, where it settled in the \u2018Curia Generalizia\u2019, headquarter of the Jesuit Order.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Collections_and_Publications\">Collections and Publications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jesuit_Historical_Institute&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Collections and Publications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>The <b>Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu</b> (<a href=\"/wiki/Monumenta_Historica_Societatis_Iesu\" title=\"Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu\">MHSI</a>) are critical editions of primary sources from the first centuries of the Society of Jesus\u2019 history. 156 volumes have been published.</li>\n<li><b>Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu (nova series).</b> A change of criteria and procedures introduced in 2005 opened a new series of \u2018<i>Monumenta\u2019</i>.
