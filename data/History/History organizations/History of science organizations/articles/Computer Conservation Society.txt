  The Computer Conservation Society (CCS) is a British organisation, founded in 1989. It is under the joint umbrella of the British Computer Society,  the London Science Museum and the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry.   The CCS is interested in the history of computing in general and the conservation and preservation of early British historical computers in particular.  The society runs a series of monthly public lectures between September and May each year in both London and Manchester.  The events are detailed on the society's website.  The CCS publishes a quarterly journal, Resurrection.   The society celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2014.   Dr Doron Swade,  formerly the curator of the computing collection at the London Science Museum, was a founding committee member. The current[when?] chair of the society is Mr David Morriss. The immediate past chair was Mrs Rachel Burnett. The society organises a number of projects to reconstruct and maintain early computers and to conserve early software.
