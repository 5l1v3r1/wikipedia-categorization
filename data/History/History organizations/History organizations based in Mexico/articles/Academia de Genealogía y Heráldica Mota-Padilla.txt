 The Academia de Genealogía y Heráldica Mota-Padilla (Academy of Genealogy and Heraldry Mota-Padilla) was a cultural institution based in Guadalajara, Jalisco, the second largest city in Mexico. According with an article published in the Genealogical Journal (1971), this institution was the first genealogical association in Latin America.  It was established on 12 January 1920 by Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad (1855–1923);  it was erected in memory of the first Historian of the former Kingdom of Nueva Galicia (New Galicia) in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, Matías Angel de la Mota Padilla (1688–1766), author of Historia de la Conquista del Reino de la Nueva Galicia (1741);  among its members, the very same Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad was a direct descendant of the after mentioned author.   This institution was privately funded and led by enthusiasts of the Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences whose main purpose was to promote the creation of a study about the history of the municipality of Unión de Tula, Jalisco, with a genealogical and heraldic research of the four founding families of that place, which were the Topete, the Villaseñor, the Lazcano and the Arriola families (the name of the place was originated through their initials: T V L A).  With the passing of time, the Academia's objectives went beyond the original idea, promoting any kind of Genealogical and Heraldic studies, then, more enthusiasts became members of this institution. They gathered monthly and produced some interesting works, like those published by journalist Alberto Santoscoy or by historian José R. Benítez; unfortunately, some of those papers are still unpublished.  The founding members were five: Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad (1855–1923), José Ignacio Dávila Garibi (1888–1981), Jorge Verea y Vallarta (1877–1958), Enrique Eduardo López Maldonado († 1938), and Alberto Santoscoy (1857–1906).
