The Pulitzer Prize for History, administered by Columbia University, is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It has been presented since 1917 for a distinguished book about the history of the United States. Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.  The Pulitzer Prize program has also recognized some historical work with its Biography prize, from 1917, and its General Non-Fiction prize, from 1952. Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner.  In its first 97 years to 2013, the History Pulitzer was awarded 95 times. Two prizes were given in 1989; none in 1919, 1984, and 1994.  Four people have won two each, Margaret Leech, Bernard Bailyn, Paul Horgan and Alan Taylor.  Entries from this point on include the finalists listed after the winner for each year. Five people have won the Pulitzer Prize for History twice.
