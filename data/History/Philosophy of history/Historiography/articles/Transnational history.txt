Transnational history is a field of history that looks at how developments within the history of one country have been shaped by developments outside of this country, e.g. how British history has been shaped by developments coming from France, Germany or the US. The idea of transnationalism can be traced back to 1991, when Ian Tyrrell pioneered this approach but it was in the field of American Studies, in the late 1990s, that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history.  As the concept is still relatively with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. However, Danish historian Nils Arne SÃ¸rensen emphasizes that an important feature of transnational history is to move on from taking the nation state as the "natural" frame for historical analysis. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the nationalist movement was on the rise in Europe.  Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the "connections and circulations" between societies in the modern age.  Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the Annales school.
