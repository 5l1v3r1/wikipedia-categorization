Amit Goyal is the Director of the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary RENEW (Research & Education in Energy, Environment & Water) Institute at SUNY-Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.  He is also Empire Innovation Professor at SUNY-Buffalo.  Previously he was a UT-Battelle Corporate Fellow, a Battelle Distinguished Inventor and an ORNL Distinguished Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee.   He was also the Chair of the UT-Battelle-ORNL Corporate Fellow Council.  Goyal is one of the leading scientists worldwide in the field of advanced electronic and energy materials including High Temperature Superconductors. He has over 85 issued patents.   He also has over 350 publications.  In 2009, an analysis of citations and papers published worldwide in the last decade in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, between 1999â€“2009, conducted by Thomson Reuters Essential Science Indicators (ESI), ranked him as the most cited author worldwide during those years.  He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Inventors. Goyal did his schooling at Mayo College, in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India.   He received the degree of Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) Honors degree in Metallurgical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 1986.  He completed his M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of Rochester in 1988. He completed his Ph.D. in Material Science and Engineering from the same institute in 1991.  He has an Executive MBA from the Krannert Business School at Purdue University,  an executive International MBA from Tilburg University, The Netherlands and Executive business training from the MIT Sloan School of Management. The University of Rochester, New York, awarded him a Distinguished Scholar Medal  in 2006 and the Indian Institute of Technology awarded him the Distinguished Alumnus Award  in 2009. Goyal joined SUNY-Buffalo as Director of the RENEW Institute and as Empire Innovation Professor in January 2015.  Previously, Goyal was at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1991 to December 2014.  He works with the development of clean energy technologies, and in the field of electronic devices such as superconductors and photovoltaics. His research has contributed to the development of single crystal like behaviour in long lengths of superconducting materials, and of wires that allow high-temperature superconductors to allow very high performance to be obtained in a cost-effective manner. He has also made significant contributions to the fields of texture and grain boundary network control and to other electronic materials such as photovoltaics. In 2011, Goyal received the inaugural E. O. Lawrence Award for Energy Science and Innovation.   The E. O. Lawrence Award is given by the United States Energy Secretary on behalf of the President of the United States, for meritorious contributions to the development, use or control of atomic energy, and is officially awarded by the United States Secretary of Energy.   It consists of a certificate,  a gold medal and a cash prize of $20,000. The award was officially awarded in a ceremony on May 21, 2012.  Goyal's award cites his "pioneering research and transformative contributions to the field of applied high temperature superconductivity, including fundamental materials science advances and technical innovations enabling large-scale applications of these novel materials".  Goyal was invited by the Energy Secretary to give a special lecture associated with this award at USDOE. The lecture was live streamed and has been archived on Science Cinema   and on YouTube.  In 2010, he received the 2010 R&D Magazine's Innovator of the Year Award.         The award recognizes career accomplishments in scientific research and technology development, spanning disciplines from medical technology to information technology. Other recipients include Elon Musk (2007),  Dean Kamen (2006)   and Google's Larry Page (2012).  The Innovator-Of-The-Year award is a special recognition for sustained innovative contributions. The R&D magazine also awards the R&D100 awards to the 100 most innovative products introduced each year in any field.  Goyal has received ten R&D 100 awards. The NRI today listed him in the top 10 list of "movers and shakers" in 2010.   He was also listed in top 50 Coolest Desis of 2010 by DesiClub.com.  He is the Founder, President & CEO of TapeSolar Inc, which develops solar cells. He is also the Founder, President & CEO of TexMat LLC, a Delaware-based intellectual property holding and consulting company. -    Elected to National Academy of Engineering (2018)     -    Presidential Level, DOE's E.
