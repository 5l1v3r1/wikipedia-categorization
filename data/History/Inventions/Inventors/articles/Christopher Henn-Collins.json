He was educated at <a href=\"/wiki/Shrewsbury\" title=\"Shrewsbury\">Shrewsbury</a>, and destined for a military career in his father's regiment, but pleaded to be allowed to pursue his boyhood ambition to be a telecommunications engineer. In 1934 he enlisted as a Gentleman Cadet at the <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy,_Woolwich\" title=\"Royal Military Academy, Woolwich\">Royal Military Academy</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Woolwich\" title=\"Woolwich\">Woolwich</a> for signals training and was commissioned in 1935.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Polish_Campaign\">Polish Campaign</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Henn-Collins&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Polish Campaign\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Main article <a href=\"/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Invasion of Poland (1939)\">Invasion of Poland (1939)</a></i>\n</p><p><sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\nAfter service in <a href=\"/wiki/Palestine_(region)\" title=\"Palestine (region)\">Palestine</a> he earned the dubious distinction of being possibly the first serving officer to come under enemy fire in the first few hours of the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second World War\">second World War</a>. In August 1939, when he was Brigade Signals Officer to the 1st <a href=\"/wiki/Brigade_of_Guards\" title=\"Brigade of Guards\">Brigade of Guards</a>, he had been ordered to lead a detachment of signallers and their equipment into <a href=\"/wiki/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a>, as part of a British Military Mission under the command of the battle-scarred veteran <a href=\"/wiki/Adrian_Carton_de_Wiart\" title=\"Adrian Carton de Wiart\">General Carton de Wiart</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_Cross\" title=\"Victoria Cross\">VC</a>, blinded in one eye and with an artificial hand. Their objective was to set up radio communications between Mission HQ in <a href=\"/wiki/Warsaw\" title=\"Warsaw\">Warsaw</a>, the UK and units of the Polish army. They were to travel in plain clothes, but with battle-dress in their kit, and six tons of equipment, through France to <a href=\"/wiki/Marseilles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marseilles\">Marseilles</a>, where <a href=\"/wiki/HMS_Shropshire_(73)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HMS Shropshire (73)\">HMS Shropshire</a> would take them to <a href=\"/wiki/Alexandria\" title=\"Alexandria\">Alexandria</a>.  There they were issued with passports and fictitious occupations, before trans-shipping to a ferry en route to <a href=\"/wiki/Turkey\" title=\"Turkey\">Turkey</a>, by which time Britain and France were at war with Germany. From there they travelled by rail through <a href=\"/wiki/Romania\" title=\"Romania\">Romania</a>, setting up radio communications along the way.\n</p><p>By the time they crossed the Polish frontier southeast of Warsaw, German armoured divisions were driving east towards the capital, and their reconnaissance planes were taking an interest in this strange convoy, which was now in a war zone. The detachment was ordered to change into uniform. In <a href=\"/wiki/Lvov\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lvov\">Lvov</a> they were under heavy fire from low-flying aircraft: they could not move forward, nor could they stay put, risking further attentions from the <a href=\"/wiki/Luftwaffe\" title=\"Luftwaffe\">Luftwaffe</a>. For several nights they shuttled to and fro a few miles west to east and back again, awaiting instructions, and it was not until 8 September when they rendezvoused with General de Wiart, who had moved his headquarters from Warsaw to <a href=\"/wiki/Tarnopol\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tarnopol\">Tarnopol</a>, that their mission was abandoned. They were ordered to destroy their equipment, and make their way home in twos and threes as best they could. Back in Alexandria Henn-Collins's instructions were to return to London where he was posted to <a href=\"/wiki/Staff_College,_Camberley\" title=\"Staff College, Camberley\">Staff College at Camberley</a>, and wrote a critical report on the lessons to be learned from this expedition.\n</p><p>Although the mission was aborted, the outcome would have been quite different if the <a href=\"/wiki/Russians\" title=\"Russians\">Russians</a> had not invaded. The Poles had plans to conduct a <a href=\"/wiki/Guerrilla_war\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Guerrilla war\">guerrilla war</a> in the east, and a British Signals unit behind the lines would have been of considerable use to <a href=\"/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II\" title=\"Allies of World War II\">the Allies</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Later_wartime_postings\">Later wartime postings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Henn-Collins&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Later wartime postings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For Henn-Collins various postings during the next three years included a period in the Directorate of Military Training, and promotion to <a href=\"/wiki/Major_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Major (United Kingdom)\">Major</a>.
