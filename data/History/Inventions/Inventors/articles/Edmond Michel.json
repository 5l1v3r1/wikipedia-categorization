He lived in <a href=\"/wiki/New_Orleans\" title=\"New Orleans\">New Orleans</a>.  His claim to fame was the invention of the handheld <a href=\"/wiki/Circular_saw\" title=\"Circular saw\">circular saw</a>.  Watching sugar farmers cut through thick cane stalks with <a href=\"/wiki/Machete\" title=\"Machete\">machetes</a>, he believed that there was a better way.\n</p><p>Michel mounted a mixer motor onto a standard machete, as well as a <a href=\"/wiki/Worm_gear\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Worm gear\">worm wheel</a> gearbox and a 2-inch circular blade.  This invention, while actually working fairly effectively (if slowly), required an external generator, making it quite impractical.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Michel-saw.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Michel-saw.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Michel-saw.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"81\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"81\" /></a>\n</p><p>In creating this device, Michel effectively invented the worm-drive motor.\n</p><p>Michel then tried again, using a piece of wood with a notch carved into it.  In the notch, he mounted the same mechanism as the mechanical reaper, but with a 6-inch blade.  This was the first electric circular saw.\n</p><p>After a New Orleans newspaper ran an article about Michel's invention, he was approached by Joseph W. Sullivan.  The two became business partners and moved to Chicago.  In 1924, they were granted a patent for the Michel Electric <a href=\"/wiki/Hand_saw\" title=\"Hand saw\">Hand Saw</a>.  Attracting immediate interest from contractors despite numerous mechanical problems, the two began production of the saw.  The name was changed to <a href=\"/wiki/Skil\" title=\"Skil\">Skil</a> in 1926, after Sullivan's wife commented on the skill necessary to use one.\n</p><p>Just before <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Depression\" title=\"Great Depression\">the Great Depression</a>, Michel withdrew from the company to work on new inventions.  After leaving the Skil company, Michel invested his share of the money inventing and developing <b>Larmloc</b>, the first keypad-based lock.  Sadly, this invention failed to pan out, and only one working prototype was ever made.\n</p><p>This inventor remains largely forgotten in American history, but is still remembered by his family.  His youngest daughter Lorretta Brown still lives in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Michel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Interview with Marguerite Brown (daughter of Edmond Michel) by her grandson, Nicholas Tausek\n</p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0VCW/is_19_25/ai_57294929/pg_2\">[1]</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.asktooltalk.com/articles/toolhistory/divide.php\">[2]</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1320\nCached time: 20180901214105\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.015 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 13/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:12996805-0!canonical and timestamp 20180901214105 and revision id 828736985\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Michel, Edmond","hidden":"","*":"Year_of_birth_missing"},{"sortkey":"Michel, Edmond","hidden":"","*":"Year_of_death_missing"},{"sortkey":"Michel, Edmond","*":"Inventors"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Chicago"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Circular saw"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Great Depression"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hand saw"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Machete"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New Orleans"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Skil"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Worm gear"}],"templates":[],"images":["Michel-saw.jpg"],"externallinks":["http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0VCW/is_19_25/ai_57294929/pg_2","http://www.asktooltalk.com/articles/toolhistory/divide.php"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Edmond_Michel","byteoffset":1894,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Edmond Michel","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Michel, Edmond"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5338897"}]}}
