His company Mershon Condensers was a successful manufacturer of <a href=\"/wiki/Electrolytic_capacitor\" title=\"Electrolytic capacitor\">electrolytic capacitors</a> for the expanding <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> market of the 1920s. He is known for the Mershon Auditorium (1957) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Mershon_Center\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mershon Center\">Mershon Center</a> at his alma mater <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio_State_University\" title=\"Ohio State University\">Ohio State University</a> that his estate made possible. In 1956 a biography and summary of his work was published by Ohio State University; the following article is a digest of that publication.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Life\">Life</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ralph_D._Mershon&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Life\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>His father Ralph Smith Mershon was a <a href=\"/wiki/Watchmaker\" title=\"Watchmaker\">watchmaker</a>, having apprenticed in Trenton, New Jersey and Philadelphia. He played <a href=\"/wiki/Violin\" title=\"Violin\">violin</a> and was an <a href=\"/wiki/Inventor\" title=\"Inventor\">inventor</a>, devising a compound regulator for timepieces, and a repeating pistol similar to the <a href=\"/wiki/Girandoni_Air_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Girandoni Air Rifle\">Girandoni Air Rifle</a>. In 1863 he purchased Henry Kruger jewelers in <a href=\"/wiki/Zanesville,_Ohio\" title=\"Zanesville, Ohio\">Zanesville, Ohio</a>. R.S. Mershon married Mary Elizabeth Jones on November 12, 1863. Ralph Davenport Mershon was born on July 14, 1868. His sister Hope Lord Mershon was born in 1875 and lived to 1953, but their other siblings perished in infancy. The clock installed by Ralph Smith Mershon in the tower of <a href=\"/wiki/Muskingum_County_Courthouse\" title=\"Muskingum County Courthouse\">Muskingum County Courthouse</a> was still functioning in 1956.\n</p><p>Unsatisfied by classes at <a href=\"/wiki/Zanesville_High_School\" title=\"Zanesville High School\">Zanesville High School</a> in 1884, R.D. Mershon joined a crew <a href=\"/wiki/Surveying\" title=\"Surveying\">surveying</a> for a railroad. Working under Mr. Bateman, a surveyor, he gained hands-on experience with a transit and level. Bateman would not answer Mershon's questioning, referring him instead to the <i>Handbook of Civil Engineering</i> by  <a href=\"/wiki/John_Trautwine\" title=\"John Trautwine\">John Trautwine</a>. From that point he learned to use reference works. Given that young Merson had an interest in mechanics, a coworker suggested he study at Ohio State. Returning to Zanesville, Mershon turned to <a href=\"/wiki/Superintendent_of_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Superintendent of schools\">superintendent of schools</a> William D. Lash for examination and certification. Mershon was admitted to Ohio State in the fall of 1886. His skills being evident, in his senior year he served as student assistant. In 1890 he graduated with a degree in <a href=\"/wiki/Mechanical_engineering\" title=\"Mechanical engineering\">mechanical engineering</a>. After graduation he was an assistant instructor in <a href=\"/wiki/Electrical_engineering\" title=\"Electrical engineering\">electrical engineering</a>. Working with <a href=\"/wiki/Alternating_current\" title=\"Alternating current\">alternating current</a> machinery, Mershon developed a means of <a href=\"/wiki/Waveform\" title=\"Waveform\">waveform</a> measurement. It is described as an instantaneous potentiometer method, employing  a telephone receiver to indicate balance. This work attracted the attention of the <a href=\"/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Company\" title=\"Westinghouse Electric Company\">Westinghouse Electric Company</a>.\n</p><p>In 1891 he joined the Company in <a href=\"/wiki/East_Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania\" title=\"East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\">East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> where he designed <a href=\"/wiki/Transformer\" title=\"Transformer\">transformers</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/Electrical_power_distribution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Electrical power distribution\">electrical power distribution</a> systems. In 1896 he and <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_F._Scott_(engineer)\" title=\"Charles F. Scott (engineer)\">Charles F. Scott</a> were sent to <a href=\"/wiki/Telluride,_Colorado\" title=\"Telluride, Colorado\">Telluride, Colorado</a> to carry out experiments on high-voltage transmissions. Their experiments went up to 133,000 <a href=\"/wiki/Volt\" title=\"Volt\">volts</a>; they observed <a href=\"/wiki/Corona_discharge\" title=\"Corona discharge\">corona discharge</a> along the <a href=\"/wiki/Transmission_line\" title=\"Transmission line\">transmission lines</a>. The losses were ameliorated with thicker wires and greater separation. To gain experience in the deployment of a <a href=\"/wiki/Power_grid\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power grid\">power grid</a>, Mershom took a <a href=\"/wiki/Leave_of_absence\" title=\"Leave of absence\">leave of absence</a> from Westinghouse to work with Colorado Electric Power in 1897/8. He returned to Westinghouse, serving for a short time in the <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York</a> office.\n</p><p>In 1900 Ralph Mershon became a <a href=\"/wiki/Consultant\" title=\"Consultant\">consultant</a> in electrical power transmission. He designed and supervised the construction of power systems in various states, <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Quebec\" title=\"Quebec\">Quebec</a>. From 1905 he consulted with South African firms taking power from <a href=\"/wiki/Victoria_Falls\" title=\"Victoria Falls\">Victoria Falls</a>, and travelled there. From 1912 he consulted on a project at <a href=\"/wiki/Inawashiro_lake\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Inawashiro lake\">Inawashiro lake</a> in Japan. He helped place visiting Japanese engineers with American manufacturers and power companies so that the necessary expertise could be acquired. Mershon became a Fellow of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science\" title=\"American Association for the Advancement of Science\">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> on January 2, 1906.\n</p><p>Mershon was a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Engineering_Societies%27_Building_and_Engineers%27_Club\" title=\"Engineering Societies&#39; Building and Engineers&#39; Club\">Engineer's Club</a> in New York City. Their building was erected in 1907. In 1910 he was involved in the formation of an \"Inventors' Guild\" that included <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Edison\" title=\"Thomas Edison\">Thomas Edison</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Cooper_Hewitt\" title=\"Peter Cooper Hewitt\">Peter Cooper Hewitt</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Elmer_Sperry\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elmer Sperry\">Elmer Sperry</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mihajlo_Pupin\" title=\"Mihajlo Pupin\">Mihajlo Pupin</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Baekeland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Baekeland\">Baekeland</a>, and others. These men were concerned with <a href=\"/wiki/Patent\" title=\"Patent\">patent law</a>, sometimes critically. Mershon was made a Life Member of the Engineers Club on January 26, 1950.\n</p><p>Mershon was president of <a href=\"/wiki/AIEE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIEE\">AIEE</a> in 1912. He is quoted making the wry observation that such posts went to men whose \"chief claim to fame arise from activities in fields other than that of electrical engineering as defined by the Institute's constitution.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mershon had many <a href=\"/wiki/Patent\" title=\"Patent\">patents</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/Invention\" title=\"Invention\">inventions</a> he devised. One of the most celebrated was a compensating <a href=\"/wiki/Voltmeter\" title=\"Voltmeter\">voltmeter</a> that was awarded the <a href=\"/wiki/John_Scott_Medal\" title=\"John Scott Medal\">John Scott Medal</a> by Philadelphia. In 1916 Mershon advocated for the \"Ohio Plan\" of military preparedness on campuses that is embodied in the <a href=\"/wiki/ROTC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ROTC\">ROTC</a>. In 1918 <a href=\"/wiki/Tufts_College\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tufts College\">Tufts College</a> awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science.\n</p><p>Mershon became a master of the art of building <a href=\"/wiki/Capacitor\" title=\"Capacitor\">capacitors</a>, an important element not only of power systems but also in the electronics of radio.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> From 1911 to 1942 he was granted 55 patents. His Mershon Condensers were featured in the popular <a href=\"/wiki/Crosley_Radio_Corporation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crosley Radio Corporation\">Crosley brand radios</a>, and suppressed the 60 cps hum heard without them. In 1930 the Mershon company was bought by <a href=\"/wiki/Magnavox\" title=\"Magnavox\">Magnavox</a>, and the brand was discontinued. However, the patent-holder continued to defend his interest with <a href=\"/wiki/Lawsuit\" title=\"Lawsuit\">lawsuits</a>: Merson v. Robinson (30 June 1941) and Mershon v. Sprague (2 April 1936).\n</p><p>Ralph Mershon never married. He died February 14, 1952, in <a href=\"/wiki/Coconut_Grove,_Florida\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coconut Grove, Florida\">Coconut Grove, Florida</a>. His Papers are preserved by Ohio State University Archives. In 1956 <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio_State_University_Press\" title=\"Ohio State University Press\">Ohio State University Press</a> published a two-volume biography by Edith D. Cockins, who was <a href=\"/wiki/Registrar_(education)\" title=\"Registrar (education)\">registrar</a> of the University from 1895 to 1944. From the account, she came to know him first when the <a href=\"/wiki/Alumni_association\" title=\"Alumni association\">alumni association</a> was invigorated by his Presidency. The first volume recounts Mershon's life and engineering projects, the second is an edited and annotated collection of his writings. His suggestions for the improvement of the patent system are found on pages 142 and 143 of volume one.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ralph_D._Mershon&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">John D.
