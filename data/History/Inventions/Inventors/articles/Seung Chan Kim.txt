Seung Chan Kim  (Hangul: 김승찬; born April 15, 1991) is a South Korean medical scientist and inventor. His main area of research is biomagnetism domestic core technology[nonsensical translation]. He received the 2009 Talent Award of Korea along with Yuna Kim.  He serves as World Talent Exchange and Sharing Organization president.  Kim identified the cancer cell growth inhibition mechanism of magnetic-based cell division difference. Dispersed by the static magnetic field, the core protein GCP3 in spindle formation, during cell division cycle, was identified for the first time in the world. This contributed to establish the scientific basis on the availability to the magnetic field for future anti-cancer therapy. From Harvard MGH research exchanges, the treatment of nerve cell to nerve cell turning the magnetic field grow into the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field that can be used in a certain direction based on research data.  These properties provide a basis for cell regeneration. In particular, in the case of spinal cord and nerve disorders due to a mismatch between synaptic connections, it is crucial. It developed a first time patented technology uncovering a new era in medical science.  Currently he holds 163 intellectual patents. Various talent sharing donations and volunteering was made through creativity, science and decisive contribution. This applies as well as decisive contribution for strengthening humanity.   Based on the Korea Talent Association (대한민국인재연합회), he established the World TESO (World Talent Exchange and Sharing Organization) in the Philippines, Canada, and Australia. He also has a major contribution to enhancing the international status of contributions to the scientific talent exchange, with the Republic of Korea.
