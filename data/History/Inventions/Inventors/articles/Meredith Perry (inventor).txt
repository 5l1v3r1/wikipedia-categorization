Meredith Perry (1991−)  is an American entrepreneur and the founder of uBeam.   Perry attended the University of Pennsylvania (2007–2011) and graduated with a degree in Paleobiology, Geology, Astrobiology. She presented the uBeam at the universities "PennVention", an invention competition, and the uBeam won.  Later, she presented her design at the All Things Digital conference in 2011.  Perry was a student ambassador at NASA Ames Research Center  where she led a zero gravity experiment, worked on technology to discover life on Mars, and researched astrobiology and medicine.  The uBeam device emits a high frequency sounds (inaudible to human ears) and transmits power directly to receivers, thus enabling users to walk around the room, laptop in hand without needing to be physically stationed to a charging location (like WIFI for charging).    The effectiveness and safety of the technology have been questioned.  uBeam has received over $26 million  in investments from Mark Cuban, Marissa Mayer, Andreessen Horowitz, Shawn Fanning,   Zappos’s CEO Tony Hsieh, Peter Thiel's Founder's Fund, among others.
