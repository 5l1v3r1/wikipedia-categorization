Though this patent does not have an extensive past, it came up in 2008 with regards to the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Crower_six_stroke&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Crower six stroke (page does not exist)\">Crower six stroke</a> engine.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Personal_life\">Personal life</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Leonard_Dyer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Personal life\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Mr. Dyer was a member of somewhat high society, with a net worth of at least $500,000 in 1922. He owned the Yacht \"Jack 'O Lantern,\" which was piloted to several victories by Abbot H. Brush.\n</p><p>Despite his high ties, there was trouble at home. In late 1922, a petition for divorce was filed by his wife, Josephine Dryer in Greenwich, Connecticut, citing intolerable cruelty, and infidelity with a young woman from Greenwich.\n</p><p>He was one of 4 brothers, George, Frank and Richard all of whom had US Navy backgrounds, one was appointed by President T Roosevelt as first governor of Guam.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
