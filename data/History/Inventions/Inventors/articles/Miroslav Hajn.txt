Miroslav Hajn (21 September 1894 in Žamberk, Austria-Hungary – 6 September 1963 in Prague, Czechoslovakia) was a chief designer at ČKD-Praga, one of the largest engineering companies in the former Czechoslovakia and today's Czech Republic.  Hajn was first a founder and chief designer at Avia, along with Pavel Beneš, in 1919.  The two began repairing planes in a workshop within the complex of an old sugar factory in Prague.   One year later, they designed their first two-seater plane, the Avia BH-1.  From 1923 to 1925, the two developed the Avia BH-7, BH-9, and BH-11 monoplanes, launching the era of biplane fighters.  The BH-11 won the Coppa d' Italia prize.  Three years later, their Avia BH-21 fighter was considered one of the world's best planes.  In 1930, Hajn and Beneš came to ČKD-Praga.  The first aircraft they designed was the Praga E-39 in 1931.
