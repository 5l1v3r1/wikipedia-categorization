English inventions and discoveries are objects, processes or techniques invented, innovated or discovered, partially or entirely, in England by a person from England (that is, someone born in England – including to non-English parents – or born abroad with at least one English parent and who had the majority of their education or career in England). Often, things discovered for the first time are also called inventions and in many cases, there is no clear line between the two. The following is a list of inventions, innovations or discoveries known or generally recognised to be English. 1835 – Der Adler. First steam locomotive in Germany.
