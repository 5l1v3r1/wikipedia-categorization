The timeline of historic inventions is a chronological list of particularly important or significant technological inventions and the people who created the inventions. Note: Dates for inventions are often controversial. Inventions are often invented by several inventors around the same time, or may be invented in an impractical form many years before another inventor improves the invention into a more practical form. Where there is ambiguity, the date of the first known working version of the invention is used here. The dates listed in this section refer to the earliest evidence of an invention found and dated by archaeologists (or in a few cases, suggested by indirect evidence). Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported, and seen. Older examples of any given technology are found often. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place. A few non-invention dates are included in italics, for context. Note the shift from Ma and ka to BC and AD â€“ 8000 BC is approximately the same as 10 ka.
