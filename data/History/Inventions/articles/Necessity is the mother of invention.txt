"Necessity is the mother of invention" is an English-language proverb. It means, roughly, that the primary driving force for most new inventions is a need.      "When the need for something becomes imperative, you are forced to find ways of getting or achieving it."  The author of this proverb is unknown. This phrase was familiar in England, but in Latin, not in English. In 1519, the headmaster of Winchester and Eton, William Horman, used the Latin phrase Mater artium necessitas in his book Vulgaria. In 1545 Roger Ascham used a close English version, Necessitie, the inuentour of all goodnesse, in his book Toxophilus. In 1608, George Chapman, in his two-part play The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron, used a very similar phrase: The great Mother, Of all productions (graue Necessity). But, the earliest actual usage of the proverb Necessity is the mother of invention is sometimes ascribed to Richard Franck, who used it in his book Northern Memoirs, calculated for the meridian of Scotland (1658).  Plato in book 2 of The Republic wrote "Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention." Aramis to Fouquet in Ten Years After, written by Alexander Dumas (1845-1850)  "Bah! necessity is the mother of invention, and when you think all is lost, something will be discovered which will retrieve everything." In an address to the Mathematical Association of England on the importance of education in 1917, Alfred North Whitehead argued that "the basis of invention is science, and science is almost wholly the outgrowth of pleasurable intellectual curiosity." and in contrast to the old proverb "Necessity is the mother of futile dodges" is much nearer to the truth.
