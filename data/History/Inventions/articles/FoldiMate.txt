FoldiMate is a California-based company developing a robotic laundry folding machine. Foldimate was founded by Gal Rozov, an Israeli software engineer who decided that folding laundry was a tedious chore that could be done effectively by a robot.  In 2010, Rozov quit his job as a software developer and product manager and spent two years developing his laundry-folding device. In 2012, he moved to the United States to work with a robotic team in Silicon Valley. By 2013, he had a patented technology. In 2016, after an initial round of investment, he produced the first  prototype.  The  prototype presented at CES 2017 generated much interest.  The company exhibited an updated prototype of Foldimate at CES 2018.  In January 2018, BSH Hausger√§te expressed an interest in partnering with Foldimate.  The FoldiMate is slightly larger than a standard washing machine. According to the developers it can fold a full wash in less than 4 minutes.  The user clips the piece of clothing on two hooks and the item is pulled into the machine. Then a series of rollers and arms moves in all directions to straighten and fold it.  The machine can fold shirts, tops, trousers and dresses, but not small pieces of clothing like  underwear or large items like  sheets.   The folded items are returned in a stack through a window at the bottom of the machine.  Previous versions included anti-wrinkling technology and fragrance features, but the product was redesigned and simplified with the aim of readying it for the market by the end of 2019.
