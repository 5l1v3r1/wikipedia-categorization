A priority certificate is a document attesting that the entities named in such a certificate are the first to discover a phenomenon from nature, the first proponent of a theory, abstract idea, solution to a problem, proof of a theorem etc. A person who makes a new and useful discovery is entitled to receive such a priority certificate for that specific discovery.   Private or public companies and organizations, such as universities, R&D institutions, trade shows and exhibitions are known to grant priority certificates to confer formal recognition upon the claimant(s).
