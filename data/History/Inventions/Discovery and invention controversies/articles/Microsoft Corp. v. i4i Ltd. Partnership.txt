Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.S. 91 (2011), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that the patent-in-reexamination is still valid without any exceptions under 35 USC 282, even if the suggested material is not considered in the process of patent application. To reverse the presumption of validity, the plaintiff should show clear and convincing evidence.  The case came about from a copyright dispute between i4i Ltd. Partnership and Microsoft: i4i charged that Microsoft had infringed on i4i's copyright in a version of Microsoft Word; Microsoft argued that its invalidity defense was subject an overly-strict standard and burden of proof, which was rejected by the Court in its widest possible sense.
