He taught for many years in the History Department and Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of Toronto (1960-1999), and is currently a senior research scholar at Yale University. A 1955 graduate of Harvard University, Goffart received his doctorate there in 1961. He is the recipient of numerous distinguished awards and fellowships and was awarded the Haskins Medal of the Medieval Academy of America in 1991 for his book "The Narrators of Barbarian History."
