Lars Mehrling Brownworth (born c. 1975) is an author and former United States history and political science teacher at The Stony Brook School in Stony Brook on Long Island, New York, who created the top 50 podcast, 12 Byzantine Rulers: The History of the Byzantine Empire. This podcast was created on a whim by Lars and his brother, Anders Brownworth. Often mistaken for a college professor, Lars was, in fact, a high school history instructor at the time the podcast was produced. On August 15, 2007, Brownworth announced that he had resigned from teaching to work on a book with Crown Publishing titled Lost to the West: The Forgotten Byzantine Empire that Rescued Western Civilization, which was published on September 15, 2009. On January 3, 2014, Brownworth released his second book, The Normans: From Raiders to Kings. His third book, titled The Sea Wolves: A History of the Vikings,  was published in December 2014. Both the Normans and the Sea Wolves reached the New York Times Best Seller Lists.  He maintains a blog called Finding History where he responds to reader and listener submitted questions. He has been interviewed by The New York Times and NPR's "Here and Now", has written for The Wall Street Journal and resides in Gaithersburg, Maryland, with his wife, the former Catherine Tipmore.  He currently serves as the chair of the history department at Washington Christian Academy in Olney, Maryland. Brownworth is often seen as a pioneer of history podcasting, and his 12 Byzantine Rulers became a direct impetus for The History of Rome podcast.
