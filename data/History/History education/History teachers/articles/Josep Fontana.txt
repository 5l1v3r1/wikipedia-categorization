Josep Fontana i Lázaro (20 November 1931 – 28 August 2018) was a Spanish historian from Catalonia.   Born in Barcelona, he received his master's degree in philosophy and letters (section history) at the University of Barcelona in 1956 and his doctorate in history by the same university in 1970. He was a student of Jaume Vicens i Vives and Ferran Soldevila. Their main currents of investigation are economic history, 19th century Spanish history and the history of property. He has been influenced in his thought by E.P. Thompson, Pierre Vilar, Gramsci and Walter Benjamin.  The Jaume Vicens i Vives University Institute of History, the interdisciplinary Ph.D. history institute in the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona was originally directed and founded by Dr. Fontana, in which he continues to teach classes of Introduction to History and 20th-century Spanish history. He has taught economic, the interplay between history, law and economics and contemporary history at the University of Barcelona, the University of Valencia and at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.  Dr. Fontana has been an active contributor to scholarly history publications since 1970, among them, l'Avenç (1976). The Introduction to History course taught during the first cycle of the humanities track of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra is based on Fontana's book Introduction to the Study of History.
