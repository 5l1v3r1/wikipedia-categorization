  Michael George MacDonald Kidson (24 August 1929 – 20 June 2015) was a British schoolmaster who taught history at Eton College. Among Kidson's pupils was former Prime Minister David Cameron. His life is portrayed in the bestselling book The Enigma of Kidson, by Jamie Blackett published by Quiller, ISBN 9781846892509. Kidson was born in Belgravia, London.  His parents separated when he was an infant and his father died a few years later.  He was brought up in Shropshire by his grandfather until the age of seven.  Following his grandfather's death he was placed into the care of the Royal Wolverhampton School, which at that time was a charitable institution for children who had lost one or both parents.   Kidson served in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry as a national service officer, then went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read economics and history. In 1956 he joined Shell as a graduate trainee but soon moved into teaching, initially at Papplewick, a private school, and then at Eton. He  retired in 1994.    He was notable for his competence and for his exceptional ability to engage the minds of his students.    Commenting on Kidson, David Cameron said: "If he caught you napping, he’d throw this block of wood at your head .... Health and safety means you can’t do this anymore."
