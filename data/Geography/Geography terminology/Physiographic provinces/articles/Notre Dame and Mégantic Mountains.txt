The Notre Dame and Mégantic Mountains in Canada are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian division, and also contain the Chic-Choc Mountains.  The Notre Dame Mountains rise to a level of approximately 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and extend southwest to northeast, south of the Saint Lawrence River. The abundant mineral resources in this region have resulted in a unique mining landscape.  The Notre Dame Mountains extend 500 miles (800 km) from the Green Mountains of Vermont into the Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec.
