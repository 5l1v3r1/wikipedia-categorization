A till plain is an extensive flat plain of glacial till that forms when a sheet of ice becomes detached from the main body of a glacier and melts in place, depositing the sediments it carried. Ground moraines are formed when the till melts out of the glacier in irregular heaps, forming rolling hills. Till plains created by the Wisconsin glaciation cover much of northern Ohio (see Glacial till plains (Ohio)).
