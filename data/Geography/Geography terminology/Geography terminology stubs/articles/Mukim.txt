A mukim is a type of administrative division used in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The word mukim is loanword in English.  However, it was also originally a loanword in Malay from the Arabic word: مقيم (means resident). The closest English translation for mukim is county, ward or parish.    In Brunei, a mukim is the immediate subdivision of a district (Malay: daerah). The equivalent English word for 'mukim' is 'subdistrict'.There are 38 mukims in Brunei.  Each mukim is an administrative area made up of several kampung (Malay for "village").  A mukim is headed by a penghulu, which is an elected office.  The number of mukims in each of the districts in Brunei is as follows: The smallest mukim by area is Mukim Saba in the Brunei-Muara District.  The largest mukim by area is Mukim Sukang in the Belait District.  The last change in the mukim boundaries was in the late 1990s when Mukim Kumbang Pasang was merged into Mukim Kianggeh and Mukim Berakas was divided into Mukim Berakas A and Mukim Berakas B. The number of mukims remained at 38. In Indonesia, mukim means 'a place to stay' or 'the one who stay', Permukiman generally use to refer 'a settlement'.  The term mukim used exclusively as a subdivision of a subdistrict in Aceh. A mukim contains some villages. In Malaysia, a mukim can either be a subdivision of a daerah (district) or a subdivision of sub-district, (Section 11(c) of the National Land Code 1965). In Singapore, a mukim is a survey district in a rural area. There are 34 mukim survey districts in Singapore, as well as 30 Town Subdivision survey districts.
