An ice shove, ice surge, ice heave, ivu,   or shoreline ice pileup is a surge of ice from an ocean or large lake onto the shore.  Ice shoves are caused by ocean currents, strong winds, or temperature differences pushing ice onto the shore,   creating piles up to 12 metres (40 feet) high. Some have described them as 'ice tsunamis',   but the phenomenon works like an iceberg.  Witnesses have described the shove's sound as being like that of a train or thunder.     Ice shoves can damage buildings and plants that are near to the body of water.      Arctic communities can be affected by ice shoves.
