Vinex ("Vierde Nota Ruimtelijke Ordening Extra", translates as Fourth Memorandum Spatial Planning Extra), is a policy briefing note of the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Ministry of VROM) released in 1988.  Large outer city areas were pointed out by the policy for massive new housing development. To accommodate the increasing population in the Netherlands the Ministry of VROM determined a number of main points in the Vinex-document for the construction of new housing districts starting in 1993. New districts had to be placed near existing town centers and had to contribute to the following aims: The Vinex-locations also had to diminish the unfair pricing of housing. This means that certain households live in housing that is too affordable when compared to their income, as a result of which these houses no longer become available to households with a lower income. So they tried to solve the shortage of affordable housing by luring wealthier households to the more expensive Vinex-locations. Nevertheless, the Vinex-locations had a determined share of affordable rentable houses.
