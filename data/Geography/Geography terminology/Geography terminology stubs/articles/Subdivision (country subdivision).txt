The term subdivision refers to a partition of an Indian state below the level of a district but above the level of a subdistrict ('taluk', 'tehsil', 'community development block', 'mandal', or 'circle' depending on the state). In other words, a district may have multiple subdivisions, and one of those subdivisions may contain multiple subdistricts and municipalities. In West Bengal, for example, Murshidabad district contains five subdivisions ('mahakumas'), one of which (Jangipur subdivision) contains seven community development blocks.
