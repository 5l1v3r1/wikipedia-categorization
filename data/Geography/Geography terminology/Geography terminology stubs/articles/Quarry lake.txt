A quarry lake is a lake that is formed after a quarry has been dug through a mining operation.  During the mining process, water must be emptied. But after the mining operation has been abandoned, groundwater is allowed to seep in, and rainwater collects in the quarry. The depth of a quarry lake is dependent upon rainfall in the region.
