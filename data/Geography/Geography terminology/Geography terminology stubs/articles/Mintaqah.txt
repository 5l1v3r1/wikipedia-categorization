Minṭaqah (Arabic: منطقة‎ [ˈmintˤaqa]; plural مناطق manāṭiq [maˈnaːtˤiq]) is a first-level administrative division in Saudi Arabia and Chad and for a second-level administrative division in several other Arab countries. It is often translated as region or district, but the literal meaning is "region" or "area".
