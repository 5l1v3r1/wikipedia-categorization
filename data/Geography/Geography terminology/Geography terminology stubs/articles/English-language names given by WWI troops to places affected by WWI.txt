This is a list of English-language names given by World War I troops to places affected by World War I. Indeed, because there were many tensions during World War 1, some places had to be renamed. Since there was a very anti-German sentiment during World War 1, the military and government would rename towns, like Kitchener, Ontario in Canada, which was named Berlin until WWI. Another reason why English-language names were given by troops to places affected by WW1 is that English-speaking troops often fought in unknown territory  and had difficulty pronouncing foreign placenames. Thus, with the advent of strategising and the creation of trench maps, the English-speaking troops (mostly belonging to the British Empire, and Americans starting in 1917) had to find a way to locate places and themselves.
