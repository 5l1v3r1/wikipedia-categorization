Baladiyah (Arabic: بلدية‎) is a type of Arabic administrative division that can be translated as "district", "sub-district"  or "municipality".  The plural is baladiyat (Arabic: بلديات‎). Grammatically, it is the feminine of بلدي  "rural, country-, folk-". The Arabic term amanah (أمانة) is also used for "municipality".  In Turkish, the word belediye (definite accusative belediyesi), which is a loan from Arabic, means "municipality" or "city council".
