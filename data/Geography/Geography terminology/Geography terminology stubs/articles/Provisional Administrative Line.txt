A Provisional Administrative Line is a de facto border between two political entities. Examples include part of the border between Ethiopia and Somalia, and the partition between Serbia and the disputed territory of Kosovo[a] The point at issue with Somalia was the Ogaden region, an area that Mogadishu claimed as part of the historical Somali nation that had been seized by the Ethiopians during the colonial partition of the Horn of Africa. In fact, Ethiopia's only undefined boundary was the border it shared with the former Italian Somaliland. On maps drawn after 1950, this boundary is termed "Administrative Line"
