EMEA (EMEIA if India is included) is a shorthand designation meaning Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It is used by institutions and governments, as well as in marketing and business. It is particularly common among North American companies. The region is generally accepted to include all European nations, all African nations, and extends east to Iran, including Russia. Typically this does not include independent overseas territories of mainland countries in the region, such as French Guiana.
