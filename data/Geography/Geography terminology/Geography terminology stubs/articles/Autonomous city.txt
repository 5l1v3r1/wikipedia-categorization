Autonomous city is a type of autonomous administrative division. The 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution granted Buenos Aires city, formerly a federal district (Capital Federal, English: "Federal Capital") of Argentina, the status of autonomous, and changed its formal name to Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (Spanish: Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires).  Another large city that is currently pressing for autonomy is Rosario, in Santa Fe Province. Rosario has nearly 1 million inhabitants (about 1.3 million counting its suburbs and nearby towns), and is usually disfavoured in the distribution of funds and resources, which disproportionately assigns more of its share to the much less populated provincial capital, Santa Fe. Some legislators have proposed that autonomy could be granted to Rosario by passing a law in the ordinary fashion, while others claim an amendment of the provincial constitution is needed. In Spain there are two autonomous cities called Ceuta and Melilla. Two enclaves located on the north coast of Morocco, separated from the Iberian peninsula by the Strait of Gibraltar.
