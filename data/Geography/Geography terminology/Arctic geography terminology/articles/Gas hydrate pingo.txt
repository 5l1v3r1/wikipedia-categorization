A gas hydrate pingo (GHP) is a submarine dome structure formed by the accumulation gas hydrates under the seafloor. Gas hydrate pingos resemble the pingo landforms found on land in periglacial regions.  Gas hydrate pingo may accumulate non-hydrate gas under pressure leading to explosions that forms craters. Crater depressions of this type have been found on the seafloor of Barents Sea. The trigger for the explosions may be drop in pressure as result of lowering of the sea level.  A study in the Norwegian Sea found that gas hydrate pingoes were covered by bacterial mats and that Polychaete tubeworms that are associated with methane.
