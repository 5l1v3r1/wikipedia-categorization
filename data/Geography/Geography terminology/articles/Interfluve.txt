An interfluve is a narrow, elongated and plateau-like or ridge-like landform between two valleys.   Whittow, more generally, defines an interfluve as an area of higher ground between two rivers in the same drainage system.  These landforms are created by earth flow ("solifluction"). They can also be former river terraces that are subsequently bisected by fluvial erosion. In cases where there is a deposit of younger sedimentary beds (loess, colluvium) the interfluves have a rounder and less rugged appearance. A consequence of interfluve formation is the so-called "interfluvial landscape."
