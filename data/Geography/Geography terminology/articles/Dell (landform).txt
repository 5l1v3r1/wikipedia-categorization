In physical geography, a dell is a small secluded hollow, (implying also) a grassy, park-like, usually partially-wooded valley.   The word "dell" comes from the Old English word dell, which is related to the Old English word d√¶l, modern 'dale'.   Dells in literature are often portrayed as pleasant safe havens.
