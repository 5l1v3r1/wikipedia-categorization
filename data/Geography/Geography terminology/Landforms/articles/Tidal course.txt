A tidal course is any elongated indentation or valley in a wetland originated by tidal processes, or having another origin, along which water flows pumped by tidal influence. A tidal course is a general denomination that includes a series of indentations within a wide spectrum of sizes (width, length and depth) and with at least two levels of inundation. Examples of tidal courses are tidal rills, tidal grooves, tidal gullies, tidal creeks and tidal channels. The first three are small features that normally do not contain water even during neap low tide, whereas  creeks and channels have water permanently.
