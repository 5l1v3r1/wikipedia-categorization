A carr is a type of waterlogged wooded terrain that, typically, represents a succession stage between the original reedy swamp and the likely eventual formation of forest in a sub-maritime climate.  The name derives from the Old Norse kjarr, meaning a swamp. The carr is one stage in a hydrosere: the progression of vegetation beginning from a terrain submerged by fresh water along a river or lake margin. In sub-maritime regions, it begins with reed-swamp. As the reeds decay, the soil surface eventually rises above the water, creating fens that allow vegetation such as sedge to grow. As this progression continues, riparian trees and bushes appear and a carr landscape is createdâ€“in effect a wooded fen in a waterlogged terrain. At this stage, overall, unlike overwhelming acidity of decaying reeds, the pH is not too acidic and the soil is not too deficient in minerals, making habitat for endemic and other wildlife. Characteristic trees include alder, willow and sallow.
