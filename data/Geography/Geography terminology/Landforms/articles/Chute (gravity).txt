A chute is a vertical or inclined plane, channel, or passage through which objects are moved by means of gravity. A chute, also known as a race, flume, cat, or river canyon, is a steep-sided passage through which water flows rapidly.

These are no longer in common use. Man-made chutes may also be a feature of spillways on some dams.  Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence chutes.
