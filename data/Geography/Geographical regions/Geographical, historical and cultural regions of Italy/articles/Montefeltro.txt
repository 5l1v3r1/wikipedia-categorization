Montefeltro is a historical-geographic region in the Marche, which was historically part of Romagna. It gave its name to the Montefeltro family, which ruled in the area during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Montefeltro covers mostly the mountain part of the Province of Pesaro and Urbino (Marche) and the south-western area of the Province of Rimini (Emilia-Romagna). It comprises also two municipalities of the Province of Arezzo, Tuscany, and the Republic of San Marino. The most important town of the region is Novafeltria. Today it is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro, formerly until 1978 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montefeltro.
