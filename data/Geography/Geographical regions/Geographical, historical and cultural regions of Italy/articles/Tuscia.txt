Tuscia is a historical region of Italy that comprised the territories under Etruscan influence and the name adopted for Etruria after the Roman conquest. While it later came to coincide with todayâ€™s province of Viterbo, it was originally much larger, including the whole region of Tuscany, a great part of Umbria and the northern parts of Lazio.
