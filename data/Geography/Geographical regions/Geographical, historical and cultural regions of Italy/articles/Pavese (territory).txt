The Pavese (Western Lombard: Paves) is a geographical and historical area in the Pianura Padana (Po Rivers's valley) of northern Italy, located in south-western Lombardy. It constitutes one of the 3 territories in which is divided the Province of Pavia.  The territory is located in the northwestern area of the province and borders with the provinces of Milan, Lodi and Piacenza (in Emilia-Romagna). It is crossed at its southern borders by the river Po and in the east by Ticino, which separates it from the Lomellina and the Oltrep√≤ Pavese. The territory is flat, except from some hills, and is crossed by the rivers Olona, Southern Lambro, Naviglio Pavese, Naviglio di Bereguardo and several acequias. The territory is divided traditionally in the city of Pavia and the areas of Campagna Soprana (i.e. "Upper Rural Area") and Campagna Sottana (i.e. "Lower Rural Area").
