 Abruzzi e Molise (known as Abruzzi when part of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies) was formerly one of the regions of Italy encompassing a total of 16,600 km2 (6,400 sq mi) and including Abruzzo, Molise and Circondario di Cittaducale (presently a part of Lazio). From the time of the Kingdom of Naples, this region was considered a single entity with the regional capital at L'Aquila. At this time, the region was further divided into four provinces: Abruzzo Ultra I, Abruzzo Ultra II, Abruzzo Citra, and Molise. In 1852, the Papal States annexed Ancarano, then further changes occurred during the formation of the Kingdom of Italy including the annexation of Venafro and adjustments of the border with Campania. In 1927 an additional adjustment was made when the Cittaducale was assigned to Rieti. In 1963, the province of Campobasso was split from the region to form Molise, with the remaining four provinces, L'Aquila, Teramo, Pescara and Chieti, comprising the present day Abruzzo.
