The Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain Province is a coastal plain floristic province within the North American Atlantic Region, a floristic region within the Holarctic Kingdom. It lies to the east and south of the Appalachian Province, from southern Nova Scotia to northeastern Mexico. The narrow coastal strip in New England widens in New Jersey to a broad plain through the Delmarva Peninsula, Virginia, the Carolinas, southern Georgia, and much of Florida. Along the Mississippi Embayment, the province stretches up to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in Cairo, Illinois.  The province can be further subdivided into the Atlantic coastal plain and Gulf coastal plain.  Although no floristic treatment has been attempted on the province, it was designated the 36th biodiversity hotspot in 2016 due to having more than 1,500 endemic plant species combined with 70% habitat loss.
