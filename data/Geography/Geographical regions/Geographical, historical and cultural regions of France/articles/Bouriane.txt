Bouriane is a natural region of France located in the department of Lot, but with a smaller part in Lot-et-Garonne. Its capital is the small town of Gourdon.   Historically, Bouriane was part of the Quercy, an ancient province which extends up to the Dordogne River and neighbours the Périgord. The region is characterized by its sandy soils and gentle hills covered with forests where chestnut trees predominate.
