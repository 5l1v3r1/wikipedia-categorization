 In the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) codes of the United Kingdom (UK), the three levels are: In the first version in 2003, North Eastern Scotland (which then included part of Moray) was coded UKM1, and Highlands and Islands was coded UKM4. The current NUTS level 1 codes start with "C" (following "UK") rather than "1" because the new list reflected the revised regions of England and local government changes throughout the UK; "1" to "B" had been used for the 11 regions in the previous coding system. NUTS 2006 came into force on 1 January 2008.  NUTS 2010 came into force on 1 January 2012.  2010 changes to NUTS 2 also resulting in changes with NUTS 3 regions 2010 changes to NUTS 3 areas without changes occurring to NUTS 2 areas NUTS 2013 came into force on 1 January 2015.  2015 changes to NUTS 3 areas without changes to NUTS 2 areas: In 2015 the Greater London NUTS 1 area was left unchanged however the previous NUTS 2 area of inner and outer London were abolished and with the previous NUTS 3 areas becoming NUTS 2 areas.
