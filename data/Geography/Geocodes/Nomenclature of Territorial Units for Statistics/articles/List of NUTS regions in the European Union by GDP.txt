The European Union uses a classification for subnational territory called Nomenclature des Unites Territriales Statistiques (commonly abbreviated as NUTS). The NUTS 1 classification is applied to a group of regions, NUTS 2 for regions and NUTS 3 as subdivisions of regions. There are also two levels (NUTS 4 and 5) which relate to local administrative unit levels. Countries agree a NUTS classification with the European Commission. Geddes notes that NUTS level 2 is "particularly important", because they often exist as territorial-government divisions and are used for regional policies by countries. NUTS 1 typically has a population of 3-7 million; NUTS 2 0.8-3 million; and NUTS 3 150,000-800,000.  As of 2015, there are 98 regions at NUTS 1 level, 276 regions at NUTS 2 level and 1,342 regions at NUTS 3 level (as a result, statistics at the NUTS level 3 are found as an external link to this article). The EU  is based on the classification of NUTS 2 regions as: less developed regions, transition regions and more developed regions.   The EU's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund direct funding to NUTS level 2 regions based on their GDP (PPS) per capita in comparison to the EU average: less developed regions (less than 75%), transition regions (between 75% and 90% and more developed regions (over 90%). For the period 2014–20, EUR 351 billion will be invested in the EU’s regions with most being directed to the less developed regions.
