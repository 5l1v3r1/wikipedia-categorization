ISO 3166-2:CD is the entry for the Democratic Republic of the Congo in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 1 city and 10 provinces. The city Kinshasa is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the provinces.  Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is CD, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The second part is two letters. A new subdivision layout was scheduled to take effect in February 2009, which would have 1 city and 25 provinces. In an October 2010 conclave of the ruling AMP coalition, it was proposed to revise Article 226, which calls for the creation of 26 provinces out of the current 11, in order to allow more time for the transition.  Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
