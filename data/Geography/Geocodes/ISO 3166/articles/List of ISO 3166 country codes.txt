The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created and maintains the ISO 3166 standard – Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions.   The ISO 3166 standard contains three parts: The ISO 3166-1 standard currently comprises 249 countries, 193 of which are sovereign states that are members of the United Nations.  Many dependent territories in the ISO 3166-1 standard are also listed as a subdivision of their parent country in the ISO 3166-2 standard. The sortable table below contains the three sets of ISO 3166-1 country codes for each of its 249 countries, links to the ISO 3166-2 country subdivision codes, and the Internet country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) which are based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard with the few exceptions noted.  See the ISO 3166-3 standard for former country codes.
