ISO 3166-2:CY is the entry for Cyprus in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Cyprus, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 6 districts. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is CY, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Cyprus. The second part is two digits (01–06). Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). ISO 639-1 codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following administrative languages: There are six districts (el: επαρχίες, eparchies; tr: kaza). Not all of the territory of the districts is controlled by the government of Cyprus; see Northern Cyprus. The British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (which consists of military bases) does not have an ISO 3166 code.
