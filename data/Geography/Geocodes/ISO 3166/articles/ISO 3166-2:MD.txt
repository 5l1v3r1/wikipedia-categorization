ISO 3166-2:MD is the entry for Moldova in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Moldova, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 1 autonomous territorial unit, 3 cities, 32 districts, and 1 territorial unit. The three cities have special status equal to the districts. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is MD, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Moldova. The second part is two letters. Due to limited international recognition, Transnistria is considered part of Moldova and does not have its own ISO 3166-1 code. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Subdivision names are sorted in Moldovan alphabetical order: a, â, ă, b-i, î, j-s, ș, t, ț, u-z. Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
