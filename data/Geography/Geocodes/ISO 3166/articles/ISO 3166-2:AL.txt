ISO 3166-2:AL is the entry for Albania in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Albania, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 12 counties. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is AL, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Albania. The second part is two digits. The codes for the counties are assigned in Albanian alphabetical order, except Dibër, whose code is assigned based on its capital, Peshkopi. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency . Subdivision names are sorted in Albanian alphabetical order: a-c, ç, d, dh, e, ë, f-g, gj, h-l, ll, m-n, nj, o-r, rr, s, sh, t, th, u-x, xh, y-z, zh.
