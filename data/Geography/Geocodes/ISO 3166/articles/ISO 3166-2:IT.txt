ISO 3166-2:IT is the entry for Italy in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Italy, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions: Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is IT, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Italy. The second part is either of the following: For the regions, the first digit indicates the geographical region where the subdivision is in: For provinces, the two-letter part is an abbreviation of the province name, such as 'PG' for Perugia, although, as an exception, the code for former Medio Campidano (IT-VS) whose name was based on its two capitals, Villacidro and Sanluri. The two-letter provincial codes were used in vehicle registration plates between 1905 and 1994 (except for Rome, whose vehicle code has always been ROMA instead of RM). In 1994, a new universal notation was introduced, dropping the province code entirely. This proved to be unpopular, and the two-letter code (or "ROMA") has been allowed to be added to a new, EU-style, blue border of the plates since 1999. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).  ISO 639-1 codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following administrative languages: Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
