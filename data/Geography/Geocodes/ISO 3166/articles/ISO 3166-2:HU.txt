ISO 3166-2:HU is the entry for Hungary in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Hungary, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 1 capital city, 19 counties, and 23 cities with county rights. The capital of the country Budapest has special status equal to the counties, while the cities with county rights, often called urban counties, have extended powers but are technically not independent of the counties. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is HU, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Hungary. The second part is two letters. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
