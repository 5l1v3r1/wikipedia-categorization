ISO 3166-2:MK is the entry for Macedonia in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Macedonia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 71 municipalities. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is MK, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Macedonia. The second part is two digits (01–85). The codes are assigned in original Cyrillic Macedonian alphabetical order. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Subdivision names are sorted in Macedonian alphabetical order after romanization (different from the original Cyrillic order used to assign codes): a-c, č, d-s, š, t-z, ž.
