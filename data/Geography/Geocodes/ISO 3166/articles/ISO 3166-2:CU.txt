ISO 3166-2:CU is the entry for Cuba in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Cuba, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 15 provinces and 1 special municipality. The special municipality Isla de la Juventud is not part of any province and administered directly by the central government. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is CU, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Cuba. The second part is two digits: The code CU-02 was assigned to La Habana Province, which was split into Artemisa and Mayabeque in 2011. The codes for the original 14 provinces were assigned roughly from west to east. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).
