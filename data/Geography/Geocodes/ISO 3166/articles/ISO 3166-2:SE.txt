ISO 3166-2:SE is the entry for Sweden in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Sweden, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 21 counties. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is SE, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Sweden. The second part is one or two letters, which is the alphabetic code (länsbokstav) of the county, and was used in vehicle registration plates until 1973. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). In ISO 3166-2, the numeric code (länskod) of each county is shown for information purposes in square brackets after the name of the county. However, these alternative code elements are not official ISO 3166-2 codes, since this part of ISO 3166 does not allow for duplicate coding of identical subdivisions. Subdivision names are sorted in Swedish alphabetical order: a-z, å, ä, ö. Click on the button in the header to sort each column. The following changes to the entry have been announced in newsletters by the ISO 3166/MA since the first publication of ISO 3166-2 in 1998:
