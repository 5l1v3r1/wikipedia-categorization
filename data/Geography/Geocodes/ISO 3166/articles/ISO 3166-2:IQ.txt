ISO 3166-2:IQ is the entry for Iraq in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Iraq, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 18 governorates. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is IQ, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Iraq. The second part is two letters. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Kurdish subdivision names are only provided for those governorates that have been amended in the 2016 update, and incidentally are part of the Kurdish region.
