ISO 3166-2:CN is the entry for China in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g. provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is CN, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of China. The second part is a two-letter alphabetic code specified by Guobiao GB/T 2260 (first published 1991, prior to ISO 3166-2, first published 1998).
