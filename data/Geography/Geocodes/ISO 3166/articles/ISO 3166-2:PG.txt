ISO 3166-2:PG is the entry for Papua New Guinea in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Papua New Guinea, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 1 district, 20 provinces and 1 autonomous region. The capital of the country Port Moresby forms the National Capital District and has special status equal to the provinces. Parliament has approved the creation of two additional provinces by 2012: Hela Province, which will consist of part of the current Southern Highlands Province, and Jiwaka Province, which will be formed by dividing Western Highlands Province.  Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is PG, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Papua New Guinea. The second part is three letters. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
