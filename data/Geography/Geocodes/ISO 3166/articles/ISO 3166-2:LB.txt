Currently for Lebanon, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for eight governorates. Aakkâr Governorate (which contains the current Aakkâr District) and Baalbek-Hermel Governorate (which contains the current Baalbek District and Hermel District), which are listed, are in the process of being implemented after having been approved for creation in 2003.
