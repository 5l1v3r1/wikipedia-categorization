ISO 3166-2:SI is the entry for Slovenia in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Slovenia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 212 communes.  Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is SI, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Slovenia. The second part is three digits, which is the municipality code used by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia: The codes for all groups of communes are assigned in Slovenian alphabetical order, except Tišina and Šalovci (whose codes are assigned based on their former names, Cankova-Tišina and Hodoš Šalovci respectively) as well as Rogašovci (of which the former spelling was Rogačovci). Žalec, whose municipality code was 145, uses 190 after splitting into multiple municipalities in 1998. Ankaran was added in 2016. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Subdivision names are sorted in Slovenian alphabetical order: a-c, č, d-s, š, t-z, ž. Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
