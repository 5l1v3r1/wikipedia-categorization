ISO 3166-2:LC is the entry for Saint Lucia in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Currently for Saint Lucia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 10 districts. Some sources claim that the country is divided into ten quarters (which include Canaries but not Dauphin and Praslin) plus the Central Forest Reserve Area. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is LC, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Saint Lucia. The second part is two digits (01â€“12). Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). Click on the button in the header to sort each column.
