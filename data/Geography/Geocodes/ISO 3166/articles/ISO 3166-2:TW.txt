ISO 3166-2:TW is the entry for Taiwan (Republic of China) in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. Due to the political status of Taiwan in the United Nations, the ISO 3166-1 full name is Taiwan, Province of China.  The definition of ISO 3166-2:TW includes the divisions located on Taiwan (Formosa), Penghu (the Pescadores), Kinmen, Matsu and their subsidiary islands. Politically, these areas are governed by the government of the Republic of China which resides in Taipei.  Currently ISO 3166-2:TW lists 13 counties, 3 cities, and 6 special municipalities. Although constitutionally the counties and cities are part of the provinces of Taiwan and Fujian, the provincial government was largely streamlined in 1998, these 22 subdivisions are regarded as the principal subdivisions of Republic of China (Taiwan). ISO 3166-2:TW has not been adopted by the Government of the Republic of China yet. Alternatively, the government uses the Code of Household Registration and Conscription Information System (HRCIS Code) to mark the divisions of Taiwan. Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA). The following changes to the entry have been announced in newsletters by the ISO 3166/MA since the first publication of ISO 3166-2 in 1998: Codes: (to correct duplicate use) Subdivision added: Subdivision deleted: Subdivision category changed:
