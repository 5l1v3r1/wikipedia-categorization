The following is an alphabetical list of subregions in the United Nations geoscheme for Europe, created by the United Nations Statistics Division.   The scheme subdivides the continent into Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, and Western Europe. The UNSD notes that "the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".
