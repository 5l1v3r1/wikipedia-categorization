 This list of Internet top-level domain (TLD) extensions contains top-level domains, which are those domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. The official list of all top-level domains is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) at the Root Zone Database.   IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains. As of  April 2018[update], the root domain contains 1543 top-level domains,  while a few have been retired and are no longer functional. IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:  Seven generic top-level domains were created early in the development of the Internet, and predate the creation of ICANN in 1998. Infrastructure top-level domain As of May 20, 2017, there were 255 Country code top-level domains. (For comparison, at the same time the United Nations comprised 193 countries.) Source:  All of these TLDs are internationalized domain names (IDN) and support second-level IDNs. ICANN/IANA has created some Special-Use domain names which are meant for special technical purposes. ICANN/IANA owns all of the Special-Use domain names.
