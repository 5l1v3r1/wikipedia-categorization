GOST 7.67 or ISO 3166-88 is GOST standard for country codes. The standard defines country names in Russian and English language, Cyrillic three-letter country codes, Latin three- and two-letter country codes, as well as numeric country codes. The latter three are the same as ISO 3166 codes (though, in practice, differences can arise due to changes in ISO 3166 that are still not introduced in GOST 7.67, for example three-letter code for Romania ROM, which is changed to ROU).
