International Networks is the name given by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to country calling codes +882 and +883, and serves as a catch-all for telephone services not dedicated to a single country. Satellite telephone carriers, especially those with worldwide service, are allocated within the Global Mobile Satellite System (GMSS), country code +881, with the exception of non-terrestrial Inmarsat, country code 870. As in the other such shared country codes, carriers are allocated number space within this code space plus their identification code (two-digit number in 882 code space, three or four digit number in 883 code space). The phone number for a subscriber of such a service will start with +882/+883 followed by the carrier code. The cost to call such a number can be high; for example in the British Telecom price list rates for various 882 and 883 numbers ranged from £0.60 to £4.50 per minute.  As of November 27, 2017 the assignments of +882/+883 carrier codes are as follows: In the +882-99 block, two numbering spaces are currently colliding: The numbering area has officially been assigned to Telenor but prior to this assignment, e164.org has started to assign unofficial numbers within that numbering area.  The following codes have been previously assigned by the ITU but were not used as of 2007:
