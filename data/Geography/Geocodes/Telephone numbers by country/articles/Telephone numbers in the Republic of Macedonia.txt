The Macedonian telephone numbering plan, is the system used for assigning telephone numbers in the Republic of Macedonia. It is regulated by the Agency for Electronic Communications AEK, which holds responsibility for telecommunications. The country calling code of the Republic of Macedonia is +389. Area codes should always be dialed, even within the country, because of the many fixed and mobile operators. An example for calling telephones in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia is as follows: Numbering formats for the Republic of Macedonia: +389 2 xxxxxxx  geographic numbers - Skopje  +389 3x xxxxxx  geographic numbers - eastern Macedonia (see below)  +389 4x xxxxxx  geographic numbers - central and western Macedonia (see below)  +389 5xx xxxxx  premium, value added, shared revenue  +389 7x xxxxxx  mobile  +389 8xx xxxxx  freephone, shared cost 1xx is the general short code format (e.g. 112 for emergency); 10xx format is for carrier access. The international call prefix depends on the country you are calling from, e.g. 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code. For calls from the Republic of Macedonia, the prefix for international calls is 00 (e.g. for calling a United States number, 00 1 ... should be dialed).  Note: When dialing from abroad, the caller has to replace the initial zero with the longer-format +389 prefix (the plus sign may in turn need to be replaced with its longer form). During Yugoslavia's existence, Macedonian area codes all began with 9. On 1 October 1993, Macedonia was split from the +38 code and the 9 from the area codes was integrated into the country code. Between 2000 and 2001, the 9 in the area codes was generally changed to either 3 or 4. The area codes for Skopje were changed from (091) to (02). In 2003, all Skopje phone numbers were changed from 6 to 7 digits by having an extra digit added to the front of the original number, meaning that (for example) the Yugoslavian number +38 91 123456 became +389 91 123456 in 1993, then +389 2 3123456.  When the extra 3 was added to the beginning of Skopje numbers, new 30x and 39x exchanges became available.
