A telephone number in Belgium is a sequence of nine or ten digits dialed on a telephone to make a call on the Belgian telephone network.  Belgium is under a closed telephone dialing plan, meaning that the full national number must be dialed for all calls, but it retains the trunk code, '0', for all national dialling. Exception: Some "special services" use 3 or 4 digits with no area or trunk codes: e.g.; 112 and 100 (fire brigade and ambulance); 101 (police); 1307 (info in French) or 1207 (info in Dutch), etc. "112" is an emergency number for contacting the fire brigade, ambulance and police in all 28 countries of the European Union. Operators will help you in the native language, in English, or the language of any neighbouring country. Calls to this number for contacting the police are forwarded to "101", losing response time. The Telephone numbering plan is open, meaning that numbers have varying lengths (9 digits for landline phones of the formerly monopolistic company Belgacom, and 10 digits for other numbers incl. GSM cellphones). Area codes in Belgium are, excluding the leading '0', one or two digits long. Numbers are of variable length; landlines have a seven-digit subscriber number and a one-digit area code, while smaller cities have a six-digit subscriber number and a two-digit area code. All Belgian telephone numbers dialed within Belgium must use the leading '0' trunk code. Area codes are separated from the subscriber number by a slash and a space, and subscriber number digits are in the format xxx xx xx or xx xx xx (sometimes xxx xxx), depending on the length of the area code. See the table below for examples: From outside Belgium, a caller would dial their international call prefix (typically 00 in Europe and 011 in North America), followed by 32 (the country code for Belgium), then the area code minus the trunk code '0', and finally the local number. Mobile/GSM area codes always begin with 04xx and the subscriber number is six digits long. Numbers are usually provided by Mobistar (re-branded as Orange), Base, or Proximus, and more recently by Telenet as well. Each provider has a unique number assigned as the second digit in the area code: Proximus numbers begin with 047x or 0460, Base numbers with 048x, Orange numbers with 049x and Telenet numbers with 0467 and 0468. With the introduction of number portability, area codes may no longer correspond with their providers. On some mobile phones, caller ID may fail unless the leading 0 is replaced with a + and the country code, i.e. a caller's number 0474-12-34-56 might need to be manually replaced with +32-474-12-34-56 in your phone. More ranges have become available between 0440 and 0468 For the latest list refer to reference   Number format:
