Before 1992, telephone numbers would consist of a 2 or 3-digit area code, and a 5 or 6-digit subscriber number. Example: (067) 85 000 and (04) 66 00 00. In that year, a closed telephone numbering plan was adopted, with eight-digit telephone numbers incorporating the area code and full number dialling for local and national calls. Service numbers were to be three digits long, Directory numbers four digits and some companies were allocated five-digit numbers, ex. 07575. GSM telephony was introduced in 1993, and those numbers always start with the digit '4' or '9'. Historically, the local operator would take emergency calls and forward them to the police, fire or local doctor. In 1964, the emergency number 000 was introduced. In 1985, a modernized emergency service was started at Haukeland hospital in Bergen for Hordaland. In 1986, the emergency numbers diverted to 001 for fire brigade, 002 for police and 003 for ambulance. These numbers changed to 110, 112 and 113 in 1994, when the international access code changed from 095 to 00.
