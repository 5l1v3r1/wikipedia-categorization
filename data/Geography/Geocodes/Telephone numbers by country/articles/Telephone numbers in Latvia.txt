The Latvian telephone numbering plan is a telephone number assigning system used in Latvia. All the numbers consist of 8 digits with exceptions for special services. The assigning process is controlled by the Electronic Communications Office (Latvian: VAS "Elektroniskie sakari") and regulated by the Public Utilities Commission (Latvian: Sabiedrisko pakalpojumu regulēšanas komisija).   The Latvian SSR had the +7 013 area code. The original format was 8 (013) xxx xxxx. In 1993, Latvia switched to the +371 code. The plan remained relatively the same until 2008, when a 6 was prepended to all landlines. Example number in Riga: The 5-series is currently only reserved for future use. The 6-series is generally used for landlines and the 7-series is used with payphones throughout the country. A variety of service numbers are assigned in the 1-series with lengths shorter than the standard 8 digits. Some of these services also provide 8-digit geographical numbers to be reachable from abroad. Calls to 112 are answered on average within 6 seconds and are answered in Latvian, English and Russian. In 98% of cases, the operator can detect the location of the caller within a minute.
