Until the 1990s, Swaziland was integrated into the South African  telephone numbering plan; calls from South Africa to Swaziland were made using the code 0194.  Calls to South Africa from Swaziland, however, required the use of the regional code 07.  Calls to Lesotho were similarly made using the regional code 05 while those to Mozambique were made using the code 06.
