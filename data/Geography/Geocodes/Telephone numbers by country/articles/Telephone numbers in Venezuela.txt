The Venezuelan Numbering Plan is an open telephone numbering plan with three-digit area codes and seven-digit telephone numbers that directs telephone calls to particular regions on a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or to a mobile telephone network, where they are further routed by the local network. The last revision of the current numbering plan is September 21, 2000. Example landline calls (using Caracas as reference): Area codes 417 and 418 were deleted in 2006 when Digicel and Infonet were bought by Digitel, migrating their subscribers to a single access code: 412.
