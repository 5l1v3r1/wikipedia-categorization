Belarus began using its own country code +375 in 1995. Prior to that it was part of the +7 international country code. The local numbering plan was inherited from USSR and remains with little changes. Geographic area codes were designed based on previous 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that. This pause was initially required by the analog trunk switches to identify the caller from PSTN for billing purposes. When calling within Belarus add 0 to the trunk prefix. This way dialing within the country is practically unchanged. In 2003 the abbreviated dialing within areas was replaced with a full 9-digit number + 2-digit trunk prefix. Previously it was possible to dial 82RRnn-nnn to reach a number in the same area. Now it is required to dial 80-AARRnn-nnn where AA is the area code, RR is the region code and nn-nnn is the local number. International calling remains unchanged: 8-10-xxx...xxxx where 8 is a trunk prefix, 10 is the international access code, xxx...xxxx are the digits of the destination country, areas and local number. Transition to new numbering plan Beltelecom began transition to the international numbering standard similar to the one adapted in many European countries in 2007. March 31, 2007 all short numbers were changed from 2 or 3 digits to 3 digits starting with 1. Beltelecom plans by 2010 to change trunk prefix to 0 from current 80 and international prefix to 00 from current 8-10. 13 — Restricted and directory services 14 — Restricted and directory services 15 — Grodno 16 — Brest 17 — Minsk 18 — Restricted and reference services 20 — Digital PSTN 1 21 — Vitebsk 22 — Mogilev 23 — Gomel 24 — Digital PSTN 2 25 — Mobile phone operator life:) Belarus 29 — Mobile phone operators - common code for all mobile phone operators except "Life :)" 33 — Mobile phone operator MTS Belarus 44 — Mobile phone operators Velcom All special numbers are dialed with a trunk prefix 8. 600 100 - Internet access billed on local phone bill 601 - Personal radio communications 604 - Network of Presidential Administration 602 - Audiotex services 606 100 1111 - Prepaid card internet service 800 - Toll-free Direct Call 801 - Toll-free directory services "Green number" 803 - Toll-free surveys 805 - Interactive platform services 810 - Toll surveys 820 - International toll-free service IFS 902 - Toll directory assistance The top 4 numbers are available across areas.
