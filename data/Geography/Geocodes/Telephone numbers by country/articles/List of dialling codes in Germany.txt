Country Code: +49 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: 0 Area codes in Germany (German Vorwahl) have two to five digits, not counting the leading trunk access code 0. The leading 0 must be dialed when calling from within Germany and must be omitted when calling from abroad. When calling via fixed networks within the same area, the area code is not required. In general, shorter area codes are assigned to larger cities, and longer area codes to smaller towns. Private telephone numbers are usually inversely long: those in larger cities have seven or eight digits, while those in smaller towns may have as few as three or four digits. The first digit (after the leading zero) is determined by region: area codes beginning (0)2 are found in the west, those with (0)3 in the east, those with (0)4 in the north, those with (0)5 in the north central part, those with (0)6 in the south central part, those with (0)7 in the southwest, those with (0)8 in the south and the 9s are found in the southeast. (0)1 are special numbers such as mobile phones (015, 016, 017), shared cost service (0180), televoting numbers (013) and 010 for dial-around services. The former codes 0130 for free phone numbers and 0190 for premium-rate numbers are now moved to 0800 and 0900 to meet international standards. 0700 is used for personal national phone numbers. Prefix 01 is used for special numbers, and is not tied to a geographic area. All of former East Germany and Berlin East Germany was using +37 before the reunification. After reunification, East Germany was merged into the existing (West) German numbering plan. Since all areas except 03 were already used, all of former East Germany needed to be merged into 03, causing numbers and area codes in the 03 area to be longer than those in the rest of Germany: Many area codes in the 03 area are 5-digit while the maximum in the rest of Germany is 4 digits currently unassigned (was Hamburg) not assigned not assigned not assigned These area codes were changed in February 1997 in order to allow service 0900 numbers:
