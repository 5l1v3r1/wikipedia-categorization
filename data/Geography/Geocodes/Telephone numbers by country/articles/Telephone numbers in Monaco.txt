 Telephone numbers in Monaco are eight digits in length, with fixed line numbers beginning with the digit 9 and mobile phone numbers with the digit 4. Until 21 June 1996, Monaco formed part of the French numbering plan, with fixed line numbers beginning with 93, but on that date the principality adopted its own country code +377.  Consequently, all calls between France and Monaco had to be dialled in international format, including those to and from surrounding areas in France.    At the technical level, the first automatic telephone switch of type R6 with recorders was installed in Monaco circa 1937-1938, the time of automation of the CÃ´te d'Azur. The inside Monegasque network followed the development of the French automatic telephone. An electronic time switch E10N1 in Monaco (Reference NC90) had been established before 1986 in Monaco by the PTT of France and who lived the transition of the PTT from France to Monaco Telecom in 1996.  (Mobile phone operators in at least two other countries, specifically Lonestar Cell in Liberia  and Vala in Kosovo,[a]  have also used the +377 dialing code. Vala's use of +377 ceased on 3 February 2017, however, when Kosovo implemented the +383 code. )
