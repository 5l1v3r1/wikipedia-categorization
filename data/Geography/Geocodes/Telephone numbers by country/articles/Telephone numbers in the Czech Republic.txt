Following the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the successor states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, continued to share the 42 country code until 28 February 1997, with the Czech Republic then adopting 420 and Slovakia adopting 421. On September 22, 2002, the Czech Republic adopted a closed numbering plan, with nine-digit numbers used for local and national calls, and the dropping of the trunk code 0. Before the change, the following arrangements would have been made for calls to Brno: After the change, the dialing arrangements for calls to Brno were as follows: In the case of mobile numbers, which had to be dialed in full, the only change was that the 0 was no longer used: The first 1-3 digits (after +420) of the telephone number indicates location or network. For mobile phones, since there is number portability, the mobile phone code only indicates the original operator. For example, when a person calls a number starting with 73 (T-mobile) but had been ported to another operator, a short voice message in Czech and English is played stating "you are calling out of a T-mobile network" before the ringing tone.
