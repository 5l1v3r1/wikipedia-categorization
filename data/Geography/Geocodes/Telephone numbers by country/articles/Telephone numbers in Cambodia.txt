To dial a land line in Cambodia all over the country, the format is Area Code + Phone Number. The area code is 3 digits long, followed by a 6 or 7 digit phone number. Calls made from outside Cambodia must omit the prefix 0. Therefore, to call a land line number in Phnom Penh from other countries, dialing begins with +855 23 followed by 6 or 7 digits.  Area codes starting with 02 Area codes starting with 03 Area codes starting with 04 Area codes starting with 05 Area codes starting with 06 Area codes starting with 07 Likewise to call mobile phones from land line or other mobile phones, domestic dialing begins a 0 followed by 8 or 9 digits.  Mobile numbers in Cambodia take the form: 0TT-AXX-XXXY. The first two numbers after the leading 0 or 'TT' in the example above identify the operator. For example, 010 234 567 is an example of a 9 digit mobile number from Smart. 088 234 5678 on the other hand is an example of a 10 digit mobile number from Metfone. The 3rd digit after the leading 0 or 'A' in the example above must be between 1 and 9.  Normally this value is between 2 and 9 which allows a value of '1' to be used for mobile phones which are roaming in Cambodia. However some operators such as Mobitel are using a '1' in this range to extend their number ranges for certain popular prefixes. For example, 012 123 4567 and 092 123 456 are valid mobile numbers in Cambodia. 'X' can take the values 0 to 9 and 'Y' is an optional extra digit which is used by some operators. Most mobile numbers are 8 digits long (excluding the leading 0), however some operators are now using 9 digit numbers. 0882345678 is an example of a valid 9 digit mobile number. Calls made from outside Cambodia must omit the prefix 0. Therefore, to call a mobile number in Cambodia from other countries, dialing begins with +855 1, +855 8, or +855 9 etc. Mobitel - - CooTel - EMAXX (Star Digital)/Kingtel - - - Seatel - - Metfone qb - - - Smart
