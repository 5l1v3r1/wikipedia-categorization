All phone numbers in Morocco are 9 digits in length (excluding the leading 0). Morocco uses a closed numbering plan, i.e. the area code is not omitted for local calls. This is necessary because Morocco makes heavy use of overlay codes, i. e. the same geographic area can be served by several area codes. Casablanca, for instance, has 10 area codes. Fixed and mobile area codes belong exclusively to one phone company. On the following list, fixed networks are indicated by the following letters: I = Itissalat Al-Maghrib (fixed), M = MÃ©di Telecom (NGN), W = WANA (Maroc Connect) (fixed NGN), X = WANA (Maroc Connect) (fixed GSM(?)) In 1990, 6-digit phone numbers were introduced. On 2000-10-13 at 23:00 UTC, the numbering area in Morocco was split into 5 parts by adding another digit to all area codes in Morocco. Six years later (2006-03-24 23:00 UTC), part of this split was reverted in order to make room for cellular networks. The 04 numbering area was merged into 02 and 05 was merged into 03, which caused 02 to cover the South while 03 covered the North. This could be done easily because there were no conflicts. On 2009-03-07 at 02:00 UTC, phone numbers in Morocco got another additional digit. A 5 was prepended to all fixed numbers while a 6 was prepended to mobile numbers. The 08 numbers became 080 and 09 became 089.
