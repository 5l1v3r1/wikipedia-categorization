Area code 456, until 2017, was a non-geographic area code used to route inbound calls from outside the North American Numbering Plan Area to specific carriers for carrier-specific services.  In November 2017, the 456 code was withdrawn due to lack of demand. 456 will be re-added to the pool of potential North American area codes (geographic and non-geographic) in 2023.
