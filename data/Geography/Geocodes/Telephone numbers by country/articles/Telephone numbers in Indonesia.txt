Telephone numbers in Indonesia have different systems for land lines and mobile phones: land lines use area codes, while mobile phones do not. For land line area codes, the digit "0" is added in front when dialing domestic long distance from within Indonesia, but is always omitted when calling from abroad. Instead, callers would use the Indonesian country code +62, followed by the area code, without the "0". Domestic phone numbers in large cities have 8 digits, and in other areas 7 digits. Mobile phone numbers have a total of 10 or 11 digits for postpaid depending on the operator, whereas prepaid services get 11 to 12 digits determined by the operator. Until October 1999, East Timor was included in the Indonesian telephone numbering plan, using the area codes 0390 (for Dili) and 0399 for (Baucau). To make a phone call to Indonesia from abroad, the following formats are used: For calls to landlines, callers dial +62, followed by the area code and subscriber's number, omitting the '0', hence a number in Jakarta would be dialled as +62 21 xxx xxxx.  For calls to mobile wireless phone (GSM) from abroad, callers dial +62, followed by the subscriber's number, omitting the '0', hence +62 895618472229 On business cards and other contact information, telephone numbers might be listed as "HP" or "hunting".  "HP" is an abbreviation for "hand phone" or mobile phone and is pronounced "hah p√©h".  Hand phones might also be referred to as pon-sel (short form of telepon seluler) or telepon genggam ("hold-in-the-hand telephone").  Hunting refers to an office line in which multiple individual lines are connected so that an incoming call can roll over to another line if the first line is busy.  This permits only one number to be published.
