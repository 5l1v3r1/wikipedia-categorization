Telephone numbers in Peru are made of: Peruvian area codes for each region (national subdivision) are 2 digits long except for Lima and Callao. On 1 March 2003 new codes were established.

In Peru, when making an international call you may choose a carrier for international calls different from your usual carrier/provider according to the rates carriers offer to attract callers. This system is known as "call by call" (in Spanish "Llamada por llamada") as each call can be made with a different carrier and is available to both fixed lines and mobile phones.

You may dial starting with the "+" symbol and the international call will go through your provider's network. From Peru to USA/Canada:
