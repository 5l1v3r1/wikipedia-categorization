Country Code: +290 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: 0 Ascension Island no longer shares the same country code with the rest of Saint Helena (i.e. Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha). Format: +290 XXXX From 1 October 2013 all existing 4-digit telephone numbers on St Helena will be prefixed by a ‘2’ to implement a 5-digit numbering plan.  The change in numbering resulted after the increased demand for new telephone services while also providing a platform for the future introduction of a cellular network on the island.  Although Tristan da Cunha shares the +290 code with St Helena, residents have access to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Telecommunications Network, provided by Global Crossing.  This uses a London 020 numbering range, meaning that numbers are accessed via the UK telephone numbering plan.
