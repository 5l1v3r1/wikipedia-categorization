  The following telephone numbers in Kenya are destination codes for international calls terminating in Kenya as well as the procedures for dialling internationally from within Kenya. Until 1999, Kenya shared its telephone numbering plan with Tanzania and Uganda, meaning that to make calls between the three countries, subscribers needed only dial the area code and number, a legacy of the East African Post and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC) which was dissolved in 1977. As a result of the reorganisation of Tanzania's numbering plan in that year, direct dialling was discontinued, although calls between the three countries do not require international dialling, only a special three-digit code. Land line phone numbers in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number. To dial a number within an Area and/or City, only the Phone Number needs to be dialled. When dialling from a different Area/City, the telephone number is dialled in the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. When dialling from overseas, the 0 is omitted. In Kenya exists 4  mobile network operators (MNO): Safaricom, Airtel (former Zain / Celtel),  Equitel (MVNO)and Telkom Kenya (Orange).  The Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) has assigned several Area Codes to each operator. All mobile Area Codes starts with the digit 7. Please note: Since April 2011 Mobile number portability (MNP) is implemented in Kenya.  The phone number can be ported by the customer to another operator.     To call Kenya from Tanzania and Uganda, subscribers must dial 005, followed by the area code and number. To call Uganda from Kenya, subscribers must dial 006, followed by the area code and number, while calls to Tanzania require the prefix 007.  To call Kenya from other countries, subscribers must dial their international access code e.g. 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America, followed by the country code 254. The international access code for calls from Kenya is 000.
