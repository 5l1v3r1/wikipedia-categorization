Colombia has various telephone dial plans, depending on the type of service. Local numbers follow the pattern: Where N are numbers from 2 to 8. Numbers where N is 9 are reserved for pay phones. [not in citation given] And X is any number from 0 to 9. Domestic long-distance numbers follow the pattern: Where A represents one of the four national long-distance carriers, but new long distance operators are using 0Axy format: And B represents the dialing zone where the number is located. Each department belongs to only one dialing zone: To dial internationally from Colombia, subscribers dial using the pattern: Where A represents the long-distance carrier, as described above. Mobile phone numbers follow the pattern: Where MMM usually represents the access code for one of the country's mobile phone operators. Since Colombia adopted the mobile number portability, these codes may not be associated with the current operators. Calls from a mobile phone to a domestic landline phone follow the pattern: Where B corresponds to the dialing zone of the receiving phone. To dial internationally from a mobile phone, the procedure is identical to calling from a landline phone. Toll-free numbers follow the pattern: Before 2002, the format was 9800-XXXXXX. When the current format was adopted in that year, existing toll-free numbers were given the format 01-800-0XX-XXXX. These numbers were advertised with the grouping 01-8000-XX-XXX, leading many people to erroneously believe that the general prefix for toll-free numbers is 01-8000.
