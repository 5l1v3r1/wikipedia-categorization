 Telephone numbers in Cape Verde are 7 digits long (except for special 1xx codes), and must always be dialed in their entirety (a closed dialing plan). The first 3 digits of a fixed-line (non-mobile) number correspond to its geographic area. Calls within a given 2xx area, and between certain areas, are considered local calls and priced accordingly. Mobile numbers have no geographic area, and calls to or from national mobile numbers are treated the same regardless of location. On July 3 2004, 2 was prepended to all fixed-line numbers, and 9 to all mobile numbers, increasing the number length to 7 digits.  The NSN length is seven digits. In all cases listed, when a 2x range is split between two islands, one takes 2x0 through 2x4, while the other takes 2x5 through 2x9. 102 - Information
