Telephone numbers in Andorra are six digits, with fixed line numbers beginning with the digits 8 and 7 and mobile telephone numbers with the digits 3, 4 and 6. Until 17 December 1994, Andorra formed part of the French numbering plan, with the prefix 0628 being used for calls from France or +33 628 from the rest of the world, except Spain which assigned access code from its numbering plan. Since 1994, Andorra adopted its own country code +376. This means that all calls to Andorra, including from France and Spain, require the usage of the +376 country code.
