Land line phone numbers in Vietnam follow the format Area Code + Phone Number. The area codes depend on the province and/or city. To dial a number within the same province or city, only the phone number needs to be dialed. When dialing from a different province/city, follow the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. At the moment, area codes may have from 2 to 3 digits, while phone numbers may have from 7 to 8 digits, in total, the land line phone numbers in Vietnam have 11 numbers included trunk code (0). The different area codes are described below. 69 is the special area code dedicated for the Ministry of Defence (Vietnam) and the Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam). In Vietnam, mobile phone numbers follow the format 09x-xxxxxxx or new prefixes: 03x, 05x, 07x, 08x.
