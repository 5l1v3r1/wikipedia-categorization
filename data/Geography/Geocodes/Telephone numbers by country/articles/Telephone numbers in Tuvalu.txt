Each of the nine atolls (districts) of Tuvalu has a dialing code, apart from Funafuti which has two.   90: Mobile (prepaid) WNP:  The mobile network was destroyed in a storm in 2007, and rebuilt in 2009.  The telephone operator can be contacted on 20006 and the emergency services can be contacted on 911.
