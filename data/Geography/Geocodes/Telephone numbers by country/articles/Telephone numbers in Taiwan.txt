The emergency number in Taiwan is 119. When making an inter-area long-distance call from within Taiwan, a long-distance prefix "0" is required. If calls are made from within the same area code, then the 0 of the area code prefix (or the entire area code itself) does not need to be included. If calls are made from outside Taiwan, the "0" of the area code prefix is omitted. The following table of area codes includes this "0" prefix. The government reserves code 1 for Nanjing, the capital of the ROC according to the constitution, which it  does not actually control. (Note: 070 prefix is used for VOIP phone services, these numbers are 8 digits instead of 7). Taiwan mobile phone numbers always begin with 09 followed by 8 digits (e.g. 0912-345678). The 0 is omitted when calling a Taiwan mobile phone number from outside Taiwan (e.g. +886 9XXXXXXXX). If calling a landline Taiwan phone number from a local Taiwan mobile phone, the 0 of area code prefix must be included (e.g. 0 + area code + 8 digit landline number). Prefixes: (09)XXXX-XXXX 090-098 Mobile Phones (090 range is mostly used for wireless data services,M2M). Toll-free numbers begin with the prefix 0800 . Numbers in the 020x prefix are used for value-added services : International dialing codes are assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to its member states and their dependencies. However, as Taiwan was not an ITU member state, it had to be allocated the code 886 unofficially, with the ITU listing the code as 'reserved' until 2006.  However, in that year, it formally allocated the code to "Taiwan, China".  Until the late 1970s, Taiwan used the code 866, but the 86 code was reassigned to the People's Republic of China in conformity with the ITU's official membership, forcing Taiwan to utilize another code for countries that wished to maintain direct dial connections.  0981983182
