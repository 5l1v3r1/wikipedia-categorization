Country Code: +55 International Call Prefix: 00 then Carrier Code Trunk Prefix: 0 then Carrier Code This page contains a list of area codes in Brazil for telephone dialing. The area codes are distributed geographically, citing the main cities in each area. Local phone numbers in Brazil observe an eight-digit pattern (nnnn-nnnn) for landlines and nine digits (nnnnn-nnnn) for mobile phones. Mobile numbers share the same geographic area codes as landlines, but the first digit differentiates them. Landline numbers start with digits 2 through 5. Initial digits 6 through 9 are reserved for mobile numbers, but as of 2017 all mobile numbers in Brazil start with the digit 9. (There is an exception for some iDEN mobile lines operated by Nextel, which are eight digits long and start with 7.) Area codes have two digits, and are often notated between parentheses: (aa) nnnn-nnnn. For long-distance calls within Brazil, a zero (0) must be dialed first, then a carrier selection code (for example, 21 for Embratel and 41 for TIM Brasil), then the two-digit area code, then the local number. For example, to call the number 2222-2222 in Fortaleza (area code 85) using Oi (selection code 31) as the chosen carrier, one would dial 0 31 85 2222 2222. For international calls to Brazil, the international access code used in the calling country must be dialed (for example, 011 from the United States and Canada, 00 from Europe and most other countries, or the actual "+" sign from some mobile networks), then Brazil's country code 55, then the two-digit area code, then the local eight- or nine-digit number. For example, to call the number 3333-3333 in Rio de Janeiro (area code 21) from Europe, one would dial 00 55 21 3333 3333.  In a few exceptional cases, some area codes span state borders to cater for tightly integrated interstate communities:
