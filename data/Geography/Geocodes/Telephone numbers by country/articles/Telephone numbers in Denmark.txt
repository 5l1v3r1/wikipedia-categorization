Denmark generally uses an eight digit closed telephone numbering plan. Subscriber numbers are portable with respect to provider and geography, i.e. fixed line numbers can be ported to any physical address in Denmark. The Kingdom of Denmark also includes two autonomous regions, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. However, they are assigned each their own country calling code and are using different numbering plans. Split charge is not generally used in Denmark anymore; calls to 70 numbers are usually charged as regular landline calls. A few exceptions do exist, e.g., 70 10 11 55 (the TDC speaking clock service).
