National Significant Numbers (NSN): International dialling format: Suriname uses a number plan introduced in 2008.  Until 1969, a system was used with 2-digit area codes and local numbers varying from 2 to 5 digits depending on the area. Around 1969/1970 this was changed to a closed numbering system with 5-digit numbers nationwide; a zero had to be dialled before the number. At that time, some areas were not automated yet.
