To call in Somalia, the following format is used: The telecommunication industry in Somalia is managed by few business people based in Moga, Djibouti and Kenya since the collapse of the Siad Barre government in 1990. Many transitional and now the UN recognised federal government officials tried to get the management of telecom sector back into the open, legal government authority. All attempts to achieve that have failed so far. The current Somali government sought the help of the ITU, unfortunately the ITU cannot enforce national laws; it can help where possible, but that is the best they can do. So as the private group that runs the Somali Somali telecom sector and now the finance sector as well via their combined telecom and mobile money combination, gets richer and more powerful, and the ITU runs 101 courses for the Somali telecom Ministry, the longer it will take telecom Somali numbering plan to become reliable and credible.
