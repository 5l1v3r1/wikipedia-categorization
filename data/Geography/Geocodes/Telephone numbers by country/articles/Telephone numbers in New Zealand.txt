  The New Zealand telephone numbering plan describes the allocation of telephone numbers in New Zealand and the Pitcairn Islands. Until the 1970s, New Zealand's telephone network consisted primarily of step-by-step telephone exchanges, or a mixture of rotary and step-by-step exchanges in the main centres. A few rural areas were still served by manual exchanges. Crossbar exchanges were installed from the 1970s, and electronic exchanges from 1982. Local telephone number lengths varied from 3 to 6 digits depending on the size of exchange and population of the local calling area. Numerous complex dialling instructions appeared in the front of telephone books explaining the number sequences needed to reach subscribers in local "free calling" areas, and in a few cases for short distance toll calls (usually to the local city or town), which were recorded on manually read meters in some step-by-step local exchanges. Local calls were free, and still are for residential customers. Long distance (toll) calls required the manual intervention of an operator, who had access to toll circuits, either via an operator's cord board or a toll exchange (switch). Access to the toll operator was by dialling 0. Local directory service could be accessed via 100, telephone faults via 120, and emergency services by dialling 111. Subscriber toll dialling (STD) was introduced in the New Zealand telephone network in the mid 1970s, a result of the introduction of NEC crossbar-based toll exchanges and their ability to perform number translation. One still needed to dial 0 to make a toll call, but instead of calling the operator, one could then dial the STD number directly. Access to the operator was via 010, while other service numbers remained unchanged. The original STD codes were numbered roughly south to north, with a few exceptions. Some of the STD codes were: STD codes were assigned with larger areas having short STD codes (e.g. Auckland - 09), while smaller areas had longer STD codes and shorter local numbers (e.g. Shannon - 06927). The total number length, that is STD code and local number excluding the first 0, usually totalled seven digits, but could vary up to nine, often as exchanges increased the length of local numbers to accommodate new lines. With the introduction of NEC stored program control exchanges in the New Zealand telephone network during the 1980s, and the rapid growth in demand, the breakup of the New Zealand Post Office and the creation of Telecom, local telephone numbers were standardised to seven digits. In many parts of the country, the old area code was incorporated into the new number, however in some areas the numbers changed completely. At the same time, the opportunity was taken to move directory service from 100 to 018 and charge for directory service calls. The justification for doing so was the introduction of a directory service computer system that gave access to current New Zealand telephone number listings, not just those printed in the telephone book, and the need for a separate user pays revenue stream for Telecom Directory Services, which was separate to the 5 regional (local) telephone companies, TNI and Telecom Mobile that Telecom had split itself into, as part of the sale of Telecom and deregulation of New Zealand telecommunications services. Since 1993, land-line telephone numbers in New Zealand consist of a single-digit area code and seven-digit local numbers, the first three of which generally specify the exchange and the final four a line at that exchange. The long distance trunk prefix, 0, which is prepended to national numbers, is not part of the international number. The minimum number length after the international prefix is three digits. Most numbers, other than service numbers have at least eight digits. The maximum number length after the international prefix is nine digits, except numbers starting with 210 (ten digits). New Zealand follows an open numbering plan.  The country code is 64. The long distance dialing prefix is 0. The international prefix is 00. New Zealand landline phone numbers have a total of eight digits excluding the leading 0: a one-digit area code, and a seven-digit phone number (e.g. 09 700 1234), beginning with a digit between 2 and 9 (but excluding 900, 911, and 999 due to misdial guards). There are five regional area codes: 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. These must be dialled, along with the domestic trunk prefix, when calling a recipient outside the local calling area of which the caller is located. For example, one calling Dunedin from Christchurch must dial 03, even though Christchurch is 03 as well. The combined domestic trunk prefix  and area codes are: The first few digits of the local number can specify the general area of the telephone numbers. Note the names below are of the local calling areas.           Telephone numbers for mobile phones begin with 02, followed by seven to nine digits (usually eight). The first few digits after the 02 indicate the original mobile network that issued the number. Telephone numbers must always be dialled in full for mobile phones. In the late 1990s however, Telecom mobile phones could dial other Telecom mobile phones without the (then) 025 prefix, making 025 act like a landline area code. The introduction of mobile number portability on 1 April 2007 meant that an increasing number of mobiles will be operating on a different network to that which originally assigned the number. To find out whether a particular number belongs to a specific network provider, one can text the mobile number of interest to 300. It is a free service provided by 2degrees. A reply will be sent to verify whether the number is operating on their network or not.  Note:  Some reports indicate this service will work for Vodafone and Spark, but as at 05/11/2014 only 2Degrees appears to support this service. Toll-free numbers begin with 0508 or 0800, usually followed by six digits (some numbers have seven digits). Premium rate services use the code 0900 followed by five digits (some with six digits). Local rate numbers, such as Internet access numbers, have the prefix 08xx, and are usually followed by five digits. Numbers beginning with 01 are for operator services. The '1' codes are used for local services, including activating exchange features. The emergency services number is '111'. The mobile network also recognises telephone numbers starting with *, including: Text message numbers for mobile phones are 3 or 4 digits long. New Zealand has no dedicated series of fictional telephone numbers. Television shows and movies generally use any available range of numbers (e.g. the TVNZ soap opera Shortland Street uses the unassigned (09) 4299 number range.).
