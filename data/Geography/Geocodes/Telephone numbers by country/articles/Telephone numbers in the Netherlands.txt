 Telephone numbers in the Netherlands are administered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation of the Netherlands and may be grouped into three general categories: geographical numbers, non-geographical numbers, and numbers for public services. Geographical telephone numbers are sequences of 9 digits (0-9) and consist of an area code of two or three digits and a subscriber number of seven or six digits, respectively. When dialled within the country, the number must be prefixed with the trunk access code 0, identifying a destination telephone line in the Dutch telephone network. Non-geographical numbers have no fixed length, but also required the dialling of the trunk access code (0). They are used for mobile telephone networks and other designated service types, such as toll-free dialling, Internet access, voice over IP, restricted audiences, and information resources. In addition, special service numbers exist for emergency response, directory assistance, and other services by the public authorities. The telephone numbering plan of the Netherlands is divided into geographical, non-geographical, and special public resource telephone numbers. The dial plan prescribes that within the country dialling both geographical and non-geographical numbers requires a national network access code, which is the digit 0. The following list includes this national trunk access digit when it must be dialled before the number. 066, 084 and 087 are often used by scammers, because they are easy and cheap to register and make identification very hard.  Previously, 06-0, 06-1000 and 06-4 were used for toll-free numbers, 06-8 for shared cost, 06-9 for premium rate, and other 06-numbers for mobile numbers. 0011 and later 06-11 was used for emergency services before this changed to 112. 09 was used as the international access code before this changed to 00. Since the reorganization of the telephone system in 1995, Dutch geographical numbers consist of 9 digits. The numbering plan implements a system of area codes. An area code consists of two or three digits. The larger cities and areas have two digits with a subscriber number of seven digits, permitting more local numbers. Smaller areas use three digits with a six-digit subscriber number. Geographic numbers are allocated in blocks to telecommunications providers. However, a telephone number from a block allocated to a certain provider may no longer be serviced by the original assignee due to number portability; subscribers who switch providers can take their number with them. When dialled within the Netherlands, the domestic trunk access code 0 must be dialled before the telephone number, extending the dialling sequence to 10 digits. If dialling from overseas, the 0 (Zero) in front of the prefix must be omitted.   Before the 1995 reorganization, area codes were restricted to towns. This was lifted and multiple towns may now share an area code. The following table lists only one town for each area code, and it includes the trunk access code (0). 010 Rotterdam  0111  Zierikzee  0113  Goes  0114  Hulst  0115  Terneuzen  0117  Sluis  0118  Middelburg  013   Tilburg  015   Delft 0161  Gilze-Rijen 0162  Oosterhout  0164  Bergen op Zoom  0165  Roosendaal  0166  Tholen  0167  Steenbergen 0168  Zevenbergen  0172  Alphen aan den Rijn 0174  Naaldwijk  0180  Ridderkerk and Zuidplas  0181  Spijkenisse  0182  Gouda  0183  Gorinchem  0184  Sliedrecht  0186  Oud-Beijerland  0187  Middelharnis  020   Amsterdam  0222  Texel  0223  Den Helder  0224  Schagen  0226  Harenkarspel   0227  Medemblik  0228  Enkhuizen  0229  Hoorn  023   Haarlem 024   Nijmegen    0251  Beverwijk  0252  Hillegom  0255  IJmuiden  026   Arnhem 0294  Weesp  0297  Aalsmeer  0299  Purmerend  030   Utrecht  0313  Dieren  0314  Doetinchem  0315  Terborg  0316  Zevenaar  0317  Wageningen  0318  Ede / Veenendaal  0320  Lelystad  0321  Dronten  033   Amersfoort  0341  Harderwijk  0342  Barneveld  0343  Doorn  0344  Tiel 0345  Culemborg  0346  Maarssen  0347  Vianen  0348  Woerden  035   Hilversum  036   Almere  038   Zwolle  040   Eindhoven  0411  Boxtel  0412  Oss  0413  Veghel  0416  Waalwijk  0418  Zaltbommel  043   Maastricht  045   Heerlen    046   Sittard  0475  Roermond  0478  Venray  0481  Bemmel  0485  Cuijk  0486  Grave  0487  Druten  0488  Zetten  0492  Helmond 0493  Deurne  0495  Weert  0497  Eersel  0499  Best  050   Groningen 0511  Veenwouden  0512  Drachten  0513  Heerenveen  0514  Balk  0515  Sneek  0516  Oosterwolde  0517  Franeker  0518  St. Annaparochie   0519  Dokkum  0521  Steenwijk  0522  Meppel  0523  Hardenberg 0524  Coevorden  0525  Elburg  0527  Emmeloord  0528  Hoogeveen  0529  Ommen  053   Enschede  0541  Oldenzaal  0543  Winterswijk  0544  Groenlo  0545  Neede    0546  Almelo  0547  Goor  0548  Rijssen  055   Apeldoorn  0561  Wolvega  0562  Terschelling/Vlieland  0566  Irnsum  0570  Deventer 0571  Voorst  0572  Raalte  0573  Lochem  0575  Zutphen  0577  Uddel  0578  Epe  058   Leeuwarden  0591  Emmen  0592  Assen  0593  Beilen  0594  Zuidhorn  0595  Warffum  0596  Appingedam  0597  Winschoten  0598  Hoogezand-Sappemeer  0599  Stadskanaal  070   Den Haag  071   Leiden  072   Alkmaar  073   's-Hertogenbosch   074   Hengelo  075   Zaandam  076   Breda  077   Venlo  078   Dordrecht 079   Zoetermeer   The non-geographic numbers do not have a prescribed fixed number of digits, but are usually kept as short as possible. Mobile telephone numbers, however, always have 9 digits, just like geographic numbers. The non-geographical telephone number categories are, including the trunk access code: Toll-free numbers (0800) can always be dialled for free, even from (public) payphones; other numbers starting with 08 are not free. The emergency number is 112. GSM mobile phones may accept different numbers, such as 999, 000 or 911, depending on the firmware. Additionally, calls to 911 are forwarded to 112 (in the Caribbean Netherlands, this is reversed - 112 redirects to 911 in that case). Directory assistance is available from several commercial providers, on 18xx (e.g., 1888 from KPN). The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, which form the Caribbean Netherlands after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, retained the numbering plan of the Netherlands Antilles using country code +599, followed by 7, 3 or 4 for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba, respectively. Calls between the European Netherlands and Caribbean Netherlands are billed as international calls.
