  Numbers on the Irish Telephone Numbering Plan are regulated and assigned to operators by ComReg. Telephone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan that allows variations in number length. The Irish format is similar to systems used in many parts of Europe, notably the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Mobile and non-geographic numbers, however, are fixed length and do not support local dialling. Ireland uses the trunk prefix 0 to access numbers outside your local area. This is followed by an area code, referred to as an NDC (National Dialling Code.) The first digit of the NDC indicates the geographical area or type of service (e.g. mobile). Calls made from mobile phones and some VoIP systems, always require the full area code and phone number. In common with most European countries, the trunk prefix 0 must be omitted when calling Irish numbers from abroad. Irish area codes vary in length, between one and three digits (excluding the leading 0), and subscribers' numbers are between five and seven digits. A migration to a standard format, (0xx) xxx xxxx, is in progress; however, to avoid disruption, this process is only being carried out as needed where existing area codes and local numbering systems have reached full capacity. There is currently no plan to move to a closed numbering system. Irish geographical numbering is structured on a regional basis and follows a logical hierarchy. Two-digit telephone directory areas are divided into multiple area codes called NDCs (National Dialling Codes). These directory areas correspond approximately to the following geographical regions: 01 - Greater Dublin, 02 - South (Cork), 04 (North East), 05 (South East) 06 (Midwest/Southwest), 07 (Northwest), 09 (West). The midlands area is covered by several regional codes. Except for the 01 area, each area is further subdivided into smaller areas (NDCs). Usually, the main city or town in the area is 0X1. (Cork 021, Limerick 061, Galway 091 etc.)  ComReg maintains a map of area codes here. Mobile phone numbers start with the 08x prefix and is part of a closed numbering plan. This means that a mobile phone number must have 10 digits. Calls to landlines, and the like, require the area code on mobile phone. New numbers are assigned on prefixes and ranges managed by a specific operator, however, as full Mobile number portability has been in operation since 2003, it is no longer possible to reliably identify which network a particular number is on. For example, a newly assigned 3 Ireland number would begin with 083, however it may have been ported to another operator. Mobile phone numbers in Ireland have their own voicemail number. To access this, the number 5 should be put after the prefix. For example, the mobile number 08X 123 4567, its voicemail number would be 08X 5 123 4567. On some networks, when the direct to voicemail number is called, the voicemail greeting is played (e.g. Vodafone, Meteor, etc.), while others request a phone number, then the voicemail greeting is played for that number (e.g. Three Ireland). Users can press the hash key (#) to gain access to the voicemail box. Although Northern Ireland is part of the UK (+44) numbering plan, a special arrangement exists for calling Northern Ireland landlines from the Republic of Ireland. Calls to Northern Ireland can be dialled using the 048 prefix or by dialling the number in the full international format. Most Irish operators treat calls to Northern Ireland at national or even local rates. Similar charging arrangements apply when calling the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland. For example, to reach Belfast landline 90xx xxxx subscribers can dial either: 048 90xx xxxx or 00 44 28 90xx xxxx Northern Irish mobile phones use the same mobile numbering and networks as other parts of the UK — calls must be dialled using the 00 44 7xxx xxx xxx format. In common with all EU countries, the international access code is 00. Call should be dialled as follows: 00 Country Code Area code (if any) - local number Mobile phones may also use + instead of the 00 international access code. General operator assistance no longer exists in Ireland.  It used to be available by dialling 10 from within Ireland.   The emergency number for Ireland is 112, as with most European countries. 999 is also used alongside 112. Deaf or hard of hearing customers can send an SMS message to 112. Further information can be found at 112.ie.  Irish premium rate telephone numbers start with 15 and are read in two digit blocks e.g. 1550 is "fifteen fifty". The rates given below are from ComReg and are indicative only. Please check with your specific telephone service provider for exact rates. A special 50XXX code is used for free-of-charge SMS. Premium rate services in Ireland are regulated by ComReg.  Carrier preselect is normally used where the exchange automatically uses the customer's preferred provider(s). These services give you more information about your phone line (applicable only to lines provided using the OpenEir access network.) Check which carrier you are using for each category of call: Special short codes are used to control various supplementary services offered by digital local exchanges. These services were first introduced as 'PhonePlus' in 1981 on the first generation of Alcatel E10 and Ericsson AXE digital exchanges used in Ireland and were rolled out nationally throughout the 1980s.  These services are available on all Irish PSTN lines, regardless of operator. There is a more expansive range of services available, but these are the most commonly used. Different codes apply on cable telephony lines, such as those provided by Virgin Media Ireland and on  VoIP providers. When this service is active, the dial tone changes to a two-frequency 'siren' tone. Most exchanges confirm setup with a verbal announcement, however some exchanges may use a ringing tone to indicate successful service setup and a busy tone to indicate an error / invalid code. You will either hear a tone or a voice message to confirm services have been set up or deactivated. Several major number changes have occurred since 2000. The majority of Area codes in County Donegal were combined into a single area code (074) with 7-digit local numbering. While other parts of South Donegal were combined into the (071) area code (e.g. Bundoran, Rossnowlagh)   The area codes abolished were 073, 075 and 077.  All local numbers became 7-digit. Area codes in Sligo and North Leitrim were merged into the single area code 071 with 7-digit local numbering. The area codes abolished were 072, 078 and 079. All local numbers became 7-digit. Area codes in parts of Galway and Mayo were merged into a single 094 area including Castlebar, Swinford, Claremorris, Ballaghadereen, Castlerae and Ballinrobe The area codes abolished were 0907 and 092. All local numbers became 7-digit. A new area code 090 replaced four codes in the West Midlands including Athlone, Banagher North, Ballinasloe, Roscommon and Portumna. The area codes abolished were 0902, 0903, 0905 and 0509 All local numbers became 7-digit. Area codes in the East Midlands were merged into the single 046 area code including Navan, Nobber, Kells, Trim, Enfield and Edenderry. The 0405 area code was abolished. All local numbers became 7-digit. Local numbering changed from 5-digit to 7-digit local in the following area (without area code change). 044 Mullingar numbers were prefixed by 93 and Tyrrellspass numbers were prefixed by 92 and Costlepollard numbers were prefixed by 96. Numbers in Portlaoise, Birr and Tullamore were merged into a new 057 area code. The area codes abolished were 0502, 0506 and 0509'. All local numbers became 7-digit. Area codes in the southeast were merged into the single 053 area code including Wexford, Enniscorthy and Gorey. The area codes abolished were 054, 055. All local numbers became 7-digit. Local numbering changed from 5-digit to 7-digit local in the following areas (without area code change). 023 Bandon numbers beginning with 2,3,4,5,7 and 8 were prefixed by 88 while numbers beginning with 6 were prefixed by 66. '043 Longford numbers were prefixed by 33 and Granard numbers were prefixed by 66. 052 Clonmel numbers were prefixed by 61, Cahir numbers were prefixed by 74 and Killenaule numbers were prefixed by 91. 064 Killarney numbers were prefixed by 66 and Rathmore numbers were prefixed by 77. Dublin numbers are currently seven digits, but may change to eight digits in the future, although breaking the city into separate area codes would match the rest of the national system. A review and public consultation on the future of Ireland's numbering plan was undertaken.  A range of numbers from 192, 193 and 194 were once used for various Telecom Éireann customer service and account service lines. Example Belfast (01232) xxx xxx was reached by dialling: 08 01232 xxx xxx Previously Belfast could be reached by dialling 084 in place of the UK area code 0232.  Until the early 1990s, the 03 numbering range was originally used for calls to Great Britain,  including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, with the Irish prefix 030 replacing the UK trunk code 0.  Calls to British cities using the Director telephone system were also possible using shorter codes: When London was split into two area codes, 071 and 081 in 1990, 031 was replaced with the codes 03071  and 03081  respectively. Use of the 03 range for this purpose was discontinued in 1993, when the international access code changed from 16 to 00, with calls to Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) requiring the country code 44 and the area code in full.
