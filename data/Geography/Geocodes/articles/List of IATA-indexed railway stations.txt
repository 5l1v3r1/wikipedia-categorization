This is a list of IATA-indexed railway stations, which are assigned codes by the IATA, similar to IATA airport codes. Such railway stations are typically used in air-rail alliances or code sharing agreements (commonly known as "Rail Fly") between airlines and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process. Rail lines at airports include: (AIRail Service with Deutsche Bahn). The IATA codes for railway stations normally begin with Q, X or Z, except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city (several kilometers distance). A connection involving transfer between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride, a train, or a bus transfer is usually needed then.
