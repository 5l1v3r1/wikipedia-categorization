  The A565 is a road in England that is around 27.5 miles (44.3 km) long and runs from Liverpool in Merseyside to Tarleton in Lancashire. It is a primary route linking the town of Southport to Liverpool and to Preston (latterly via the connecting A59), having been designated a trunk road as part of the Trunk Roads Act 1946. The A565 starts in Liverpool at the junction with the A5052 road and A5053 road respectively, at the south end of Great Howard Street; a spur also heads southbound from this junction for 0.3 miles (0.48 km).  From Liverpool, the road follows a north-bound alignment through Bootle, Crosby and on to Formby where it passes along a bypass. After the bypass, the road heads towards Southport where it meets the A570 Scarisbrick New Road before continuing north-east through Banks and into Lancashire, ultimately reaching Tarleton where it meets and becomes the A59 road.  Much of the present day A565 route from Liverpool to Thornton is unchanged since the Victorian age.  A bypass of Formby, now forming part of the A565 was constructed during 1936-1937 at an estimated cost of £200,000 (equivalent to £12,471,118 in 2016).  The A565 route was included in the 1946 Trunk Roads Act, designated in its route from Bootle through to Tarleton.  A bypass of Thornton, Merseyside, known as the A5758 Broom's Cross Road, was constructed during 2014-2015, linking the A565 at Thornton with Switch Island junction, having been planned since the 1970s.  Liverpool City Council announced in 2016 that they had appointed a construction company to create a new dual-carriageway road in Liverpool, involving the widening of Great Howard Street and Derby Road, a 1.7 miles (2.7 km) stretch, at an expected cost of £18million,  which had risen to £22million by the time the work started in May 2017.  The council deemed the works necessary given the road would be a vital route for freight traffic to and from the Liverpool2 deep water container terminal, in addition to an associated tunnel and bridge which required replacement, having failed a structural assessment.
