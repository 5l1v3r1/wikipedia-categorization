The 5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA is a Canadian Army Reserve artillery regiment based at the Bay Street Armoury in Victoria, British Columbia. It is part of the 3rd Canadian Division's 39 Canadian Brigade Group. Although having served for nearly sixty years as a field artillery unit, the early history of the regiment is inextricably intertwined with the defences of the naval base at Esquimalt. The regiment is currently equipped with C3 towed 105mm gun-howitzers. The regiment's museum is located in the Bay Street Armoury and is open to the public on Tuesday evenings.  55 and 56 Batteries were redesignated as 155 and 156 Batteries on 21 May 2016.
