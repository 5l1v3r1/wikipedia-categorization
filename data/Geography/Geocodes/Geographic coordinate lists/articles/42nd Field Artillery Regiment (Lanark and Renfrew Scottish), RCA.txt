It is part of the 4th Canadian Division's 33 Canadian Brigade Group. The regiment did not initially mobilize for the Second World War during the general activation of units beginning in August 1939.  In July 1944, the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division perceived it was deficient in infantry. The 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade was created out of units already in existence.  One unit of the new brigade was the Motor battalion of the division, a second was a re-equipped reconnaissance battalion from the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, and a third unit was created from anti-aircraft assets, no longer required due to Allied aerial superiority.

The regiment is affiliated with two Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps:
