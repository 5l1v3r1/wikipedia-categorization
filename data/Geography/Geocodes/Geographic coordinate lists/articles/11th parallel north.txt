The 11th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 11 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Africa, the Indian Ocean, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, Central America, South America and the Atlantic Ocean. At this latitude the sun is visible for 12 hours, 46 minutes during the summer solstice and 11 hours, 29 minutes during the winter solstice.  In Thailand, a 1966 cabinet resolution restricts the rights of non-Thai companies to conduct mineral exploration or mining operations north of this parallel.  Starting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 11Â° north passes through: The border between Ghana and what was then French Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) was fixed by treaty between the French and British at the Conference of Paris in 1898, to be the 11th parallel.  The border does not follow the boundary exactly, but follows it approximately, crossing over it several times.
