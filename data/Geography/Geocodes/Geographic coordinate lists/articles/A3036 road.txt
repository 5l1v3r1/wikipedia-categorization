  The A3036 is an A road in London, England. It starts at the southern tip of the County Hall roundabout (51°30′01″N 0°07′00″W﻿ / ﻿51.5003°N 0.1168°W﻿ / 51.5003; -0.1168﻿ (A3036 road (northeastern end))), where the A302 Westminster Bridge, York Road and A23 Westminster Bridge Road all intersect. This stretch of the route is called Lambeth Palace Road and heads southwest, past St Thomas' Hospital and the Palace itself, at the roundabout junction with the A3203 at Lambeth Bridge, where it runs along the south side of the Thames. After this, the road is called Albert Embankment and continues to run alongside the river, until it passes the MI6 headquarters at the major junction known as Vauxhall Cross, where the A202 Vauxhall Bridge, Durham Street and Harleyford Road, the A203 South Lambeth Road, and the A3205 Nine Elms Lane all converge. From Vauxhall, the route is then called Wandsworth Road until it crosses the A3216 Queenstown Road / Cedars Road junction in Battersea. At that point the street name changes to Lavender Hill, continuing until Clapham Junction. The A3 follows roughly the same southwesterly course as this route and after St John's Hill, Clapham Junction, the two routes merge at the Wandsworth one-way system (51°27′35″N 0°10′48″W﻿ / ﻿51.4596°N 0.1799°W﻿ / 51.4596; -0.1799﻿ (A3036 road (southwestern end))), where the road continues as the A3.
