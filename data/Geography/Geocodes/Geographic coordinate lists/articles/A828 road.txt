  The A828 road is a primary route along the western coast of Scotland At its northern end the A828 meets the A82 at South Ballachulish and it runs to a junction with the A85 at Connel; the total length being some 26 miles (42 km). It passes through Highland and Argyll and Bute council areas. The area it runs through, the Appin, is remote and this is evidenced by the fact that the only other numbered road it has a junction with is the minor B845.
