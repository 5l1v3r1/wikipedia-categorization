  The A6003 is an A-class road in England, linking Kettering in Northamptonshire with Corby and Oakham, the latter in Rutland. The road briefly enters Leicestershire between the villages of Rockingham and Caldecott. The road forms the principal link between Corby and the rest of Northamptonshire, as well as between Rutland and Northamptonshire. The entire length of the road is 21 miles (34 km). The road starts at junction 10 of the A14, heading past Wicksteed Park and into Kettering. Through the town it is a single carriageway until crossing the A43 at a signal-controlled roundabout. From here it passes an industrial development and heads north towards Corby. The stretch between the A43 and the A6014 road in Corby is the only length of dual carriageway on the route. As at July 2012 a bypass is under construction from Barford Bridge on the A6003 to the A43 west of Stanion to relieve the traffic on the single carriageway passing through Geddington on the A43.   Skirting the edge of Corby, the road passes the Eyebrook Reservoir before crossing the A47 at a roundabout at Uppingham. North of here it passes Rutland Water before arriving at Oakham, where a new bypass has been constructed. Coordinates: 52°32′11″N 0°43′22″W﻿ / ﻿52.5364°N 0.7228°W﻿ / 52.5364; -0.7228﻿ (A6003 road)
