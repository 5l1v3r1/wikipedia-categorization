  The A194 road is a road in Tyne and Wear, England. It runs northeast from its start at junction 65 of the A1(M) near Washington, and the first 3 miles (4.8 km) are motorway standard, designated the A194(M). There are intermediate junctions with the A182 and the A195 before the motorway section ends at the A184 junction. The junctions were unnumbered until 2013 when they were designated J1 to J3. The A194 continues as a trunk road to its next major junction, the A19 which provides access to the Tyne Tunnel, Sunderland and Teesside.  At this point, A194 ceases to be a trunk road and continues to its terminus in South Shields town centre. Coordinates: 54°57′15″N 1°30′06″W﻿ / ﻿54.9542°N 1.5017°W﻿ / 54.9542; -1.5017﻿ (A194 road)
