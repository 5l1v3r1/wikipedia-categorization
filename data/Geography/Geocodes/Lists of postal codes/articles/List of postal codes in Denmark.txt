Postal codes (Danish: postnumre) in Denmark are 4-digit codes. They were implemented in 1967, and were based on the territorial divisions of towns and municipalities at the time. The postal codes 1000-1999 are each assigned to individual streets and large mail recipients, such as companies, organizations or public administrations. Not included in this list are postal codes for postal service centres and bulk mail receivers, the latter using the postal codes 0800-0990 (a more elaborate list can be found on the Danish entry 'Danske postnumre'). Greenland has postal codes in the same series (3900-3999) while the Faroes do not.
