The postal codes in the Faroe Islands by the postal service Postverk Føroya use the country's code FO, e.g. FO 927 Akrar.  In the Faroese language, names of locations are inflected and can stand in dative on addresses, like: FO 927 Økrum (Akrar means acres; if someone lives "in the acres", he is living in whom? - thus dative). However, this is not relevant for letters from abroad, but may be interesting for philatelists.
