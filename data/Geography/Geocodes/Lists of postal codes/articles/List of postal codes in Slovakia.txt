Slovak Post (Slovenská pošta) in 2006 offered a service for the lookup of postal codes (poštové smerové číslo PSČ) in Slovakia. The service works in both Slovak and English. The Post offers the ability to search postal codes of towns and streets (see the list below of towns where a street code is needed) or to search by town and company name. Furthermore, the list of postcodes is available as a ZIP file. Postal codes need to be written before the name of the town, and no shortening of the official state name (e.g. 'SK') is permitted.
