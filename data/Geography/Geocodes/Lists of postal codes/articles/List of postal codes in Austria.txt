Postal codes in Austria consist of four digits. They were introduced on 1 January 1966. Each code denotes a post office of the Österreichische Post company. The first digit identifies a geographic delivery area within Austria. The second identifies a routing area. The third defines the route the mail takes either with the car/truck or with the train. The fourth stands for the post office outlet in the routing city. The geographic delivery area sometimes coincides with the state, as shown in the table below. There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, the market town of Weyer has a postal code of 3335, but is situated in Upper Austria and not in Lower Austria, as the postal code would suggest. However, it is served from a Lower Austrian mail distribution centre. The Styrian village of Tauchen am Wechsel, part of the Pinggau municipality has the Burgenlandian post code 7421, as in the 1966 introduction it was confused with Tauchen near Mariasdorf. In the Austrian capital Vienna, the second and third digit describe the district within the city (i.e. 1100: 10th district – Favoriten). The Vienna International Airport, officially located in Schwechat, Lower Austria has its own postal code 1300; the Vienna International Centre (UNO City) in the Vienna Donaustadt district has the postal code 1400. The post code 1500 is used for military mail by the peacekeeping units of the Austrian Armed Forces. The municipalities of Mittelberg in Kleinwalsertal, Vorarlberg, and Jungholz, Tyrol have both Austrian and German postal codes, as they are served by the Deutsche Post company. 20xx-24xx
