 There is presently no postal code system in Namibia, although one is under consideration, which would use five-digit numeric codes.  Before independence in 1990, when the country was under South African administration, it formed part of that country's post code system, but following independence, use of post codes was discontinued.  South West Africa, including the enclave of Walvis Bay, was allocated the number range 9000â€“9299.   However, the code 9000 was commonly used for all addresses for mail from or via South Africa.  Walvis Bay remained under South African administration until 1994.
