Postal codes in Germany, Postleitzahl (plural Postleitzahlen, abbreviated to PLZ; literally "postal routing number"), since 1 July 1993 consist of five digits. The first two digits indicate the wider area, the last three digits the postal district. Before reunification, both the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) used four-digit codes. Under a transitional arrangement following reunification, between 1989 and 1993 postal codes in the west were prefixed with 'W', e.g.: W-1000 [Berlin] 30 (postal districts in western cities were separate from the postal code) and those in the east with 'O' (for Ost), e.g.: O-1xxx Berlin. City administrations and postal customers with high mail volumes, or Gro√ükunden have their own postal codes, separate from those used for postal districts or PO Box number ranges. Postal regions do not necessarily follow state boundaries, so sorting by state is not practical. The postal regions and some postal codes are: The 5-digit postal codes were established on July 1, 1993.  The region 25 covers all of Schleswig-Holstein's westcoast from Hamburg to the Danish border. All mail from, to and within this region is handled by the postal distribution center in Elmshorn. These postal codes were used until 1993 (The ending zeroes were often omitted, e.g., 2 Hamburg XX or 28 Bremen XX): Berlin (West) 3000-3099 3100-3199 3200-3299 3300-3399 3400-3499 4500-4599 4000-4099 4100-4199 4200-4299 4300-4399 4400-4499 4500-4599 4600-4699 4700-4799 4800-4899 4900-4999 5000-5099 5100-5199 5200 5300 5600-5699 5800-5899 5900-5999 5400-5499 5500-5599 6500-6599 6700-6799 3500-3599 6000-6099 6100-6199 6200-6299 6300-6399 6400-6499 6500-6599 6800-6899 6900-6999 6800-6899 6900-6999 7000-7099 7100-7199 7200-7299 7300-7399 7400-7499 7500-7599 7600-7699 7700-7799 7800-7899 7900-7999 7900-7999 8000-8099 8100-8199 8200-8299 8300-8399 8400-8499 8500-8599 8600-8699 8700-8799 8800-8899 8900-8999
