 Post Codes were introduced in South Africa on 8 October 1973, with the introduction of automated sorting.  South African post codes consist of four digits. Mail may be delivered either to the physical address or to a PO Box, particularly in rural areas where no street delivery is available. In addition, many large organisations may use Private Bag addresses, with mail dispatched to the holder by a mail contractor. In the case of cities and large towns, however, the last two digits of the postcode indicate the mode of delivery.  The digits "01" indicate a street address and "00" a PO Box or Private Bag address, with addresses in Port Elizabeth, for example, using the following format:  In Pretoria, however, a different format is used, with "02" indicating a street address, and "01" indicating a PO Box or Private Bag address.  A feature of South African postal addresses, also common to Australia, is that it is only necessary to include the suburb, not the city, for example, in the case of Yeoville in Johannesburg:  The South African post code system was previously used in Namibia, then "South West Africa", including the enclave of Walvis Bay, which remained part of South Africa until 1994. It was allocated the number range 9000–9299.   Following independence, use of the South African postcode system was discontinued.  Post code boundaries do not follow provincial borders exactly, especially since the re–organisation of provinces in 1994.
