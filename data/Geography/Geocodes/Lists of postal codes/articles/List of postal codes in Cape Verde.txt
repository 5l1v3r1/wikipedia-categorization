Postal codes in Cape Verde are a four digit number, where the first digit corresponds to the island and the first two digits correspond to the Concelho (county/municipality), as illustrated by the table below.  The postal code numbers start with 1xxx and ends with 9xxxx, it starts in Santo Ant√£o eastward to Sal, then southward to Maio and westward to Brava.  As with several countries, the postal code number does not start in an area or an island with the capital city.
