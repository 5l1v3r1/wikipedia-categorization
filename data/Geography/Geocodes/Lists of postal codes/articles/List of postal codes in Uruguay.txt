Uruguay postal codes are 5-digit numeric codes. The first two digits of each code correspond to a department— Uruguay's internal administrative divisions—unless the first digit is 1, which corresponds to the capital, Montevideo. The zones so determined are called Zonas Postales. The remaining digits of the code are either zeros for the capital of the department or the city of Montevideo as a whole, or else take specific values for other cities in the department or for local zones in Montevideo. The following list shows the postal codes for the capitals of each department. Names of capitals differing from those of the departments are shown in parentheses. Postal Codes of the Department Capitals See El Correo de Uruguay - Códigos Postales for postal zone maps, lists of codes for municipalities (organized by department), and a lookup tool.
