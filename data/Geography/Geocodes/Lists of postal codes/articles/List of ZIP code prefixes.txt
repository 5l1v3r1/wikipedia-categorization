This is a list of ZIP code prefixes.  Each cell in this table contains a three-digit ZIP code prefix, the state where that ZIP code prefix is located, and the name of the United States Postal Service (USPS) Sectional Center Facility (SCF) that serves that ZIP code prefix, which may be in a different state. Each SCF may serve more than one three-digit ZIP code prefix. Each SCF serves local addresses whose five-digit ZIP codes start with the same set of prefixes.
