Serbian postal codes consist of five digits. The first two digits roughly correspond to the corresponding district; district seat cities usually have 000 as the last three digits, while smaller towns and villages have non-round last three digits. According to http://www.posta.rs/AdresniKod/Adresovanje_eng.asp, since 1 January 2005 a six-digit postcode format has been introduced.
