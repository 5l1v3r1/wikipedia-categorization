Defence Geospatial Information Working Group, formerly Digital Geographic Information Working Group, (DGIWG, pronounced Dee Gee Wig) is an organization of member nations working for interoperability standards for geographic data exchange between various military systems and Geographic information system in general.  The organization  has a number of member nations mostly within NATO.  The DIGEST standard is a product of DGIWG.  This standard is related to a number of other international standards and form a model for exchange of Geographic Information.  After the revision 2.1 of DIGEST, released in September 2000, the DGIWG has discontinued work on the standard and is currently focusing of incorporating its standards as profiles in   ISO/TC 211.  DGIWG was formerly known as Digital Geographic Information Working Group, but changed its name at the DGIWG conference in 2008.
