Location-allocation refers to algorithms used primarily in a geographic information system to determine an optimal location for one or more facilities that will service demand from a given set of points.  Algorithms can assign those demand points to one or more facilities, taking into account factors such as the number of facilities available, their cost, and the maximum impedance from a facility to a point.
