Geary's C is a measure of spatial autocorrelation or an attempt to determine if adjacent observations of the same phenomenon are correlated. Spatial autocorrelation is more complex than autocorrelation because the correlation is multi-dimensional and bi-directional. Geary's C is defined as where                         N                 {\displaystyle N}     is the number of spatial units indexed by                         i                 {\displaystyle i}     and                         j                 {\displaystyle j}    ;                         x                 {\displaystyle x}     is the variable of interest;                                                                x               Â¯                                                  {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}     is the mean of                         x                 {\displaystyle x}    ;                                    w                        i             j                                     {\displaystyle w_{ij}}     is a matrix of spatial weights with zeroes on the diagonal (i.e.,                                    w                        i             i                             =         0                 {\displaystyle w_{ii}=0}    ); and                         W                 {\displaystyle W}     is the sum of all                                    w                        i             j                                     {\displaystyle w_{ij}}    . The value of Geary's C lies between 0 and some unspecified value greater than 1. Values significantly lower than 1 demonstrate increasing positive spatial autocorrelation, whilst values significantly higher than 1 illustrate increasing negative spatial autocorrelation. Geary's C is inversely related to Moran's I, but it is not identical. Moran's I is a measure of global spatial autocorrelation, while Geary's C is more sensitive to local spatial autocorrelation. Geary's C is also known as Geary's contiguity ratio or simply Geary's ratio.  This statistic was developed by Roy C. Geary.
