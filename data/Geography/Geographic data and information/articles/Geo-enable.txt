Geo-Enable is a neologism, a portmanteau of Geospatial or Geographic and Enablement. Associated words include Geo-Enablment and Geo-Enabling. As a verb it is increasingly used in the fields of Geographic Information System (GIS), Web Development, Mobility, Information Management (IM) and IT. Similar to the terms 'Web-Enabled' or 'GPS-Enabled' - 'Geo-Enable' suggests the application of location or geospatial information as part of business processes or using 'location intelligence' to augment non-spatial information systems and/or Business Intelligence (BI). Geospatial Enablement can be thought of as the integrated use of Geographic Information, as opposed to using Geographic Information within a geographic and technology-centric environment of something such as a GPS or GIS. A definition given by GeoEnable Ltd is: 'Geo-Enablement n.: 1. Embedding and leveraging the power of location and geography within workflows and business processes. 2. The act of deriving and utilising geography within non-spatial information. 3. The state of being enabled using location information.'   Another definition by the US Government is: 'To geo-enable is to apply geospatial capabilities to a business process in order to establish the authoritative spatial location of business data, and enable contextual spatial analysis.'
