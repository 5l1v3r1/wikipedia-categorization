3D Wayfinder is an indoor wayfinding software and service used to help visitors to navigate in large public buildings (shopping centers, airports, train stations, hospitals, universities etc.) 3D Wayfinder uses a 3D floor plans of a building and renders it in real-time. It displays interactive information layers. Software can be used on interactive kiosks or as a mobile application. 3D Wayfinder enables users to visualize the shortest path from users' position to searched location. At the same time users can zoom, rotate and change floors of building's 3D map. All the existing objects - like escalators, doors, elevators, trees, stairs etc. can be included on the 3D floorplan. Displayed floor plans can be switched and usually the roof of the building is also included on the 3D model of the building to provide better understanding of the building and map direction. 3D Wayfinder is using JavaScript and the WebGL-based FRAK (engine) developed by 3D Technologies R&D. The 3D Wayfinder application can be embedded easily to the users website. It works with most common web browsers (Mozilla, IE, Safari etc.) under Windows, Linux and Mac. 3D Wayfinder is also a channel for communicating with customers. It is possible to add three types of advertisements: 3D Wayfinder application is used by many shopping malls around Europe to guide visitors and keep tenant information up to date.
