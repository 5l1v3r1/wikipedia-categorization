Prior to that time, the Army and Royal Navy had different intelligence units that were independent of each other. The ISTD was established at <a href=\"/wiki/Manchester_College,_Oxford\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Manchester College, Oxford\">Manchester College, Oxford</a>. Working together with members of each arm and the Allies, this unit was able to bring together zero-elevation <a href=\"/wiki/Aerial_photography\" title=\"Aerial photography\">aerial photography</a>, which is phototgraphy taken as close to the wave tops as possible, in order to bring the views of the beach landscape, which were then made into continuous horizontal strip photographs. These files were marked with military targets such as bridges, <a href=\"/wiki/Marshalling_yard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marshalling yard\">marshalling yards</a> and the like, and up-to-date photos and intelligence were used to up date obsolete maps. From these new maps, and from older maps, magazine illustrations, and old family photographs taken on holiday collected from the public, new maps could be produced for the planning staffs and operations forces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Departmental_actions_and_publications\">Departmental actions and publications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Inter-Services_Topographic_Department&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Departmental actions and publications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>\"Inadequate topographic intelligence could result in troops encountering impenetrable terrain, amphibious assaults landing on impassable beaches, or airborne assaults dropping into water. The U.S. Army's plan to provide photographic mapping support to advancing troops illustrates topographical intelligence's importance to the Western Allies. Further, the British developed the Inter-Service Topographic Department (ISTD) in October 1940.  The ISTD responded to the British topographical intelligence shortage before the April 1940 German invasion of Norway. In fact, the paucity of topographical intelligence on Norway resulted in Royal Air Force Bomber Command pilots relying on 1912 revised <a href=\"/wiki/Baedeker\" title=\"Baedeker\">Baedeker</a>'s guides\u2014commonly used by foreign travelers\u2014 for navigation when attacking airfields in Norway. This lack of intelligence also caused Royal Navy carrier pilots to rely on contourless <a href=\"/wiki/Admiralty_chart\" title=\"Admiralty chart\">Admiralty charts</a> during their attack on <a href=\"/wiki/Narvik\" title=\"Narvik\">Narvik</a>'s port.  Later, the topographical intelligence produced by the ISTD proved invaluable to the Royal Navy midget submarine attack and the Royal Navy torpedo aircraft attack during September 1942 and late 1944, respectively, on the <a href=\"/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz\" title=\"German battleship Tirpitz\">German battleship Tirpitz</a> based in Norway. It was also invaluable during the November 1942 Allied North African landings, and the <a href=\"/wiki/St._Nazaire\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St. Nazaire\">St. Nazaire</a> commando raid in March 1942.  In tribute to the ISTD's effectiveness, the department received compliments from General <a href=\"/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" title=\"Dwight D. Eisenhower\">Dwight D.

It relied in large measure upon the Museum and Library organization for the provisions of the geological information incorporated into the reports, such information being written up by the Museum staff or by the staff of the I.S.T.D. from bibliographies, maps and texts supplied to its Library Liaison Service from the Museum. The work was of a highly confidential character but, in special circumstances, of great importance and interest, and it is now permissible to state that the Museum and Library staffs provided information relating to every considerable military operation in Africa and Europe from the first landings in North Africa. Of special significance, not always apparent at the time that they were supplied, are the reports of North Africa and other Mediterranean territories in 1942; on <a href=\"/wiki/Yugoslavia\" title=\"Yugoslavia\">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Crete\" title=\"Crete\">Crete</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Dodecanese\" title=\"Dodecanese\">Dodecanese</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=M%C3%B6hne_Valley&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"M\u00f6hne Valley (page does not exist)\">M\u00f6hne Valley</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Lampedusa\" title=\"Lampedusa\">Lampedusa</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pantelleria\" title=\"Pantelleria\">Pantelleria</a>, the geology of certain <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Alpine_tunnel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Alpine tunnel (page does not exist)\">Alpine tunnels</a>, and various regions of the Far East in 1943; and those on the <a href=\"/wiki/Flying_bomb\" title=\"Flying bomb\">flying bomb</a> sites in France in 1944.

Abstract: Between November 1943 and May 1946, geologists assisted the Inter-Service Topographical Department (ISTD) to prepare reports and maps to guide planning of British military operations in Europe and the Far East. Early reports were illustrated by pre-war geological maps reprinted by the Geographical Section, General Staff, (GSGS), later reports by new simplified geological maps, usually accompanied by one or more thematic maps. An airfield suitability map for Bulgaria and soils maps for both the Middle Danube region (Hungary) and Austria were printed as part of the GSGS Miscellaneous map series, and groundwater and soils maps prepared as tracing overlays for use with topographical maps for parts of Germany. Simplified geological maps were prepared by ISTD and printed by GSGS for Sumatra, Borneo, Formosa, the Kra Isthmus region of the Burma/Thailand peninsula, Siam (Thailand) and Indo-China, Java, Hainan, and the Hong Kong to Canton region of China. These were mostly at a scale of 1:1000 000 but in varying styles, to innovatively indicate terrain features of specific military significance. Airfield suitability maps were printed at scales between 1:250 000 and 1:1000 000 for many of these regions, based on ground features and predicted soil permeability. All these specialist maps were printed in small numbers, and few copies have survived the war \u2013 notably in the British Library, the National Archives, or the library of the Royal Geographical Society. The ISTD Geological Section constituted the larger of only two teams of British military geologists to be established in either World War, exercising a role in military intelligence that is seldom acknowledged. <a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number\" title=\"International Standard Serial Number\">ISSN</a>&#160;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/search?fq=x0:jrnl&amp;q=n2:0008-7041\">0008-7041</a>.</li>\n<li>Farrington, J.L., 1946, History of the Geological Section Inter Services Topographical Department October 1943 - June 1946. ii + 41 pages, appendix 4 pages.
