Satellite formation flying is the concept that multiple satellites can work together in a group to accomplish the objective of one larger, usually more expensive, satellite.   Coordinating smaller satellites has many benefits over single satellites including simpler designs, faster build times, cheaper replacement creating higher redundancy, unprecedented high resolution, and the ability to view research targets from multiple angles or at multiple times.  These qualities make them ideal for astronomy, communications, meteorology, and environmental uses.  Depending on the application, there are three formations possible: trailing, cluster, and constellation.      Usually, these formations are made up of numerous small satellites.  A micro satellite weighs under 100 kg and a nano satellite weighs under 10 kg.  Magnetosheric Constellation, for instance, would be composed of 100 micro satellites.(see  ) This technology has become more viable thanks to the development of autonomous flying.  With an onboard computer and this algorithm, satellites may autonomously position themselves into a formation.  Previously, ground control would have to adjust each satellite to maintain formations.  Now, satellites may arrive at and maintain formations with faster response time and have the ability to change the formation for varied resolution of observations.  Also, satellites may be launched from different spacecraft and rendezvous on a particular path.  This advance was made possible by Dave Folta, John Bristow, and Dave Quinn at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).
