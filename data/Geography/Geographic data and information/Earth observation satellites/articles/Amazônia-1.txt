The Amazônia-1 satellite (or SSR-1), scheduled to launch in 2020,   is the first earth observation satellite entirely developed by Brazil.  Operations will be joint with the CBERS-4 satellite.  In the early 90s, the design of SSR satellites, Amazônia-1 precursor, was revised and INPE technicians proposed replacing the polar orbit by an equatorial orbit, and this proposal was accepted. That made sense at that time as Brazil already had coverage by polar orbit with the CBERS satellites. The SSR-1 of the project suffered several delays start, either by lack of resources, whether by barriers in the disputes of the bids. The effective start, only occurred in 2001 when a contract was signed for the development of multi-mission platform specifically (at the time) for this purpose. In 2001, a joint study between the INPE and DLR was published, found that most of the SSR-1 requirements can be met by two sensors: the Camera VIS / NIR and other MIR   However, with the publication PNAE review in 2005, the SSR-1 ceased to be a priority. Between September and October 2012, a structural model of the Amazônia-1 satellite was subjected to a series of vibration test.  In the latest review of the PNAE, published in January 2013, the Amazônia-1 resurfaced with this name, and even successors planned (Amazon-1B in 2017 and Amazon-2 in 2018), however, remains the intention of use in orbit polar and the release dates of these satellites can not be maintained. A delay of two years, at least, already exists in the Amazônia-1 schedule.   The satellite was originally supposed to be launch on a VLS-1, but the program was cancelled. Currently, the project managers are evaluating other alternatives such as the Vega from Arianespace, the Minotaur-C from Orbital ATK and the Russian Dnepr.  The current design features are as follows: The Amazônia - 2 satellite is planned for launch in 2018 to replace its predecessor.
