The earth is constantly being monitored by a great number satellites operating in the earth exploration-satellite service (EESS) or space research service (SRS). These artificial satellites have onboard space radio stations from which they gather data. The data is transmitted back to earth via feeder links. This article lists a number of current active Earth observation satellites and their downlink transmission frequencies.
