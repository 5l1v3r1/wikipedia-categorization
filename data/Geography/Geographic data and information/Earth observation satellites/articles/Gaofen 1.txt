Gaofen-1 (Chinese: 高分一号; pinyin: Gāofēn Yī hào) is a high resolution Chinese Earth observation satellite. Gaofen-1 was launched on April 26, 2013 at 4:13 UTC with a Long March 2D carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center along with the three small experimental satellites: Turksat 3USat (Turkey), CubeBug-1 (Argentina) and NEE-01 Pegaso (Ecuador) in a sun-synchronous orbit.  The civilian HDEOS (High-Definition Earth Observation Satellite) program was proposed in 2006 and received approval in 2010. Gaofen-1 is the first of six planned HDEOS spacecraft to be launched between 2013 and 2016. The satellite's primary goal is to provide NRT (Near-Real-Time) observations for disaster prevention and relief, climate change monitoring, geographical mapping, environmental and resource surveying, as well as precision agriculture support.
