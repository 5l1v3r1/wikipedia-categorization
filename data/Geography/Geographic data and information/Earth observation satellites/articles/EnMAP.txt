EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) is a German hyperspectral satellite mission providing high accuracy hyperspectral image data of the Earth surface on a timely and frequent basis. Under the scientific lead of the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) the mission is managed by the Space Agency of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The Hyperspectral Imager (HSI) will be developed by OHB-System AG which is also responsible for the development of the satellite bus. The ground segment will be developed and operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The envisaged launch of the EnMAP satellite is 2020 using the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle  of Indian space agency ISRO. EnMAP records data via a sun-synchronous orbit at a height of 653 km above the Earth. The satellite provides a high resolution hyperspectral imager capable of resolving 230 spectral bands from 420 to 2450 nm with a ground resolution of 30 m x 30 m. The swath width amounts to 30 km at a maximum swath length of up to 5000 km a day. The off-nadir (+/- 30°) pointing feature enables fast target revisit of 4 days. EnMAP is designed to record bio-physical, bio-chemical and geo-chemical variables on a global basis and thus, to increase our understanding of biospheric /geospheric processes and to ensure the sustainability of our resources.
