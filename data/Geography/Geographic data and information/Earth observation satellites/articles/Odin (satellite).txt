Odin is a Swedish satellite working in two disciplines: astrophysics and aeronomy, and it was named after Odin of Norse mythology. Within the field of astrophysics, Odin was used until the spring of 2007 aiding in the study of star formation. Odin is still used for aeronomical observations, including exploration of the depletion of the ozone layer and effects of global warming. In February 2016 it celebrated 15 years in Earth orbit, and was still functioning nominally.   The main instrument on Odin is a radiometer using a 1.1 m telescope, designed to be used for both the astronomy and aeronomy missions. The radiometer works at 486–580 GHz and at 119 GHz. The second instrument on board is the OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System).  Odin was developed by the Space Systems Division of Swedish Space Corporation (now OHB Sweden) as part of an international project involving the space agencies of Sweden (SNSB), Finland (TEKES), Canada (CSA) and France (CNES). Odin was launched on a START-1 rocket on February 20, 2001 from Svobodny, Russia.  In April 2007, astronomers announced that Odin had made the first ever detection of molecular oxygen (O2) in interstellar clouds.   The spacecraft was still functioning nominally in 2010.  It continued to function and as of February 20, 2016, was still functioning nominally.  International partners:  Agencies or organizations involved in Odin:  Objectives:  Examples:
