CleanSeaNet is a satellite-based monitoring system for marine oil spill detection and surveillance in European waters.  The service is maintained by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and provides a range of detailed information including oil spill alerts to Member States, rapid delivery of available satellite images and oil slick position. The legal basis for the CleanSeaNet service is Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties, including criminal penalties, for pollution offences (as amended by Directive 2009/123/EC). EMSA has been tasked to 'work with the Member States in developing technical solutions and providing technical assistance in relation to the implementation of this Directive, in actions such as tracing discharges by satellite monitoring and surveillance'.
