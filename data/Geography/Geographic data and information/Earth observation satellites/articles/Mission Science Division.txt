The Earth and Mission Science Division is a group of ESA mission scientists, research fellows, young graduates, contractors and administrative staff working at the European Space Agency (ESA) within the Science, Applications and Climate Department of the Directorate of Earth Observation Programmes. The Division is located at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, South Holland, The Netherlands. The Earth and Mission Science Division (MSD) supports the preparation, development and operations of research and operational missions within the Earth Observation Programmes Directorate. The Division is responsible for ensuring the application of scientific and other user community requirements in all phases of the development of Earth Observation missions, from precursor studies through to in-orbit satellite operations, and for ensuring coherence throughout with the objectives expressed in the mission requirements documents, including the management of mission-, instrument-specific, or ad-hoc advisory structures (as required). In support of the preparation of new mission concepts, or development and operations of each ESA approved Earth Observation mission, the Division conceives, initiates and conducts supporting scientific studies (in house and external) to ensure that the mission is "fit for purpose". In addition, the Division organises, coordinates and executes Campaigns for the purpose of acquiring airborne, balloon-borne, or in-situ data. Campaigns are specifically designed in support of technology or mission concept development, mission development, data simulation, and instrument calibration or product validation purposes. Campaign data are distributed publicly. The Mission Science Division management team are: The Mission Science Division has prepared and contributed to the approval of eight ESA Earth Explorers  , with two new mission candidates to be selected from proposals resulting from a 2016 call for the ninth Earth Explorer mission, namely: A Call for proposals for new Earth Explorer mission (EE-9) concepts released in November 2015   resulted in no candidate being selected, and a revised Call for proposals was released in December 2016  . Two competing candidates were selected for Phase A/B1 study in November 2017: The Division currently supports the development of seven series of approved Copernicus Programme Sentinel Missions as part of the Space Component of the joint EC/ESA Copernicus initiative. It has supported the development of MetOp, and is currently active in supporting the preparation of MetOp Second Generation. The Division also presently supports the development of several instruments out of the 10 instrument payload of the approved series of second generation MetOp satellites. The MetOp-SG series is developed in cooperation with EUMETSAT, as part of the EUMETSAT Polar System â€“ Second Generation initiative. EPS-SG represents Europe's contribution to the future Joint Polar System (JPS). For more information, see
