STSAT-2C, or Science and Technology Satellite 2C, or Naro Science Satellite(ko:나로과학위성) is a South Korean satellite which was launched in 2013. It is operated by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, and is intended to demonstrate technology for future spacecraft. The satellite has a mass of 100 kilograms (220 lb), and is expected to operate for less than a year.   STSAT-2C was launched at 07:00 UTC on 30 January 2013, on the third flight of the Naro-1 carrier rocket, with a Russian first stage derived from the Angara and a South Korean second stage.  Liftoff occurred from the Naro Space Centre, and the rocket successfully deployed the satellite into at 292-by-1,511-kilometre (181 by 939 mi) low Earth orbit inclined at 80.3 degrees. The launch marked the first successful flight of the Naro-1, which had previously failed to launch STSAT-2A in 2009 and STSAT-2B in 2010.
