Blacksky Pathfinder-1 is an earth imaging satellite of Spaceflight Industries.  The satellite is equipped with payloads from Harris Corporation designed to image an area approximately 4.4km x 6.6km at 1-meter resolution.  This is first in a series of 60 satellites planned to deploy the BlackSky constellation that will provide near real-time images in about 90 minutes to produce images that are more current and wide-ranging to increase global transparency.  The satellite was launched on 26 September 2016 by ISRO using the PSLV-C35 rocket.
