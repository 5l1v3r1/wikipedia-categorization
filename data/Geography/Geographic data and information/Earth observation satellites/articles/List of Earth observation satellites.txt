Partial list of Earth observation satellites by series/program. The invention of climate research through the use of satellite remote telemetry began in the 1960s through development of space probes to study other planets. During the U.S. economic decline in 1977, with much of NASA's money going toward the Shuttle program, the Reagan Administration proposed to reduce spending on planetary exploration. During this time, new scientific evidence emerged from ice and sediment cores that Earth's climate had experienced rapid changes in temperature, running contrary to the previously held belief that the climate changed on a geological time scale.  These changes increased political interest in gathering remote-sensing data on the Earth itself and stimulated the science of climatology.  17 Satellites, 4 in operation 10 Satellites 5 in operation.  successor to planned National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program 11 Geostationary Weather Satellites, 5 in operation: 2 Polar Orbiting Weather Satellites, all in operation:
