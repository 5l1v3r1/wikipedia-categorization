Kuodi Zhi (Chinese: 括地志), translated as Comprehensive Gazetteer or Comprehensive Land Records, is an early Tang dynasty survey of Tang China's geography and administrative divisions. It was compiled by Li Tai, Prince of Wei, a son of Emperor Taizong, with the help of imperial scholars including Xiao Deyan (蕭德言). It was completed in 641/642 AD.    The original work comprised 555 volumes, but most have been lost.  During the Qing dynasty, scholar Sun Xingyan (1753–1818) published the 8-volume book Kuodi Zhi jiben (括地志輯本), a collection of the surviving fragments . In 1974, Wang Hui (王恢) published a revised and expanded version of Sun's work entitled Kuodi Zhi xinji (括地志新輯). In 1980, He Cijun (賀次君) published Kuodi Zhi jijiao (括地志輯校).
