Wikishire is an on-line gazetteer of Great Britain, Ireland and associated territories. The site describes itself thus:"Wikishire is where you are; whether you are on the Shetland islands or the South Shetland Islands or the places between, Wikishire is a growing guide on all you need to know about the British and Irish lands". To accompany the gazetteer there is an interactive map of the British Isles based on OpenStreetMap. Wikishire organises its articles on the basis of the historic counties and ridings of Britain and Ireland and insists that articles are written in British or Irish dialects of English. The site was launched in July 2010 and as of February 2018[update] contained over 20,000 articles.
