The Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) is a system maintained by Statistics Canada for categorizing and enumerating the census geographic units of Canada.   Each geographic area receives a unique numeric code ranging from 1 to 10 digits, which extend telescopically to refer to increasingly small areas.  This geocode is roughly analogous to the ONS coding system in use in the United Kingdom. The SGC code format for regions is X, where X is a unique identifier incrementing from east to west, then north. 1: Atlantic Canada 2: Quebec 3: Ontario 4: Prairies 5: British Columbia 6: Northern Canada The SGC code format for provinces and territories is XY, where X is the above regional prefix, and Y is a further identifier incrementing from east to west.  Taken as a single digit, each value of Y is unique within the province group, or unique within the territory group. 10: Newfoundland and Labrador 11: Prince Edward Island 12: Nova Scotia 13: New Brunswick 24: Quebec 35: Ontario 46: Manitoba 47: Saskatchewan 48: Alberta 59: British Columbia 60: Yukon 61: Northwest Territories 62: Nunavut The SGC code format for census divisions is XX YY, where XX is the above province/territory code, and YY is the census division's code, unique within its own province.  Census divisions are generally numbered from east to west.  In some locations, a similar policy to American FIPS county codes has been adopted, with even-numbered slots being left vacant for future expansion. Examples: 10 04: Division No. 4, Newfoundland and Labrador 10 05: Division No. 5, Newfoundland and Labrador 13 08: Kent County, New Brunswick 13 09: Northumberland County, New Brunswick 13 10: York County, New Brunswick 24 64: Les Moulins Regional County Municipality, Quebec 24 65: Territoire équivalent of Laval, Quebec 24 66: Territoire équivalent of Montreal, Quebec 24 67: Roussillon Regional County Municipality, Quebec 24 68: Les Jardins-de-Napierville Regional County Municipality, Quebec 35 07: Leeds and Grenville United Counties, Ontario 35 08: [vacant slot] 35 09: Lanark County, Ontario 35 10: Frontenac Census Division, Ontario 47 04: Division No. 4, Saskatchewan 48 05: Division No. 5, Alberta 59 01: Regional District of East Kootenay, British Columbia 59 02: [vacant slot] 59 03: Regional District of Central Kootenay, British Columbia 59 04: [vacant slot] 59 05: Regional District of Kootenay Boundary, British Columbia The SGC code format for census subdivisions is XX YY ZZZ, where XX is the province/territory code, YY is the census division code, and ZZZ is the census subdivision's code, unique within its own census division.  Census subdivisions are again generally numbered from east to west, and the practice has been to leave even-numbered slots vacant for future expansion. Examples: 35 12 001: Tyendinaga, Ontario 35 12 002: Deseronto, Ontario 35 12 003: [vacant slot] 35 12 004: Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario 35 12 005: Belleville, Ontario 35 12 006: [vacant slot] 62 04 001: Sanikiluaq, Nunavut 62 04 002: [vacant slot] 62 04 003: Iqaluit, Nunavut 62 04 004: [vacant slot] 62 04 005: Kimmirut, Nunavut 62 04 006: [vacant slot]
