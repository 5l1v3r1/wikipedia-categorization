Google My Maps is a service launched by Google in April 2007 that enables users to create custom maps for personal use or sharing.   Users can add points, lines, and shapes on top of Google Maps, using a WYSIWYG editor.  In November 2014, a new version was released, and maps from the original version were automatically upgraded.  You can also have layers and customise the items in each layer with uniform styles and having labels for the name or description. There are many different objects you can have as your points, such as the town point, train point, bus point, hospital point or a school points. You can change the colour of anything and change the thickness as well.
