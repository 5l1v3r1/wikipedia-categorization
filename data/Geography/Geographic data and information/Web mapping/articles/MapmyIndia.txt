 Rakesh and Rashmi Verma launched a start-up called C E Info Systems in 1992 at New Delhi, India. This start-up has grown and is known as "MapmyIndia" today. MapmyIndia is a desktop and mobile web mapping service application and technology provider offering satellite imagery, street maps, street view and indoor maps.   It is headquartered at Okhla Phase-III in New Delhi.  The purpose of this start-up was to harness web mapping technology and provide products and services required for enhancing marketing and logistics efficiency in existing organisations in the country. In 1993 the company took up an assignment to develop good quality maps with detailed topography to support the marketing and logistics operations of Coca-Cola and Cellular One. The success of the assignment made these maps the basis of offering similar services to other companies in India.  The company launched the first Indian interactive digital mapping portal "www.mapmyindia.com" in 2004. This portal provided free, customized, location-based services including assigning an e-location to existing addresses to enable last mile deliveries to their exact destinations. The services were available for mobile phones with internet connectivity also. These services were also provided through the MapmyIndia portal to MagicBricks.com, an e-portal of the "Times of India" group starting March 2006.     In 2010, MapmyIndia launched a GPS navigation service called Road Pilot, preloaded with Indian cities, villages and destinations. As of 2018, it has 5000+ Enterprises and 5mn+ consumers that use and benefit from its services. MapmyIndia has also expanded into the Indian subcontinent by creating maps of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. Its clientele includes some of the most valuable technology companies in the world, the Indian government and the largest business conglomerates in India.
