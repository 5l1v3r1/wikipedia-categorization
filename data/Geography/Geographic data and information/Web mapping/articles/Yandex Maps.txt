Yandex Maps is a Russian  web mapping service developed by Yandex. The service provides detailed maps of the whole world. It includes a search, information about traffic jams, routing and street panoramas. The service was launched in 2004.  Yandex Maps is the most popular cartographic service in Russia. It has about 11.5 million users in Russia per month, and over 20 million worldwide.     The service initially had maps only of Russia and Ukraine, but now includes world maps.  Maps are available in four versions: maps, satellite images, satellite images with captions, and legend (hybrid). Users can measure distance and get directions by dragging between spots on a map.  The search is available by both geographical objects (addresses, streets, cities, regions and countries) and by organizations. The illumination of the district, city or region is available after searching the organization on the site. Yandex Maps has a mobile application for iOS, Android and Windows phones.  On Yandex Maps it is possible to view street panoramas. There are street view even of Pripyat and Chernobyl.   In 2016 a "street view" of Everest was photographed.  Users can make new data on the map with the help of the Yandex.Map editor. Yandex Traffic is a feature on Yandex Maps that displays traffic conditions in real time on major roads and highways. It can be viewed at the Yandex Maps website, or via the app. Yandex Traffic works by analyzing the GPS-determined locations transmitted to Yandex by a large number of mobile phone users. By calculating the speed of users along a length of road, Yandex is able to generate a live traffic map. It processes the incoming raw data about mobile phone device locations, and then excludes anomalies such as a postal vehicle that makes frequent stops. When a threshold of users in a particular area is noted, the overlay along roads and highways on the map changes color.
