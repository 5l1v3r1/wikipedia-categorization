OpenStreetCam, formerly called OpenStreetView, is a project to collect crowdsourced street-level photographs for improving OpenStreetMap  operated by TeleNav.  Collected imagery is published under a CC-BY-SA license and most of the project's code is open source.  Contributors gather imagery with their smartphones using an Android or iOS app.   It is also possible to upload images captured with other cameras. The OpenStreetCam app supports using an ODB-II dongle plugged into the vehicle in addition to GPS to improve the accuracy of the positions of images. The app also recognizes and processes street signs in real time while capturing imagery.  Once the imagery is recorded, it is uploaded, processed, and published to the website.  OpenStreetMap editors can access OSC images using the iD editor or JOSM plugin.  OpenStreetCam's purpose resembles that of Mapillary. The main difference between the two is that OpenStreetCam's web and mobile apps are open-source, whereas Mapillary is not. OpenStreetCam also makes it easier for user to delete their uploaded photos in case they change their mind about contributing.  OpenStreetCam was founded in 2009 as OpenStreetView.  In 2016 TeleNav took over the openstreetview.org domain and started its own service under the name  . The service was renamed to OpenStreetCam after an intervention by an unnamed trademark holder.
