Crowdmapping is a subtype of crowdsourcing   by which aggregation of crowd-generated inputs such as captured communications and social media feeds are combined with geographic data to create a digital map that is as up-to-date as possible  on events such as wars, humanitarian crises, crime, elections, or natural disasters.    Such maps are typically created collaboratively by people coming together over the Internet.   The information can typically be sent to the map initiator or initiators by SMS or by filling out a form online and are then gathered on a map online automatically or by a dedicated group.  In 2010 Ushahidi released "Crowdmap" âˆ’ a free and open-source platform by which anyone can start crowdmapping projects.      Crowdmapping can be used to track fires, floods, pollution,  crime, political violence, the spread of disease and bring a level of transparency to fast-moving events that are difficult for traditional media to adequately cover, or problem areas  and longer-term trends and that may be difficult to identify through the reporting of individual events.  During disasters the timeliness of relevant maps is critical as the needs and locations of victims may change rapidly.  The use of crowdmapping by authorities can improve situational awareness during an incident and be used to support incident response.  Crowdmaps are an efficient way to visually demonstrate the geographical spread of a phenomenon.
