"Net Locality: Why Location Matters in a Networked World" (2011) is a textbook written by Eric Gordon and Adriana de Souza e Silva.  The book revolves around a brand new concept that Gordon and de Souza e Silva call Net Locality. Net Locality is locational awareness based on mobile technologies.  This book delves deep into how individuals and societies interact with their environment when virtually everything thing they do is traceable and locatable. Chapter 1: Maps Chapter 2 Mobile Annotations Chapter 3 Social Networks and Games Chapter 4 Urban Spaces Chapter 5: Community Chapter 6 Privacy Chapter 7 Globalization Chapter 8 Conclusion While Eric Gordon and Adriana de Souza e Silva received praise from many, including Marcus Foth of Queensland University of Technology claiming that Net Locality brings back to life the idea that place still matters, the book is still up for debate on the dichotomy of the physical/virtual world. Allen Smith who works for WHERE had this to say about the writings, “I always thought about recent phone technology as allowing the internet to come out into the world and overlay it with information, I never thought of it the other way around, “extending the idea and functionality of location into the network.”   Gordon replied to this by claiming that although the term "net-locality" is about the internet presence in everyday life, it is also true that our definition of networked interactions are changing from our perception of social norms and physical location.
