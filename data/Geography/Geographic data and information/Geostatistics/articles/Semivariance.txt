In spatial statistics, the empirical semivariance is described by semivariance=1/2(z(x)-z(x))^2 where z is the attribute value  where z is a datum at a particular location, h is the distance between ordered data, and n(h) is the number of paired data at a distance of h. The semivariance is half the variance of the increments                         z         (                    x                        i                             +         h         )         −         z         (                    x                        i                             )                 {\displaystyle z(x_{i}+h)-z(x_{i})}    , but the whole variance of z-values at given separation distance h (Bachmaier and Backes, 2008). A plot of semivariances versus distances between ordered data in a graph is known as a semivariogram rather than a variogram. Many authors call                         2                                                γ               ^                                          (         h         )                 {\displaystyle 2{\hat {\gamma }}(h)}     a variogram, others use the terms variogram and semivariogram synonymously. However,  Bachmaier and Backes (2008), who discussed this confusion, have shown that                                                                γ               ^                                          (         h         )                 {\displaystyle {\hat {\gamma }}(h)}     should be called a variogram, terms like semivariogram or semivariance should be avoided.
