Digital Cadastral DataBase (DCDB) is a computerised map or 'spatial' location showing property boundaries normally in relation to adjoining and other close properties or parcels of land.  Commonly used as a basic layer of data used in map based computer programs that gives an outline of the legal boundary of a property.  By using lines to represent an area, features such as rivers and roads can be shown in relation to where a property is.
