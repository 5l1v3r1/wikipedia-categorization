Maclear's Beacon is a triangulation station used in the calculation of the curvature of the earth. The beacon is on top of Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa. It is situated on the Eastern end on the plateau of the mountain. The beacon is 1,086 metres (3,563 ft) above sea level. Table Mountain’s lower end is 350 metres (1,150 ft) above sea level. The beacon is the highest point on the mountain; 19 metres (62 ft) higher than the upper cable car station. The structure consists of man made rock packed in a triangle form, being 5 metres (16 ft) high. It was painted in lamp black colour to make it visible, when light shown on it.  The Astronomer Royal at the Cape, Thomas Maclear, in December 1844, instructed his assistant  William Mann to build a beacon in the form of a pile of rocks which would be used to confirm and possibly expand on the existing curvature of the earth data of Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. This data was in connection with the Cape arc of the meridian.  Initially the beacon had no name but in later years it was named after Maclear.  In 1929 the pile of stones collapsed and it was restored in 1979 to commemorate the centenary of Maclear's death.  The beacon is still used by cartographers today. It has become a tourist attraction and hiking trails over the mountain pass next to the beacon. It is also a National Monument.
