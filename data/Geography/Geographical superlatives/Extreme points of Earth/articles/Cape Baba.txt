Cape Baba (Turkish: Baba Burnu, Ancient Greek: Λεκτόν), is the westernmost point of the Anatolian part of Turkey, making it the westernmost point of Asia. It is located at the village of Babakale ("Father Castle"), Ayvacık, Çanakkale, in the historical area of the Troad. There was a lighthouse at Cape Baba that was called Lekton (Latinized as Lectum) in classical times,  anglicised as Cape Lecture. > The Acts of the Apostles records a journey around the Cape from Troas to Assos undertaken by Luke the Evangelist and his companions, while Paul the Apostle took the journey over land (Acts 20:13).
