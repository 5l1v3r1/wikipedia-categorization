It is surrounded by white sand beaches bordered by flat-topped forms of sedimentary strata called "tabuleiros", which rise sharply above the beaches to heights between 150 and 500 ft, and enjoys abundant rainfall. It lies on the coastal highway connecting João Pessoa and the port of Cabedelo farther north.
