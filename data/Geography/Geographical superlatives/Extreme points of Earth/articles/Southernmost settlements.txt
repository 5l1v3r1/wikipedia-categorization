Southernmost settlements are cities, towns, weather stations or permanent military bases which are farther south than latitude 45Â°S. They are closely related to the Southern Ocean or either the Roaring Forties or Furious Fifties. The southernmost city in the world is mainly a slogan used for tourism to attract visitors to the city as well as the tourists headed for Antarctica. Currently three places use this slogan: Ushuaia in Argentina as well as Punta Arenas and Puerto Williams         in Chile, with the latter being the absolute southernmost town by latitude (see table below). There are several more settlements further south but none are considered to be large enough to be classified as a 'city'. The three contending cities are from north to south: Ushuaia Punta Arenas city view Puerto Williams, Micalvi yacht club This is a list of the all settlements south of the 45th parallel south with over 1,000 permanent inhabitants. This list of settlements excludes research stations in Antarctica and its surrounding islands. There are many research stations in Antarctica, both permanent and summer only. Many of the stations are staffed all year. McMurdo Station is the largest with an average population of 1200. A total of 30 countries (as of October 2006), all signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, operate seasonal (summer) or year-round research stations on the continent and on its surrounding islands. In addition to these permanent stations, approximately 30 field camps are established each austral summer to support specific one off projects.
