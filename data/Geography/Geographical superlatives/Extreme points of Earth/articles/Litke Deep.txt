Litke Deep (Russian: Жолоб Ли́тке) is   an oceanic trench in the Arctic Ocean. It is the deepest  known point in the Arctic Ocean.  It is the 20th  deepest oceanic trench in the world. The Litke Deep is located in the southwestern part of the Eurasian Basin  south of the underwater ridge Gakkel Ridge roughly 350 kilometers  northeast of Svalbard and roughly 220 km north of the island of Nordaustlandet. The deepest part is at 5,449 metres  (17,881   feet)  under sea level. The average depth in the Arctic Ocean is about 1,000 metres  and more than 60 % is less than 200 metres deep.  The Eurasian Basin stretches from northeastern part of Greenland past the Svalbard archipelago, Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya to the Taymyr Peninsula. Sometimes the Molloy Deep is mentioned as the deepest point in the Arctic Ocean, this deep however lies in the Fram Strait in the Greenland Sea. The Litke Deep was located in 1955  by the russian icebreaker ”Fyodor Litke”  expedition. It is named after russian explorer Fyodor Petrovich Litke.
