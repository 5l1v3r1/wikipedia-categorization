 This is a list of extreme points of Earth, the geographical locations that are farther north or south than, higher or lower in elevation than, or farthest inland or out to sea from, any other locations on the landmasses, continents or countries. For other lists of extreme points on Earth, including places that hold temperature and weather records, see Extremes on Earth, Lists of extreme points, and List of weather records. The lowest railroad station was the Japanese Yoshioka-Kaitei Station, at 150 m (492 feet) below sea level, but it was closed in 2014.  The lowest railroad not inside a tunnel is 71 m (233 feet) below sea level, in the Mojave Desert between Yuma, Arizona, and Palm Springs, California, in the United States of America.  Baku is located 28 metres (92 ft) below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Each continent has its own continental pole of inaccessibility, defined as the place on the continent that is farthest from any ocean. Similarly, each ocean has its own oceanic pole of inaccessibility, defined as the place in the ocean that is farthest from any land. The pairs of cities (with a population over 100,000) with the greatest distance between them are:  These are the longest straight lines that can be drawn between any two points on the surface of the Earth and remain exclusively over land or water; the points need not lie on the same latitude or longitude.
