According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the highest registered air temperature on Earth was 56.7 °C (134.1 °F) in Furnace Creek Ranch, California, located in the Death Valley desert in the United States, on July 10, 1913.    The WMO itself admits that "[a]fter examining the temperature record in detail, [it was] noted that this temperature may be the result of a sandstorm that occurred at the time. Such a storm may have caused superheated surface materials to hit upon the temperature in the shelter" - what would mean the recording did not refer to air temperature.  Weather historians such as Christopher C. Burt also claim that the 1913 Death Valley reading is "a myth", and is at least 4 to 5 °F (2.2 to 2.8 °C) too high.  This same conclusion has also been reached by historians Dr. Arnold Court and William Taylor Reid.   If the 1913 record were to be decertified, the highest recorded air temperature on Earth would be 54.0 °C (129.2 °F), recorded both in Death Valley on June 20, 2013, and in Mitribah, Kuwait on July 21, 2016.  The standard measuring conditions for temperature are in the air, 1.5 meters above the ground, and shielded from direct sunlight.  From 1922 until 2012, the WMO record for the highest official temperature on Earth was 57.8 °C (136.0 °F), registered on September 13, 1922 in ‘Aziziya, Libya. In January 2012, the WMO decertified the 1922 record, citing persuasive evidence that it was a faulty reading recorded in error by an inexperienced observer.   Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 °C.  The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 °C (between 194 and 212 °F) for dry, darkish soils of low thermal conductivity.  While there is no highest confirmed ground temperature, a reading of 93.9 °C (201 °F) was allegedly recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch on July 15, 1972.  Temperature measurements via satellite also tend to capture occurrence of higher records but, due to complications involving satellite's altitude loss (a side effect of atmospheric friction), these measurements are often considered less reliable than ground-positioned thermometers.  The highest recorded temperature taken by a satellite is 66.8 °C (152.2 °F), which was measured in the Flaming Mountains of China in 2008.  Other satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert, Iran. The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009). These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.  The following are unverified claims of extreme heat over the current world record of 56.7 °C (134.1 °F).
