The Diamantina Deep is located in the Diamantina Trench southwest of Perth, Western Australia.  The Diamantina Trench is in the eastern part of the larger Diamantina Fracture Zone, which stretches from the Ninety East Ridge to the Naturaliste Plateau, which lies off the lower part of Southwest Australia.  It is one of the deepest points (surpassed by the Sunda Trench) in the Indian Ocean at 7,079 m (23,225 ft) . It is located about 1,125 km west-southwest of Perth at 35°S and 104°E. A survey in 1961 by the Australian oceanographic survey ship HMAS Diamantina (K377) confirmed the bathymetry as well as conducting a scientific survey. The trench was named after her.
