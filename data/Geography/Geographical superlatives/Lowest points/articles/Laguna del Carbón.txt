Laguna del Carbón (Spanish for "coal lagoon") is a salt lake in Corpen Aike Department, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. This salt lake is located 54 kilometres (34 miles) from Puerto San Julián, within the Gran Bajo de San Julián (Great San Julián Depression), an endorheic basin situated between the San Julian Bay and the Chico River. At 105 metres (344 ft) below sea level, Laguna del Carbón is the lowest point of Argentina and both the Western and Southern Hemispheres, and the seventh-lowest point on Earth.  As in several other locations in Patagonia, dinosaur fossils have been found in the area.
