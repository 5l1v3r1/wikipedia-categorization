The Blaeu Atlas of Scotland (Theatrum Orbis Terrarum Sive Atlas Novus, Volume V) is the first known Atlas of Scotland, compiled by Joan Blaeu, containing 49 engraved maps and 154 pages of descriptive text written in Latin and first published in 1654.  In 1725 Andrew Millar - then still an apprentice to the Scottish bookseller James McEuen - was advertising this work as 'finely bound' to customers - clearly there was a continuing value set on the work in the 18th century by booksellers and buyers.
