The Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae (1993â€‘2000) is a six-volume, multilingual reference work considered to be the major, modern work covering the topography of ancient Rome.  The editor is Eva Margareta Steinby, and the publisher is Edizioni Quasar of Rome. It is considered the successor to Platner and Ashby's A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome. An ongoing series of supplements provides additional coverage of Roman topography and important topics in the archaeology of the city. A subsequent series, Lexicon topographicum urbis Romae: Suburbium, edited by Adriano La Regina and produced by Edizioni Quasar covers sites in the suburbium of ancient Rome.
