Absyrtides or Apsyrtides or Apsirtides (Ancient Greek: Ἀψυρτίδες) was a collective name of two islands off the coast of Illyricum – Cres and Lošinj, which were almost attached. The name recalls Absyrtus, who according to one tradition, was slain here by his sister Medea and by Jason. Ptolemy mentions only one island, Apsorrus (Ἄψορρος), on which he places two towns Crepsa (Κρέψα) (the modern Cres) and Apsorrus (the modern Osor, Croatia).
