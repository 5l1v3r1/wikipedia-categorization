Acadera or Acadira was a region in the northwest of India, traversed by Alexander the Great as related by first-century Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus.  Arrian has it not a region but a city he terms Andaca, which Alexander took by storm,  during the Cophen Campaign, 327 BCE to 326 BCE.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
