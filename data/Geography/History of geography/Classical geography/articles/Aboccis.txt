It was renowned on account of the two magnificent grotto temples, which were discovered at this place by Giovanni Battista Belzoni. The walls of the larger of the two temples were covered with paintings, which recorded the victories of Ramses III over various nations of Africa and Asia. William Smith identifies the place with Abu Simbel.
