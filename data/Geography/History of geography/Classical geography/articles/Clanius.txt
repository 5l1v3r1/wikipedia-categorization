Clanius (also Glanis or Clanis; Ancient Greek: Γλάνις ) is a river of Campania noted in antiquity. It rises in the Apennines near Abella, and traverses the whole plain of Campania, falling into the sea about 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the Vulturnus (modern Volturno). In the early part of its course it flowed by the town of Acerrae, which frequently suffered severely from the ravages of its waters during floods.  At other times their stagnation rendered the country unhealthy; hence in the nineteenth century the stream was diverted into a canal or artificial course, called il regio Lagno, and sometimes by corruption l'Agno. This is divided into two streams near its mouth, the one of which flows direct into the sea, and is known as Foce dei Lagni, the other takes a more southerly direction, and joins, or rather forms, a marshy lake called the Lago di Patria (the ancient Literna Palus), the outlet of which into the sea, about 7 miles (11 km) miles south of the former branch, called the Foce di Patria. This is evidently the same which was known in ancient times as the river Liternus ternus,   and appears to have been then the principal, if not the only outlet of the Clanius, as Strabo, who describes the coast of Campania minutely, does not notice the latter river.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
