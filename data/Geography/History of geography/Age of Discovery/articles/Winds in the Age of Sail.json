Since a sailing ship is usually pushed by winds and currents, its captain must find a route where the wind will probably blow in the right direction. <a href=\"/wiki/Tacking_(sailing)\" title=\"Tacking (sailing)\">Tacking</a>, i.e. using contrary wind to pull (sic) the sails, was always possible but wasted time because of the zigzagging required, and this would significantly delay long voyages. The early European explorers were not only looking for new lands. They also had to discover the pattern of winds and currents that would carry them where they wanted to go. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Age_of_sail\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Age of sail\">age of sail</a> winds and currents determined trade routes and therefore influenced European imperialism and modern political geography.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Kuroshio_Current\" title=\"Kuroshio Current\">Kuroshio Current</a> tends to push his ship northeast into the <a href=\"/wiki/Westerlies\" title=\"Westerlies\">westerlies</a> and towards North America. There are records of unlucky Japanese fishermen being blown to North America, but no records of any who sailed home.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> It is easy to sail south and link up with the Indian Ocean trade. North China had few ports and little coastwise trade. South China has a number of good ports but the country inland is hilly or mountainous which restricts trade.\n</p><p><b>Indian Ocean and the Monsoon Trade:</b> There are no barriers to trade along the coast between the Red Sea and Japan. Local coastal routes soon were linked and extended to Indonesia. By about 850 trade was mostly in Arab or Muslim hands. This trade brought Hinduism and later Islam to Indonesia. A great advantage in the Indian Ocean is the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Monsoon_of_south_Asia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Monsoon of south Asia (page does not exist)\">monsoon</a> which blows south in the winter and north in the summer. An Arab wishing to go to Africa or Indonesia would go south on the winter monsoon and return north with the summer monsoon. In Africa this trade extended about as far as Mozambique at the southern limit of monsoon winds. Further south was a <a href=\"/wiki/Lee_shore\" title=\"Lee shore\">lee shore</a> with no trade goods that could not be obtained further north. It is not clear how far south trade and geographic knowledge extended, but there is said to be a Chinese map of the thirteenth century showing Africa in roughly its true shape and there is a Venetian report from the mid-fifteenth century of a Chinese or Javanese junk seen off the southwest African coast.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Europeans_Eastbound\">Europeans Eastbound</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Winds_in_the_Age_of_Sail&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Europeans Eastbound\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Route\" title=\"Cape Route\">Cape Route</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Henrican_navigation_routes.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Henrican_navigation_routes.gif/250px-Henrican_navigation_routes.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"264\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Henrican_navigation_routes.gif 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"294\" data-file-height=\"311\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Henrican_navigation_routes.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"<a href=\"/wiki/Volta_do_mar\" title=\"Volta do mar\">Volta do mar</a>\" maneuvre during <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_the_Navigator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Henry the Navigator\">Henry the Navigator</a>'s (c.1430-1460) lifetime: Atlantic winds (green), currents (blue) and approximate Portuguese sailing routes (red): the further south ships went, the wider off sailing required to return.

He soon reaches the northeast <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_winds\" title=\"Trade winds\">trade winds</a> which also push him southwest. If he leaves in late summer he will hit the trade winds sooner since wind systems move north and south with the seasons. The problem was to get back again. The solution was the <a href=\"/wiki/Volta_do_mar\" title=\"Volta do mar\">volta do mar</a> in which a captain would sail northwest across the winds and currents until he found the <a href=\"/wiki/Westerlies\" title=\"Westerlies\">westerlies</a> and was blown back to Europe.\n</p><p>The coast of Northwest Africa might be described as the nursery of European imperialism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Experience gained here was the basis for the sudden breakout into all the world's oceans in the 30-year period of 1492-1522. The <a href=\"/wiki/Canary_Islands\" title=\"Canary Islands\">Canary Islands</a> were known to the ancients. They were reached by <a href=\"/wiki/Lancelotto_Malocello\" title=\"Lancelotto Malocello\">Lancelotto Malocello</a> in 1312. <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_de_B%C3%A9thencourt\" title=\"Jean de B\u00e9thencourt\">Jean de B\u00e9thencourt</a> conquered two of them in 1405 but the larger islands were not fully subdued until about 1495. The local <a href=\"/wiki/Guanches\" title=\"Guanches\">Guanches</a> have the distinction of being the first non-European people to be wiped out by European expansion. The volta do mar led to the discovery of uninhabited <a href=\"/wiki/Madeira\" title=\"Madeira\">Madeira</a> in 1419 which soon developed a trade in wine and sugar. A longer volta do mar led to the uninhabited <a href=\"/wiki/Azores\" title=\"Azores\">Azores</a> which are over 700 miles from the nearest land. Further south the <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Verde_Islands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cape Verde Islands\">Cape Verde Islands</a> developed a system of slave-worked sugar plantations which was later exported to Brazil. The Canaries were taken by Spain and the other islands fell to Portugal. Northwest Africa was the starting point longer voyages, the Spanish heading southwest from the Canaries and the Portuguese south from Cape Verde.\n</p><p><b>Down the coast of Africa:</b>  The Portuguese reached the westernmost point of Africa in 1444 and in 1458 rounded <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Palmas\" title=\"Cape Palmas\">Cape Palmas</a> where the coast tends eastward. Here the trade winds gave out and they faced the irregular winds near the <a href=\"/wiki/Doldrums\" title=\"Doldrums\">doldrums</a> and the east-flowing <a href=\"/wiki/Guinea_Current\" title=\"Guinea Current\">Guinea Current</a>. In 1471 they reached the <a href=\"/wiki/Gold_Coast_(region)\" title=\"Gold Coast (region)\">Gold coast</a> where they found the gold that had previously come by caravan across the Sahara. In 1474 <a href=\"/wiki/Lopes_Gon%C3%A7alves\" title=\"Lopes Gon\u00e7alves\">Lopes Gon\u00e7alves</a> reached the point where the coast turns south and became the first European sailor to cross the equator.  In 1475-79 Spain and Portugal fought along the coast. The <a href=\"/wiki/Treaty_of_Alc%C3%A1%C3%A7ovas\" title=\"Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas\">Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas</a> gave the whole area to the Portuguese except for the Canaries. This was the first colonial war and the first colonial treaty. In 1482 <a href=\"/wiki/Diogo_C%C3%A3o\" title=\"Diogo C\u00e3o\">Diogo C\u00e3o</a> continued south against the <a href=\"/wiki/Benguela_current\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Benguela current\">Benguela current</a> and the southeast trade winds, reaching the <a href=\"/wiki/Congo_River\" title=\"Congo River\">Congo River</a> in 1482 and <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Cross\" title=\"Cape Cross\">Cape Cross</a> in Namibia in 1485. In 1487 <a href=\"/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias\" title=\"Bartolomeu Dias\">Bartolomeu Dias</a> reached Cape Voltas near the mouth of the <a href=\"/wiki/Orange_River\" title=\"Orange River\">Orange River</a> and stood out to sea. Although the sources are not clear, he may have guessed that there were southern westerlies and was trying a volta do mar. After many days, at about 40 degrees south he discovered the <a href=\"/wiki/Roaring_fourties\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roaring fourties\">westerlies</a> and turned east. Finding no land after a number of days he turned north and reached <a href=\"/wiki/Mossel_Bay\" title=\"Mossel Bay\">Mossel Bay</a> about 400&#160;km east of Cape Town. He continued east against the <a href=\"/wiki/Agulhas_current\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Agulhas current\">Agulhas current</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Algoa_Bay\" title=\"Algoa Bay\">Algoa Bay</a> where the coast began to turn north. Guessing that he had found the route to India, he turned back, discovered and rounded the <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope\" title=\"Cape of Good Hope\">Cape of Good Hope</a> and reached Lisbon in 1488. In 1493 Columbus arrived at Lisbon with news of the new world and reported that he had sailed out of sight of land for five weeks. \n</p><p>In 1497 <a href=\"/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama\" title=\"Vasco da Gama\">Vasco da Gama</a> chose a very obvious and very bold route. After rounding the bulge of Africa he sailed directly south across the trade winds and, helped by the <a href=\"/wiki/Brazil_Current\" title=\"Brazil Current\">Brazil Current</a> reached the <a href=\"/wiki/Roaring_forties\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roaring forties\">roaring forties</a>.  This was by far the longest voyage yet made out of sight of land. Turning east too soon, he hit the coast and had to work his way around South Africa. Working up the coast against the <a href=\"/wiki/Agulhas_Current\" title=\"Agulhas Current\">Agulhas Current</a>, at Mozambique he came in contact with the Arab monsoon trade. At <a href=\"/wiki/Malindi\" title=\"Malindi\">Malindi</a> he found a local pilot and used the summer monsoon to reach India in 23 days. Returning he foolishly sailed against the summer monsoon and took 132 days to reach Africa. Rounding the Cape of Good Hope, he again chose a wise and bold course. He took the southeast <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_winds\" title=\"Trade winds\">trade winds</a> directly northwest across the South Atlantic to the Cape Verde Islands, the Azores, and home. Not only did Da Gama find a sea route to India, he discovered the most efficient sailing route there and back.  In 1500 <a href=\"/wiki/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral\" title=\"Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral\">Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral</a> sailed somewhat west of Da Gama's route and bumped onto the coast of Brazil.\n</p><p><b>Portuguese and Dutch in the Indian Ocean:</b> After a few more voyages the Portuguese learned two things: that there was little market for European goods in the east, and the large Portuguese ships could outfight nearly any local craft. They therefore determined to take by force what they could not get by honest trade. Under the leadership of <a href=\"/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque\" title=\"Afonso de Albuquerque\">Afonso de Albuquerque</a> they captured <a href=\"/wiki/Goa\" title=\"Goa\">Goa</a> in 1510 for their main base, captured <a href=\"/wiki/Malacca\" title=\"Malacca\">Malacca</a> in 1511 to control the <a href=\"/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca\" title=\"Strait of Malacca\">Strait of Malacca</a>, tried to block the mouths of the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_Sea\" title=\"Red Sea\">Red Sea</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Persian_Gulf\" title=\"Persian Gulf\">Persian Gulf</a> and built forts in Mozambique to pick up fresh water and wait for the summer monsoon. In 1513 they reached the <a href=\"/wiki/Maluku_Islands\" title=\"Maluku Islands\">Spice Islands</a> and in 1519, the same year that Balboa first saw the Pacific, reached <a href=\"/wiki/Guangzhou\" title=\"Guangzhou\">Canton</a>. They continued to use the monsoon route - north with the summer monsoon and south with the winter monsoon.\n</p><p>The Dutch republic began its remarkable rise about 1580 during its war of independence from Spain. With <a href=\"/wiki/Iberian_Union\" title=\"Iberian Union\">the union of the two crowns</a> in 1580 it was also at war with Portugal. In 1595 <a href=\"/wiki/Jan_Huyghen_van_Linschoten\" title=\"Jan Huyghen van Linschoten\">Jan Huyghen van Linschoten</a> published previously-secret Portuguese sailing directions for the Indian Ocean. The Dutch reached Java in 1596 and the <a href=\"/wiki/Maluku_Islands\" title=\"Maluku Islands\">Spice Islands</a> in 1599. In 1611 <a href=\"/wiki/Hendrik_Brouwer\" title=\"Hendrik Brouwer\">Hendrik Brouwer</a> found a better route to the East Indies. After reaching the roaring forties he continued east almost to Australia and then swung north. This avoided Portuguese warships and greatly reduced the travel time since there was no need to wait for the monsoon. This <a href=\"/wiki/Brouwer_Route\" title=\"Brouwer Route\">Brouwer Route</a> shifted the gateway to the Indies from the <a href=\"/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca\" title=\"Strait of Malacca\">Strait of Malacca</a> between Malaya and Sumatra to the <a href=\"/wiki/Sunda_Strait\" title=\"Sunda Strait\">Sunda Strait</a> between Sumatra and Java and led to the foundation of <a href=\"/wiki/Jakarta_Old_Town\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jakarta Old Town\">Batavia</a> in 1619.

A few years later his pilot, Anton de Alaminos, used the Gulf Stream to push him north to the westerlies and return to Spain. This established the standard Spanish route to the Americas: south to the Canary Islands, west on the trade winds to the Caribbean, then beat against the wind north of Cuba using the <a href=\"/wiki/Florida_Current\" title=\"Florida Current\">Florida Current</a> to the Gulf Steam, use it to go north to the westerlies which led directly home. Since wind systems move north in summer and south in winter, there is a question of the best season, which is poorly documented. The Caribbean was the gateway to Spanish America since it is the closest part of America to Europe measured in sailing days.
