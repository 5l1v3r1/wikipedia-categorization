The International Geographical Union (IGU; French: Union GÃ©ographique Internationale, UGI) is an international geographical society. The first International Geographical Congress was held in Antwerp in 1871. Subsequent meetings led to the establishment of the permanent organization in Brussels, Belgium, in 1922.  The International Geographical Union adheres to the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Social Science Council (ISSC), which it recognizes as coordinating bodies for the international organization of science. The IGU has seven objectives or aims: The following lists contain the Senior Officers of the IGU from 1922 to present: The IGU is organized into a number of commissions and task forces that deal with specific topics .  The commission topics include e.g. specific approaches (e.g. Applied Geography), topics (e.g. Climatology, Health and Environment), methods (e.g. Geographical Information Science), and spatial examples (e.g. Mediterranean Basin). There are also commissions for the International Olympiad and Geographical Education.  The two task forces are "Young and Early-Career Geographers" and "Centennial and Sesquicentennial".  The IGU-CGE (Commission on Geographical Education) focuses on geography education. It is currently headed by co-chairs Clare Brooks (UK) and Chew-Hung Chang (Singapore) . It publishes the IRGEE journal and organizes yearly conferences . The "International Charter on Geographical Education" constitutes an international agreement on different aspects with global impacts. The 2016 charter features e.g. important geography education research questions and policy recommendations .  In the 1992 charter there is also information on geographic questions, key concepts, approaches and the selection of spatial examples .
