On 22 June 1883, the Geographical Society of Australasia started at a meeting in Sydney. A branch was formed in Victoria  in the same year. In July 1885, both the Queensland and the South Australian branches started. In July 1886 the society became the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia.  The New South Wales branch's new constitution in 1886 widened its scope to encourage interest in scientific, commercial, educational and historical aspects of geography.  The Society sponsored several important expeditions, notably the New Guinea Exploration Expedition in 1885,  whose members included zoologist Wilhelm Haacke, erstwhile director of the South Australian Museum. The Victorian branch amalgamated with the Victorian Historical Society, while the New South Wales branch had ceased to function by the early 1920s.  The South Australian and Queensland branches continue as the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia and Royal Geographical Society of Queensland respectively (see External links below).
