The Manchester Geographical Society (founded 1884) is based in Manchester, England.  When it was founded it was addressed by H. M. Stanley, the African explorer.  The society's original interest was in commercial and political geography. Throughout its history the society has organised an annual lecture series. From 1885 to 1960 it published The Journal of the Manchester Geographical Society; this was succeeded by The Manchester Geographer which was renamed The North West Geographer in 1997. Since 2001 it has been a free online journal. Its archives (to 1985) have been deposited in Greater Manchester Record Office.  Among the society's founders was Eli Sowerbutts who was its secretary until his death in 1904.
