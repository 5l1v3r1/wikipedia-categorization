Farther India, or Ultraindia, is an old term, now rarely used, for Southeast Asia, seen in colonial days from Europe as the part of the Far East beyond the Indian subcontinent, but south of China. :190 It refers to Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (aka Burma), Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand (former Siam), and Vietnam) and the Malay states (Brunei, East Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore), but usually not including East Timor or the Philippines, these neighbouring predominantly Malay states usually belong to the wider East Indies (which includes all of the above as well as the Indian subcontinent). Farther India is also a title of a book written by Sir Hugh Clifford. Coordinates: 14°13′12″N 101°51′36″E﻿ / ﻿14.22000°N 101.86000°E﻿ / 14.22000; 101.86000
