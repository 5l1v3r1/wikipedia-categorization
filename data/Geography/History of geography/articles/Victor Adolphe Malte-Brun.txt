Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun (25 November 1816 – 13 July 1889) was a French geographer and cartographer. He was born in Paris, France, the son of Conrad Malte-Brun, another geographer, of Danish origin, and founder of the Société de Géographie. After having been professor of history in several colleges, he devoted himself especially to geographical studies.  In 1851, Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun became a member of the Société de Géographie, and quickly rose to be its secretary-general. He was also principal editor of the Nouvelles Annales des Voyage.  He died in Marcoussis in the Essonne département and is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. His name was given to the street in Marcoussis where he once lived. Mount Malte-Brun in New Zealand's Southern Alps was named, by Sir Julius von Haast, after him. He also published a revised edition of his father's geography (8 vols., 1852–55).
