The topographic isolation of a summit is the minimum great-circle distance to a point of equal elevation, representing a radius of dominance in which the peak is the highest point.  It can be calculated for small hills and islands as well as for major mountain peaks, and can even be calculated for submarine summits. The following sortable table lists the Earth's 40 most topographically isolated summits. 1. Mount Everest is the highest mountain peak on Earth. 2. Aconcagua is the highest peak in both the Southern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere. 3. Denali is the highest peak of North America. 4. Kilimanjaro is the highest peak of Africa. 5. Puncak Jaya on New Guinea is the highest peak on any ocean island. 6. The Vinson Massif is the highest peak of Antarctica. 7. Mont Orohena on Tahiti is the highest peak of French Polynesia. 8. Mauna Kea on the Island of Hawaiʻi is the tallest mountain on Earth as measured from base to summit. 9. Gunnbjørn Fjeld on Greenland is the highest peak of the Arctic. 10. Aoraki, or Mount Cook, on the South Island is the highest peak in New Zealand. 11. Mont Blanc is the highest peak of Western Europe. 12. Piton des Neiges is the apex of Réunion. 13. Klyuchevskaya Sopka is the highest peak of Kamchatka. 14. Pico de Orizaba is the highest peak of Mexico. 15. Mount Whitney is the highest peak of the contiguous United States. 16.
