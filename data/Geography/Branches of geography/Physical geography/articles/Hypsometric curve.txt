A hypsometric curve is a histogram or cumulative distribution function of elevations in a geographical area. Differences in hypsometric curves between landscapes arise because the geomorphic processes that shape the landscape may be different. When drawn as a 2-dimensional histogram, a hypsometric curve displays the elevation (y) on the vertical, y-axis and area above the corresponding elevation (x) on the horizontal or x-axis.  The curve can also be shown in non-dimensional or standardized form by scaling elevation and area by the maximum values.  The non-dimensional hypsometric curve provides an hydrologist or a geomorphologist with a way to assess the similarity of watersheds â€” and is one of several characteristics used for doing so. The hypsometric integral is a summary measure of the shape of the hypsometric curve. In the original paper on this topic, Arthur Strahler proposed a curve containing three parameters to fit different hypsometric relations:  where a, d and z are fitting parameters. Subsequent research using two-dimensional landscape evolution models has called the general applicability of this fit into question,  as well as the capability of the hypsometric curve to deal with scale-dependent effects.
