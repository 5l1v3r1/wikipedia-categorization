This list of locations with a subtropical climate specifically lists locations considered within the subtropics.  The subtropics are geographic and climate zones located roughly between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn and the  40th parallel in both hemispheres.  Subtropical climate regimes can exist at high elevations within the tropics, such as across the Mexican Plateau and in Vietnam and Taiwan.  Six climate classifications utilise the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for the planet Earth. Using the Trewartha climate classification eight or more months of the year within the subtropics have an average temperature at or above 10 °C (50.0 °F). The Köppen climate classification instead classifies the warmest month above 22 °C (72 °F) and the coldest above 0 °C (32 °F) or −3 °C (27 °F) depending on preference. A great portion of the world's deserts are located within the subtropics, due to the development of the subtropical ridge.  Within the humid monsoon regimes in the subtropics, a wet season is seen annually during the summer, which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls.  Within the Mediterranean climate regime, the wet season occurs during the winter.  Areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall.  Plants such as date palms, citrus, mango, litchi, and avocado are grown within the subtropical zones. This is not a complete list. Many of the higher mountains at tropical latitudes have sparsely (if at all) inhabited areas with a subtropical climate. Roads with reflectors also exist in most areas with subtropical climates.  These French overseas territories have a marine subtropical climate:
