A geologic hazard is one of several types of adverse geologic conditions capable of causing damage or loss of property and life. These hazards consist of sudden phenomena and slow phenomena: Sudden phenomena include: Gradual or slow phenomena include: Sometime the hazard is instigated by man through the careless location of developments or construction in which the conditions were not taken into account. Geologic hazards are typically evaluated by engineering geologists who are educated and trained in interpretation of landforms and earth process, earth-structure interaction, and in geologic hazard mitigation. The engineering geologist provides recommendations and designs to mitigate for geologic hazards. Trained hazard mitigation planners also assist local communities to identify strategies for mitigating the effects of such hazards and developing plans to implement these measures. Mitigation can include a variety of measures: Eissto√ü Feb.2006 Vienna, Austria (Donauinsel) Glacier just above Grindelwald, Switzerland
