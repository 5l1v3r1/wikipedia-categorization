A humanitarian corridor is a type of temporary demilitarized zone intended to allow the safe transit of humanitarian aid in, and/or refugees out of a crisis region.  Such a corridor can also be associated with a no-fly zone or no-drive zone.  In practice "humanitarian corridors" have also been suggested as a means of supplying weapons to a besieged force.    Various types of "humanitarian corridors" have been proposed in the Post Cold War era, put forward either by one or more of the warring parties, or by the international community in the case of a humanitarian intervention. United Nations Safe Areas (UN Safe Areas) were humanitarian corridors established in 1993 in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War by several resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.
