A compact state in the political geography context is a state (country) in which the distance from the center to any boundary does not vary significantly. Compact states are one of six different shapes for states  and are never perfect circles. The benefits of these states are that, controlling for everything else, they are easiest to defend as they have the smallest possible perimeter and they are effective with communication and transportation. Modern examples of compact states include: Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Cambodia, Botswana, Poland, Montenegro.
