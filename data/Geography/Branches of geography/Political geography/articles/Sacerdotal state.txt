A sacerdotal state is a state whose head is also an ecclesiastical leader designated by a religious body.  An example of this kind of state is the Vatican City, whose head of state is the Pope of the Catholic Church.  Andorra operates under a semi-sacerdotal system, as one of its co-heads of state is the Bishop of Urgell. In the past it was common for bishops to assume civil as well as clerical power and rule as Prince-Bishops.
