A worm's-eye view is a view of an object from below, as though the observer were a worm; the opposite of a bird's-eye view.  It can be used to look up to something to make an object look tall, strong, and mighty while the viewer feels child-like or powerless.  A worm's eye view commonly uses three-point perspective, with one vanishing point on top, one on the left, and one on the right.  It is a very common technique in paintings. More often than not, this technique is considered a modification of a low angle shot.
