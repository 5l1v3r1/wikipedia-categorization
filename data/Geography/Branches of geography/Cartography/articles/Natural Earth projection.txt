The natural Earth projection is a pseudocylindrical map projection designed by Tom Patterson and introduced in 2012. It is neither conformal nor equal-area. The natural Earth is defined by the following formulas: where l(φ) and d(φ) are given as polynomials, initially from interpolation of the following values in Flex Projector : The values for the southern hemisphere are calculated by changing the sign of the corresponding values for the northern hemisphere.
