{"parse":{"title":"German Naval Grid System","pageid":12934010,"revid":856558444,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>German Naval Grid Reference</b>, (German:<i>Gradnetzmeldeverfahren</i>), was a system for referencing a location on a map. Introduced initially by the German <a href=\"/wiki/Luftwaffe\" title=\"Luftwaffe\">Luftwaffe</a> just before <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a>, it was used widely in the German armed forces until 1943. Each armed force had its own version of this reference.\n</p><p>The reference used in the \u2019Gradnetzmeldeverfahren\u2019 can be viewed as a short form of the position in full, without a real translation or encoding.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/Kriegsmarine\" title=\"Kriegsmarine\">Kriegsmarine</a> version,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> the entire globe was divided into large square sectors, each with its unique two-letter designation (e.g. AE, AF, BA, BB, etc.) with each square called a quadrant 486 nautical miles to a side. E.g CA covered the East Coast of the United States from about Portsmouth, Hampshire south to Cape Fear, North Carolina. Each such sector was further sub-divided into a 3 x 3 matrix, so that there were nine squares. Each of the nine squares were again divided into nine smaller squares.\n</p><p>This was known as a Grid, so that there were now 81 total grid squares within a sector. Each grid was given a two-digit designation, so the Grid System would now have two alphabets and two digits. Each of these Grids were again divided in the same manner \u2013 first into a 3 x 3 matrix, and then each matrix was divided into nine squares, so that a further 81 squares were formed within the Grid. Each newly formed square was again given a two digit designation. The complete Grid System would now read as two alphabets with four digits. This can be referred to as the patrol zone. Thus the <i>Kriegsmarine</i> could pinpoint any location on the globe using six characters, a very useful tool when using radio. Its precision was to the level of six nautical miles within a grid. This was how locations were communicated to naval units, particularly <a href=\"/wiki/U-boats\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"U-boats\">U-boats</a>. Thus grid location AN1879 denoted a location east of Northern <a href=\"/wiki/Scotland\" title=\"Scotland\">Scotland</a>, just below <a href=\"/wiki/Scapa_Flow\" title=\"Scapa Flow\">Scapa Flow</a>.\n</p><p>For example, major grid AJ is located south of Greenland. Each submarine was equipped with an Adressbuch to decipher the locations.\n</p><p>As the war advanced, the Germans suspected that the Allies were deciphering their patrol reports. As a precautionary measure they transmitted patrol zones by using coded sectors.\n</p><p>Thus instead of transmitting the actual patrol zone, they would use an offset, so that any zone that was transmitted over the waves would be an offset of a secret location. This secret location was changed at random intervals, and U-boat captains would calculate the new patrol zone based on the offset.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=German_Naval_Grid_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Helgason, Gu\u00f0mundur (1995-01-01). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://uboat.net/maps/grid.html\">\"The War in Maps - The Grid system\"</a>. <i>Encyclopedia of Things</i>. uboat.net<span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
