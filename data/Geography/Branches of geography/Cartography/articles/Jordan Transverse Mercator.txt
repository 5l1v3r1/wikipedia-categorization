Jordan Transverse Mercator (JTM) (Arabic: نظام تربيع ميركاتور الأردني المستعرض) is a grid system created by the Royal Jordan Geographic Center (RJGC). This system is based on 6° belts with a Central Meridian of 37° East and a Scale Factor at Origin (mo) = 0.9998. The JTM is based on the Hayford ellipsoid adopted by the IUGG in 1924. No transformation parameters are presently offered by the government.  However, Prof. Stephen H. Savage of Arizona State University provides the following parameters for the projection: Jordan Transverse Mercator  Geographic Coordinate System: GCS_International_1924 Datum: D:International_1924 Spheroid: International_1924 Prime Meridian: Greenwich Units: Degree Projection: Transverse Mercator Units: Meter Three-parameter transformation to WGS84 is:  Prof. Savage also offers software, ReprojectME!, which will convert coordinates between JTM and other systems.
