After he obtained his doctorate at the KU Leuven in 1991, Dr. Lode Missiaen worked as a senior scientist at the NATO C3 Agency in The Hague,  the Netherlands, where he was responsible for the study, development, and application of modern software technologies in the field of Air Traffic Control and Airspace Management. Together with his colleague Thierry Salvant, who built a career in France at Matra AÃ©rospatiale in the world of air traffic, Missiaen recognized the lack of commercially available software to combine geographic information efficiently and with high precision with real-time aviation information. To fill this gap, Missiaen and Salvant founded Luciad on March 22, 1999, together with management company R2I (acted as business angels). Gemma Frisius Fund (GFF), a seed capital fund established in 1997 as a joint venture between the KU Leuven,  KBC and  BNP Paribas, provided further seed capital in September 2000 .

In October 2017, Gimv and the other shareholders sold their stake in Luciad to the Swedish-headquartered   Hexagon  to strengthen their ability to deliver smart digital realities.
