In 1989 the Society adopted a new title and constitution opening up membership to anyone who regularly makes maps. The Society of Cartographers purported aim is to support and encourage all those actively involved in the production of maps – whatever the method and format of map production. It seeks to do this by providing information and opportunities to contact, meet and exchange views and techniques, they hope to support and encourage those involved in all aspects of mapmaking and maintain a high standard of cartographic illustration and quality, meaningful map production. The Society's membership is widely drawn from the education sector, statutory institutions, local authorities, public utilities and the commercial and publishing industry. The majority of the membership is UK based, but with a significant world-wide membership. The SoC is focused on the continual evolution of the mapping industry and how this relates to overlapping disciplines (such as GIS; Graphic Design, Web mapping); how maps now manifest themselves in today’s society and what this means to the mapmakers of today. The Society holds an annual conference the 'Annual Summer School' in August or September.
