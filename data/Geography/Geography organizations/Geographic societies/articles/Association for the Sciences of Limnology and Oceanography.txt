Initiated in 1947, the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), formerly known as the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, is a scientific society with the goal of Advancing the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography. With approximately 4000 members in nearly 60 different countries, ASLO is the largest scientific society, worldwide, devoted to either limnology or oceanography or both. ASLOâ€™s mission is to foster a diverse, international scientific community that creates, integrates and communicates knowledge across the full spectrum of aquatic sciences, advances public awareness and education about aquatic resources and research, and promotes scientific stewardship of aquatic resources for the public interest. Its products and activities are directed toward these ends. ASLO publishes four scientific journals: Limnology and Oceanography; Limnology and Oceanography: Fluids and Environments;  Limnology and Oceanography: Methods;and Limnology and Oceanography: Bulletin. Much of the content of ASLO journals is open access.  In addition to occasional small workshops (LINK) ASLO hosts regularly scheduled major scientific meetings around the world including the Aquatic Science Meetings; the Ocean Science Meetings and the Summer ASLO Meetings. ASLO presents five annual awards in recognition of professional excellence in the field. Active in outreach and public affairs related to the aquatic sciences and related fields, ASLO has a Public Affairs Office.  ASLO is governed by an elected Board of Directors, which includes 2 student members with full voting privileges.  ASLO offers its members many benefits and provides information to the general public and educators as well. Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography gives out the following awards:
