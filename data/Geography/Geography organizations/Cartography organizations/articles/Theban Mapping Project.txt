The Theban Mapping Project is an archaeological expedition devoted to Ancient Egypt. It was established in 1978 by the Egyptologist Dr. Kent R. Weeks at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1985, it was moved to the American University in Cairo, where it continues to be based. The Project's original goal was to create an archaeological map of the Valley of the Kings, and that was published as the Atlas of the Valley of the Kings in 2000.  It now also appears online at www.Thebanmappingproject.com, where it was updated annually. The web site has not published an update in years and no longer responds to email . Since 2001, the Project has also developed a management plan for the Valley of the Kings, which is funded by the World Monuments Fund.
