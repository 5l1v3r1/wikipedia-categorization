The Map Collectors' Circle was founded in London in April 1963 by Ronald Vere Tooley with a stated aim of "stimulating interest in and publish material on early printed maps, atlases, cartographers, etc."  Between 1963 and 1975, it set about fulfilling its second mandate with a series of 110 monographs related to the field of historical cartography which remain of interest to cartographers for their breadth.   An index to the series has been created by the Bodleian Library Map Section.
