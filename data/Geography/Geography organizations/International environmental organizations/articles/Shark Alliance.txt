The Shark Alliance is a global not-for-profit coalition founded in 2006 by Pew Charitable Trusts  of non-governmental organizations dedicated to restoring and conserving shark populations by improving shark conservation policies.  The mission of the Shark Alliance is to secure the following: The Shark Alliance was initiated and is coordinated by the Pew Environment Group, the conservation arm of The Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-government organization that is working to end overfishing in the world's oceans. To raise public awareness about the dramatic decline of shark species and Europe’s role in the process, the Shark Alliance proclaimed 8–14 October 2007 to be the first European Shark Week. Using the slogan 'Every Fin Counts!' members of the public were asked to take part in events and sign a petition asking the fisheries commission of the EU for better regulation to protect sharks. During European Shark Week over 100 events were organised around Europe by Shark Alliance members. At the end of the campaign, over 20,000 signatures were presented to the fisheries commission. In 2010, the Shark Alliance's Shark Week expanded beyond Europe to include North and South America to raise public awareness around the globe. Eventually, the Shark Alliance's Shark Week will include every region, reaching additional countries every year.
