The Global Invasive Species Information Network (GISIN) is a web-based network of data providers including government, non-government, non-profit, educational, and other organizations that agree to work together to provide increased access to data and information on invasive species around the world.  Computer-based information systems like those in the GISIN present specific information to help detect, rapidly respond to, and control invasive alien species, flora or fauna. As of June 2008, work is proceeding on a draft of a proposed GISIN data-sharing protocol.
