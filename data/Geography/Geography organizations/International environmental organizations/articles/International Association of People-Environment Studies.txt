The International Association of People-Environment Studies (IAPS), has been promoting the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas between planning and social scientists for 35 years – above all between spatial planning, architecture, psychology, and sociology. IAPS was officially founded in 1981, although its origins can be traced back to a series of successful conferences in several European countries from 1969 to 1979. The objectives of IAPS are: People-environment studies, originating from environmental psychology (Lewin, Barker, Brunswik), have always tried to close the “mind gaps” between natural sciences, engineering, arts, and social sciences by an epistemological approach that encompasses denotations (objects and techniques) as well as connotations (subjective social, cultural meanings).  Benefits of membership include: The biannual conference is the main event organised under auspices of the association. In the past years, the following conferences have been organised: A database of all 4,400 abstracts from conferences since 1969, which permits a full-text search through the history of environmental psychology.
