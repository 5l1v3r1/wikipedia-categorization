The World Carfree Network is an international network that coordinates the actions of car-free advocates from around the world. It is the main hub of the global car-free movement. The World Carfree Network brings together roughly 90-member organisations and many more individuals dedicated to promoting alternatives to car dependence and automobile-based planning at the international level. Working to reduce the human impact on the natural environment while improving the quality of life for all are major goals.[dubious  â€“ discuss] The network grew out of the activities of Car Busters, an international organisation within the carfree movement founded in 1997. The name Car Busters continues to be used in its joined spelling for Carbusters Magazine. Carbusters Magazine celebrated ten years of existence in 2008. The Towards Carfree Cities conference series is one of the principal activities every year in the network. The conference has been held so far eight times and on three different continents: The network runs many projects and activities. Some of these are run by the network's International Coordination Centre (ICC). Others are coordinated in a decentralised manner by network members. Others still, such as the Towards Carfree Cities conference series, function by consensus between a project coordinator at the ICC and one or more local partners. Its International Coordination Centre is located in Prague, Czech Republic. See also list of car-free places.
