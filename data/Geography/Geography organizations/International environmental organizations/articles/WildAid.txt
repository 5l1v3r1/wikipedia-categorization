WildAid is an environmental organization based in San Francisco, California, United States.  WildAid focuses on reducing the demand for wildlife products. WildAid works with Asian and Western celebrities and business leaders to dissuade people from purchasing wildlife products via public service announcements and educational initiatives, reaching up to approximately one billion people per week in China alone.  WildAid operates a field program in the Galapagos Islands, protecting the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve, apprehending poachers and smugglers and creating economic alternatives to local communities. WildAid works with media, governments, celebrities and local partners and communities worldwide to make wildlife conservation a global priority. WildAid's original name was Global Survival Network (GSN), which focused on countering wildlife and human trafficking.  GSN was founded and directed by Steven Galster, and one of its main supporter was Suwanna Gauntlett.  At GSN, Peter Knights ran a successful program to reduce demand for wildlife.  In 2000, Galster, Gauntlett, Knights and a colleague of their's, Steve Trent, teamed up to strengthen GSN, focus it on the environment, and re-branded it "WildAid".  Eventually, WildAid's 4 co-directors split up and formed 4 different organizations with different areas of focus: Galster formed Freeland.  Knights maintained directorship of WildAid.  Gauntlett formed Wildlife Alliance.  And Trent formed Environmental Justice Foundation.  Today, WildAid works in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Indonesia, India, and Ecuador with headquarters in San Francisco, California.
