The Global Commons Institute was founded in the United Kingdom in 1990 by Aubrey Meyer and others to campaign for a fair way to tackle climate change.   It has in particular promoted the model of Contraction and Convergence of CO2 emissions as a means to tackle climate change.  Many of the founders and signatories to the first statement in favour of contraction and convergence were members of the Green Party.
