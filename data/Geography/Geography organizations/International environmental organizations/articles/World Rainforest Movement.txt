The World Rainforest Movement (WRM) is an international NGO and Indigenous Peoples' Groups network involved in efforts to defend the world's tropical forests against the forces that destroy them.  Since its creation in 1986, WRM has played an important role as catalyst and critic and has particularly championed the rights of forest-dwelling communities. The idea was to link peoplesâ€™ organisations and movements working on forest related policies and projects of the World Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs) with the aim of countering the influence of the timber industry.  The secretarial of the World Rainforest Movement is based in Montevideo, Uruguay, while its European support office is based in and hosted by FERN and Forest Peoples Programme in Moreton-in-Marsh, United Kingdom.
