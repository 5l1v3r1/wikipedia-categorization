The Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (CCFLA) is a coalition of more than forty organizations actively working to accelerate investment into sustainable infrastructure.   The Alliance brings together a wide range of public and private institutions. For example, the Swiss Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation (GIB) is a member of the CCFLA Steering Committee, and occupies the “Research/NGO/Foundations” seat.  The Alliance was launched at the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Summit in September 2014.  In 2016, R20 Regions of Climate Action was elected to lead the Secretariat of CCFLA, partnering with three other organizations: FMDV, UNDP, and UNEP.
