Polar Bears International (PBI) is a non-profit polar bear conservation organization. Their research, education, and action programs address the issues that are endangering polar bears.  The organization also tracks the activity of polar bears, primarily in Canada, which has helped lead to the animals being listed as an endangered species.  Their Chief Scientist is Steven Amstrup , who was awarded the Indianapolis Prize in 2012.  In partnership with Google, polar bear habitats in Churchill were added to Google Maps in February 2014.   PBI also worked with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to create education programs regarding polar bear conservation.
