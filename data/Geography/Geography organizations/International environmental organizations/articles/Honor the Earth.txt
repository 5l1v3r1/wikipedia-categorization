Honor The Earth is a non-profit organization founded to raise awareness and financial support for Indigenous environmental justice.  The organization was founded by Indigo Girls Amy Ray and Emily Saliers after meeting Winona LaDuke, and after consultation with members of the Indigenous Environmental Network, Indigenous Women's Network and Seventh Generation Fund. Since 2016, Winona LaDuke and other members of Honor the Earth have been active in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.  Honor the Earth's mission is to create awareness and support for Native environmental issues and to develop needed financial and political resources for the survival of sustainable Native communities. Honor the Earth develops these resources by using music, the arts, the media, and Indigenous wisdom to ask people to recognize our joint dependency on the Earth and be a voice for those not heard.  The campaign priorities of Honor the Earth are: Musicians who have held benefit concerts for the organization include Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, and David Crosby.
