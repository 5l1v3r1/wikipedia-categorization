The International Association of Public Transport (UITP, from the French: L’Union internationale des transports publics) is a non-profit advocacy organization for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry. The association was founded on August 17, 1885 by King Leopold II in Brussels, Belgium to support the Belgian tram and steel industries.  UITP supports a holistic approach to urban mobility and advocates for public transport development and sustainable mobility. UITP represents an international network of 1,600 member companies located in 96 countries and covers all modes of public transport – metro,  light rail,   regional and suburban railways, bus,  and waterborne transport.  It also represents collective transport in a broader sense. UITP's network counts one main and EU office in Brussels and fifteen regional and liaison offices worldwide (Abidjan, Astana, Bangalore, Casablanca, Dubai, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Moscow, Rome, São Paulo, Shenzhen, Singapore and Tehran). The General Secretariat in Brussels is managed by Mohamed Mezghani, who has been working for more than 25 years in public transport and urban mobility related fields. He has been the Deputy Secretary General of the Association since January 2014 until his election in 2017; Pere Calvet Tordera is the association's President.
