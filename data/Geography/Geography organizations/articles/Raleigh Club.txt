The Raleigh Club was a dining club founded in 1827. It met at the 'Thatched House', a tavern in the St James area of London as an alternative to the Travellers Club. It was founded by Sir Arthur de Capell Brooke as a place where real exploring travellers could meet, exchange tales and try the cuisine of far-off lands. It was pretty much the nursery of the Royal Geographical Society and became subsumed by that body later in the century. Prominent early membera were Sir John Barrow and Alexander Burnes.
