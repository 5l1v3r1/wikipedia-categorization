  John Bailey Denton (1814–1893) M. Inst. C.E.; F.G.S., was a British surveyor and civil engineer.  When discussing the value of sewage, Denton records that Jean-Baptiste Boussingault, a chemist, demonstrated that a harvest of 800 pounds (360 kg) of wheat and 900 pounds (410 kg) of barley can be obtained from the nearly 16 pounds (7.3 kg) of nitrogen an adult's body-waste produces yearly.  In addition, 9s (£45 at present worth  as of 2018) was calculated by Dr. Augustus Voelcker, the consulting chemist for the Royal Agricultural Society of England, to be the annual value  of ammonia and phosphates excreted per head.  Honorary member of the R.A.S.S. of Denmark, Sweden, and Hanover.  This list is taken from ODNB  and Works by Mr Bailey-Denton, M. Inst. C.E.; F.G.S., in Sewage Disposal (1895).
