Nils Johan Schjander (1859â€“1903) was a Norwegian engineer and a member of the movement known as the Kristiania Bohemians.  He is known for having taken part in a journey to Patagonia and writing a diary, published as En reise til Patagonia (A Journey to Patagonia).  For the Kristiania Bohemians, Patagonia was a promised land where several dreamed of creating a free state.  Schjander was involved in surveying and mapping Patagonia on behalf of the Argentine Southern Land Company between 1889 and 1891.
