A "kilometric point" (French: Point kilométrique, Spanish: Punto kilométrico; PK) is a term used in metricated areas, especially in France and Spain, to provide reference points alongside a transport route such as a road, a railway line or a canal. It is calculated according to the distance in kilometres  from a fixed commencement point. In the English-speaking world, its equivalent would be milepost or mile marker.
