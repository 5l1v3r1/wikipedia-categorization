In the British Isles, an ordnance datum or OD is a vertical datum used by an ordnance survey as the basis for deriving altitudes on maps.  A spot height may be expressed as AOD for "above ordnance datum".  Usually mean sea level (MSL) is used for the datum.  In particular: Tunnel datum is a datum based on an ordnance datum and used in designing tunnels which pass below sea level.  By using a lower datum as the base point, negative numbers can be avoided in calculations, eliminating a possible source of mistakes.
