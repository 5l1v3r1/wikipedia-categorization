The former American Congress on Surveying and Mapping (ACSM) was an international professional association representing the interests of those engaged in measuring and communicating spatial data relating to the Earth's surface. Until recently, ACSM was composed of only two autonomous professional societies, namely: In 2012, ACSM legally merged into the NSPS. But it still considers AAGS to be a closely affiliated member organization. During the 2000s two previous member organizations of ACSM, namely the Cartographic and Geographic Information Society (CaGIS,) first, and then later on, the Geographic and Land Information Society (GLIS) removed themselves more or less from ACSM.  However, GLIS still has some affiliation with NSPS, via their occasional contributions to a former ACSM publications: the quarterly Surveying and Land Information Science (SaLIS) technical journal which is now officially published by the NSPS but also continues to publish submissions from AAGS as well. They also previously contributed to the bimonthly Bulletin, which is no longer in publication.
