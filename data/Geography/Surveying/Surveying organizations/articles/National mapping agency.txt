A national mapping agency is an organisation, usually publicly owned, that produces topographic maps and geographic information of a country. Some national mapping agencies also deal with cadastral matters. The first national mapping agency was the Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom;   its roots go back to 1747, when the compilation of a map of the Scottish Highlands was proposed.   This survey at a scale of 1 inch to 1000 yards (1:36,000)  was the starting point of the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain (1783–1853), and led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey itself; work was begun in earnest in 1790, when the Board of Ordnance began a national military survey at one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360 scale).  During the next thirty years, roughly a third of England and Wales was mapped (see Principal Triangulation of Great Britain), as other military matters took precedence.
