The Bradshaw Model is a geographical model, which describes how a river's characteristics vary between the upper course and lower course of a river. It shows discharge, occupied channel width, channel depth, and how the average load quantity increases downstream,  for example; load particle size, channel bed roughness, and gradient are all characteristics that decrease. This is represented by triangles; an increase in the size of a triangle represents an increase in the variable. Generally it shows the characteristics we expect to see in a river, but due to the nature of rivers and the ever-changing environment in which we live not all rivers fit the model perfectly; therefore the model is usually used in order to compare natural rivers to concepts laid down by the model.
