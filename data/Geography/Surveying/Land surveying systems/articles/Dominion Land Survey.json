Covering about 800,000 square kilometres (310,000&#160;sq&#160;mi), the survey system and its terminology are deeply ingrained in the rural culture of the Prairies. The DLS is the world's largest survey grid laid down in a single integrated system. The first formal survey done in western Canada was by <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Fidler_(explorer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Peter Fidler (explorer)\">Peter Fidler</a> in 1813.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLwS_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLwS-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The inspiration for the Dominion Land Survey System was the plan for Manitoba (and later Saskatchewan and Alberta) to be agricultural economies. With a large amount of European settlers arriving, Manitoba was undergoing a large change so grasslands and parklands were surveyed, settled, and farmed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-poi_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-poi-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The Dominion Land Survey system was developed because the farm name and field position descriptions used in northern Europe were not organized or flexible enough, and the township and concession system used in eastern Canada was not satisfactory. The first meridian was chosen at 97\u00b027\u203228.4\u2033 west longitude and was established in 1869. Another 6 meridians were established after.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLS1_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLS1-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A number of places are excluded from the survey system: these include federal lands such as Indian reserves, federal parks, and air weapon ranges. The surveys do not encroach on reserves because that land was established before the surveys began. When the Hudson's Bay Company relinquished their title to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, via the deed of surrender it received Section 8 and all of Section 26 excluding the northeast quarter. These lands were gradually sold by the company and in 1984 they donated the remaining 5,100 acres (21&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) to the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Saskatchewan_Wildlife_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Saskatchewan Wildlife Association (page does not exist)\">Saskatchewan Wildlife Association</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLS2_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLS2-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The surveying of western Canada was divided into five basic surveys. Each survey's layout was slightly different from the others. The first survey began in 1871 and ended in 1879 and covers some of southern Manitoba and a little of Saskatchewan. The second and smallest survey, in 1880, was used in only small areas of Saskatchewan. This system differs from the first survey because rather than running section lines parallel to the eastern boundary they run true north-south. The largest and most important of these surveys was the third which covers more land than all the others surveys put together. This survey began in 1881. That method of surveying is still used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLS2_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLS2-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The fourth and fifth surveys were used only in some townships in British Columbia.\n</p><p>The reason that the Canadian government was pushing to subdivide Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta was to affirm Canadian sovereignty over these lands. The United States was undergoing rapid expansion in the 1860s, and the Canadian government was afraid that the Americans would expand into Canadian territory. Canada's introduction of a railway and surveying was a means to discourage American encroachment. Sir <a href=\"/wiki/John_A._Macdonald\" title=\"John A. Macdonald\">John A. Macdonald</a> remarked in 1870 that the Americans \"are resolved to do all they can short of war, to get possession of our western territory, and we must take immediate and vigorous steps to counteract them.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLeS_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLeS-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The beginning of the Dominion Land Survey marked a new era for western Canada. Railways were making their way to the West and the population of western regions began to increase. The introduction of the survey system marked the end of the nomadic ways for the First Nations and Metis. This did not go over well and was a catalyst to the events of the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_River_Rebellion\" title=\"Red River Rebellion\">Red River Rebellion</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLeS_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLeS-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Being a surveyor was not easy. The hours were long, the time away from civilization was longer, and the elements were unforgiving. A survey party generally consisted of up to 20 members, which would include a party chief, chain men, a cook, people to saw trees, a recorder, and people to turn angles. All travel was either on horseback or by foot. To begin surveying a party chief would have to buy approximately $400 worth of instruments. These instruments included an <a href=\"/wiki/Alidade\" title=\"Alidade\">alidade</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dumpy_level\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dumpy level\">dumpy level</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Theodolite\" title=\"Theodolite\">theodolite</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gunter%27s_chain\" title=\"Gunter&#39;s chain\">Gunter's chain</a> (which was replaced by a steel tape), and a <a href=\"/wiki/Solar_compass\" title=\"Solar compass\">solar compass</a> or a vernier compass.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLwS_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLwS-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Dominion Land Survey system was proposed in 1869 by <a href=\"/wiki/John_Stoughton_Dennis\" title=\"John Stoughton Dennis\">John Stoughton Dennis</a>. The initial plan, though based on the square townships of the American <a href=\"/wiki/Public_Lands_Survey_System\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Public Lands Survey System\">Public Lands Survey System</a>, involved 9 mile townships divided into sixty-four 800 acre sections consisting of four 200 acre lots each. Work to establish the first meridian and few township outlines began and quickly ended in 1869 when a party of Metis symbolically stepped on a survey chain, beginning the <a href=\"/wiki/Red_River_Resistance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Red River Resistance\">Red River Resistance</a>. Work resumed in 1871; however, the system was redesigned to use 6 mile townships with 640 acre sections based on a suggestion from Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories <a href=\"/wiki/William_McDougall_(politician)\" title=\"William McDougall (politician)\">William McDougall</a>, who advocated that most of the settlers would come from the United States, so it was \"advisable to offer them lots of a size to which they have been accustomed.\" The Dominion Land Survey System still differed from the Public Land System because it contained road allowances.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLeS_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLeS-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Dominion Land Survey was enormous. Around 178,000,000 acres (720,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) are estimated to have been subdivided into quarter sections, 27 million of which were surveyed by 1883 (14 years after the system's inception). The amount of work undertaken between 1871 and 1930 is given justice by the amount of paper work submitted: the maps, plans and memos transferred by the Canadian government to the provinces filled approximately 200 railway cars. This did not include the closed or dormant files which would be enough to fill 9000 filing cabinets, which would weigh about 227 tons.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DLeS_6-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DLeS-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Until very recently, surveying was done with manually controlled instruments to take distance and angular measurements. Distance was measured using either a chain or more recently a transit or range finder. To turn angles a <a href=\"/wiki/Theodolite\" title=\"Theodolite\">theodolite</a> was used. To find their location they used astronomical observations, and to find elevation levels and barometers were used.<sup id=\"cite_ref-asidf_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a

and in reference to other benchmarks on the continent, but were determined using 19th century technology.  The only truly accurate benchmarks at that time were near the prime meridian in Europe.  Benchmarks in other parts of the world had to be calculated or estimated by the positions of the sun and stars.  Consequently, although they were remarkably accurate for the time, today they are known to be several hundred metres in error.  Before the survey was even completed it was established that for the purposes of laws based on the survey, the results of the physical survey would take precedence over the theoretically correct position of the meridians.

Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than the south.  Only along the baselines do townships have their nominal width from east to west.  The two townships to the north of a baseline gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually widen as one moves south.  Halfway between two base lines, wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships.  The east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and north\u2013south roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east or west.

LSDs are numbered as follows (north at top):\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr class=\"center\">\n<td>13</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>16\n</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"center\">\n<td>12</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>9\n</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"center\">\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>8\n</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"center\">\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>In order to fully understand how the townships, sections, quarter sections, and legal subdivisions were set out, one should refer to the <i>Manual of Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Land</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Occasionally, resource companies assign further divisions within LSDs such as \"A, B, C, D etc.\" for example, to distinguish between multiple sites within an LSD.  These in no way constitute an official change to the Dominion Land Survey system, but nonetheless often appear as part of the legal description.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Road_allowances\">Road allowances</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dominion_Land_Survey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Road allowances\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:402px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Dominion-land-survey-township.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Dominion-land-survey-township.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"540\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"400\" data-file-height=\"540\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Dominion-land-survey-township.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Road allowances and special sections in the Dominion Land Survey.</div></div></div>\n<p>Between certain sections of a township run \"road allowances\" (but not all road allowances have an actual road built on them). The road allowances add to the size of the township (they do not cut down the size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly 24 miles (39&#160;km) apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are road allowances of <span class=\"frac nowrap\">1<span class=\"visualhide\">&#160;</span><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> <a href=\"/wiki/Chain_(unit)\" title=\"Chain (unit)\">chains</a> (30&#160;m) surrounding every section. In townships surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in width and in number. They are 1 chain (20&#160;m) wide and run north\u2013south between all sections; however, there are only three east\u2013west road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to 12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a north-south road allowance every mile going west, and an east-west road allowance every two miles going north. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but still provides road-access to every quarter-section. Road allowances are one of the differences between the Canadian DLS and the American <a href=\"/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System\" title=\"Public Land Survey System\">Public Land Survey System</a>, which leaves no extra space for roads.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_sections\">Special sections</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dominion_Land_Survey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Special sections\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Certain sections of townships were reserved for special purposes:\n</p>\n<ul><li>As part of the deal that transferred <a href=\"/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land\" title=\"Rupert&#39;s Land\">Rupert's Land</a> from the <a href=\"/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company\" title=\"Hudson&#39;s Bay Company\">Hudson's Bay Company</a> to Canada, the HBC retained five per cent of the \"fertile belt\" (south of the <a href=\"/wiki/North_Saskatchewan_River\" title=\"North Saskatchewan River\">North Saskatchewan</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Winnipeg_River\" title=\"Winnipeg River\">Winnipeg rivers</a>).  Therefore, Section 8 and three-quarters of Section 26 were assigned to the company.  Additionally, the fourth quarter of Section 26 in townships whose numbers were divisible by five also belonged to the HBC in order to give the company exactly five per cent. Although the HBC sold all these sections long ago, they are still often locally called \"the <b>Bay section</b>\" today.</li>\n<li>The odd-numbered sections (except 11 and 29) were often used for <a href=\"/wiki/Railway\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Railway\">railway</a> land-grants.  The Prairies could not be settled without railways, so the Dominion government habitually granted large tracts of land to railway companies as an incentive to build lines.  Notably, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted 25,000,000 acres (100,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) for the construction of its first line from Ontario to the Pacific.  These sections are colloquially called <b>CPR sections</b> regardless of the railway they were originally granted to.</li>\n<li>Sections 11 and 29 were <b>school sections</b>.  When <a href=\"/wiki/School_board\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School board\">school boards</a> were formed, they gained title to these sections, which were then sold to fund the initial construction of schools.  The rural school buildings were often as not located on school sections; frequently, land trades were made between landowners and the school for practical reasons.</li>\n<li>The remaining quarter sections were available as <b>homesteads</b> under the provisions of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dominion_Lands_Act\" title=\"Dominion Lands Act\">Dominion Lands Act</a>, the federal government's plan for settling the North-West.  A homesteader paid a $10 fee for a quarter section of his choice.  If after three years he had cultivated 30 acres (12&#160;ha) and had built a house (often just a <a href=\"/wiki/Sod_house\" title=\"Sod house\">sod house</a>), he gained title to the quarter.  Homesteads were available as late as the 1950s, but the bulk of the settlement of the Prairies was 1885 to 1914.</li></ul>\n<p>Legal surveys conducted before and after the Dominion Land Survey grid was laid out often have their own legal descriptions and delineations.  Early settlement lots still retain their own original legal descriptions, but often have townships superimposed over them for the sake of convenience or for certain tasks.  Urban developments superimpose new survey lots and plans over the older section and township grid also.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Political_disputes_over_the_survey\">Political disputes over the survey</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dominion_Land_Survey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Political disputes over the survey\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Certain areas otherwise within the surveys' boundaries were not part of the survey grid, or not available for homesteading.

The settlers claimed <a href=\"/wiki/Squatters%27_rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Squatters&#39; rights\">squatters' rights</a> over the land they had already farmed, but the sizes and boundaries of these farms were poorly defined, leading to frequent disputes.  As well the M\u00e9tis in the <a href=\"/wiki/Southbranch_Settlement\" title=\"Southbranch Settlement\">Southbranch settlements</a> of Saskatchewan were particularly with their land rights given that they had not been well protected by the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Manitoba_Act\" title=\"Manitoba Act\">Manitoba Act</a></i> as they had been promised in 1870.  In the case of the closely clustered settlements of Edmonton, St. Albert, and Fort Saskatchewan in the Alberta District, a militant \"settlers' rights\" movement developed which demanded action from the federal government to grant the settlers legal title to their land and to end claim jumping.  The movement even resorted to vigilante action against suspected claim jumpers.  Most of these grievances were resolved by 1885, which is likely one of the reasons the area never joined the <a href=\"/wiki/North-West_Rebellion\" title=\"North-West Rebellion\">North-West Rebellion</a> despite the fact that St. Albert, and to a lesser extent Edmonton, were largely populated by M\u00e9tis people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Macleod1993_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Macleod1993-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dominion_Land_Survey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Alberta_Township_System\" title=\"Alberta Township System\">Alberta Township System</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Concession_road\" title=\"Concession road\">Concession road</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Section_(United_States_land_surveying)\" title=\"Section (United States land surveying)\">Section (United States land surveying)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/The_Association_of_British_Columbia_Land_Surveyors\" title=\"The Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors\">The Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dominion_Land_Survey&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-taylor-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-taylor_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-taylor_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Lands-A-History-of-Survey-Systems.pdf\"><i>Crown Lands: A History of Survey Systems</i></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184529/http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Lands-A-History-of-Survey-Systems.pdf\">Archived</a> July 6, 2011, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>., by W.A.
