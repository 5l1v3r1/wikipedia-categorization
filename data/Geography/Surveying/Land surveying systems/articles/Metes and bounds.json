The system is also used in the Canadian province of <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a>. <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> By custom, it was applied in the original <a href=\"/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies\" title=\"Thirteen Colonies\">Thirteen Colonies</a> that became the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, and in many other land jurisdictions based on <a href=\"/wiki/English_law\" title=\"English law\">English</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Common_law\" title=\"Common law\">common law</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Typically the system uses physical features of the local <a href=\"/wiki/Geography\" title=\"Geography\">geography</a>, along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land. The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a <a href=\"/wiki/Point_of_beginning\" title=\"Point of beginning\">point of beginning</a>, returning to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of <a href=\"/wiki/Beating_the_bounds\" title=\"Beating the bounds\">beating the bounds</a>. It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys. At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments.\nSurveying has been a subjective process open to interpretation by the person or persons producing the document as well as open discussion to the persons abiding by the document. The variables that originally defined the \"bounds\" need to be converted to metes by more modern methods. Today the word \"art\" is being used when discussing surveying as in Surveying is an \"Art\" leaving much to surveyor opinion to \"update\" the existing deed. In most areas, urban deeds have defined the boundary lines sufficiently to buy and sell land with sufficient clarity however as one moves further into larger parcels the subjectivity grows.     \n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Metes.</b>  The term \"metes\" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing, or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods.</li>\n<li><b>Bounds.</b>  The term \"bounds\" refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public <a href=\"/wiki/Road\" title=\"Road\">road</a> way, or an existing building.  The system is often used to define larger pieces of property (e.g. farms), and political subdivisions (e.g. town boundaries) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description.</li></ul>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Usage\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Usage</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Resolving_inconsistencies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Resolving inconsistencies</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Difficulties\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Difficulties</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#History_of_use_in_the_United_States\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History of use in the United States</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Use_of_the_term_in_patent_law\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Use of the term in patent law</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Usage\">Usage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Metes_and_bounds&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Usage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A typical description for a small parcel of land would be: \"beginning with a corner at the intersection of two stone walls near an apple tree on the north side of Muddy Creek road one mile above the junction of Muddy and Indian Creeks, north for 150 rods to the end of the stone wall bordering the road, then northwest along a line to a large standing rock on the corner of the property now or formerly belonging to John Smith, thence west 150 rods to the corner of a barn near a large oak tree, thence south to Muddy Creek road, thence down the side of the creek road to the starting point.\"\n</p><p>The sequence begins with an identified corner serving as benchmark.  The description then gives distance, direction and various boundary descriptions as if one were walking the bounds pacing off the distance to the next corner where there is a change of direction. Where watercourses form part of the bounds their meander is generally taken as a straight line between the established corners and their monuments.\n</p><p>In many deeds, the direction is described not by azimuth (a clockwise degree measure out of 360 degrees), but instead by bearing (a direction north or south followed by a degree measure out of 90 degrees and another direction west or east). For example, such a bearing might be listed as \"N 42\u00b035' W\", which means that the bearing is 42\u00b035' counterclockwise, or west of north.\n</p><p>This has the advantage of providing the same degree measure regardless of which direction a particular boundary is being followed; the boundary can be traversed in the opposite direction simply by exchanging N for S and E for W. In other words, \"N 42\u00b035' W\" describes the same boundary as \"S 42\u00b035' E\", but is traversed in the opposite direction.\n</p><p>In most distance measures, especially those in older deeds and where measuring distances over a furlong, boundary lengths are listed in <a href=\"/wiki/Rod_(unit)\" title=\"Rod (unit)\">rods</a> or poles instead of feet or meters. Rods and poles are equivalent measures equaling 16.5 <a href=\"/wiki/Foot_(length)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Foot (length)\">feet</a>. There are four rods in one chain. The old English surveyors actually carried chains 66 feet in length with which to measure lengths, as well as poles 16.5 feet long, and many older legal descriptions of real estate in the United States are given in chains and poles.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resolving_inconsistencies\">Resolving inconsistencies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Metes_and_bounds&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Resolving inconsistencies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some courts have established a list of priorities to resolve inconsistent descriptions of corners. In descending order starting with the most reliable: (1) natural monuments, (2) artificial monuments such as roads and marked or surveyed lines, (3) adjacent tracts or boundaries, (4) courses or directions, (5) distances, and (6) area or quantity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Difficulties\">Difficulties</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Metes_and_bounds&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Difficulties\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Once such a survey is in place, the corners may have to depend on tradition and long use to establish the line along the boundaries between them. In some areas where land was deeded before 1593 the lengths given predate the changes to the length of the <a href=\"/wiki/Furlong\" title=\"Furlong\">furlong</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mile\" title=\"Mile\">mile</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England\" title=\"Elizabeth I of England\">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. In other places references to the official borders of towns, counties, states and even the U.S. may have changed. Compass directions always have to be tied to a table of annual deflections because magnetic north is constantly changing. The description might refer to <i>landmarks</i> such as the <i>large oak tree</i> which could die, rot and disappear; or be confused with a different tree that had grown over time. Streams might dry up, meander or change course. Man-made features such as roads, walls, markers or stakes used to mark corners and determine the line of the boundaries between corners may have been moved. As these features move, change and disappear over time, when it comes time to re-establish the corners along the line of these boundaries (for sale, subdivision, or building construction) it can become difficult, even impossible, to determine the original location of the corner. In the metes and bounds system, corners, distance, direction, monuments and bounds are always carried back to the original intent regardless of where they are now. Court cases are sometimes required to settle the matter when it is suspected the corner markers may have been moved.\n</p><p>These kinds of problems caused the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> to largely replace this system except in the east. Beginning with the <a href=\"/wiki/Land_Ordinance_of_1785\" title=\"Land Ordinance of 1785\">Land Ordinance of 1785</a>, it began a transition to the <a href=\"/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System\" title=\"Public Land Survey System\">Public Land Survey System</a> (PLSS) used in the central and western states. The eastern, or original states, continue to use the metes and bounds surveys of their founders.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_use_in_the_United_States\">History of use in the United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Metes_and_bounds&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: History of use in the United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This system was imported to the original colonies that formed the United States. It is also used in some states that were previously part of one of the <a href=\"/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies\" title=\"Thirteen Colonies\">Thirteen Colonies</a>, or where land was allocated before 1785. These include <a href=\"/wiki/West_Virginia\" title=\"West Virginia\">West Virginia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kentucky\" title=\"Kentucky\">Kentucky</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Maine\" title=\"Maine\">Maine</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tennessee\" title=\"Tennessee\">Tennessee</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Vermont\" title=\"Vermont\">Vermont</a>. Because <a href=\"/wiki/Texas\" title=\"Texas\">Texas</a> was an <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_of_Texas\" title=\"Republic of Texas\">independent republic</a> prior to statehood, its land system is primarily metes and bounds.\n</p><p>Election constituency boundaries continue to be described by the use of metes and bounds, even in jurisdictions where land <a href=\"/wiki/Plat\" title=\"Plat\">plats</a> are not otherwise based upon metes and bounds. Such mapping generally uses streets and their intersections to define the boundaries of election districts, wards, precincts, <i>inter alia</i>. <i>E.g.</i>: \"From the intersection of Main Street and John Doe Boulevard, thence north to ABC Drive, thence generally east along the median of ABC Drive to 123rd Street, thence...\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_of_the_term_in_patent_law\">Use of the term in patent law</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Metes_and_bounds&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Use of the term in patent law\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In patent law, an application provides background and disclosure necessary to describe an invention, but it is the <a href=\"/wiki/Claim_(patent)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Claim (patent)\">claims</a> that define the protected aspects.  It is therefore said that the claims set out the metes and bounds (see, e.g. in <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_patent_law\" title=\"United States patent law\">United States patent law</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Manual_of_Patent_Examining_Procedure\" title=\"Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\">Manual of Patent Examining Procedure</a> \u00a7 2173.05(a)) for the protected invention.
