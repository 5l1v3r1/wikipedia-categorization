The Delaware-Maryland-Pennsylvania Tri-State Marker is a stone marker marking the tri-point at the northwestern corner of Delaware, the northeastern corner of Maryland, and the southern edge of Pennsylvania.  A wooden marker was placed in 1765, by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, but was replaced with a stone marker in 1849. A trail to the marker was made in 2014 to 2015. Mason and Dixon placed the wooden marker on June 6, 1765.  It was replaced in 1849 by a stone marker.   At one point, the marker went missing, so Lt. Col. Graham, of the U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers, was sent out to replace it.  He located the marker, but replaced it in the wrong location.  In 1892, W.C. Hodgkins was sent to resurvey the area, and he fixed the location of the marker.  The marker was hard to access, as it was on private land, so in December 2011, Pennsylvania bought the land on the Pennsylvania side of the marker, while the Delaware and Maryland sides remained as private lands.  A plan for a 4-mile trail to the marker, the Tri-State Trail progressed in 2012 and 2013. The Northern Trail, or Phase 1, was finished in 2014, and the Southern Trail, or Phase 1, was finished in 2015.
