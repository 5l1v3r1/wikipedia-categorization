Townships were originally surveyed and <a href=\"/wiki/Plat\" title=\"Plat\">platted</a> by the United States General Land Office, using contracted private survey crews, and are marked on the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey\" title=\"United States Geological Survey\">United States Geological Survey</a> maps of the United States.\n</p><p>Townships are normally a square approximately six miles (9.7&#160;km) on a side with <a href=\"/wiki/Cardinal_direction\" title=\"Cardinal direction\">cardinal</a> boundaries conforming to meridians and parallels, containing 36 sections of one square mile (2.6&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) each. The northern and westernmost tier of sections in each township are designed to take up the convergence of the east and west township boundary lines or range lines, as well as any error in the survey measurements, and therefore these sections vary slightly from being one square mile or 640 acres (260&#160;ha).

In Tennessee, the entire state is surveyed into townships and ranges that make up 13 survey districts of the Tennessee State Survey. In extreme northern Maine there is an area divided into townships and ranges oriented to true north. A region in the central part of the state, made up of 17 surveys, is divided into townships, but these are not oriented to true north.  The remainder of the state is on <a href=\"/wiki/Metes_and_bounds\" title=\"Metes and bounds\">metes and bounds</a>. Similarly, Vermont and New Hampshire are mostly metes-and-bounds states, but have areas in the north that are surveyed into townships not oriented to true north. Most of Ohio is surveyed using the Public Land Survey System, but several sizable areas are metes-and-bounds, including the Virginia Military Reserve, Donation Tract, French Grant and the three Moravian grants (Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrunn and Salem).  A 150,000-acre (61,000&#160;ha) area in southern Indiana (<a href=\"/wiki/Clark%27s_Grant\" title=\"Clark&#39;s Grant\">Clark's Grant</a>) is not surveyed into townships, but is still a gridded survey.  Portions of the Texas State Survey use square townships. Sizeable portions of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona are unsurveyed. Substantial swampy areas in Florida and Louisiana are also unsurveyed.\n</p><p>Both New York and Pennsylvania have metes-and-bounds surveys, but in the western parts of these states, the metes-and-bounds form square townships many of which are also civil townships.  Besides these, nearly every state has areas of metes-and-bounds that were never included in the grids (like along major rivers) or were removed from the grid, usually due to surveying mistakes.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Civil_townships\">Civil townships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Township_(United_States)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Civil townships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_township\" title=\"Civil township\">Civil township</a></div>\n<p>The township government is a unit of local government, often rural. Townships are geographic and political subdivisions of a <a href=\"/wiki/County_(United_States)\" title=\"County (United States)\">county</a>. The township is identified by a name, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Raritan_Township,_New_Jersey\" title=\"Raritan Township, New Jersey\">Raritan Township, New Jersey</a>. The responsibilities and the form of the township government is specified by the <a href=\"/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)\" title=\"State legislature (United States)\">state legislature</a>.\n</p><p>The most common form of township government has an elected board of trustees or supervisors. Some additional offices, such as clerk or <a href=\"/wiki/Constable#United_States\" title=\"Constable\">constable</a>, may also be elected. The most common governmental responsibilities of townships include oversight of such things as road maintenance, <a href=\"/wiki/Land-use_planning\" title=\"Land-use planning\">land-use planning</a>, and trash collection. Many townships in Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania provide police and fire protection, similar to what an incorporated city would provide.\n</p><p>In most <a href=\"/wiki/Midwest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Midwest\">midwestern states</a>, a civil township often corresponds to a single survey township, although in less populated areas, the civil township may be made up of all or portions of several survey townships. In areas where there are natural features such as a lake or river, the civil township boundaries may follow the geographic features rather than the survey township boundaries. Municipalities such as cities may incorporate or annex land in a township, which is then generally removed from township government. Only one state, <a href=\"/wiki/Indiana\" title=\"Indiana\">Indiana</a>, has township governments covering all its area and population.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In other states, some types of municipalities, like villages, remain a part of the township while cities are not.

In Michigan, as in other states with like systems (though sometimes different names), a township is an administrative division of a county, which is an administrative division of the state. Counties and townships are local organs through which state law and public policy are administered, adapted to local need to the extent the law allows. A charter township is a township that has been granted a charter, which allows it certain rights and responsibilities of home rule that are generally intermediary in scope between those of a city (a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Michigan) and a village, which (unless it is a home-rule village) is subject to the authority of the township(s) in which it is located.\n</p><p>Charter townships may also reorganize themselves into municipalities, as can be seen in <a href=\"/wiki/Wayne_County,_Michigan\" title=\"Wayne County, Michigan\">Wayne County, Michigan</a>, and elsewhere in the <a href=\"/wiki/Detroit_metropolitan_area\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Detroit metropolitan area\">Detroit metropolitan area</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Census_statistics\">Census statistics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Township_(United_States)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Census statistics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Towns and townships are considered <a href=\"/wiki/Minor_civil_division\" title=\"Minor civil division\">minor civil divisions</a> of counties by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau\" title=\"United States Census Bureau\">United States Census Bureau</a> for statistical purposes.

In Minnesota, the terms town and township are used interchangeably with regard to township governments. Although towns in the six New England states and New York, and townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are legally termed municipal corporations, perform municipal-type functions, and frequently serve densely populated urban areas, they have no necessary relation to concentration of population, and are thus counted for census purposes as town or township governments.
