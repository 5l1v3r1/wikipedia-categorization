Texhoma is a town in Texas County, Oklahoma, United States.  The population was 926 at the 2010 census.  Texhoma is a divided city with the Texas–Oklahoma state border separating the town from Texhoma, Texas.  The name of the town is a portmanteau of Texas and Oklahoma.   Founded around the Rock Island Railroad laying tracks through the area, much of the town's local economy is from ranching and livestock. Before No Man's Land was opened for settlers in 1890, the area now known as the Oklahoma Panhandle was sparsely settled ranchland. After the opening some of the land was filed on near the ranch headquarters, mostly by the cowboys, and sold to the ranch as soon as proved up. Expansion of the Rock Island Railroad tracks from Liberal, Kansas to Santa Rosa, New Mexico spurred the settlement's formation. A post office named Loretta was established May 7, 1898, but the name and location was changed to Texhoma on November 12, 1901, as there was another Loretta, Oklahoma. Very few claims were filed on until the railroad was assured. The town grew quickly to a population near 1,000, serving as the closest railroad town to the people who lived as far north and west as present Boise City, and south into the Texas Panhandle to the present town of Gruver. The land was quickly homesteaded and proved to be a rich agricultural area. Texhoma is located at 36°30′16″N 101°47′11″W﻿ / ﻿36.50444°N 101.78639°W﻿ / 36.50444; -101.78639 (36.504421, -101.786517).
