A united city is one which, as a consequence of political changes or border shifts, once constituted two separate entities that were later merged. (See also Divided cities)  The Canadian city of Lloydminster, although divided by a provincial border, can be considered a "united city" as it is administered as a single city through a special joint agreement between the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Similarly, the city of Flin Flon, which straddles the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border, is also administered as a single city by a similar joint agreement.
