 This is a list of countries which border two or more oceans, including both sovereign states and dependencies, provided the same contiguous territory borders on more than one of the five named oceans, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic.  Countries which border on multiple oceans because of discontiguous regions are excluded here but included in the list of transcontinental countries.
