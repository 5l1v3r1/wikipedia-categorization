The 30th annual National Geographic Bee were held in Washington, D.C. It is sponsored by the National Geographic Society. The State Bees were held on April 6, where the 54 finalists will be determined. On April 6, 2018, the National Geographic State Bees were held across the 50 states, Washington, D.C., the Atlantic Territories, the Pacific Territories, and the Department of Defense. Fifty-four State or Territory level Champions were determined. In 2018, the prize for winning the state bee has been raised, as $200 is now given to the winner instead of $100, the old prize. The winners have also received a National Geographic Visual Atlas of the World, Second Edition. Second and third place winners received $150 and $100, respectively. The state preliminary rounds (there were 8 total) consisted of rounds about U.S. geography, international geography, current events, national birds, protecting the environment, Weird but True, and a “GeoChallenge”. The GeoChallenge was a True/False round where a statement would be made about a U.S. state’s population, GDP, or size, comparing it to another country, and the student would have to say if it was True or False. For example, one question was “Virginia has a higher GDP than Portugal, True or False?”-the answer is true. The 54 state champions competed in the preliminary rounds held from May 21-22, 2018. This part of the contest consisted of 10 oral rounds as well as a written portion. After the preliminary rounds, ten competitors advanced to the championship round. These competitors were: Sean Cheng, New Hampshire 19/20 (10/10 + 9/10) Gayatri Kaimal, Arizona 18/20 (10/10 + 8/10) Venkat Ranjan, California 18/20 (9/10 + 9/10) Atreya Mallanna, Massachusetts 18/20 (10/10 + 8/10) Anoushka Buddhikot, New Jersey 18/20 (10/10 + 8/10) Jonathan Song, North Carolina 18/20 (8/10 + 10/10) Saket Pochiraju, Ohio 18/20 (9/10 + 9/10) Vishal Sareddy, Georgia 17/20 (8/10 + 9/10) Ashwin Sivakumar, Oregon 17/20 (8/10 + 9/10) Nihar Janga, Texas 17/20 (10/10 + 7/10) The top 10 contestants with the highest scores in the preliminary rounds was held May 23, 2018. Venkat Ranjan from California was the champion, with Anoushka Buddhikot from New Jersey coming 2nd, and Vishal Sareddy from Georgia placing third. Once the top three had been decided, Sareddy, Ranjan and Buddhikot were asked another "Geochallenge Question." They were asked to choose the best location for a new river clean-up effort. They were asked to choose from the Rhine River, Yangtze River and Niger River. (Yangtze was the correct answer.) After the responses were scored, Buddhikot and Ranjan advanced to the championship round, which was played in sudden death format. The first question: "What country borders the Wetar and Omboi Straits?" was answered correctly (East Timor) by both contestants. Then, a second question: "Lebanon has a population most similar to what South American country?" was answered correctly by Ranjan (Paraguay) and he was declared the winner.
