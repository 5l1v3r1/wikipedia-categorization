First run in 2003 as part of AAA's centennial celebrations, the competition became an annual event and a premier high school scholarship program for a time.  The competition was notable for its national coverage\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The National Finals were held yearly in <a href=\"/wiki/Orlando,_Florida\" title=\"Orlando, Florida\">Orlando, Florida</a>. In its five years of existence, the contest awarded over $600,000 worth of scholarships. The 2007 competition featured a $20,000 top prize (down from $25,000 in past years), won by Samuel Brandt of Oregon. In addition, the 2007 competition, for the first time, also included a separate essay contest for those interested in seeking majors in travel-, tourism-, or hospitality-related careers.\n</p><p>Often compared to the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Geographic_Bee\" title=\"National Geographic Bee\">National Geographic Bee</a>, a middle-school competition, the AAA Travel Challenge featured a similar format, with a local, state, and national level, each with progressively tougher questions and material. Unlike the National Geography Bee, however, the AAA Travel Challenge stressed team competition, rather than individual achievement.\n</p><p>The 2007 competition was the last Challenge to take place. Afterwards, administrators opted for a one-year hiatus from the program. Challenge administrators had hoped to use this hiatus to work out and analyze the event \"to develop strategies and tactics for an improved program.\" AAA decided that it would be best to find a single co-sponsor for the event, rather than the multiple sponsors who had supported the competition in previous years. Unfortunately, the recession and other factors made this difficult. On September 26, 2008, it was announced that the Challenge would be discontinued.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Eligibility\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Eligibility</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Procedure\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Procedure</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Registration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Registration</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Stage_One:_Internet_Test\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stage One: Internet Test</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Stage_Two:_The_State_Test\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stage Two: The State Test</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Stage_Three:_The_National_Finals\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Stage Three: The National Finals</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Phase_One:_The_Preliminary_Test\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Phase One: The Preliminary Test</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Phase_Two:_The_Individual_Competition\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Phase Two: The Individual Competition</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#The_Team_Rounds_(2003-2006)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Team Rounds (2003-2006)</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Question_Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Question Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Prizes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prizes</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Trivia_Competition\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Trivia Competition</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Essay_Competition\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Essay Competition</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Champions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Champions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eligibility\">Eligibility</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Eligibility\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Students were eligible to participate in the AAA Travel High School Challenge if they met the following requirements (from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.aaa.com/TravelChallenge/contestrules.html\">Official Site</a>):\n</p>\n<ul><li>Must be a legal US resident residing in a US state or the District of Columbia.

Eligible students could apply and create a unique username and password which they would later use for the Stage One Internet test. From 2007 onward, students could also indicate if they desired to participate in the travel career-related Essay Competition.\n</p><p>A student could, at any time, take a Practice Test offered on the Official Site, which gave a general sampling of questions that might have appeared.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stage_One:_Internet_Test\">Stage One: Internet Test</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Stage One: Internet Test\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>For a specified period of time in January (usually 8\u201310 days), the Official Site would run the Stage One qualifying test. After students entered their unique user name and password, they would then proceed to the test.\n</p><p>The test consisted of 40 multiple-choice travel-themed questions to be completed in 15 minutes time (20 minutes from 2003\u20132006), with a countdown clock visible throughout the test. No two tests were alike, as the questions were picked from a pool of several thousand questions, with each test being \"weighted\" with an equal number of easy, medium, and hard questions. Neither reference materials (printed or electronic) nor help from another person was allowed, and this was agreed to when a student checked the \"Integrity Oath\" box during registration.\n</p><p>Questions had to do with destinations popular with American tourists, with most questions centering on the United States and foreign destinations such as Europe and East Asia.\n</p><p>The top five scorers in each state would advance to Stage Two (state of residence, not school, determined in which state one is competing for). In the event of a tie, the student(s) who used the least amount of time to answer questions would advance (from 2003\u20132006, random drawings initially served as tiebreakers). If a tie still existed, then, like in previous years, a random drawing determined who advances. These Top Five were usually notified 1\u20132 weeks after the testing period ended via e-mail. If one of the five was unable to continue, or if nothing was heard from after 72 hours of the notification e-mail being sent, then the next highest scorer would be notified.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stage_Two:_The_State_Test\">Stage Two: The State Test</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Stage Two: The State Test\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Once all five in each state and D.C. had been confirmed (255 across the nation), each student would be sent an information packet with instructions for Stage Two.\n</p><p>Stage Two was another 40 multiple-choice question, 15-minute test (20 minutes from 2003\u20132006), this time, however, written and taken at the nearest AAA Office nearest to the contestant's home. The test was monitored by a AAA Official. The time period for taking the test was usually three days in March, and arrangements (through AAA) had to have been made with the office at which the test would be taken.\n</p><p>Questions again focused on tourist destinations, but this time become more global in nature and slightly more obscure. It is unknown whether tests were the same throughout the nation or if each state or even each individual received different tests, like Stage One.\n</p><p>The winner, the top scorer of the five in each state, was notified approximately one week after the testing period finishes. If the winner was unable to proceed, then the next highest scorer would notified. In the event of a tie for the top score, a random drawing determined the winner.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stage_Three:_The_National_Finals\">Stage Three: The National Finals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Stage Three: The National Finals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The National Finals were a four-day event usually held in early to mid May. Each of the 51 Stage Two Winners and one chaperone per finalist were awarded an all-expenses paid trip to <a href=\"/wiki/Orlando,_Florida\" title=\"Orlando, Florida\">Orlando</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a>, for the competition. Additional guests could attend, and arrangements could be made through <a href=\"/wiki/American_Automobile_Association\" title=\"American Automobile Association\">AAA Travel</a> at the expense of the Finalist's family.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_One:_The_Preliminary_Test\">Phase One: The Preliminary Test</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Phase One: The Preliminary Test\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The first phase was a preliminary test taken by all 51 finalists, usually in a conference room held at a sponsor hotel. The test was once again a monitored 40-question multiple choice written test to be completed in 20 minutes. Questions at this level were at their hardest yet, focusing mostly on global destinations, some familiar, but most obscure.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phase_Two:_The_Individual_Competition\">Phase Two: The Individual Competition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Phase Two: The Individual Competition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The top 24 scorers on the written test were invited back to participate in Phase Two (random drawings served as tiebreakers). These 24 contestants were then divided into six preliminary groups, consisting of four participants each. Contestants within each group then participated in a single-elimination oral competition, answering more questions covering the material. One winner emerged in each group, and these six winners advanced to the second half of Phase Two.\n</p><p>The second half of Phase Two was an individual competition introduced for the 2006 Challenge. The six finalists (which, in 2006 only, were actually the twelve finalists who had participated in the team rounds) were brought out and assigned a random order to sit in on the stage. Each contestant was then asked a question, one by one, by moderator Dr. <a href=\"/wiki/Marc_Mancini\" title=\"Marc Mancini\">Marc Mancini</a>. In a manner similar to the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Spelling_Bee\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Spelling Bee\">National Spelling Bee</a>, if the student answered correctly, he advanced to the next round. If not, then the student was eliminated. If all the contestants in a round answered incorrectly, then all were brought back to participate in the next round.\n</p><p>The winner was the contestant who managed to answer his/her question correctly while everyone else in the round answered incorrectly, in addition to one more question. Such procedures allowed for ties for second and third place, as shown in the <a href=\"/wiki/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge#Champions\" title=\"AAA Travel High School Challenge\">results of the 2006 and 2007 competitions</a>.\n</p><p>After another day to enjoy Orlando, a banquet was held at the <a href=\"/wiki/Hard_Rock_Cafe\" title=\"Hard Rock Cafe\">Hard Rock Live</a> that evening. Prizes were officially awarded as well as other miscellaneous closing remarks and \"housekeeping notes\".\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"The_Team_Rounds_.282003-2006.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Team_Rounds_(2003-2006)\">The Team Rounds (2003-2006)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: The Team Rounds (2003-2006)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Top 12 scorers, with random drawings acting as tiebreakers, advanced to the second phase of the competition. These finalists were usually announced about 30 minutes after testing had completed. Afterwards the twelve finalists stayed for a briefing and practice round, as all were later released to enjoy Orlando.\n</p><p>The next day the 12 remaining contestants as well as the 39 other finalists and families gathered for the Final Round, usually at <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_Orlando\" title=\"Universal Orlando\">Universal Orlando</a> (this competition was sometimes open to the public). The 12 Finalists had been divided into four teams of three contestants each. Three game-show style rounds were conducted. The first featured two teams versus each other. The second put the other two teams against each other. The winners of each of these rounds advanced to a final head-to-head round.\n</p><p>A round lasted 20 minutes, and featured these types of questions:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Gateway Questions</b> - worth 20 points, these were toss-up questions that could be answered by any team member buzzing in. If a contestant answered incorrectly, 20 points were deducted from the team's score, and the other team was then given a chance to answer. Team members were not allowed to consult with each other.</li>\n<li><b>Add-On Questions</b> - posed to a team once one of their team members had answered a Gateway Question correctly. The question was divided into three parts, with each part worth ten points (e.g. \"Name the three North American national capital cities with the word 'City' in their name\"). Team members were allowed to consult with each other, and no points were deducted for an incorrect response.</li>\n<li><b>Upgrade Questions</b> - a special kind of add-on, where teams could significantly increase their point total. Before the question was posed, the team was given a category to which the question pertained. The team then could wager up to 100 or their total number of points, whichever was lower. If the question was answered correctly, the team was awarded that number of points. An incorrect answer deducted that number of points from the team's score.</li></ul>\n<p>The winner of the round was the team with the highest score. The team competition was discontinued in 2007.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Question_Sources\">Question Sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Question Sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://emarketing.delmarlearning.com/AAA_travelchallenge_05Promo.asp?camp=CTTMAEE105\"><i>Selling Destinations</i>, 4th Edition</a>, by Dr. Marc Mancini (who also moderates the National Final Round and writes most of the questions)</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://aaa.com/TravelChallenge/files/AAA_2007_Travel_Challenge_Exploring_the_World_form.pdf\"><i>Exploring the World, First Edition</i></a>, by the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Travel_Institute&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Travel Institute (page does not exist)\">Travel Institute</a></li>\n<li>AAA TourBooks &amp; TravelBooks</li>\n<li>AAA North America and World Atlases</li>\n<li>Encarta Encyclopedia</li>\n<li>Any other travel geography resource material</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prizes\">Prizes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Prizes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trivia_Competition\">Trivia Competition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Trivia Competition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>All participants in <b>Stage One</b> were given the option of printing a Certificate of Participation after completion of the Internet exam.\n</p><p>Individual states awarded miscellaneous prizes to participants of <b>Stage Two</b>, but none were awarded by AAA itself.\n</p><p>All <b>Stage Three</b> finalists were awarded the following by AAA and various sponsors:\n</p>\n<ul><li>An all-expenses paid trip to Orlando, Florida, for them and one chaperone each.</li>\n<li>Two-day two-park passes for <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_Orlando\" title=\"Universal Orlando\">Universal Orlando</a> (usually intended to be used during the National Finals)</li>\n<li>A $1,000 US Savings Bond</li>\n<li>Two $150 AAA Gift Cards (one for the finalist, and one for the chaperone)</li>\n<li>A trophy</li></ul>\n<p>The Top 24 Semifinalists (12 from 2003\u20132006) each received an additional $1,000 US Savings Bond and a trophy different from other finalists.\n</p><p>Top Prizes\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>2003-2005</b>\n<ul><li>First Place (team), a $25,000 Scholarship for each team member</li>\n<li>Second Place (team), a $10,000 Scholarship for each team member</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>2006</b>\n<ul><li>First Place (individual), a $25,000 Scholarship</li>\n<li>Second Place (individual), a $15,000 Scholarship</li>\n<li>Third Place (individual), a $10,000 Scholarship</li>\n<li>First Place (team), a $10,000 U.S. Savings Bond for each team member</li>\n<li>Second Place (team), a $5,000 U.S. Savings Bond for each team member</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>2007</b>\n<ul><li>First Place, a $20,000 Scholarship</li>\n<li>Second Place, a $10,000 Scholarship</li>\n<li>Third Place, a $5,000 Scholarship\u2021</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>\u2021Due to a four-way tie for third place, a last minute executive decision doubled the Third Place prize money to $10,000, which was to be split evenly among the four students ($2,500 each).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Essay_Competition\">Essay Competition</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Essay Competition\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>2007</b>\n<ul><li>All Stage Two Finalists received a $1,000 Scholarship for any travel, tourism, or hospitality-related career studies</li>\n<li>The national essay winner received a $5,000 Scholarship for any travel, tourism, or hospitality-related career studies</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Champions\">Champions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Champions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>No two First Place champions (either individual or team) came from the same state.
