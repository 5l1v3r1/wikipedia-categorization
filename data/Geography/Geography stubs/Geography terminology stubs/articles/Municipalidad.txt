Municipalidad (Spanish pronunciation: [munisipaliˈðað]) is a Spanish term for municipality used in many Latin American countries such as Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Puerto Rico. It refers to the governing body of a particular territory and not to the territory, which is often referred to as "municipio". In Chile the territory governed is called a "comuna", which is the third-level administrative division of the country.
