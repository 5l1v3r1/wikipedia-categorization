In physical geography and geology the headwall of a glacial cirque is its highest cliff. The term has been more broadly used to describe similar geomorphic features of non-glacial origin consisting of a concave depression with convergent slopes typically of 65 percent or greater forming the upper end of a drainage valley.  In civil engineering, a headwall is a small retaining wall placed at the inlet or outlet of a stormwater pipe or culvert.
