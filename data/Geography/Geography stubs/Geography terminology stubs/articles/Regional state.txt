A regional state or a regionalised unitary state, is a unitary state in which authority has been decentralized to subnational regions. This term has yet to become widely used. One such example of a state is Ethiopia, which has been divided into ethnic-based regions. Another example is the United Kingdom, where Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have all been given their own degrees of devolution (i.e. a devolved government) Subnational regions are intermediate level between local and national government.
