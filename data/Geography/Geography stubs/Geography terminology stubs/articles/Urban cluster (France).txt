In France, a pôle urbain is a statistical area defined by INSEE (France's national statistics office) for the measurement of contiguously built-up areas. It shares the same definition as a unité urbaine ("urban area"), but differing in that it is not contained within the couronne périurbaine (commuter belt) of any other pôle urbain; in other words, a pôle urbain is an urban area that is a core of demographic growth. Please see unité urbaine and aire urbaine for more detail.
