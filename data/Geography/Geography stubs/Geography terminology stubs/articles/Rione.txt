Rione (Italian pronunciation: [riˈoːne]; plural: rioni) is the name given to a neighbourhood in several Italian cities. A rione is a territorial subdivision. The larger administrative subdivisions in Rome are the Municipi, with the rioni being used only in the historic centre. The word derives from the Latin: regiones, the 14 subdivisions of Rome imposed by Augustus.  The term has been adopted as a synonym of quartiere in the Italian comuni.
