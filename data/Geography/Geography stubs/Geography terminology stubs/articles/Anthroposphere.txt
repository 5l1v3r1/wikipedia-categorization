The anthroposphere (sometimes also referred as technosphere) is that part of the environment that is made or modified by humans for use in human activities and human habitats. It is one of the Earth's spheres.  As human technology becomes more evolved, such as the greater ability of technology to cause deforestation, the impact of human activities on the environment potentially increases.
