A division is a type of administrative division of some Asian and African countries, as well as a sub-division of entities in England. Some have been dissolved or been renamed. Some of the hundreds and wapentakes in England (both historic subdivisions of the historic counties) were subdivided into divisions. Also a number of the Wards of the City of London are, or were, divided into two divisions.
