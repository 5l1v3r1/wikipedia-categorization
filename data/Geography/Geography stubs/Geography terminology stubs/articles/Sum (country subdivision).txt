Sum, sumu, sumon, and somon (Plural: sumd) are a type of administrative district used in China, Mongolia, and Russia. In Inner Mongolia, a sumu (Mongolian: ᠰᠤᠮᠤ, transliteration: sumu; Chinese: 苏木, pinyin: sūmù) is a township-level political/administrative division. The sumu division is equivalent to a township but is unique to Inner Mongolia. It is therefore larger than a gaqa (Mongolian: ᠭᠠᠴᠠᠭᠠ гацаа) and smaller than a banner (the Inner Mongolia equivalent of the county-level division). Sumu whose population is predominated by ethnic minorities are designated ethnic sumu – parallel with the ethnic township in the rest of China.  As of  2010[update], there is only one ethnic sumu in China, the Evenk Ethnic Sumu. A sum (Mongolian: сум) is the second level administrative subdivision below the Aimags (provinces), roughly comparable to a County in the United States. There are 331 sums in Mongolia. Each sum is again subdivided into bags.  In Russia, a sumon is an administrative division of the Tuva Republic, and somon is that of the Buryat Republic.  Both are describing the Russian term "selsoviet".
