Eskimo Point (74°17′S 162°33′E﻿ / ﻿74.283°S 162.550°E﻿ / -74.283; 162.550) is a flat-topped, steep-sided promontory which protrudes from the east side of Eisenhower Range and forms the north wall of O'Kane Canyon, in Victoria Land.  So named by the Southern Party of New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1962-63, which camped on its upper surface and built an igloo while waiting for white-out conditions to lift.  This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Eskimo Point" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
