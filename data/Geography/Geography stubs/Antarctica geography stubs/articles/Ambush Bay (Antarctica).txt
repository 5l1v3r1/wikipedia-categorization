Ambush Bay (63°10′S 55°26′W﻿ / ﻿63.167°S 55.433°W﻿ / -63.167; -55.433) is a bay 3.5 nautical miles (6 km) wide indenting the north coast of Joinville Island immediately east of King Point. Surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1953. The name arose because the bay is a trap for the unwary if its shallow and foul nature is not known.  This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Ambush Bay (Antarctica)" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
