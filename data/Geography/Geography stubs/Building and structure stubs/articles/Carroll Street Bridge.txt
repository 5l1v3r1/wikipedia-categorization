The Carroll Street Bridge is a retractable bridge in New York City, crossing the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. It carries a single 17.5 feet (5.3 metres) wide wooden-decked lane for one-way eastbound vehicular traffic and two walkways. It was completed in 1889.   It is the quietest of the 794 bridges and tunnels operated by the New York City Department of Transportation, with an average of about one thousand crossings each weekday.  The Carroll Street Bridge is one of four remaining retractable bridges in the United States. The only other one in New York City is the Borden Avenue Bridge.  It was designated a New York City landmark in 1987.
