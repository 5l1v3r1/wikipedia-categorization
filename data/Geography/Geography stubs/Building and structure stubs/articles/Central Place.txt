CEB Tower 391 ft (119 m)  26 (CEB Tower) Central Place is mixed-use development, consisting primarily of CEB Tower (headquarters of CEB Inc.) to the south, and a residential tower to the north, with a plaza between them in Arlington, Virginia. The office tower is home to Virginia's first public observation deck, located nearly 490 ft (149 m) above sea level,  and will be the highest public location in the Washington metropolitan area.  Design began in 2002 and construction was set to begin in 2008, but was delayed to 2014 due to the Great Recession in the United States.  The complex is located directly above the Rosslyn station of the Washington Metro and some bedrock, presenting engineering challenges.
