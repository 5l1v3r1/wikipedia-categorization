Fulbourn Manor is the sole surviving manor of the Five Manors of Fulbourn. It was built in 1788   or maybe earlier.  An account from 1495 states that Richard Berkeley and his wife Anne Berkeley settled a debt of 1,000 marks with four manors of Fulbourn, which were stated as Zouches, Manners, Shardelowes and Fulbourn . It was largely rebuilt around 1910 by Dudley Newman .  Reconstruction preserved part of the 18th century building. Coordinates: 52°10′57″N 0°13′24″E﻿ / ﻿52.182631°N 0.223436°E﻿ / 52.182631; 0.223436
