De Immigrant is a windmill located in Fulton, Illinois, built on a flood-control dike on the Mississippi River. The City of Fulton contracted Molema Millbuilders, Havenga Construction, and Lowlands Management on December 4, 1998 to construct a Dutch windmill, to be fabricated by native millwrights in the Netherlands and shipped to Fulton for assembly. Two months later, construction began with thirty metric tons of wood. The construction took place in phases, and the tower, cap, sails, and machinery were all put together on November 19, 1999. On May 5, 2001, De Immigrant officially began grinding wheat, buckwheat, rye, and cornmeal.
