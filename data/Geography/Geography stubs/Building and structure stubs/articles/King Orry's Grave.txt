King Orry's Grave is the largest megalithic tomb on the Isle of Man.  It is situated in Minorca, in the northern part of the village of Laxey, partly in a private cottage garden. It is some 4000 to 5000 years old; however the reference to King Orry is to the 11th century local ruler Godred Crovan, who has a number of supposed burial places. Like Cashtal yn Ard, the structure is a "Clyde Tomb" of coloured sandstone. The eastern part is semi-circular with a diameter of 12 m and a depth of 4 m. The eastern section is a row of three burial chambers. At the western end is a separate cist-like structure, excavated in 1930, with a menhir. As the central section is not extant, it is unclear whether this is part of the same structure. King Orry's Grave is a Manx National Heritage site.
