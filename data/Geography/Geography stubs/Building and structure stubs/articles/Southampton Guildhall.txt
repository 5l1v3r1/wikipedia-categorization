The grade II* listed building was originally a town hall. There are three venues in the Guildhall catering for various event formats: the Guildhall, the Solent Suite and a lecture theatre.  The Guildhall was designed to complement the rest of the Civic Suite and opened on 13 February 1937. It houses a large pipe organ which was built into it from new. The organ has two distinct consoles: a classical concert organ and a theatre organ. The consoles share the same body of approximately 4,000 pipes which are housed in chambers above the proscenium arch. It was the largest organ made by its builder, John Compton. On 7 October 2013, the venue was renamed to the O2 Guildhall Southampton, due to partnership between Live Nation UK and O2 Telefónica.
