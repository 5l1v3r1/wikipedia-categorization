Smithfield General Market is a market hall in the Smithfield District of London, and one of the five buildings of Smithfield Market. It was designed by Horace Jones in the 19th century but was damaged during the Second World War and became disused. In March 2015, the Museum of London revealed plans to vacate its Barbican site and move into the General Market Building.  The cost of the move is estimated to be in the region of £70 million and, if funding can be achieved, would be complete by 2021.
