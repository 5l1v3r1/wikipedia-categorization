The Gaillard Center is a concert hall and performance venue in Charleston, South Carolina. It was opened in 2015 and replaced the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium. Constructing the new facility was a central priority of mayor Joe Rileyâ€™s administration. The opening, planned for early 2015 in time for the city's Spoleto Festival,  was delayed by six months due to overages.  Yo-Yo Ma performed at the opening of the center.
