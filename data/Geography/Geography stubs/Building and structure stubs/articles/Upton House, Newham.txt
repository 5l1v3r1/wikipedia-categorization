Upton House was a building in the London borough of Newham, on what is now the corner of Lancaster Road and Upton Lane.  In 1827 it was the birthplace of the surgeon Joseph Lister. In 1893 a temporary church for St Peter's Church, Upton Cross was set up in its gardens, with the house forming the vicarage  - the permanent church was later built in the gardens. The vicarage was demolished in 1967-1968 and its site is now occupied by Joseph Lister Court. Coordinates: 51°32′22″N 0°01′24″E﻿ / ﻿51.5395°N 0.0232°E﻿ / 51.5395; 0.0232
