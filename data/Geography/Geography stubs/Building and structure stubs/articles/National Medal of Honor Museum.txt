The National Medal of Honor Museum is a proposed museum to be built in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. It is slated for completion in 2021. Proposed by the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation Board, the museum is planned to be 140 feet tall, 20 feet taller than Mount Pleasant's next tallest building. The foundation was created in 2014 and aims to raise $100 million dollars to build the museum. Designed by Moshe Safdie, the building has faced much regulatory scrutiny and criticism by the Mount Pleasant Planning Commission.
