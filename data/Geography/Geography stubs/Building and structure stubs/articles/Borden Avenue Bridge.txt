The Borden Avenue Bridge is a retractable bridge in New York City,  in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. It carries vehicular and pedestrian traffic across Dutch Kills, a tidal waterway that is a tributary of Newtown Creek.  The main span is 84 feet (26 metres) long, and it retracts by sliding on rails. It was last retracted to allow marine traffic to pass in 2005.  It was designed by Edward Abraham Byrne and opened on March 25, 1908.  The Borden Avenue bridge is one of four remaining retractable bridges in the United States. The only other one in New York City is the Carroll Street Bridge.
