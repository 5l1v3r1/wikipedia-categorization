The building was designed by Peter L.P. Tostevin in the Italianate style, and was built in 1869 for John P. Jube & Co., which occupied it until 1935.  The building has a cast-iron facade from the J. B. & W. W. Cornell Iron Works, the details of which were most likely chosen from a catalog. As such, it is typical of cast-iron construction in the 1850s and 1860s.  At the time it was built, the Bowery was the primary commercial street of the Lower East Side.  Today, the building is a rare cast-iron survivor in the area, as well as a reminder of the importance of the Bowery as a commercial center after the Civil War.  97 Bowery was designated a New York City Landmark by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission on September 14, 2010.
