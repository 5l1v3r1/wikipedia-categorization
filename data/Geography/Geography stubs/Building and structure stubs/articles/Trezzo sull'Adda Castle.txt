The Castle of Trezzo sull'Adda is a castle located on a hill within a bend of the Adda river and from this protected on two sides. On the remaining side it is closed by a wall and a 42-meter high tower. Part of the castle was the fortified bridge over the river, destroyed in 1416.   The site was inhabited since prehistoric time by Celtic populations and after the VII century hosted a Longobard settlement, which was also at the origin of the first fortification on the hill. In 1370 Bernab√≤ Visconti, lord of Milan, ordered the construction of a new caste, which was built on the remains of the previous fortress and completed in 1377.
