MidCity Huntsville is a mixed use retail development center currently being built in Huntsville, Alabama on the corner of University Drive (US 72) and Research Park Boulevard (SR-255) on the land formerly used for Madison Square Mall. It is expected to be completed in 2022. MidCityâ€™s first official phase opened with Topgolf and a preview center/entertainment venue called The Camp at MidCity.  The former Madison Square Mall property was sold to The Grove LLC for $5 Million in April 2015.  After two more years of business, the mall was closed and began demolition in February 2017.   Demolition lasted several months, concluding sometime in June.  As demolition began to slow down, construction of Topgolf began in April. In June, it was announced that High Point Climbing and Fitness would be coming to Midcity Huntsville, with construction beginning sometime in the fall.   A smaller project, The Camp at Midcity, which is a small music and arts venue, was developed on the former Lone Star Grill property. It opened on August 9.  Topgolf opened December 22, 2017.    In February 2018, it was announced that Dave and Busters would be opening sometime in July 2019.   There was also the announcement of a Wahlburgers opening sometime in the future as well.   In March 2018, it was announced that RCP companies had brought in Mark Taft to plan multiple restaurants and eating locations throughout Midcity.
