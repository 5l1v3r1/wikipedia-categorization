Green Spine (originally known as Southbank) is a two-building development proposed for Melbourne developed by Beulah International and designed by architectural firms UNStudio and Cox Architecture.  The site currently hosts a BMW dealership.  If completed as planned, the building will become the tallest in Melbourne. Beulah International conducted a contest to determine the architect for the project, and dubbed the competition "Southbank by Beulah". All six solicited bids involved two architectural firms, and partnerships included BIG Architects and Fender Katsalidis, MAD Studio and Elenberg Fraser, and Woods Bagot and MVRDV.  The collaborative bid by UNStudio and Cox Architecture ultimately secured the commission.
