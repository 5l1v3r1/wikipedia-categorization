The Alhambra Cinema is an Art Deco building on Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, Israel. It was named after the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. The cinema opened in 1937 and was one of the biggest and luxurious cinemas in Palestine. It was also used as a theatre hall and hosted famous artists such as Umm Kulthum, Farid al-Atrash and Leila Mourad. After the Independence War it was reopened under the name "Yafor Cinema". On 1963 it was hired by the impresario Giora Godik and was renamed again as "Alhambra". On the late 70's the building was abandoned and partly used. In 2010 it underwent refurbishment and today it's the center of the Scientology organisation in Israel.
