Mecca Flats was an apartment complex in Chicago completed in 1892, originally built as a hotel for visitors to the World's Columbian Exposition.  The building was designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin Pierce Burnham. Franklin Pierce Burnham was not related to Daniel Burnham.  After the Exposition, the building was converted to apartments and leased only to white tenants. This policy was later reversed and the building became home to mostly middle-class black families.  IIT razed the building in 1952 after a decade-long fight with tenants who aimed to prevent its destruction.  S.R. Crown Hall, designed by Mies van der Rohe, replaced the building. Portions of the building's basement floor were unearthed in 2018 and subsequently displayed by IIT's architectural school, which is located in S.R. Crown Hall. The building inspired a song by Jimmy Blythe titled Mecca Flats Blues and a poem, "In the Mecca", by poet Gwendolyn Brooks.
