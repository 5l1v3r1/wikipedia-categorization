A smart work zone or intelligent work zone refers to a site-specific configuration of traffic control technology deployed within a roadway work zone to increase the safety of construction workers, provide "real-time" travel information, and efficiently route motorists through a work zone.  Smart work zones reduce the dependency on human "flaggers" and make the work zone safer for roadway workers.       The following list are common terms used to describe equipment configuration used within smart work zones:       Smart Arrow Board     Zipper Merge    Smart Traffic Monitoring System     Advanced Queue Warning System     End of Queue Detection System     Dynamic Late Merge     Queue Detection System     Portable queue warning alert system     Queue warning system     Work zone queue detection warning system     Stopped traffic advisory system     Portable queue detection     Conflict Warning System     Over Height Vehicle Detection     Portable Radar Sensors     Trucks Entering System     Variable Speed Limit     Dynamic Speed Display     Blue Tooth System Travel Time System     Portable Rumble Strips       Smart work zones often use radar guns or other non-intrusive sensors to detect the presence and speed of vehicles approaching a work zone, in order to display an appropriate message on one or more variable message signs. In a "dynamic merge" system, for example, vehicles approaching a lane closure are directed to use all available lanes when congestion develops and speeds are low.  When speeds are high, motorists are directed to merge early or are left to use their own judgement.  Such a system is usually deployed in addition to traditional static messaging.
