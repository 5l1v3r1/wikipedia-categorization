The  International Mid-Continent Trade Corridor is a supercorridor linking highways in Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The North American SuperCorridor Coalition promotes and lobbies for further development of the corridor. This supercorridor uses existing American highways such as the Interstate 35, from the Mexico–US border at Laredo, Texas, to the Interstate 29 at the Canada–U.S. border in North Dakota and Manitoba Highway 75 at Winnipeg, Manitoba.
