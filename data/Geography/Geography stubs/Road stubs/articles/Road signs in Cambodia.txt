Road signs in Cambodia (Khmer:ឧបសម្ព័ទ្ឋ ស្តីពី សញ្ញាចរាចរផ្លូវគោក)are standardized road signs similar to those used in other nations but with certain differences. Until the early 1980s, Cambodia closely followed US, Australian, and Japanese practices in road sign design, with diamond-shaped warning signs and circular restrictive signs to regulate traffic. Cambodia traffic signs use Khmer, the national language of Cambodia, however, English is also used for stop and important public places such as tourist attractions, airports, railway stations, and immigration checkpoints. Both Khmer and English are used on directional signage. Cambodia signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals but have yet to ratify the convention.
