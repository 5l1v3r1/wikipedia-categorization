Heavy Rescue: 401 is a Canadian reality TV show that follows the operations of multiple heavy vehicle rescue and recovery towing companies, along with the support from the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, and York Regional Police, based in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and southern Ontario region.  The show focuses on the hardships of operating along Ontario's 400-series highways, such as the 401 in the GTA. After the success of Highway thru Hell was well established with five top-rated seasons, the series' creator Mark Miller has come up with a spinoff series Heavy Rescue: 401, which kicked off with a bang on January 3, 2017 on Discovery Canada following the debut of the pilot in October 2016. The show is produced by Great Pacific Television, and executive produced by Kelly McClugan and Blair Reekie. Season 1 contains nine 45-minute episodes. The show focuses on the work of heavy recovery operators in Southern Ontario. Every long and tough winter they have their hands full as they do everything in their power to keep the region's highways clear of wrecks and the traffic moving. The task is far from easy, as these roads are among the busiest in the world, with up to 400,000 vehicles passing through every day.     \
