A protected intersection is an at-grade road junction in which cyclists and pedestrians are separated from cars. Vehicles turning right (in countries driving on the right, or left in countries driving on the left) are separated by a car length from crossing cyclists and pedestrians, providing increased reaction times and visibility.  Drivers looking to turn right have better visibility to cyclists and pedestrians as they can look to the side for conflicts instead of over their shoulders.  This type of intersection is common in the bike-friendly Netherlands.  A few other countries and jurisdictions are beginning to install protected intersections similar to those in the Netherlands, including American cities Salt Lake City,  Austin, Davis and Boston,  and Canadian cities like Ottawa. A number of features make this intersection safer. A corner refuge island, a setback crossing of the pedestrians and cyclists, generally between 1.5â€“7 metres of setback, a forward stop bar, which allows cyclists to stop for a traffic light well ahead of motor traffic who must stop behind the crosswalk. Separate signal staging or at least an advance green for cyclists and pedestrians is used to give cyclists and pedestrians no conflicts or a head start over traffic. The design makes a right turn on red, and sometimes left on red depending on the geometry of the intersection in question, possible in many cases, often without stopping.  Cyclists ideally have a protected bike lane on the approach to the intersection, separated by a concrete median with splay curbs if possible, and have a protected bike lane width of at least 2 metres if possible (one way). In the Netherlands, most one way cycle paths are at least 2.5 metres wide.  Here you find a list of some protected intersections outside the Netherlands (where they are very popular):
