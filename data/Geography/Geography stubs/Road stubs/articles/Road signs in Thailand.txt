Road signs in Thailand are standardized road signs similar to those used in other nations but with certain differences. Until the early 1980s, Thailand closely followed US, Australian, and Japanese practices in road sign design, with diamond-shaped warning signs and circular restrictive signs to regulate traffic. Signs usually use the FHWA Series fonts ("Highway Gothic") typeface also used in the United States, though some signs on recently completed expressways use "Arial Bold".  Thai traffic signs use Thai, the national language of Thailand. However, English is also used for important public places such as tourist attractions, airports, railway stations, and immigration checkpoints. Both Thai and English are used on directional signage. Thailand is a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, but has yet to fully ratify the convention. With the exception of the special designs used for Stop, Yield, and No Entry signs, mandatory signs (e.g., Must Turn Left) are round with a blue background, white border, and a white pictogram. Those which express a prohibition (e.g., No Left Turn) show the pictogram crossed out by a red diagonal bar. This is in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (Type A variants).
