A junction, when discussed in the context of transport, is a location where traffic can change between different routes, directions, or sometimes modes, of travel. Historically, many cities and market towns developed wherever there was a junction. The intersection of two or more routes offered opportunities for rest or trade for travellers and merchants. Towns sprang up to accommodate this; the first such in Europe were probably at intersections of the Roman roads. A similar effect came with the growth of rail transport; so-called railway towns grew up near major railway junctions - originally to accommodate railway workers, but expanding into fully functioning settlements over time. Junctions also developed where different modes of transport intersected, e.g. canal and rail. There are many types of different junction for road transport and rail transport (including metro and rapid transit systems). If many of these are contained in a small area, and where passengers can change from one transport mode to the other in them, it is said to be a transport hub. The word "junction" derives from Latin iunctus, past participle of iungere, to join.  The word "junction" in this context may also refer to:
