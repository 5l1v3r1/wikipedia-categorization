A traffic barricade  is a type of barricade fitted with flashing lights and used to block excavations or road construction or other safety-related purposes. Formerly made of wood, or wood and steel, many now have structural members made wholly of plastic or composite materials. Type I, II and III barricades are commonly used for road detours and closings where vehicles are present.  A-Frame barricades are more typically seen where pedestrian traffic control is needed or used on low speed roads. In addition to the more traditional traffic barricades mentioned above there are several other categories of barricades  that get used quite regularly for traffic channelization including concrete barriers, jersey barriers (may be water filled or plastic), traffic barrels or drums and vertical panels.  Depending on space and need all of these categories are listed as acceptable barricade devices in the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices).  Traffic barrels and vertical panels are often used in areas where there is less horizontal space but they serve the same purpose - to help control the flow of traffic and protect workers. One large multi-state company providing traffic barricade services was Houston-based, Highway Technologies, Inc., a US construction company that maintained offices in 33 cities.   It filed for bankruptcy in May 2013, laying off 740 of its 825 employees.  The company was founded in approximately 1983.
