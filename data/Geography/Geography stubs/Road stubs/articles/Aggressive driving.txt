Aggressive driving is defined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the behaviour of an individual who "commits a combination of moving traffic offences so as to endanger other persons or property."  By definition, aggressive driving is 'committing unprovoked attacks on other drivers', attacks such as not yielding to  vehicles wishing to pass.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has implemented the Fatality Analysis Reporting System,   which identifies actions that would fall under the category of aggressive driving, including:   According to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, aggressive driving played a role in 56% of fatal crashes between 2003 and 2007, most of which were attributed to excessive speed.   Aggressive driving also negatively impacts the environment as it burns 37% more fuel and produces more toxic fumes.
