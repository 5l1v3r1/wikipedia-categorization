In Belize, the Southern Highway takes up where the Hummingbird Highway ends and runs from Dangriga to Punta Gorda.  It is entirely paved, with the completion of a 10-mile segment between Golden Stream and Big Falls circa 2008-09.  The Southern Highway provides important access to a number of Mayan ruins and natural areas.  The ancient Mayan sites of Nim Li Punit and Lubaantun are each situated a few miles west of the highway in southern Belize.  The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is several miles west of the highway in south-central Belize.  In 2011, a project was initiated to extend the Southern Highway to Jalacte in southwestern Belize.
