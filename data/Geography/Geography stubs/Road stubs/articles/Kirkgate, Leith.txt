Kirkgate is an ancient thoroughfare in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland. It runs north from the foot of Leith Walk towards Leith Docks. It is one of the oldest streets in the district and historically one of its most vital road links.  Most of the buildings on old Kirkgate and neighbouring streets such as Tolbooth Wynd were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by the Newkirkgate Shopping Centre and a new housing complex, which incorporates the A-listed tower block Linksview House, in 1965.  The resident population were mainly dispersed to new housing developments elsewhere in Edinburgh.
