Laos traffic signs use Lao, the national language of Laos. However, English is also used for stop and important public places such as tourist attractions, airports, railway stations, and immigration checkpoints. Both Lao and English are used on directional signage. Laos signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals but have yet to ratify the convention.
