The road signs in Poland follow the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals and, therefore, are more or less identical to those in other European countries. Warning signs have yellow background rather than the more common black-on-white design, and therefore similar to the Road signs in Greece. Polish road signs depict people with stylized (as opposed to naturalistic) silhouettes. Warning signs are triangular with yellow backgrounds and red borders.
