The Philip Goldson Highway in Belize joins Belize City through Orange Walk Town and Corozal Town with the Mexican border at the state of Quintana Roo. It is approximately 95 miles (153Â km) long. Crude side-roads suitable only for over-land vehicles connect to such localities as Aguas Turbias, on the corner where Belize, Mexico and Guatemala meet. The highway was officially commissioned in 1968 as the Northern Highway.  On 21 September 2012, Prime Minister Dean Barrow announced that it would be renamed the Philip Goldson Highway, named after a Belizean activist, editor and politician.  The highway passes the international airport also named for Goldson.
