A staggered junction is a place where several roads meet a main road at a slight distance apart thus they do not all come together at the same point. Major single-point traffic-light controlled junctions of more than two roads are often reconfigured into staggered junctions in order to increase traffic flow through them. Intersections that involve a minor road crossing a main road are often made into staggered junctions to prevent traffic going straight across a main road without stopping to check for oncoming vehicles.
