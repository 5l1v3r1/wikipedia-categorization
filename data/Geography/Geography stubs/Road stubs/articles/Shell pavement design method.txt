The Shell pavement design method is used in many countries for the design of new asphalt roads.   In structural road design, the main considerations consist of soil parameters, parameters (thickness and stiffness) for the other road foundation materials, and the expected number of times a standard load will pass over. The output of the calculation is the thickness of the asphalt layer.
