The Priority Bus Route (or PBR) is a public transit corridor roadway on Trinidad island in Trinidad and Tobago.  It is dedicated to use only by buses, maxi taxis, and emergency vehicles.   The route serves the Eastâ€“West Corridor metro region, from the city of Port of Spain from the west, to the borough of Arima to the east. It was built on the right of way of the former Trinidad Government Railway line. The Priority Bus Route is parallel to the public Eastern Main Road.
