A supercorridor is a proposed new type of transportation infrastructure in the United States.  A supercorridor would use swaths of land up to 1,200 feet (370 m) wide to carry parallel links of freeways, rails, and utility lines. The freeway portions would be divided into two separate elements: truck lanes and lanes for passenger vehicles.  Similarly, the rail lines in the corridor would be divided among freight, commuter, and high-speed rail. Services expected to be carried in the utility corridor include water, electricity, natural gas and petroleum, plus fiber optic lines and other telecommunications services. Supercorridors bypass traditional national borders instead using inland ports known as "smartports". Border guards and customs officers would check the cargo at these inland ports. Critics of supercorridors complain that existing transportation infrastructure is not being invested in and maintained. Other critics are concerned about the environmental damage which might occur by creating a supercorridor.  Still others are concerned about issues of national and state sovereignty, and the possible increased danger of terrorism, in the rapid transfer of individuals, goods and materials across borders. Acquisition of large swaths of land for such corridors have created questions about property rights and the use of eminent domain.
