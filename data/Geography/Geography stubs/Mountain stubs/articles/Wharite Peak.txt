Wharite Peak is a mountain at the southern end of the Ruahine Range, 9 km (5.6 mi) north of Woodville in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand. The mountain is home to the main television transmitter for the city of Palmerston North and the wider Manawatu region. A 1 kW television transmitter was established atop Wharite in 1963, relaying WNTV1 from Wellington. It was replaced with a 100 kW transmitter in 1966.
