Monaco City (French: Monaco-Ville) is the southcentral ward in the Principality of Monaco. Located on a headland that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, it is nicknamed The Rock (French: Le Rocher). The name "Monaco City" is misleading: it is not itself a city, but a historical and statistical district.   Monaco City is one of the four traditional quarters (French: quartiers) of Monaco; the others are La Condamine, Monte Carlo, and Fontvieille. Monaco-Ville is located at 43°44′15″N 7°24′55″E﻿ / ﻿43.73750°N 7.41528°E﻿ / 43.73750; 7.41528 and has an estimated population of 975. Monaco City was originally called in greek Monoikos, after the temple of Hercules Monoikos, located in a Phocaean colony of the 6th century BCE. During its history, Monoikos changed hands numerous times. It became Monaco in the Middle Ages. Some of the city walls and original structures still remain. In 1297, the Rock was seized by François Grimaldi, a member of the House of Grimaldi. The Grimaldis made the old fortress their residence. The fortress evolved into the Palais Princier, which is the official residence of Albert II, Prince of Monaco. Despite being located in the middle of the City of Monaco, the world's most densely populated urban center, Monaco City remains a medieval village at heart, made up almost entirely of quiet pedestrian streets and marked by virtual silence after sundown. Though innumerable people visit Monaco City and the palace square, only local vehicles are allowed up to the Rock, and gasoline-powered motorcycles are prohibited after 10 pm.
