Les Révoires is a north eastern residential and tourist area; part of the traditional Quartier of La Condamine in the Principality of Monaco.  It is also one of the ten modern administrative Wards of Monaco.  Les Révoires lies on the northwestern side of the country, just north of Moneghetti.  Les Révoires is generally considered part of Moneghetti, even though it is its own administrative Ward. It runs directly along the neighboring French towns of Beausoleil, and Cap-d'Ail, as well as the Monégasque Wards of, La Colle, and Moneghetti.    Les Révoires has steep inclines, and offers views of the Rock of Monaco and the Mediterranean. Les Révoires is also the location of the Chemin des Révoires, Monaco's highest point, 161 m above sea level.  Les Révoires is the smallest Ward in Monaco in terms of both population and land mass. Les Révoires has a population of 2,545 and is 0.09 km².  Monaco has ten state-operated schools, four private schools, and one university. There are no state schools and private schools located in this district.  There are also very few government offices located in this district, although there is a regional police station near the Les Révoires - Moneghetti border.  Les Révoires is more of residential area, but there are many chain-owned hotels, and bed & breakfasts, along the upper slopes of Mont Agel, helping Monaco's high end tourist industry.  Because Les Révoires is located outside the city center, its real estate sales are generally less.  Real estate sales average 6% to 10% less than neighboring Fontvieille or La Condamine.  The district contains the celebrated Jardin Exotique de Monaco (French: for Exotic Garden of Monaco), founded by Prince Albert I in 1933. The garden contains a rich collection of over a thousand succulent and cacti. There is also a museum, called the Prehistoric Anthropology located within the Exotic Garden, which displays a variety of prehistoric remains.
