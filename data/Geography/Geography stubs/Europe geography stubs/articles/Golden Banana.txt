The Golden Banana or "sun belt" is a term used by analysts when discussing urbanisation in a European context.  It denotes an area of higher population density lying between Valencia in the west and Genoa in the east along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, defined by the "Europe 2000" report from the European Commission in 1995  to be analogous to the Blue Banana. The region is a centre for information technology and manufacturing.
