Martuni District was one of the five (raions) or administrative districts of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (AzSSR).  In 1991 the parliament of the newly established Republic of Azerbaijan abolished passed the Law on Abolishment of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast which had the effect of also abolishing Martuni District. The district's territory was incorporated into the neighbouring Azerbaijani Khojavend District.  This abolition was not recognised by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Today, the majority of Martuni District is under the de facto control of the Artsakh Defense Army. The Republic of Artsakh has renamed the district as Martuni Province and has added some territory land captured during the Nagorno-Karabakh War to the province. The eastern part of Martuni District remains in Azerbaijani control.
