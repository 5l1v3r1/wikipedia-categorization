The Tejas sequence was the last major marine transgression across the North American craton.  Following the late Cretaceous regression that ended the Zu√±i sequence, the oceans advanced again early in the Cenozoic, peaking during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.  There were no dramatic epeiric seas in North America; indeed, the Atlantic coast advanced only as far as the Mississippi Embayment.    The Tejas was deeper in Eurasia and Africa, which experienced widespread carbonate deposition during the Eocene.  There was a final transgression before the end of the Oligocene, the end of which marked the end of the Tejas sequence.
