The Insular Plate was an ancient oceanic plate that began subducting under the west-coast of North America around the early Cretaceous time. The Insular Plate had a chain of active volcanic islands that were called the Insular Islands. These volcanic Islands however collided then fused onto the west-coast of North America when the Insular Plate jammed then shut down ending the subduction zone.
