The Pan-African Ocean is a hypothesized paleo-ocean whose closure created the supercontinent of Pannotia.   The ocean may have existed before the break-up of the supercontinent of Rodinia. The ocean closed before the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon, when the Panthalassa ocean expanded, and was eventually replaced by it.
