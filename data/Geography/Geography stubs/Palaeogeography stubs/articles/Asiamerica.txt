Asiamerica was a large island formed from the Laurasian landmass and separated by shallow continental seas from Eurasia to the West and eastern North America to the East. This region incorporated what is now politically China, Mongolia, western United States and western Canada. Fossil evidence tells us that it was home to many dinosaurs and archaic mammals. It existed during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene periods, and existed again during Quaternary Pleistocene epoch. It will exist again for the third time within 50 million years.
