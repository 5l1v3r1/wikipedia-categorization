The Charcot Plate was a fragment of the Phoenix Plate.  The Charcot Plate is subducting under West Antarctica. The subduction of the Charcot Plate stopped before 83 Ma, and became fused onto the Antarctic Peninsula.  Researchers have suggested that there are remnants of the western part of the Charcot Plate in the Bellingshausen Sea.
