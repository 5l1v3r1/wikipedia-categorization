The Bridge River Ocean was an ancient ocean that existed between North America and the Insular Islands during the Paleozoic time. Like the earlier Slide Mountain Ocean, the Bridge River Ocean had a subduction zone on the ocean floor called the Insular Trench. The closure of the Bridge River Ocean occurred about 115 million years ago, during the mid Cretaceous period. The namesake of the Bridge River Ocean is the Bridge River in the Canadian province of British Columbia, about 100 miles north of the city of Vancouver.
