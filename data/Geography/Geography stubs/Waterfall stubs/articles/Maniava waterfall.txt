Maniava waterfall (Ukrainian: Манявський водоспад) is the highest waterfall in the Carpathians and is located in the Gorgany mountain ridge in Ukraine.  Maniava waterfall is located on the Maniavka river, about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of Maniava, Bohorodchanskyi Raion, Ivano-Frankivska oblast.    It is nearly 20 metres (66 ft) high. Near the waterfall is a canyon that is approximately 200 metres (660 ft) long with rocks up to 20 metres (66 ft) high. The waterfall also boasts a small lake, where the water remains cool even in hot season. Fir and beech forests line the waterfall creating a very beautiful and tranquil environment. The waterfall turns a little wild following heavy rainfall or the monsoon with frequent flash floods. In winter months frozen ice appear like chimeras with an enchanting effect on the visitors who frequent the place, now and again.
