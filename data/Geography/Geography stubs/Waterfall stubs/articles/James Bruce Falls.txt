James Bruce Falls (unofficial name) is the highest-measured waterfall in the continent of North America and ninth-tallest in the world. Located in Princess Louisa Marine Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada, it stems from a small snowfield and cascades 840 m (2,760 ft) down to Princess Louisa Inlet. Two parallel streams, for which the falls are named, come from this snowfield, one of which is persistent throughout the year and the other of which usually dries up by July. The stream flows into Loquilts Creek, which empties into the inlet via the better known Chatterbox Falls.  Coordinates: 50°13′08″N 123°46′57″W﻿ / ﻿50.21889°N 123.78250°W﻿ / 50.21889; -123.78250
