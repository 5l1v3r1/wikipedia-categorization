Kapachira Falls are waterfalls in Malawi.  They lie on the lower Shire River near the town of Chikwawa and the Majete Wildlife Reserve. The Kapichira Hydroelectric Power Station was constructed above the falls to provide hydroelectricty. The falls blocked David Livingstone's 1859 Zambezi Expedition from proceeding up the Shire; several members of his team died from disease and are buried in the area.
