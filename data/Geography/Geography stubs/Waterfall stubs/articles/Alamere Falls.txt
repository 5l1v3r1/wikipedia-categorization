Alamere Falls is a waterfall in Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin County, California. Alamere Falls is a rare "tidefall", a waterfall that flows directly into the ocean. It is one of only two in the area, the other being McWay Falls.  Alamere Falls tumble over fragile shale cliffs at Alamere Creek Beach. Upstream of the main Alamere Falls is the upper Alamere Falls, consisting of three separate cascades. Together, these cascades are approximately 20–30 feet (6–9 m) in height. All of these waterfalls are fed by the Alamere Creek.   Alamere Falls can be reached by following the Coast Trail from the Palomarin Trailhead at the end of Mesa Road out of Bolinas, California. After 2.5 miles, the trail passes two small lakes (Bass Lake and Pelican Lake). Bass Lake can be accessed by a side trail that leads to a rope swing, and hikers often stop for a swim during summer months.   From the Palomarin Trailhead, the hike is 4.0 miles, one-way, to the falls.
