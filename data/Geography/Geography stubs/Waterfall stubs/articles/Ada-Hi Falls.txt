Ada-Hi Falls (pronounced Uh-dah`'he) is located within Black Rock Mountain State Park in Rabun County, Georgia.  The name is Cherokee for "forest." It is the highest elevation falls in the state. The amount of water present is highly variable due to its high elevation. The falls are surrounded by a forest of rhododendron. A short, yet steep hike, ends at an observation deck.
