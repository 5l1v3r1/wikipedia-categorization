  The Newell Falls is a waterfall on an unnamed stream that is located in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. The waterfall is situated adjacent to the Waterfall Way between the town of Dorrigo and the locality of Thora in Dorrigo National Park. The waterfall passes down the cliff side and under a single lane bridge before entering the Bellinger River at the bottom of the valley. People can also stop to view the waterfall at small rest area, around 50 metres (160Â ft) from the Newell Falls. Picnic tables, shelter sheds and bins are located at this site. There is also a near Newell Falls lookout into the Bellinger Valley.  The Waterfall Way often closes at Newell Falls in times of heavy rainfall and flooding as the road becomes a shower of water and visibility is significantly reduced.
