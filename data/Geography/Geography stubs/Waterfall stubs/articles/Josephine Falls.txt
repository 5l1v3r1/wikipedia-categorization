  The Josephine Falls is a tiered cascade waterfall on the Josephine Creek located in Wooroonooran, Cairns Region in the Far North region of Queensland, Australia. The falls are situated at the foot of the southern face of Mount Bartle Frere in the Wooroonooran National Park. They descend from the Atherton Tableland at an elevation of 192 metres (630 ft) above sea level  in the range of 150–300 metres (490–980 ft)  near a popular recreation site as the water flows over a large rock to form a natural waterslide on Josephine Creek, a tributary of the Russell River. Access to falls is via a sealed road off the Bruce Highway between Babinda and Innisfail. The natural rock slide can be dangerous and the occasional flash flooding occurs without warning, with a sudden increase in the water volume.   Media related to Josephine Falls at Wikimedia Commons
