  The Waterfall Creek Falls (Aboriginal: Gunlom) is a cascading waterfall on the Waterfall Creek located in the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, Australia. The falls are also known as UDP Falls and are perhaps most famous for making an appearance in the movie Crocodile Dundee.  The falls descend from an elevation of 168 metres (551 ft) above sea level and range in height between 60–85 metres (197–279 ft)  and are located in the Mary River area in the southern part of Kakadu, less visited by tourists. Depending on the time of the year, the Waterfall Creek Falls range from a roaring waterfall to a gentle trickle falling down the cliffs. This plunge pool at the bottom of the falls is one of the most visited places in the Kakadu National Park and a popular swimming hole free of saltwater crocodiles.  A steep 15-minute climb leads to the top of the falls, with views over the southern region of the park. There is also a series of swimming holes at the top of the falls. The Waterfall Creek Falls is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the Kakadu Highway on a gravel road, just inside the southern entry to the park. During the wet season (December to April), access is restricted. There is also a campground located near the falls.
