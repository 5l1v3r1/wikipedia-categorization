  The Crystal Cascades is a cascade waterfall on the Freshwater Creek in the Far North region of Queensland, Australia. The Crystal Cascades is located in a relatively unspoilt section of the upper Freshwater Creek, in the Redlynch Valley, west of Cairns, with numerous waterfalls and swimming waterholes popular with locals and tourists. The largest waterhole is sited alongside a sheer cliff which locals and tourists climb to jump into the adjoining deep waterhole. The most famous part of the cliff is called "No Fear" which is the highest perch from which to jump. In 2014 an 18–year–old man drowned when he failed to resurface after slipping over the edge of the waterfall, while swimming in a restricted area.
