Beaver Falls, is a waterfall located on Beaver Creek near the town of Clatskanie in Columbia County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.  The waterfall is formed as Beaver Creek sheets out onto a wide channel over a 40 feet shoot at high velocity into a natural amphitheater of layered basalt.  Beaver Falls Trail leads to Beaver Falls in 0.3 miles (0.48Â km) from a trailhead on Beaver Falls Road.    The waterfall and trail are surrounded by Douglas fir, western red-cedar, western hemlock, and big-leaf maple. Sword fern, Oregon grape, and salal are very common plant life growing beneath the forest canopy.
