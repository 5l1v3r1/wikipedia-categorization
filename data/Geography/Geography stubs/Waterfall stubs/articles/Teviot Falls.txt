  The Teviot Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Teviot Brook in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. The falls are part of the Scenic Rim and are located near the town of Killarney. The falls descend 38 metres (125Â ft)  from the McPherson Range near Wilsons Peak, north of the Queensland/New South Wales border.  The falls may be viewed via accessing a partially unsealed road up the range towards Teviot Gap, also known as The Head. Four other waterfalls are located in the area surrounding Killarney, including the Queen Mary Falls, Daggs Falls, Browns Falls and Upper Browns Falls. The naming of the falls is derived from the naming of Teviot Brook on 6 August 1828 by Allan Cunningham, a botanist and explorer, after the Teviot River, Roxburghshire, Scotland.
