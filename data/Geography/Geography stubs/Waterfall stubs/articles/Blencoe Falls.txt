  The Blencoe Falls is a segmented waterfall on the Blencoe Creek, located in the Far North region of Queensland, Australia. The falls are situated in the Girringun National Park near Tully, approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of a confluence with the Blencoe Creek and the Herbert River. From an elevation of 517 metres (1,696 ft) above sea level,  the falls descend 320 metres (1,050 ft)  in an initial drop of approximately 90 metres (300 ft) and they cascade for another 230 metres (750 ft) to the base of the gorge.  The falls can be reached by road from Mount Garnet on the Kennedy Highway. The Kirrama Range Road from Kennedy on the Bruce Highway also provides access from the coast to the falls.  This road is now opened and is accessible by four-wheel-drive and high-clearance vehicles. For the latest information relating to the state of Kirrama Range Road one can contact Cassowary Coast Council. Blencoe Falls lookout is approximately 62 kilometres (39 mi) west of Kennedy.  The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Blencoe Falls are the Indigenous Australian Warungnu peoples,  some of whom were driven over the ridges above Blencoe Falls to drown in the gorge.  The second season of Survivor was filmed in an area close to the falls.
