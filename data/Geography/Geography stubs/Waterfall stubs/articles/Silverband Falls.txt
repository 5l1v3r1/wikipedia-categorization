  The Silverband Falls are waterfalls located in the Grampians National Park, in western Victoria, Australia. Fed by Dairy Creek, the horsetail falls are characterised by a narrow band of water that tumbles over a small rock face and then disappears into a rocky base.  The creek re-emerges some 50 metres (160Â ft) west of the falls.  Early European visitors to the falls named it Silverband because of its narrow stream of water.
