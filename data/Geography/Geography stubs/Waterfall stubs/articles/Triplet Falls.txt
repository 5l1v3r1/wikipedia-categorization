   The Triplet Falls  are waterfalls located in the Great Otway National Park of Victoria, in eastern Australia, 200km (approximately 125 mi) from Melbourne via Colac and Gellibrand, or 70km (approximately 43 mi) from Apollo Bay.   The falls are fed by the Young Creek and as the name suggests there are three falls that cascade over a lush rainforest to the floor of the valley.  The three streams normally flow when there has been significant rain upstream, so it is not uncommon to see only one or two streams flowing. Triplet Falls are nestled amongst the ancient forests of Mountain Ash and Myrtle Beech.
