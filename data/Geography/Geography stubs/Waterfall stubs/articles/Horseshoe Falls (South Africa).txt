The Horseshoe Falls of South Africa are waterfalls that are located 4 km off the Old Lydenburg Road along the Sabie River in Mpumalanga. These unusual falls, although not very high, are horseshoe shaped and have been declared a national monument. While doing a short walk through the beautiful landscape that leads to the cascade-type falls, the opportunity to spot magnificent birdlife and other wildlife is not uncommon. Horseshoe Falls is also a popular venue for trout fishing. Although it is easy to navigate to, there is a small fee to get into the park to be able to enjoy this beautiful attraction.  The amphitheatre in the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park, also in South Africa, has massive cliffs that are in the shape of a horseshoe that could be confused as horseshoe falls.
