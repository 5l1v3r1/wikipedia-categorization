  The Florence Falls (Aboriginal: Karrimurra) is a segmented waterfall on the Florence Creek located within the Litchfield National Park in the Northern Territory of Australia.  The waterfall descends from an elevation of 64 metres (210 ft) above sea level via a series of segmented tiers that range in height between 9.8–15 metres (32–49 ft).  Accessed by sealed road, the falls are found near the northern boundary of the national park, approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) south of Darwin.  A sign post at Florence Falls mentions two walks for hiking. The 'Shady Creek Walk' is graded easy with a distance of 1.2 kilometres (0.75 mi) return. The 'Florence Creek Walk' is also graded easy with a distance of 3.2 kilometres (2.0 mi) return. The Florence Falls plunge pool is listed as "great for a refreshing swim" besides the usual safety warnings.  Media related to Florence Falls at Wikimedia Commons
