  The Guide Falls and Upper Guide Falls, a tiered–cascade waterfall on the Guide River, is located in the North West region of Tasmania, Australia.  The waterfalls are situated about 19km south of Burnie  at an elevation of 187 metres (614 ft) above sea level and descend in the range of 22–38 metres (72–125 ft).  To access the falls from Burnie, take the road towards Cradle Mountain, and then turn right just outside the boundary of Ridgley and continue down into the gully and turn left at a posted gate sign. Once entered, the Guide River is to the right and continue to drive up the gravel road where the falls are located. The top is safe and there are great view from the fenced lookout. There is also a set of steps that lead down to the bottom of the falls. Around the vicinity there are also picnic tables and barbecue areas.
