Agaya Gangai waterfalls are located in Kolli Hills of the Eastern Ghats. Panchanathi, a jungle stream, cascades down as the Agaya Gangai (En:Ganges of Sky), near the Arapaleeswarar temple atop the Kolli Hills in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu.  It is a 300 feet (91Â m) waterfall of the river Aiyaru situated close to Arapaleeswarar temple. It is located in a valley that is surrounded by mountains on all sides.   We need to climb down 1050 steps to see the full view of Agaya Gangai. The water falls with the full force and we need to approach the bottom of the falls using a rope only. Take a relaxing but also risky bath in the falls. The caves of Korakka Siddhar and Kalaanginatha Siddhar are situated near the Agaya Gangai waterfalls inside the forest area.
