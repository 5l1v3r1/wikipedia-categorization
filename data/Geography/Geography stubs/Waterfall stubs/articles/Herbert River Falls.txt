  The Herbert River Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Herbert River that is located in the UNESCO World Heritage–listed Wet Tropics in the Far North region of Queensland, Australia. The falls are located on the northern boundary of the Girringun National Park, west of Cardwell, in the Cassowary Coast local government area, approximately 162 kilometres (101 mi) northwest of the river's mouth at Ingham.  The waterfall plunges from the Atherton Tableland at an elevation of 505 metres (1,657 ft)  and falls between 56–75 metres (184–246 ft)  into the Herbert River Gorge below.
