Annie Falls, is the tallest of three waterfalls so named, located along Annie Creek in the Crater Lake National Park at the south end of Rim Village Historic District, in Klamath County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.  It is located in a steep canyon area surrounded by walls of petrified volcanic ash consequence of Mount Mazama eruption. The location of Annie Creek Falls deep in the Annie Creek canyon makes it very difficult to reach the waterfall. Partial views of the cascade can be seen from a picnic area off the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway south of Crater Peak. Access to Annie Creek is available at the USFS snow park, both the Creek and the Waterfall are high flow water.
