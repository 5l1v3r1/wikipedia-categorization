Espeland Falls    (Norwegian: Espelandsfossen) is a 75-metre (246 ft) tall waterfall located in the Espeland Valley  (Norwegian: Espelandsdalen) in the municipality of Granvin in Hordaland county, Norway.  The falls are located just above large Lake Espeland   (Norwegian: Espelandsvatnet), near the border of Granvin and neighboring municipality of Ulvik.  Due to an urban legend, Espeland Falls is sometimes erroneously claimed to be 2,307 feet (703 m) tall.  One theory is that the erroneous information may have originated from a misunderstanding of the concept Meters of Head in relation to the development of the Espeland River (Norwegian: Espelandselvi) for hydropower. Another theory is that there may have been a mixup with Skrikjofossen in Lofthus, Ullensvang, a 455 m waterfall located about 60 km south of Espeland Falls.
