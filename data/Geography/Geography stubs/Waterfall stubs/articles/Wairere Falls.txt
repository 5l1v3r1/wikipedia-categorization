Wairere Falls, the highest waterfall in New Zealand's North Island, plunges 153 metres (500 feet) in two steps over the Kaimai escarpment  The waterfall is located between Te Aroha and Matamata. A walking track runs from the car park at the end of Goodwin Road, up the valley of the stream to a viewing platform, and thence to the top of the plateau and the crest of the falls. Once at the top one can continue onto the North South track that runs the length of the Kaimai Ranges. Coordinates: 37°44′02″S 175°52′48″E﻿ / ﻿37.734°S 175.88°E﻿ / -37.734; 175.88
