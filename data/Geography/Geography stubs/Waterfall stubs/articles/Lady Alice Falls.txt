Lady Alice Falls is a tall waterfall in Fiordland, New Zealand. It drops either 656  or 919  feet (200 or 280 m). The falls are formed by a mountain stream dropping out of a hanging valley down to Doubtful Sound, one kilometre inside Deep Cove. The falls should not be confused with the Alice Falls, further north in Fiordland, which flow into George Sound.
