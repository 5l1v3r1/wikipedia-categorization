  The Horseshoe Falls, a tiered–cascade waterfall, is located in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania, Australia.  The Horseshoe Falls are situated in the Mount Field National Park, 100 metres (330 ft) upstream of Russell Falls, approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) northwest of Hobart via the Brooker Highway to New Norfolk and are a popular tourist attraction. The waterfall descends over horizontal marine Permian siltstone benches, while the vertical faces of the falls are composed of resistant sandstone layers.
