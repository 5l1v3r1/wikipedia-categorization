  The Tolmer Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Tolmer Creek that is located in the Litchfield National Park in the Northern Territory of Australia.  The waterfall descends from an elevation of 102 metres (335 ft) above sea level in two drops that range in height between 32–42 metres (105–138 ft)  into a plunge pool. Accessed by sealed road, the falls are near the western boundary of the national park, approximately 85 kilometres (53 mi) south of Darwin.  The falls were named by explorer Frederick Henry Litchfield after his late father's colleague in the South Australia Police, Alexander Tolmer.
