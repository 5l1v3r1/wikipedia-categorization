Torca Island was an inhabited phantom island said to be located in the Indian Ocean, possibly in the East Indies. It purportedly vanished when a volcano erupted on June 4, 1693. The survivors escaped to a nearby island called Amboy (also called Amboyan, present-day Ambon Island) on 18 July 1693.  The villagers attempted to flee in canoes or by swimming, but many people died attempting to do this.
