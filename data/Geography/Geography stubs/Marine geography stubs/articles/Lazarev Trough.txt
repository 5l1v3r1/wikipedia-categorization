It was named for the Russian polar explorer Admiral Mikhail P. Lazarev, commanding officer of the sloop Mirnyy during the Bellingshausen expedition of 1819–1821. The name, proposed by Dr. G. Agapova of the Geological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, was approved by the Advisory Committee for Undersea Features in August 1985.   This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Lazarev Trough" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
