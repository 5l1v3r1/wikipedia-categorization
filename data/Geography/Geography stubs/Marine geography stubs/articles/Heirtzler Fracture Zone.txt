The Heirtzler Fracture Zone (63°30′S 162°30′E﻿ / ﻿63.500°S 162.500°E﻿ / -63.500; 162.500Coordinates: 63°30′S 162°30′E﻿ / ﻿63.500°S 162.500°E﻿ / -63.500; 162.500) is an undersea fracture zone named for James R. Heirtzler, a geophysicist who was a pioneer in geomagnetics studies. The name was proposed by Steven C. Cande, William F. Haxby, and Carol A. Raymond of the Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory (now the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory), and was approved by the Advisory Committee on Undersea Features in 1993.   This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Heirtzler Fracture Zone" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
