The Hodgson Seamount is a seamount in the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of the New England Seamounts which was active more than 100 million years ago. It was formed when the North American Plate moved over the New England hotspot.  It was named after Robert David Hodgson, an American geographer and an internationally recognized expert on geographic aspects of the law of the sea and maritime boundaries.
