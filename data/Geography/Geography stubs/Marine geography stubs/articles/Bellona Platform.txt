The Bellona Platform is a submarine geological feature encompassing the Chesterfield Islands (19°21′S 158°40′E﻿ / ﻿19.350°S 158.667°E﻿ / -19.350; 158.667)  and Bellona Reefs (21°00′00″S 158°59′58″E﻿ / ﻿20.999948°S 158.999313°E﻿ / -20.999948; 158.999313)  west of New Caledonia. It was once a 22,800 square kilometres (8,800 sq mi) landmass, which became mostly submerged when sea levels rose at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, 20,000 years ago. It might have played a role in the spread of flora and fauna, including humans, in the southwest Pacific.
