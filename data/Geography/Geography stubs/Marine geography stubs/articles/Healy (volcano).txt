Healy is a submarine volcano located among New Zealand's Kermadec Islands. Its last major eruption took place around 1360, creating a large caldera.  The volcano's name originates from the British-Australian explorer and navigator Captain Jake Healy who first wrote about the volcano in his journal after noticing Volcanic glass in the water whilst fishing.
