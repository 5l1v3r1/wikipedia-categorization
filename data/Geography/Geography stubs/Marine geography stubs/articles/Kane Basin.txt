Kane Basin is an Arctic waterway lying between Greenland and Canada's northernmost island, Ellesmere Island. It links Smith Sound to Kennedy Channel and forms part of Nares Strait. It is approximately 180 kilometres in length and 130 km at its widest. It is named after Elisha Kane, whose expedition in search of the lost Franklin expedition crossed it in 1854. Kane himself had named it "Peabody Bay," in honor of philanthropist George Peabody, the major funder of Kane's expedition.  Currently Peabody Bay is a bay at the eastern side of the basin, off the southwestern end of the Humboldt Glacier.
