The Laurentian fan or abyss is an underwater depression off the eastern coast of Canada in the Atlantic Ocean.  Not a trench, but more of an "underwater valley", it is estimated to be at most ~19,685 feet (3.7 miles; 6.0 km) in depth. The Laurentian fan is a product of glaciation and water currents from the Saint Lawrence River.  It is part of the Laurentian cone region, bound by the Laurentian Channel and the Sohm Abyssal Plain. The fan is the site of hydrothermal vents with their own sub ecosystems independent of sunlight.
