The Mindanao Current is an ocean current along the eastward side of the southern Philippines. It is a narrow, southward flowing current starting at 14°N with 13Sv increasing in strength to 33Sv at 5.5°N. The current splits before the coast of south-east Mindanao where one part flows cyclonically into the Celebes Sea later feeding the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) while another part feeds the NECC directly.
