 The Tasman Outflow is the most recently discovered of the world ocean's major ocean currents.  The existence of the outflow was published by scientists of the Australian CSIRO's Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research team in August 2007, interpreting salinity and temperature data captured from 1950 to 2002. The deepwater current passes at an average depth of 800â€“1,000 metres from the Pacific Ocean outside Tasmania's southern shores into the Southern Ocean that encircles Antarctica, the vast 'flywheel' that stabilizes global distribution of heat.
