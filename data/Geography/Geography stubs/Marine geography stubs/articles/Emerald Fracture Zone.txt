Emerald Fracture Zone (62°S 170°E﻿ / ﻿62°S 170°E﻿ / -62; 170Coordinates: 62°S 170°E﻿ / ﻿62°S 170°E﻿ / -62; 170) is an undersea fracture zone running the distance from the southwest corner of the Campbell Plateau to the northern tip of Iselin Bank. The name was proposed by Dr. Steven C. Cande of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for the vessel Emerald, which traversed this region in 1821, and was approved by the Advisory Committee for Undersea Features in June 1997.   This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Geological Survey document "Emerald Fracture Zone" (content from the Geographic Names Information System).
