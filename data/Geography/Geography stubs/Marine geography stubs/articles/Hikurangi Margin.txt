The Hikurangi Margin is an active subduction zone extending off the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, where the Pacific and Australian plates collide.  It is the southern portion of the Tonga–Kermadec–Hikurangi subduction zone and its main feature is the Hikurangi Trench. Earthquakes of up to 8.2M have been recorded on the Hikurangi Margin, generating local tsunamis, and earthquakes in the 9.0M range are thought to be possible.  The Ruatoria debris avalanche originated on the north part of the subduction zone and probably occurred around 170,000 years ago.
