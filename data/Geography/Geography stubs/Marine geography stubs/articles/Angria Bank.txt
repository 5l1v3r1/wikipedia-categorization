  Submerged bank Angria Bank is a bank, a shallow sunken atoll, on the continental shelf off the west coast of India. It is located 105 kilometres (65 mi) west of Vijaydurg, Maharashtra.  The name Angria Bank is derived from the name of one of the most successful Naval Admirals of Maratha King Chatrapati Shivaji viz. Kanhoji Angre, whose name was spelled Cunhojee Angria in British documents. Angre was based at Vijaydurg Fort and hence the name. The bank is at an average depth of approx 35 metres (115 ft), and its dimensions are 40 kilometres (25 mi) from north to south and 15 kilometres (9 mi) from east to west. It is believed to be a coral habitat. The bottom is supposedly composed of sand, shells, and coral. The bank is steep-to on all sides, with great depths surrounding it.  Angria Bank is 200 kilometres (120 mi) north of Adas Bank, a similar submerged feature off the coast of Goa. As of  2008[update], Angria Bank is accessible by a two-hour boat ride from Malvan, Maharashtra.  In 2008, Maharashtra state Finance Minister Jayant Patil announced a Rs 50 million initiative to explore Angria Bank to determine the feasibility of further marine tourism in the area.  The first ever underwater scientific expedition was carried out by well known marine biologist Sarang Kulkarni in April 2010. Subsequent research missions have been undertaken by the National Institute of Oceanography. It revealed significant bio diversity though the results are yet to be published.
