  The Bremer Marine Park (formerly Bremer Commonwealth Marine Reserve) is a 4472 km2 marine protected area, with a depth range of about 15–5000 m, lying in the Southern Ocean off the southern coast of Western Australia about 50 km south-east of the town of Bremer Bay. An area of 284 km2, comprising the northernmost section adjoining Western Australia’s coastal waters, has been zoned as a marine national park (IUCN Category II), with the remainder as multiple use or special purpose zones (IUCN Category VI).  It was gazetted in 14 December 2013 and was renamed on 11 October 2017.   The marine park provides important seasonal calving habitat for southern right whales as well as supporting migrating humpback whales. It is a foraging area for Australian sea lions, Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses, flesh-footed shearwaters, soft-plumaged petrels and great white sharks. It also encompasses Bremer Canyon, a submarine canyon known as a biodiversity hotspot supporting seasonal aggregations of sperm and killer whales.
