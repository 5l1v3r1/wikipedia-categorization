Orca Seamount is a seamount (underwater volcano) near King George Island in Antarctica, in the Bransfield Strait.  While it is inactive.  However last volcanic activity at Orca Seamount is judged to have occurred in the recent past as there are temperature anomalies in the seawater around at the seamount.   Thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms organism have been fount at the seamount.  The crater rim is about 3 km wide and about 500 m above the ocean floor.  The seamount was first named by Professor O. González-Ferrán of Chile in 1987, after the orca (killer whale) often sighted in these waters.   It was mapped and studied by the ship RV Polarstern during an Antarctic cruise (number ANT-XI/3) in 2005.  The variant name of Viehoff Seamount (approved in 6/95 ACUF 263) was named for Dr. Thomas Viehoff, a remote sensing specialist in marine sciences. Name proposed by Dr. G.B. Udintsev, Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry (VIG).
