Scripps Canyon is a narrow underwater gorge located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California, United States. The canyon is approximately 1 mile (1.6Â km) long and joins to La Jolla Canyon offshore. It is located near the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a major oceanographic research institution, and as a result is one of the best-studied underwater canyons. Scripps Canyon is also a popular site for recreational divers, because of its vertical walls and high density of marine life.
