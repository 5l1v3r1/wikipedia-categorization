The Alaska Current is a southwestern warm-water current along the coast of British Columbia and the Alaska Panhandle. The current results from the northward diversion of a portion of the North Pacific Current when that current meets the west coast of the North American continent. It forms a part of he Alaska Current continues into the Alaskan Stream, which begins near Kodiak Island and flows southwestward along the Alaska Peninsula. The Alaska Current produces large clockwise eddies at two sites: west of the Queen Charlotte Islands ("Queen Charlotte Eddy" or "Haida Eddies") and west of Sitka, Alaska ("Sitka Eddy").
