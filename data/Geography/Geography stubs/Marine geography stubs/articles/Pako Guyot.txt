Coordinates: 15°30′N 155°0′E﻿ / ﻿15.500°N 155.000°E﻿ / 15.500; 155.000Pako Guyot (also known as Caiwei ) is a guyot in the Pacific Ocean, which reaches a depth of 1,210 metres (3,970 ft). It has dimensions of 40 by 65 kilometres (25 mi × 40 mi) and features a summit plateau 2,056 square kilometres (794 sq mi) wide.  It is part of the Magellan Seamounts.  The seamount was volcanically active 91.3 million years ago  and may have formed on a hotspot together with Ioah Guyot and Vlinder Guyot.  Volcanic rocks dredged from Pako are of hawaiitic composition and geochemically resemble these erupted by the Rarotonga hotspot.  Ophiuroids, most of which are symbiotic with corals and sponges, live on the seamount and its flanks.
