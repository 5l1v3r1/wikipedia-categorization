Browns Mountain, also sometimes spelt Brown's Mountain, is a small submarine mountain – a seamount – lying in the south-western Pacific Ocean 38 km off the coast of New South Wales, Australia, about 50 km east of the city of Sydney. The waters around the seamount are about 600 m in depth, while the mountain itself rises some 133 m above the sea floor. It is a popular site for commercial and recreational fishing.   It got its name from Ernie Brown, the popular local Sydney fisherman who discovered it.
