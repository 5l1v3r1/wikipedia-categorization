The Arctic Basin (also North Polar Basin) is an oceanic basin in the Arctic Ocean, consisting of two main parts separated by the Lomonosov Ridge, a mid-ocean ridge running between north Greenland and the New Siberian Islands. The basin is bordered by the continental shelves of Eurasia and North America.    There was an expedition to the North Polar Basin by Fridtjof Nansen and Otto Sverdrup in the Fram in 1893â€“1896. Roald Amundsen sailed across the North Polar Basin between 1922 and 1924.
