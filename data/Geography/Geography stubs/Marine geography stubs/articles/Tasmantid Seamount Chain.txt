The Tasmantid  Seamount Chain is a 2,000 km (1,200 mi) long chain of seamounts in the South Pacific Ocean. The chain consists of over 16 extinct volcanic peaks, many rising more than 4,000 m (13,000 ft) from the seabed.  It is one of the two parallel seamount chains alongside the East Coast of Australia; the Lord Howe and Tasmantid seamount chains both run north-south through parts of the Coral Sea and Tasman Sea. These chains have longitudes of approximately 159°E and 156°E respectively.  Like its neighbour, the Tasmantid Seamount Chain has resulted from the Indo-Australian Plate moving northward over a stationary hotspot.  It ranges in age from 40 to 6 million years old.  Alternative names for the Tasmantid  Seamount Chain include the Tasmantid Seamounts, Tasman Seamounts, Tasman Seamount Chain and the Tasmantide Volcanoes.  The Tasmantid Seamount Chain includes the following: Coordinates: 31°00′S 156°00′E﻿ / ﻿31.000°S 156.000°E﻿ / -31.000; 156.000
