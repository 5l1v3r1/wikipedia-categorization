The Eastern Gemini Seamount, also known as Oscostar, is a seamount in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Vanuatu's Tanna and Matthew Islands. The only recorded eruption from Eastern Gemini was observed by a passing ship on February 18, 1996 when bursts of very dark water were observed.
