Quiroga Ridge (Bulgarian: хребет Кирога, 'Hrebet Quiroga' \'hre-bet ki-'ro-ga\) is a submarine ridge in False Bay, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica.  It extends 2.2 km in an east-southeast to west-northwest direction between Ogosta Point on the Rozhen Peninsula and the opposite coast of Hurd Peninsula at a depth of over 50 m, with depths exceeding 100 m on both sides of the ridge. It was formed as a frontal moraine of Huntress Glacier between the 13th and 17th centuries.
