The Broad Fourteens is an area of the southern North Sea that is fairly consistently fourteen fathoms (84 feet/26 metres) deep. Thus, on a nautical chart with depths given in fathoms, a broad area with many "14" notations can be seen. The Broad Fourteens region is located off the coast of the Netherlands and south of the Dogger Bank, roughly between longitude 3°E and 4°30'E and latitude 52°30'N and 53°30'N. The area is known to the Dutch and German navies as the Breeveertien. Geologically it is comparable to the Long Forties, another submerged plateau that has related origins. The area has been the scene of many naval engagements throughout history.
