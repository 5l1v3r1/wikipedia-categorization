The Retriever Seamount is a seamount in the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of the New England Seamounts, which was active more than 100 million years ago. It was formed when the North American Plate moved over the New England hotspot.   It is located inside the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which was proclaimed by President of the  United States Barack Obama to protect the seamount's biodiversity.
