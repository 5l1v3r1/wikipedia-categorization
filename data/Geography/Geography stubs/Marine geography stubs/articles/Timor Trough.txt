The Timor Trough is an oceanic trough that is a continuation of the Sunda Trench that marks the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate's continental shelf and the Timor Plate to the north.  It is separated from the Java Trench by a sag near Sumba Island at the Scott Plateau and North Australian Basin, and on the other end becomes Tanimbar trough southeast of the Tanimbar Islands continuing on to the Aru trough east of the Kai Islands near Bird's Head Peninsula on New Guinea.  Lining the north of the trough are numerous islands, of which Timor is the largest. Further west are the Weber Basin and Banda Trench. Oil and natural gas have been found south of the trough  and the region is geologically active with numerous earthquakes.
