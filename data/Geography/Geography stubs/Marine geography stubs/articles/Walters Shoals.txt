The Walters Shoals is a group of submerged mountains off the coast of Madagascar. Despite being 700 kilometres (430 mi) from the coast, the tips of some of the mountains are only 18 metres (59 ft) below the surface. The Walters Shoals is home to many species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It was discovered in 1963 by the South African Hydrographic Frigate SAS Natal captained by Cmdr Walters. When found it had a huge population of Galápagos sharks but they have since been fished out.
