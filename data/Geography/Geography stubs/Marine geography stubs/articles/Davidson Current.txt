In oceanography, the Davidson Current is a coastal countercurrent of the Pacific Ocean running north along the western coast of the United States from Baja California, Mexico to northern Oregon, ending at about latitude 48Â°N.   Its flow is adjacent to the California Current, but it flows north rather than south and hugs the coastline. The current is active year-round at 650 feet (200 meters) below sea level, but surfaces during the winter months, generally from mid-November through mid-February.  In these months, northerly winds weaken and are replaced to some extent by southeasterly winds.
