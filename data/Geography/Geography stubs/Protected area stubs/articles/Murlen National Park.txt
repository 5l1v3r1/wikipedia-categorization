So the thickness of the forest in the park is generally compared to the forest found in the Amazon region in South America. Some of the trees found in the park are as old as 350 years. There is an area in the park where not even a single sun’s ray can penetrate. And for this reason the area has been known as ‘losing area of seven fellow-men’ or land of no return.  The vegetation is admixture of Quercus, Schima wallichii, Betula, Michelia champaca, Pinus kesiya, Prunus, Myrica, Rhododendron, Chimonobambusa callosa, canes and a variety of orchids and lichens.
