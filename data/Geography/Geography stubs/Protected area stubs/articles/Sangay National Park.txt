Sangay National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Sangay) is a national park located in the Morona Santiago, Chimborazo and Tungurahua provinces of Ecuador. The park contains two active volcanoes (Tungurahua and Sangay), one extinct volcano El Altar (Kapak Urku), and ecosystems ranging from tropical rainforests to glaciers. The park has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. In 1992, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to illegal poaching, extensive grazing, unplanned road construction and encroachment of the park's perimeter. It was removed from the UNESCO list of endangered sites in 2005. The National Park is an important refuge for rare species of the Andes, like mountain tapir and spectacled bear. Especially for the mountain tapir, the park is one of the most important strongholds.  In the forests below live spectacled bears, giant otter, jaguar, ocelot, margay, Brazilian tapir, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ustus), little red brocket deer and Northern pudu. About 300-400 bird species inhabit the Park.  The cougar and pampas cat have been recorded in the park as well.  In 2016, a new Pristimantis species was described from the park's cloud forest.
