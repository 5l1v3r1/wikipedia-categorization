  Warrenben Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Yorke Peninsula of South Australia about 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) north-east of Marion Bay.  The conservation park which held protected area status under previous legislation was re-proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 in 1972.  The following statement of significance appears in the conservation park’s management plan:Together with nearby Innes National Park, it conserves a substantial proportion of the natural habitat remaining on southern Yorke Peninsula.  The park comprises an area of undulating limestone plains and low, stabilised dunes that remain well vegetated with mallee and tea-tree scrub and some sheoak woodlands.  It provides habitat for a number of threatened species including the nationally and state vulnerable Annual Candles, state rare Goldsack’s Leek-orchid (Prasophyllum goldsackii), and the nationally and state vulnerable Malleefowl and Western Whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis leucogaster).   The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area.
