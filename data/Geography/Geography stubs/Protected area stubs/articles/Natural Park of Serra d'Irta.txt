Peniscola (15 mi) and Alcossebre (15 mi) The Natural Park of Serra d'Irta (Valencian: Parc Natural de la Serra d'Irta, Spanish: Parque Natural de la Sierra de Irta) is a natural park with 7,744 hectares of land, as well as a marine nature reserve. These mountain and shoreline areas were declared a protected area by the Valencian government on July 16, 2002. The park protects the environment of large zones of the Serra d'Irta mountain range and of the adjacent Mediterranean Sea coastal area in the Costa del Azahar. Besides the reefs of the marine reserve extending into the sea, the natural park includes a moderately high coastal mountain range with a maximum altitude of 572 metres (Campanella). The range runs parallel to the coast and forks in the south in an area separated by the Estopet valley. On the coastal side the mountains descend abruptly along 12 km with numerous cliffs, coves and cornices.  Large swathes of urbanized and touristic areas of the coastal side of Serra d'Irta located at the northern end near Pen√≠scola, as well as at the southern end, near Alcossebre, are not included in the Park.
