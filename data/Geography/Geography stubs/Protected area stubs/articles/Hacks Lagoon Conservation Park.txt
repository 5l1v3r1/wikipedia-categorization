  Hacks Lagoon Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Limestone Coast of South Australia about 24 kilometres (15 miles) south of the town of Naracoorte.  The conservation park was proclaimed on 8 June 1967 for the "protection of wetland values" and to serve as a "waterfowl refuge area free from hunting."  The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category IV protected area.  In 1985, the area covered by both the conservation park and the adjoining Bool Lagoon Game Reserve was added under the name "Bool and Hacks Lagoons" to the List of Wetlands of International Importance maintained by the Ramsar Convention.
