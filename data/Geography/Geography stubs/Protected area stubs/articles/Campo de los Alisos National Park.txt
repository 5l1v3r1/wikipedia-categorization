Located in the Chicligasta Department on the eastern slope of the Nevados del Aconquija, the park has an area of 17,000 ha (170 km2; 66 sq mi). The Aconquija mountains are the southern extension of the Calchaquíes Valleys, the western first steps raising from the Gran Chaco plain into the Northwest region. Annual rainfall here oscillates between 100–200 mm (3.9–7.9 in) Flora and fauna vary considerably with the different heights, from a jungle at lower levels to snow-covered mountainous terrain at 5,000 m (16,000 ft)
