Santuario Igualdad Interespecie ('Sanctuary of Equality between Species'), Santiago de Chile, is an animal sanctuary in the commune of El Monte, about 50 kilometers from Santiago.Launched on November 3, 2014 by Marisol de la Reguera and Ariel Maluenda.    It was set up in 2011, by two activists of the organization Elige Veganismo ('Choose Veganism').  After witnessing the harsh life faced by animals in the meat, poultry and dairy industries, they decide to leave their traditional life in Santiago to build the sanctuary to allow the animals to live in dignified conditions and freedom for the rest of their lives.     The sanctuary is a refugee for farm animals. Its mission is to give a safe and permanent home to the animals that have been rescued from abuse and abandonment.  They work to give to the refugees all veterinary treatments and attend to their emotional necessities as well. In addition, the sanctuary promotes a vegan style life to stop animals suffering. Fighting for a better future and fair treatment to the animals.   People can collaborate to this sanctuary in different ways:  - Being a volunteer.  - People donations in campaigns and benefit events.  - Being a godmother / godfather of one or more refugees, by given a monthly cooperation to them. Contributors can visit their goddaughters / godsons one or two days per month and receive photos of them.  Today, the sanctuary has more than 80 animals including pigs, cows, sheep, goats, chickens and ducks. Also, dogs and cats.   They have hopes for expansion, possibly to form a sanctuary project in the Los RÃ­os Region.
