Latorica Protected Landscape Area (Slovak: Chránená krajinná oblasť Latorica) is the second lowland protected landscape area in Slovakia. It is located in the south-eastern Slovakia, in the Trebišov and Michalovce districts.  The park is located around the Slovak part of Latorica river and around lower part of Ondava and Laborec rivers. The landscape area consists of the system of riverbeds and arms, surrounded by alluvial forest and wetlands. The most noticeable phenomenon of the PLA is the rare water and swamp biocenose, unique in Slovakia. Due to the location and character of this PLA, the area is used by waterfowl, not only for nesting, but also, in the case of migratory birds, for short rests. A part of river's watershed ("Ramsar site No. 606", 44.05 km²) was added to the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance since 1993.
