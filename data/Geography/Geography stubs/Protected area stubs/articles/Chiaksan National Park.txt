Chiaksan National Park (Korean: 치악산국립공원, 雉岳山國立公園) is located in the province of Gangwon-do, South Korea. It was designated as the 16th national park in 1984.  The park is named after the 1,288-metre (4,226 ft)  mountain Chiaksan, which in turn had its name changed from Jeokakasan to Chiaksan, meaning "Pheasant Peak Mountain", based on a myth about a man who saved a pheasant from being eaten by a snake.  The park is home to a total of 821 plant species and 2,364 animal species. Among the animals 34 are endangered, including the Flying squirrel and Hodgson's Bat.
