The Kragga Kamma Game Park is a small reserve within the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. One of the cheetahs featured in the movie Duma used to reside at Kragga Kamma. He died towards the end of November 2011 from kidney failure which is not unusual for wild cats in captivity. Leg 4 of The Amazing Race Australia included a visit to Kragga Kamma. The Kragga Kamma Game Park is home to the southern white rhinoceros, South African cheetah, Burchell's zebra, South African giraffe, nyala, bontebok, lechwe and African buffalo.
