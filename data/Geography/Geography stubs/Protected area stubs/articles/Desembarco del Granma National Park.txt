Desembarco del Granma National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Desembarco del Granma) is a national park in south-eastern Cuba, in what is now Granma Province.  The  name of the park means "Landing of the Granma" and refers to the yacht in which Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Ra√∫l Castro, and 79 of their supporters sailed from Mexico to Cuba in 1956 and incited the Cuban Revolution.  It was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site because of its uplifted marine terraces and pristine sea cliffs.  Media related to Desembarco del Granma National Park at Wikimedia Commons
