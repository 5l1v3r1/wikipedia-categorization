Copo National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Copo) is a federal protected area in Santiago del Estero Province, Argentina. Established on 22 November 2000,  it houses a representative sample of the Dry Chaco biodiversity in average state of conservation. Located in the Copo Department, it has an area of 118,118 ha (1,181.18 km2; 456.06 sq mi). The climate is warm, with annual rainfall between 500–700 mm (20–28 in). A large part of the park is made up of forests, with the Santiago red quebracho (quebracho colorado santiagueño) being its characteristic tree species. This tree has a strong wood and high content of tannin, and in the past it suffered a devastating exploitation in other parts of the country. At the beginning of the 20th century, Santiago del Estero was 80% quebracho scrubland; nowadays only 20% remain. Some of the endangered species that live in this park include the maned wolf,  jaguar, the giant anteater, the chacoan peccary and the giant armadillo.
