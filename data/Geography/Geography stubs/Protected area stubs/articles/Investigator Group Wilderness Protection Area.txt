  Investigator Group Wilderness Protection Area is a protected area located in the Investigator Group of islands off the west coast of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia between 25 kilometres (16 miles) to 70 kilometres (43 miles) south-west of Elliston.   The wilderness protection area was proclaimed in August 2011 under the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 in order to protect ‘important haul-out areas for the Australian sea lion and New Zealand fur seal’ and habitat for species such as White-faced storm petrels, Cape Barren geese and mutton birds  and the Pearson Island black-footed rock-wallaby.  The wilderness protection area was created from land excised from the Investigator Group Conservation Park.   It consists of the Ward Islands, the Top Gallant Isles, and the Pearson Isles which consist of Dorothee Island, Pearson Island and Veteran Isles with exception of a portion of land on Pearson Island which is held by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority for ‘lighthouse purposes’.  The Wilderness Protection Area is classified as an IUCN Category Ib protected area.
