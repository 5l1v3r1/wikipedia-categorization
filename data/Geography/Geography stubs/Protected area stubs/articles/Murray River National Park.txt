  Murray River National Park is a protected area  in South Australia located between 180 kilometres (110 mi) and 240 km (150 mi) north east of the Adelaide city centre.  The national park was proclaimed in 1972 "to conserve a significant proportion of South Australia’s floodplain environments which are not represented widely in other reserve systems."  The national park consists of three sections adjoining the Murray River and extending from near Loxton in the south west to near Renmark in the north-east.  The first which is known as the ‘Katarapko’ section is located on the north side of the river between Loxton in the south and Berri in the north.  The second section which is known as the ‘Lyrup Flats’ section is located on the north side of the river midway between Berri and Loxton.  The third section is known as the ‘Bulyong’ section is located on the west side of the river upstream from Renmark.     The national park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.
