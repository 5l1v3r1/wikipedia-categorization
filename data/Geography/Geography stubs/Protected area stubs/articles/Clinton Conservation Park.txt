  Clinton Conservation Park is a protected area located on the coastline at the north end of Gulf St Vincent in South Australia. The conservation park consists of two parts with the first extending from Clinton on Yorke Peninsula on the west side of Gulf St Vincent to Port Wakefield on the east side of the gulf and the second extending south of Port Wakefield to Sandy Point. The conservation park which was originally proclaimed in 1970, was re-proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.  The area contained within the conservation park including the ‘head of gulf wetland and Wakefield River estuary’ is considered to be ‘important as a fish nursery and a significant site for migratory wading birds’.  The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.
