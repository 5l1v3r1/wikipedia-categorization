  Chowilla Game Reserve is a protected area covering the floodplain on the north side of the River Murray in South Australia from about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) north-east of Renmark to the New South Wales border.  It was proclaimed 8 April 1993 in conjunction with the Chowilla Regional Reserve.  Its creation arises from a community consultation process which recommended that ‘hunting of waterfowl be a permitted activity in selected areas of the Chowilla floodplain’.  The game reserve is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.
