  The Pages Conservation Park is a protected area in the Australian state of  South Australia located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) south-east of Cape Jervis  and about 98 kilometres (61 miles) south south-west of Adelaide city centre.  It consists of the island group known as The Pages and adjoining waters.  The protected area status exists to protect the island group’s use as a breeding area by Australian sea lions and sea birds.  The proclamation as The Pages Conservation Park in 1972 after the enactment of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 replaced the island group’s previous protected status as a Fauna Conservation Reserve proclaimed under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1967 in 1967.  The boundary of the conservation park was extended 3 nautical miles (6 km) seawards during the 1990s in order to control berleying associated with both shark cage diving and shark fishing.  The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category IA protected area.
