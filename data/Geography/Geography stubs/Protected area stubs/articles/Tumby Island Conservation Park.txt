  Tumby Island Conservation Park is a protected area associated with Tumby Island in Spencer Gulf in South Australia about 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) southeast of Tumby Bay.  The land which now comprises the conservation park previously received statutory protection in January 1969 and was re-proclaimed in 1972 under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.  The area under protection is considered significant for the following reason: ‘a small island providing feeding and roosting habitat for seabirds.’  The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area.
