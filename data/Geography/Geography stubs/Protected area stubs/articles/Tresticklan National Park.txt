Tresticklan National Park (Swedish: Tresticklan nationalpark) is located in the municipality of Dals-Ed in northwestern Dalsland, Sweden, along the Norwegian border. "Trestickel" means "trident", possibly a reference to the shape of Lake Stora Tresticklan. This national park contains one of the few remaining areas of old-growth forest in southern Scandinavia. The park was established in 1996 and has an area of 28.97 km2 (11.19 sq mi). The park's highest point is the Orshöjden (276 m.a.sl).
