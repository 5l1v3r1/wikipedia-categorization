The Tanintharyi Nature Reserve is a nature reserve in the Tenasserim Hills, Burma, north of Tanintharyi National Park on the border with Thailand, adjacent to Kaeng Krachan National Park. It is governed by the Burma Forest Department and the level of protection is partial.  Elevations within the reserve range from 20–1,300 m. Tourists are not permitted within the nature reserve. The purposes of the reserve are habitat conservation, scientific research, and education. The typical habitat is tropical evergreen forest which covers 75% of its area; the remainder is mixed deciduous forest with bamboo clumps as well as grassland. The endangered Gurney's pitta, native to Thailand and Myanmar, is found in the reserve.
