Anibare is a district in the island nation Nauru, a part of the Anabar Constituency. It is located in the east of the island, and covers an area of 3.1 km2 (1 sq mi). It has a population of about 250. It is thus Nauru's largest district in area, and among the smallest in population. Nauru's reputation for being densely populated is thus somewhat nuanced, since it refers principally to the average areas and populations of districts other than Anibare.
