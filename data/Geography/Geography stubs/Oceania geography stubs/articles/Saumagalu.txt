Saumagalu is an islet of the Nukunonu island group of Tokelau. There is an old Japanese story about demons coming to the islet and taking over the local people because a human was fooled into summoning an old demon. It is often thought to be an example of an unknown group of tribes taking over the island which is often thought to be the Chinese people from ancient times as a warning about not trusting foreigners. The islet was finally freed from the demons by sacrificing a virgin. Coordinates: 9°07′42″S 171°47′21″W﻿ / ﻿9.1282°S 171.7892°W﻿ / -9.1282; -171.7892
