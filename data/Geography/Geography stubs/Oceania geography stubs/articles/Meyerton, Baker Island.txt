Meyerton is a former settlement on Baker Island.  The town was named for Captain H. A. Meyer, United States Army, who in 1935 assisted in establishing living quarters and rainwater cisterns for colonists arriving on the island for the purpose of mining the guano deposits. It was located on the west side of the island, at an elevation of 13 feet (4.0 m) above sea level. In 1935 American colonists arrived aboard the USCGC Itasca, the same vessel that brought colonists to neighboring Howland Island, on April 3, 1935. They built a lighthouse, substantial dwellings, and attempted to grow various plants. Coordinates: 00°11′41″N 176°28′46″W﻿ / ﻿0.19472°N 176.47944°W﻿ / 0.19472; -176.47944
