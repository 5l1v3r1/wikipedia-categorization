San Jose is the largest village on the island of Tinian, in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is located on the south coast of the island, close to the island's main harbor and three beaches: Kammer Beach, Taga Beach, and Tachogña Beach. Now home to most of Tinian's population of about 1000, San Jose is close to the site of a much larger ancient village of the Chamorro culture, which may have housed 12,000-15,000 people.
