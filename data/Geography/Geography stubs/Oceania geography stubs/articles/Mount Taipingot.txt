Mount Taipingot lies at the southern end of Songsong Village on the Rota in the Mariana Islands. It is connected to the main part of Rota by a tombolo, on which is the southern part of Songsong village.  It is more commonly known as "Wedding Cake Mountain" because of its resemblance to a layered wedding cake. The areas in and around the mountain are conservation areas established to protect the native flora and fauna that thrive there.
