Ngarchelong is a state in Palau. Ngarchelong is at the northernmost tip of the island of Babeldaob. Only the state of Kayangel is farther north.  Ngarchelong is an important historical site and has undergone archeological excavation. Ngarchelong is the site of ancient stone monoliths which are mysterious in origin.  Traditional Palaun religion regarded these stone monoliths as sacred prayer ground.  There are other stone monoliths located in and around the islands but one will not see as many as there are in Ngarchelong. The state has a population of slightly under 500 people, making it the fifth most populated of Palau's sixteen states, although it is ranked thirteenth in land (with only about 10 square kilometers). The village of Mengellang serves as the state capital, and lies toward the south of the state. Mengellang and Ollei are the state's main population centers. The Ministry of Education operates public schools. Ngarchelong Elementary School, established in 1947, moved to its current site in Bai ra Mengellang from the original site in the community bai of Yebong hamlet in 1953. Its current building opened in 1964. It served students from Choll.  Ngaraard Elementary School in Ngaraard formerly served Ngarchelong.  Palau High School in Koror is the country's only public high school, so children from this community go there.  Coordinates: 7°42′N 134°37′E﻿ / ﻿7.700°N 134.617°E﻿ / 7.700; 134.617
