Coordinates: 21°40′N 151°35′E﻿ / ﻿21.667°N 151.583°E﻿ / 21.667; 151.583  Los Jardines or Los Buenos Jardines  (Spanish, "the good gardens") are phantom islands supposedly located either near New Guinea, [dubious  – discuss] or later, northeast of the Mariana Islands.  The islands were reportedly visited by Spanish explorers Alvaro de Saavedra in 1528  and Ruy López de Villalobos in 1542.  Saavedra named them, and described them as 10 low-lying atolls.   Sighted again by John Marshall in 1788,  they had moved northwards [dubious  – discuss] where they were purported to be part of an Anson Archipelago, which included other phantom islands such as Ganges Island as well as real islands such as Wake and Marcus Islands.  In 1973 the International Hydrographic Organization removed them from its charts.
