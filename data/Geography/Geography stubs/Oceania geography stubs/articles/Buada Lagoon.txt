Buada Lagoon is a landlocked, slightly brackish, freshwater lake of Buada District in the island nation of Nauru. It occupies about 0.05 square miles (0.13 km2). The lagoon is classified as an endorheic lake, meaning there is no outflow to other bodies of water such as oceans or rivers. Unlike in many areas of Nauru, trees are in relative abundance in the vicinity of Buada Lagoon.
