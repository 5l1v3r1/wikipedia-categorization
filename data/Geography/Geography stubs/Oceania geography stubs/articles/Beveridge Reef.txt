Beveridge Reef is a submerged atoll located in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Niue, approximately 130 miles (209 km) from Niue and 600 miles (966 km) from the Cook Islands.    The reef is normally submerged,  with a small part is visible at low tide.   It has been the cause of several fishing boats running aground.  The wreck of the Nicky Lou of Seattle, a fiberglass hulled fishing vessel that ran aground on the reef, can be seen on the reef.  Elsdon Best reported that "according to native tradition at Rarotonga, the Beveridge Reef  was once a fine isle, with many coconut-palms growing thereon, but that it was swept bare by a fierce hurricane, which carried away both trees and soil, leaving nothing but the bare rock."
