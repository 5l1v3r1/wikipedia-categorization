Bounty Bay is an embayment of the Pacific Ocean into Pitcairn Island. Bounty Bay is named after the Bounty, a British naval vessel whose eighteenth century mutiny was immortalized in the novel Mutiny on the Bounty, and the numerous subsequent motion pictures made of it. The mutineers sailed the Bounty to Pitcairn Island and destroyed her by fire in Bounty Bay. Current Pitcairn Islanders are largely lineal descendants of the mutineers, as exhibited by some of their surnames.  Travellers to Pitcairn are usually brought in by longboat into Bounty Bay.
