The Moqua Well is a small underground lake, in Nauru. During World War II, Moqua Well was the primary source of drinking water for inhabitants of Nauru.  It is for this reason that the body of water is referred to as a well instead of a lake.  In 2001, Nauruan authorities decided to put up a fence to prevent accidents, after an alcohol-related drowning in the same year.   The well is located below the Yaren district. The Moqua Well is not well known, one of a few attractions in Nauru. The name of the well 'Moqua' (sometimes referred to as 'Makwa') is derived from the former name by which Yaren was known. Nearby are the Moqua Caves, a series of underground caves below Yaren.
