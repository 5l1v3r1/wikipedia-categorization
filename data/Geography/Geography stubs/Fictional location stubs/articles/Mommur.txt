In the story of Huon of Bordeaux, Mommur is an enchanted forest that is ruled by Oberon, king of the fairies. Variously, the name is also applied to the capital city of Oberon,  and to the fairy land in which the city is located.  The wood in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream may be based on Mommur, although it is not called so by name.
