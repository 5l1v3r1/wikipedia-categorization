Nations: A Simulation Game in International Politics is a case study available from the Georgetown University Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. In the game, students are divided into countries, and they compete against other by trading resources and making treaties. The game takes place on the fictional continent of Lostralia. The students are provided with rules. Each country has resources and secrets. Each country has a series of problems that they must solve and a certain amount of resources that they must get. The game is set on the fictional continent of Lostralia. It consists of seven countries and a neutral zone. The seven states are Spartonia, Bampff, Holy Zott, Pyrote, Libertania, Zamboni, and Crock. Each of the countries have specified resources, cities, and problems. Lostralia is fraught with diplomatic issues and players that all dominate in varying fields: Spartonia-military, Pyrote-religious, Crock-diplomatic, Zamboni-food, and Libertania-freedom.  Lostralia is known for its problems, but also for its ability to overcome them, much like the real world had done between World War I and the end of the Cold War.
