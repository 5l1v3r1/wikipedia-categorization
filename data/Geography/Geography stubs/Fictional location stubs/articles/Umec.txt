Umec is a fictional Middle Eastern country appearing in DC Universe. Its name is an acronym, standing for "unnamed middle eastern country" per its co-creator Greg Rucka.  In The Adventures of Superman, it was occupied by U.S. military forces. Lois Lane was shot while embedded with the troops. Like the other fictional DC Middle Eastern countries - Qurac, Syraq, Kahndaq and Bialya - it is supposed to be on the Persian Gulf.
