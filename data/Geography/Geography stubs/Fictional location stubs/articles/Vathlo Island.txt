Vathlo Island is a fictional location on the planet of Krypton in the DC Comics universe. Vathlo Island is a Kryptonian island continent similar to Australia and populated by a "highly developed black race" of Kryptonians, and "retained its independence throughout history and did not join the planetary federation, though good relations were maintained". Black Kryptonians were first shown in Superman #234, with the island itself shown on a map in #239.  Vathlo was rarely if ever referenced beyond these few issues, although a black Kryptonian named "Iph-Ro of Vathlo" appeared in the more recent Superman: The Man of Steel #111.  An offhand reference to the island was made in Alan Moore's story For the Man Who Has Everything, where "racial trouble with the Vathlo Island immigrants," are mentioned in a dream world Krypton that had avoided destruction. It is believed, based on the appearances of black Kryptonians in recent Superman issues, that the Vathlonians eventually were integrated into Krypton proper.  In Superman: World of New Krypton #4, it is established that Vathlo Islanders settled in Kandor prior to the destruction of Krypton.  In Final Crisis #7 an African-American version of Superman is shown to reside on the alternate universe of Earth-23. This Superman, who's given name is Kalel but adopts the human alias of Calvin Ellis is shown to originate from Vathlo Island of his reality's Krypton. While the island itself has not appeared or even referenced in the television series Smallville, African-looking/dark-skinned Kryptonians have been featured. One was a disciple of Zod, who goes by the name Nam-Ek (portrayed by Leonard Roberts). Another was named Basqat (played by Adrian Holmes).
