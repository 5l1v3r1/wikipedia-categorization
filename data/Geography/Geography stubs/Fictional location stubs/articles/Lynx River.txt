The fictional town of Lynx River was created in the CBC television series North of 60.  In the series Lynx River was located near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, and is supposedly traversed by the Deh Cho River, though the river pictured seems smaller than the Deh Cho as it flows through Fort Simpson. Consistent with Hollywood tradition, in the opening episode, local phone numbers began with 555; the area code was 403, which was the area code of the Northwest Territories until just prior to the final episode of the weekly series. The set for this town is located near Bragg Creek, Alberta.
