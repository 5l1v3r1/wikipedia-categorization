Eärwa is the fictional world on which the stories in the Canadian author R. Scott Bakker's The Second Apocalypse series of fantasy novels, consisting so far of the sub-series Prince of Nothing and Aspect-Emperor, are set.  "‘The Prince of Nothing’? In a sentence it’s the story of a holy war waged across exotic lands, and the man who for reasons unknown uses his godlike intellect to enslave it."
