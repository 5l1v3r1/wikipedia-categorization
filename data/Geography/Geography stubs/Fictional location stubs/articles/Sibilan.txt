Lagros' newly elected mayor, Joseph Santiago, discovers that a bunch of wayward employees have turned the municipal hall into a boarding house and, worse, have been making under the table deals. His efforts to fight corruption are blocked by a political dynasty led by Governor Antonio Rubio and Congressman Anton Rubio.
