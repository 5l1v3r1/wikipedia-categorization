Garmouth is the fictional seaside town in which Robert Westall's book, The Machine Gunners is set. Garmouth is based on Tynemouth, a seaside town, near Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North East of England. Garmouth also features in several other novels by Westall, including Fathom Five (the sequel to The Machine Gunners) and The Watch House. Various Garmouth landmarks are described in Fathom Five. Two such landmarks are Collinwood's Monument,  and Wooden Dolly.
