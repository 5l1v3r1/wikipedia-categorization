The Immanent Grove is a fictional small grove of trees in Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea novels. The grove is located near the center of the island of Roke, the headquarters of wizardry, and metaphorically also serves as a focus of magical power in Earthsea.  The Master Patterner resides in the Immanent Grove.  First appearing in the 1968 book, A Wizard of Earthsea,  the Immanent Grove is noted for appearing more extensive when one is inside than when standing outside the grove,  and in some stories it is suggested that it has a supernatural connection to all forests in Earthsea.  For example, the Master Patterner, Azver, lets Irian stay with him in the Immanent Grove.  Initially, Azver befriends Irian as a beginning of a natural evolution of events.  However, because the leaves of the Immanent Grove spoke Irian's name before she ever came there, Azver begins to love her.   In the second trilogy, magical wizardry becomes "consubstantial with trees, most particularly the Immanent Grove on Roke, going deep into the motherly earth."
