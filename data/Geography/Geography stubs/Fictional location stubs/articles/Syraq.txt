Syraq is a fictional Middle Eastern country used in the DC Comics Universe. It was mostly prominent in issues during the 1980s. Now probably defunct, it appeared to have been an amalgamation of Syria and Iraq. It is not surprisingly mistaken on many occasions as being one of these.  Like the other fictional DC middle eastern countries, Qurac, Umec, Bialya and Kahndaq it is supposed to be on the Persian Gulf.
