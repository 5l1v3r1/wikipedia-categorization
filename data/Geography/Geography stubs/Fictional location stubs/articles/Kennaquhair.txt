Kennaquhair (literally, "know-not-where" in Scots) is an imaginary locality in Walter Scott's novels The Monastery and The Abbot. In T. H. White's The Sword in the Stone, Kennaquhair is the land of Athene, mother-goddess of the owls, and is located at the doubly impossible co-ordinates of 91 degrees north and 181 degrees west.
