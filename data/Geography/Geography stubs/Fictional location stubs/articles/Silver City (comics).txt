The Silver City is a fictional location in stories published as part of the DC Universe. It is the home of beings known as angels and of the Presence, the primary deity of Abrahamic theology in the DC Universe. The Silver City debuted in More Fun Comics #52 (February 1940) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Bernard Baily. The modern Silver City was re-imagined for Neil Gaiman's Season of Mists storyline in The Sandman, when the angels Duma and Remiel are dispatched to the Dreaming to observe the events there following Lucifer's abdication of the throne of Hell. The Silver City was initially stated not to be the same as, but is now stated to be Heaven.  It exists "outside the created order of things" and apparently predates the rest of Creation. These same traits are attributed to the Christian Heaven. Gaiman used the location again in his short story "Murder Mysteries", which is set in the Silver City and features the angel Raguel's investigation of the first murder ever. In 1999, comics author Mike Carey started The Sandman spinoff series Lucifer, in which the Silver City is an important and frequently displayed location.
