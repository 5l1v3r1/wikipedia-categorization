Glagnorra Castle is a fictional medieval Scottish castle referenced in the 1946 novel The Quiz Kids and the Crazy Question Mystery (Whitman Publishing) by Carl W. Smith. In that novel, Glagnorra Castle had served as a model for the early 20th century Grimm Castle in the western suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, built by wealthy Chicagoan Arnold Grimm for his wife. In the novel, the abandoned Grimm Castle is an early 20th Century replica of the larger Glagnorra Castle in Scotland, located along the Spring Valley Road. It was built to full scale by wealthy Chicagoan Arnold Grimm as a wedding gift to his wife, but proved impractical as a home, being "drafty and difficult to heat", and was abandoned. A group of jewel thieves take up residence in the massive, remote structure.  A diagram of the Grimm Castle by Isobel Read is featured in the novel.
