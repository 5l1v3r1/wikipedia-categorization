Tyrraz is a fictional artificial planet in the 30th century DC Universe. It is the homeworld of Legion foe Tyr, who was the ruler of this planet. Tyr had the planet cannibalized and transformed into a mobile world, which then travelled throughout the galaxy attacking other planets. One of The Controllers is tasked with stopping it, and begins construction of a Sun-Eater to destroy it. These plans are foiled when a Legion squad, not knowing its intent, destroy the Sun-Eater factory. The Controller then captures these Legionnaires, explains the situation, and forces them to help him in destroying Tyrraz.
