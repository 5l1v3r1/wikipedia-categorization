Durla is a fictional planet in the 30th century DC Universe, best known as the home planet for Legion of Super-Heroes member Chameleon Boy. It is a member world part of the United Planets. Durl' is the only existing planet in the Durla star system. It once sustained a high-order civilization whose warlike tendencies ultimately ended in a conflict known as the "Six-Minute War." The war reduced the planet to nuclear rubble, gradually mutating the native populace until they gained the power to change their form instantly to adapt to their immediate circumstances. This ultimately created a barbaric tribal life on what is colloquially referred to as The Chameleon Planet. Their ability to appear as other than what they are has led to deep distrust among other beings in the galaxy. Few examples of Durlan architecture remain, and those that do are in a state of slow decay from the instantaneous burn of implosion bombs that killed many of the planet's inhabitants. The form of the inhabitants in the time of the holocaust is unknown, as no remains have been found in identifiable condition. Archaeological and anthropological permits were not granted to investigate the circumstances. Whole sections of the planet are essentially barren, wasted by the impact of the high-intensity fusion weapons developed to destroy military bases. Insects, lizards and lower order life dwell in these regions. As surviving Durlans began to gather into tribal packs, each tribe adopted a characteristic shape used in their rituals and worn by Durlans of the tribe who leave the planet. The relationship of any of these shapes to the natural appearance of Durlans is unknown. Best available data indicates these shapes may be those worn by the primary ancestors of the tribe at the Temple - the alleged source of the inhabitants' unique abilities.
