Isbanir (Persian اسبانير or اسپانير) is a city referred to in One Thousand and One Nights as the home of Fakir Taj. It is believed to be based on the real-life Persian city of Asbanbar (in modern-day Iraq), which was one of the seven cities that entailed the Persian capital Ctesiphon. Isbanir is a corruption of the name Asbanbar or Aspanbar.
