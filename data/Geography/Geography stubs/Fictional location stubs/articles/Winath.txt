Winath is a fictional planet in the 30th century DC Comics Universe. Winath is a primarily agrarian planet, settled by humans sometime between the 20th and 30th centuries. For reasons that were never explained, almost all children born on Winath are fraternal twins. Winath is the homeworld of Legionnaires Lightning Lad and Lightning Lass, who are twins, as well as their older sibling, the supervillain Lightning Lord. Their powers are not related to their planet of origin. In post-Zero Hour continuity, Winath is one of the first planets to react to the so-called "Durlan problem" by leaving the United Planets and joining the Affiliated Planets, after one of the twin presidents is shot, supposedly by Chameleon Boy. It transpires this was a plot by his brother, who is arrested by the Legion. In current continuity, Winath is beset by fierce thunderstorms, and most of the buildings are underground (creating the impression on the surface that there are only small isolated farmhouses). Winathians believe in a supernatural being called Validus, the Lord of Lightning. Single births are considered the children of Validus. Mekt Ranzz (Lightning Lord) was a member of a cult which worships Validus, and which has grown in his absence. The members of the cult now seem to include many prominent Winathians and the Ranzz parents. The members of the cult have all acquired lightning powers through nanomachines apparently created by a Coluan named Vrax Gozzl, a member of Mekt's Wanderers. In Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #3, when the three sets of Ranzz twins meet, they discover that each has a different way to pronounce the name of their homeworld, depending on the universe. In the Reboot universe, it is pronounced "Win-Athe", in the Threeboot universe it is pronounced "Win-Ath", and in the post-Infinite Crisis universe it's pronounced "Wine-Ath". (This is a metatextual joke on the part of Geoff Johns, as all three pronunciations were put forward by Legion fans as the proper one.)
