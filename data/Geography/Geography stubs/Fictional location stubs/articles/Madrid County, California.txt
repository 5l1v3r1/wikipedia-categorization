Madrid County, California was the fictional setting of the 1971 CBS television drama Cade's County, starring Glenn Ford as Sheriff Sam Cade.  Madrid County was a vast domain of mostly sparsely populated desert, and was seemingly modeled on the real San Bernardino County, the largest county in the United States in terms of area.
