Weber's World is a fictional planet in the 30th Century DC Comics Universe. It is an artificial planet-sized satellite, constructed for the purpose of housing the government and bureaucracy of the United Planets. It has been attacked several times: by the Khund during the Earthwar; by Daxamite hordes during the Great Darkness Saga; and it was briefly taken over by the Emerald Empress.   It has not been seen since the "threeboot."
