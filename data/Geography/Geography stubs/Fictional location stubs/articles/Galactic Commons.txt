The Galactic Commons (GC) is a fictional universe created by Becky Chambers for her novels The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, A Closed and Common Orbit, and Record of a Spaceborn Few. First laid out in The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, there are few methods used to travel through GC space. Disregarding fuel types, to move short distances GC spaceships employ the use of solid and liquid fuel, in the same way as conventional 20th/21st century rockets. For long distance travel, such as between star systems or to different ends of the galaxy, drives that can penetrate the 'sublayer' are used. The sublayer is a seemingly extra-dimensional area outside of human perception, but with the right equipment, and alien crewmembers who can comprehend it, the sublayer can be used to create wormholes. By 'drilling' through space using an interspacial bore, the sublayer can be accessed, piloted through, and exited. Dropping buoys in transits keeps the tunnel open, and when cages are placed on either end, a stable wormhole has been created. This allows for comfortable and fast long-distance travel through GC space. In order to travel to areas not yet linked via wormhole, pinhole drives can be used - these quickly drop small craft in and out of the sublayer to allow for very fast transit across long distances. Sublayer 'drilling' requires ambi for fuel - one of the most sought-after resources by members of the GC. Various intelligent species inhabit GC space, or are known to the GC. A partial list of literary inventions of life in GC space.
