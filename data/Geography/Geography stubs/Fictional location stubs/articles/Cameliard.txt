In the legends of King Arthur, Cameliard is the home of Guinevere and her father, King Leodegrance.  Although the legends traditionally place the kingdom in Wales, historical roots may be found in Cornwall.  It was at Cameliard that the Round Table was kept prior to being given to Arthur by Leodegrance as part of Guinevere's dowry.
