  Auchenshoogle is a fictional Scottish town, an amalgam of Dundee and Glasgow, the setting (originally unnamed) of the comic strips Oor Wullie and The Broons in The Sunday Post. The name was used infrequently in the early days of the comic strip, coming into more frequent use in the late 1990s. The term has since become a generic Scottish small-town name, used for humour or as a dummy name in legal discussions  and is often claimed to be in Inverness-shire.
