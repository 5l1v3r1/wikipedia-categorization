  Glen Tanar (Scottish Gaelic: Gleann Tanar) is a glen in Aberdeenshire, eastern Scotland, through which the Water of Tanar flows.  Near the mouth of the glen, at Tower o' Ess, the Water of Tanar flows into the River Dee. This flows through Deeside into the North Sea at Aberdeen.  Glen Tanar provides the eastern walking route to Mount Keen, Scotland's most easternly Munro.  Starting at the car park at the end of the public road, walkers follow the glen through the native Caledonian Pine Forest into open moorland before crossing the river to begin the acsent.
