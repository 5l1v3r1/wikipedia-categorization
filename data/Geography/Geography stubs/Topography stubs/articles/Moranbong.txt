 Moranbong or Moran Hill (literally "Peony Hill", often "Peony Peak")  forms a park located in central Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Its 312-foot (95 m) summit is the location of the Pyongyang TV Tower.  There are multiple monumental structures located on Moran Hill. They include the Arch of Triumph, Kim Il-sung Stadium, the monument to President Kim Il-sung's handwritings from his address at a rally to welcome him when he returned to Pyongyang and the mural painting in commemoration of President Kim Il-sung's speech on his return. At the foot of the hill is the Jonsung revolutionary site, which conveys the "revolutionary achievements" of President Kim Il-sung and the Hungbu revolutionary site which is associated with the history of leader Kim Jong Il and includes trees bearing slogans written during the independence revolutionary struggle. The area surrounding the hill is now a recreation area, including the Moranbong Theatre, the Kaeson Youth Park, an open-air theatre in the Youth Park, the Moran Restaurant, an afforestation exhibition and a small zoo. The Okryu Restaurant is also located nearby.  Coordinates: 39°02′25″N 125°45′30″E﻿ / ﻿39.04028°N 125.75833°E﻿ / 39.04028; 125.75833
