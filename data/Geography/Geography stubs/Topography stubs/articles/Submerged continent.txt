A submerged continent or sunken continent is a continental mass, extensive in size, but mainly undersea. The terminology is used by some paleogeologists and geographers in reference to some land masses.  The main examples in this class are the Kerguelen Plateau, Seychelles microcontinent, Mauritia (microcontinent), and Zealandia.  Submerged continents have been sought and speculated about in regard to a possible "lost continent" underwater in the Atlantic Ocean.   There was also a search in the 1930s for Lemuria, believed to have possibly been a submerged continent between the Indian and African coasts.
