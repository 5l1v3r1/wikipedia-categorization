A guelta (Arabic: قلتة‎, also transliterated qalta or galta; Berber: agelmam) is a pocket of water that forms in drainage canals or wadis in the Sahara.  The size and duration will depend on the location and conditions. It may last year-round through the dry season if fed by a source such as a spring.  When a river (wadi) dries up, there may be  pockets of water remaining along its course (c.f. ox-bow lake).  In Western Sahara, gueltas correspond with oases.  Some examples include Guelta d'Archei in Chad and Timia in Niger.
