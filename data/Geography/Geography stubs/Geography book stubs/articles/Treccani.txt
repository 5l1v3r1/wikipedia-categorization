 The Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti (Italian for "Italian Encyclopaedia of Science, Letters, and Arts"), best known as Treccani for its developer Giovanni Treccani or Enciclopedia Italiana, is an Italian-language encyclopaedia. The publication Encyclopaedias: Their History Throughout The Ages regards it as one of the greatest encyclopaedias, along with the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition and the Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana. The first edition was published serially between 1929 and 1936.  In all, 35 volumes were published, plus one index volume. The set contained 60,000 articles and 50 million words.  Each volume is approximately 1,015 pages, and 37 supplementary volumes were published between 1938 and 2015. The director was Giovanni Gentile and redactor in chief Antonino Pagliaro. Most of the articles are signed with the initials of the author.  An essay credited to Benito Mussolini entitled "The Doctrine of Fascism" was included in the 1932 edition of the encyclopedia, although it was ghost-written by Gentile.  Many editors, like Roberto Almagià, Ugo Amaldi, Guido Calogero, Federico Chabod, Gaetano De Sanctis, Luigi Einaudi, Federigo Enriques, Enrico Fermi, Henry Furst, Ugo La Malfa, Giorgio Levi Della Vida, Walter Maturi, Bruno Migliorini, Rodolfo Mondolfo and Nello Rosselli were Jewish or opponents of Fascism. The Fascist regime attached such great importance to the encyclopedia that authors otherwise blacklisted were permitted to contribute.
