Yolanda, the Black Corsair's Daughter is a 1905 adventure novel written by Italian novelist Emilio Salgari. It is the third installment of The Black Corsair series, preceded by The Queen of the Caribbean and followed by Son of the Red Corsair. Henry Morgan has taken the place of his mentor, the Black Corsair, as the foremost privateer in the Caribbean. He discovers that Yolanda, the daughter of the now deceased Black Corsair, has been imprisoned in Maracaibo by her half-uncle, the Count of Medina and Torres, an illegitimate son of Wan Guld who wants to appropriate his father's estate, which had never been returned to Honorata, the Black Corsair's wife. Morgan decides to rescue her out of gratitude towards her father, and eventually the two fall in love. After defeating the Count, the two get married as he's appointed Governor of Jamaica. The novel was first adapted in 1920 by Vitale de Stefano as Jolanda, la figlia del corsaro nero. A second adaption was made in 1952 as Jolanda, the Daughter of the Black Corsair, directed by Mario Soldati. An animated cartoon series was also broadcast in 1999.
