The Red Sari (El sari rojo), which is a dramatized version of Sonia Gandhi's life, ran into some controversy in India.   Javier Moro's Spanish and Italian publishers received emails from Indian National Congress lawyers and spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi with demands to withdraw the book from stores. Singhvi stated that book distorted facts and misinterpreted details.   The author always denied that the book is malicious.  The book was originally published in October 2008 in Spain  in Spanish. The book tells the story of the Gandhi family through the eyes of Sonia Gandhi. Abhishek Singhvi claimed that the book violated a person's privacy for monetary gain.  The book was finally released in India in January 2015 and was greeted with a big success.
