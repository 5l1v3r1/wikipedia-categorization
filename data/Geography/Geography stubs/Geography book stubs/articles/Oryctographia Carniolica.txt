Oryctographia Carniolica (with the subtitle physikalische Beschreibung des Herzogthums Krain, Istrien und zum Theil der benachbarten LÃ¤nder) is a four-volume work by Belsazar Hacquet, published in Leipzig in 1778, 1781, 1784 and 1789. It discusses the physical properties of the Duchy of Carniola, Istria and parts of the neighbouring lands. It also includes an in-depth description of the Idrija mercury mine. The front page of the work presents the first known depiction of Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia. The copper engraving was produced by C. Conti after a drawing by Franz Xaver Baraga.
