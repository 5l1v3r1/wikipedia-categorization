Not On Our Watch: The Mission to End Genocide in Darfur and Beyond is a book co-authored by actor Don Cheadle and human rights activist and co-founder of the Enough Project, John Prendergast. A New York Times bestseller, the book discusses the situation in Sudan's Darfur region and other cases of mass atrocities. The book outlines ways in which ordinary citizens can take action to end ongoing tragedies in Darfur, northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere. Holocaust Survivor Elie Wiesel contributed with a foreword, and then-Senator Barack Obama and Senator Sam Brownback wrote the book's introduction. A European/UK edition of the book was published by Maverick House Publishers in August 2007.  A portion of the proceeds are being donated to the Enough Project, a joint initiative of the International Crisis Group and the Center for American Progress to abolish genocide and mass atrocities.
