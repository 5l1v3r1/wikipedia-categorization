Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River is a non-fiction book by Alice Albinia that covers the writer's journey from Karachi to Tibet, which is the natural course of the Indus River. The book gives an insight into the communities as well as the history and political framework of the countries through which the Indus flows.  Empires of the Indus was awarded the Jerwood Award by the Royal Society of Literature in 2005.  The content of the book is divided in 12 distinct sections, preceded by a preface. A map of the Indus river is given and several colour photographs. The book also has special sections named glossary, notes, select bibliography and an index. The glossary makes the book more understandable and comprehensible for readers not familiar with certain words and terms used in Pakistan, India and Tibet.
