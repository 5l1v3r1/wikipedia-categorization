Shades of Grey: Glasgow, 1956-86 is a book of photographs by Oscar Marzaroli with an essay by William McIlvanney.  One of the photos from the book, a 1963 portrait of three young boys wearing their mother's high-heeled shoes playing in Kidson Street in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, was in 2005 made into a bronze statue installed in Queen Elizabeth Square.   The statue was unveiled in August 2008 by Nicola Sturgeon, then Scotland's Deputy First Minister.
