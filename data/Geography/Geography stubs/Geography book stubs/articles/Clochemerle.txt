 Clochemerle is a French satirical novel by Gabriel Chevallier which was first published in 1934. The book is set in a fictional French town called "Clochemerle", inspired by Vaux-en-Beaujolais,   and situated in the Beaujolais region. The book is a comic work, satirising the conflicts between Catholics and Republicans in the French Third Republic by telling the story of the installation of a pissoir or vespasienne (a structure housing one or more urinals) in Clochemerle's town square. The work has been translated in various editions and adapted into film and television series, notably by the BBC in 1972.
