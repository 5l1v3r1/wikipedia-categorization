White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide is a 2016 non-fiction book written by Emory University professor Carol Anderson.  It looks into how whiteness functions in American life and how the legacy of structural racism has brought about white anger and resentment. Anderson was contracted to write the book following reaction to an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in 2014.  White Rage became a New York Times Best Seller,  and was listed as a notable book of 2016 by The New York Times,  The Washington Post,  The Boston Globe,  and the Chicago Review of Books.  White Rage was also listed by The New York Times as an Editors' Choice,  and won the 2016 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism.  At the January 2017 confirmation hearing for Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, candidate for U.S. Attorney General, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin offered Sessions a copy of White Rage, saying "I'm hoping he'll take a look at it".
