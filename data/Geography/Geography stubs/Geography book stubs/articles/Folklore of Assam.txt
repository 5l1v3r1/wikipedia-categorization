Folklore of Assam is a comprehensive book on Assamese folklore authored by Jogesh Das. The book was published by National Book Trust in 1972. The book is a part of the Folklore of India series. The book is originally written in English and then in other Indian languages.  The songs are often poetic, with refined sentiments and striking imagery. Sentiments and themes in Assamese songs find their parallels in the tribal languages. An example of this structure: Assamese: My mind does not settle at home, dear, nor does it settle outside, as the teased cotton floats so to float do I long. Rabha: As the teased cotton of the plains is floating hearing your voice my mind too wants to float. Assamese: To drink water there is no cup and there is no leaf, to bring you there is no money, please wait another few days.  Kachari: The khaliha fish of the brimming lake, aah, why do you put so high a price? to pay for you is required many rupees, but being poor, where will I get so much?
