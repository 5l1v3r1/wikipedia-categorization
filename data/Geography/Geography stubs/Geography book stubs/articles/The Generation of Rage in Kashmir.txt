The Generation of Rage in Kashmir is a book written by Indian journalist and author David Devadas.    In praise for the book, Kallol Bhattacherjee wrote a review for The Hindu:David Devadas in The Generation of Rage in Kashmir has done a great work by bringing those thousand heartbreaks of Kashmir’s young generation to readers. With the eye to detail that is hallmark of ethnographic research, the author has brought out the pain and white fear that emerged in the heart of teenaged Kashmiris when elders urged them to switch off lights and go to bed fearing the midnight knock. Thousands of such midnight knocks reverberated all over Kashmir during the 1990s when terrorism and insurgency blended into the ‘disturbances’. No one paid attention to the long-term impact of those moments of fear. Yet as the mainstream media in India wondered about the roots of rage in contemporary Kashmiri youth, the impact of the past became clear.
