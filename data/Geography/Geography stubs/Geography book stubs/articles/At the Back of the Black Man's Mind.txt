At the Back of the Black Man's Mind is a book by Richard Edward Dennett published in 1906.  It provides many details on the folklore, culture, and religion of the Bantu and Yoruba.  However, many of its characterizations would today be considered colonialist or racist.  Also, it provides many theories about the facts presented which are incorrect or irrelevant.
