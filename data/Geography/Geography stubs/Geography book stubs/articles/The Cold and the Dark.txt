The Cold and the Dark: The World after Nuclear War is a 1984 book by Paul R. Ehrlich, Carl Sagan, and Donald Kennedy.  It makes dramatic long lasting climate predictions of the effect a nuclear winter would have on the Earth, an event that is suggested by the authors to follow both a city countervalue strike during a nuclear war, and especially following strikes on oil refineries and fuel depots. The book was released following the highly publicised "TTAPS" study, co-authored by Sagan, which was published in 1983 in Science.
