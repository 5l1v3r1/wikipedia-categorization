Grand Colombier is a small, uninhabited island in the French North American territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Only 50 ha in area, it lies 500 m off the north coast of Saint Pierre Island and rises to an elevation of 150 m. It is steep sided and treeless with rocky outcrops and a gently rolling top. The slopes are vegetated with grasses and ferns, while the top of the island is dominated by crowberry. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a population of 100,000 breeding pairs of Leach's storm petrels.
