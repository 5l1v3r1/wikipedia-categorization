L'Île-aux-Marins (literally "The Island of the Sailors"; before 1931 called Île-aux-Chiens, literally "Island of the Dogs") is a small island in the Atlantic Ocean. It is located off the coast of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and was a commune until 1945, when it was annexed by the commune of Saint-Pierre. It is 1,500 metres (0.93 mi) long and its width varies from 100 to 400 metres (330–1,310 ft). The highest point, Cape Beaudry, is only 35 metres (115 ft) above mean sea level. It was settled in 1604 and once had a population approaching 700.  It has had no permanent population since 1965 when the last families left for Saint Pierre Island, although a small number of people live there on a seasonal basis from May to November. It is also a ghost town: several unique buildings still stand, such as the Church, the Jézéquel house, the cemetery, a number of fisherman's homes, and the Archipélitude Museum located in the town's only school. The bow section of the wrecked ship Transpacific is on the northern side of the island and is accessible. Coordinates: 46°47′10″N 56°08′55″W﻿ / ﻿46.78611°N 56.14861°W﻿ / 46.78611; -56.14861
