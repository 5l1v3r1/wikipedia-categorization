Sabina Shoal (Filipino: Escoda Shoal; Chinese: 仙宾礁; pinyin: Xiānbīn jiāo) is an atoll in the NE of Dangerous Ground in the Spratly Islands, South China Sea. It is claimed by the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Philippines. The Philippines puts it under the jurisdiction of barangay Pag-asa, Kalayaan, Palawan.  Sabina Shoal lies in position 09° 45' N 116° 28' E,  123.6 nautical miles from Palawan Island.  It lies 56 nautical miles southwest of Carnatic Shoal, with two main parts and an area of 115 square kilometres (44 sq mi).  The eastern half of Sabina Shoal consists of reefs awash, while the western half consists of banks 3.7 to 8.3 meters deep, and reefs enclosing a lagoon.  In 1995, soon after occupying Mischief Reef, China (PRC) installed 3 buoys near Sabina Shoal. They were confiscated by the Philippines.
