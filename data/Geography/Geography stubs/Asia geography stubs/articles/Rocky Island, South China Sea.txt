Rocky Island (simplified Chinese: 石岛; traditional Chinese: 石島; pinyin: Shí Dǎo; literally: "stone island"; Vietnamese: Đảo Đá) is one of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. It is under the administration of the People's Republic of China and guarded by the PLA Navy. The island is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. Until 2016-2017, Rocky Island was connected to Woody Island by an 800 metre concrete causeway. Land reclamation in 2016-2017 has joined the two islands by a larger area of land.    A signals intelligence station was built on Rocky Island in 1995, mainly because the island is the highest point in the Paracel Islands.
