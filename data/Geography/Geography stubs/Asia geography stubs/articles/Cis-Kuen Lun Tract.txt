The Cis-Kuen Lun Tract  is the area in northern Kashmir which has been either annexed by China or is part of the area ceded by Pakistan to the Chinese. It comprises   "the tract of territory between the Karakoram and Kuen Lun Mountains". The Northern border of the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract is Dafdar in the area of the Taghdumbash Pamir and Mariom Pamir and the mountain passes in northern Kashmir including inter alia the Kukalang Pass, Yangi Pass to the north of the Raskam area in Kanjut, the Kilian Pass, the Sanju-La Pass and the Hindutash  Pass.  The Government of Pakistan had published an official map depicting the alignment of the northern Border of Kashmir in 1962 which depicted much of the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract as part of Kashmir and the Times Atlas had predominantly depicted the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract as a part of Kashmir under the caption "Undefined Frontier area".
