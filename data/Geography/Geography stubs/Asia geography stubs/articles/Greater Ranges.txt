The Greater Ranges comprise the high mountain ranges of Asia:  The UIAA gives a broader definition of the Greater Ranges than the traditional one. With the increasing popularity of global travel and adventure sports, this definition is now somewhat more popular than the original. In addition to the ranges listed above, the ranges also comprise: All of these ranges have peaks over 4,800 metres (15,750 ft), and most have peaks over 6,000 metres (19,690 ft). The Greater Ranges contain all of the world's peaks higher than 7,000 metres (22,970 ft).  The term was popular amongst alpinists in the Victorian period and was used to distinguished the high peaks of Asia from the European Alps.
