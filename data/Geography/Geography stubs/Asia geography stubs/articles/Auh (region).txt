Auh is a historical Chechen settlement in Dagestan. In 1921, Auh was included in the Dagestan ASSR, despite the desire of Akkins to join the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. According to another explanation, the reason was the entering Akkins fear of losing their winter pastures in the territory of the Khasavyurtovsky District. In 1943, the territory was incorporated into the Auha Auhovsky area. In 1944 Akkin Chechens were deported to Central Asia. The area of the historic residence was renamed the Novolaksky District and inhabited by Laks. The yurt villages Auch and Auch-Aktas were transferred to the Kazbekovski District and inhabited by Avars. In 1956, the Chechens (including the Akkin) began to return to their historical homeland.  The Chechens' homes were located in the mountains, next to the Caspian Sea. In 1718 the Don cossacks were sent to destroy their houses and many were killed.   Alburi Lam â€” mountain top in Akh.
