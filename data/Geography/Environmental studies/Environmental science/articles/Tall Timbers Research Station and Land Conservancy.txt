Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy is a research and learning facility located in northern Leon County, Florida, just off County Road 12 on the north side of Lake Iamonia. Occupying the same acreage and location and operating from the old Beadel House, Tall Timbers researches the areas of fire ecology, resource management, forestry, game bird management, and vertebrate ecology. The Research Station was formerly a quail hunting plantation of Tall Timbers Plantation built in 1895 by Edward Beadel. The Fire Ecology Program is designed to provide the public with applicable, science-based information on prescribed fire and vegetation dynamics in the southern pine ecosystem, specifically in the Red Hills Region. The Resource Management Program's responsibility is to manage the land so that the upland forests are maintained in an open, park-like condition using prescribed fire, mechanical tools, and chemical techniques to accomplish land management goals. The Forestry Program is designed to meet the ecological forestry research needs of the Red Hills Region between Tallahassee, Florida and Thomasville, Georgia. The Game Bird Program is studying the northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and its habitats. The Vertebrate Ecology Lab is studying Bachman's sparrows, brown-headed nuthatches, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
