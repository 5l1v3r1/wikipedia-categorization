Conservation biologists have designed a variety of objective means to  measure biodiversity empirically. Each measure of biodiversity relates to a particular use of the data. For practical conservationists, measurements should include a quantification of values that are commonly shared among locally affected organisms, including humans[clarification needed]. For others, a more economically defensible definition should allow the ensuring of continued possibilities for both adaptation and future use by humans, assuring  environmental sustainability. As a consequence, biologists argue that this measure is likely to be associated with the variety of genes. Since it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove beneficial, the best choice  for conservation is to assure the persistence of as many genes as possible. For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it prohibits ecological succession. Biodiversity is usually plotted as taxonomic richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. Whittaker  described three common metrics used to measure species-level biodiversity, encompassing attention to species richness or species evenness: Recently, another new index has been invented called the Mean Species Abundance Index (MSA); this index calculates the trend in population size of a cross section of the species. It does this in line with the CBD 2010 indicator for species abundance.  Alternatively, other types of diversity may be plotted against a temporal timescale: These different types of diversity may not be independent. There is, for example, a close link between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity.  Other authors tried to organize the measurements of biodiversity in the following way:  Diversity may be measured at different scales. These are three indices used by ecologists:
