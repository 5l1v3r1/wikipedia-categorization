Water quality modeling involves the prediction of water pollution using mathematical simulation techniques. A typical water quality model consists of a collection of formulations representing physical mechanisms that determine position and momentum of pollutants in a water body.  Models are available for individual components of the hydrological system such as surface runoff; there also exist basinwide models addressing hydrologic transport and for ocean and estuarine applications.  Often finite difference methods are used to analyse these phenomena, and, almost always, large complex computer models are required. Water quality is modeled by one or more of the following formulations:
