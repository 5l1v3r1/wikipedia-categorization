The Arctic consists of <a href=\"/wiki/Taiga\" title=\"Taiga\">taiga</a> (or <a href=\"/wiki/Boreal_forest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Boreal forest\">boreal forest</a>) and <a href=\"/wiki/Tundra\" title=\"Tundra\">tundra</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Biomes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Biomes\">biomes</a>, which also dominate very high elevations, even in the tropics.

The earliest inhabitants of the Arctic were the Neanderthals. Since then, many indigenous populations have inhabited the region, which continues to this day. Since the early 1900s, when Vilhjalmur Stefansson led the first major Canadian Arctic Expedition, the Arctic has been a valued area for ecological research.  In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in Point Barrow, Alaska under the contract of the Office of Naval Research. This launched an interest in exploring the Arctic examining animal cycles, permafrost and the interactions between indigenous peoples and the Arctic ecology. During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Arctic_Sunset.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"A sunset in the arctic region.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Arctic_Sunset.jpg/220px-Arctic_Sunset.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"144\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Arctic_Sunset.jpg/330px-Arctic_Sunset.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Arctic_Sunset.jpg/440px-Arctic_Sunset.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2592\" data-file-height=\"1701\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Arctic_Sunset.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A sunset in the arctic region.</div></div></div>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Arctic_environment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arctic environment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Biomes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Biomes</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Tundra\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tundra</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Boreal\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Boreal</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Adaptations_to_conditions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Adaptations to conditions</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Humans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Humans</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Other_animals\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other animals</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Plants\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Plants</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#History_of_Arctic_ecology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History of Arctic ecology</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Early_history\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early history</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Modern_history\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Modern history</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Indigenous_peoples_and_research\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Indigenous peoples and research</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Human_ecology_in_the_Arctic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Human ecology in the Arctic</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Conservation_and_environmental_issues\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Conservation and environmental issues</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Further_exploration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Further exploration</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arctic_environment\">Arctic environment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Arctic environment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To understand Arctic ecology, it is important to consider both the terrestrial and oceanic aspects of the region. A few important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Sea_ice\" title=\"Sea ice\">Sea ice</a> is frozen seawater that moves with oceanic currents; it provides important habitat and a resting place for animals, particularly during the winter months. Over time, small pockets of salty seawater get trapped in the ice, and the salt is squeezed out. This causes the ice to become progressively less salty. Sea ice persists throughout the year, but there is less ice available during summer months.\n</p><p>Large portions of the land are also frozen during the year. <a href=\"/wiki/Permafrost\" title=\"Permafrost\">Permafrost</a> is substrate that has been frozen for a minimum of 2 years. There are two types of permafrost: discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas where the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below freezing (0&#160;\u00b0C or 32&#160;\u00b0F); this forms in sheltered locations. In areas where the mean annual soil surface temperature is below \u22125&#160;\u00b0C (23&#160;\u00b0F), continuous permafrost forms. This is not limited to sheltered areas and ranges from a few inches below the surface to over 300&#160;m (1,000&#160;ft) deep. The top layer is called the <a href=\"/wiki/Active_layer\" title=\"Active layer\">active layer</a>. It thaws in the summer and is critical to plant life.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Biomes\">Biomes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Biomes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Moisture and temperature are major physical drivers of natural ecosystems.

It can be found at lower latitudes at high elevations as well. The average temperature is \u221234&#160;\u00b0C (\u221229&#160;\u00b0F); during the summer it is less than 10&#160;\u00b0C (50&#160;\u00b0F). Average precipitation ranges from 10 to 50&#160;cm (4 to 20&#160;in), and the permafrost is 400\u2013600&#160;m (1,300\u20132,000&#160;ft) thick. Plant species supported by tundra have small leaves, are short (74&#160;mm to &lt;5 m), tend to be deciduous, have a high ratio of roots to shoots, and are composed mainly of perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs, grasses, lichens, and mosses.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Boreal\">Boreal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Boreal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In comparison to tundra, <a href=\"/wiki/Boreal_forest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Boreal forest\">boreal forest</a> has a longer and warmer <a href=\"/wiki/Growing_season\" title=\"Growing season\">growing season</a> and supports larger <a href=\"/wiki/Species_diversity\" title=\"Species diversity\">species diversity</a>, an increase in canopy height, vegetation density, and <a href=\"/wiki/Biomass\" title=\"Biomass\">biomass</a>. Boreal conditions can be found across northern North America and Eurasia. The boreal forests in the interior of the continents grow on top of permafrost due to very cold winters (see <a href=\"/wiki/Drunken_trees\" title=\"Drunken trees\">drunken trees</a>), while much of the boreal forest has patchy permafrost or lack permafrost completely. The short (3\u20134 month) growing season in boreal forests is sustained by greater levels of rainfall (between 30 and 85&#160;cm or 12 and 33&#160;in per year) than the tundra receives; This biome is dominated by closed canopy forests of evergreen conifers, especially spruces, fir, pine and tamarack with some diffuse-porous hardwoods. Shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and lichens are also important species. Stand-replacing crown fires are very important to this biome, occurring as frequently as every 50\u2013100 years in some parts.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Adaptations_to_conditions\">Adaptations to conditions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Adaptations to conditions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Humans\">Humans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Humans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Humans living in the Arctic region generally rely on warm clothing and buildings to protect them from the elements. <a href=\"/wiki/Acclimatization\" title=\"Acclimatization\">Acclimatization</a>, or the adjustment to new conditions, appears to be the most common form of adaptation to cold environments. No genetic advantage has been found when different people groups or races are compared. There is no evidence that fat is grown in response to cold, although its presence is advantageous. Amazingly, most people living in the Arctic region live a lifestyle very connected to the environment, spending significant time outside and depending heavily on hunting and fishing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_animals\">Other animals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Other animals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Animals that are active in the winter have <a href=\"/wiki/Adaptations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Adaptations\">adaptations</a> for surviving the intense cold. A common example is the presence of strikingly large feet in proportion to body weight. These act like snowshoes, and can be found on animals like the <a href=\"/wiki/Snowshoe_hare\" title=\"Snowshoe hare\">snowshoe hare</a> and caribou. Many of the animals in the Arctic are larger than their temperate counterparts (<a href=\"/wiki/Bergmann%E2%80%99s_rule\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bergmann\u2019s rule\">Bergmann\u2019s rule</a>), taking advantage of the smaller ratio of surface area to volume that comes with increasing size. This increases the ability to conserve heat. Layers of fat, plumage, and fur are also very effective <a href=\"/wiki/Thermal_insulation\" title=\"Thermal insulation\">insulators</a> to help retain warmth and are common in Arctic animals including polar bears and marine mammals. Some animals also have digestive adaptations to improve their ability to digest woody plants either with or without the aid of microbial organisms. This is highly advantageous during the winter months when most soft vegetation is beneath the <a href=\"/wiki/Snow_pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Snow pack\">snow pack</a>.\n</p><p>Not all Arctic animals directly face the rigors of winter. Many migrate to warmer climates at lower latitudes, while others avoid the difficulties of winter by <a href=\"/wiki/Hibernation\" title=\"Hibernation\">hibernating</a> until spring. Although these options might seem to be easy solutions to the difficulties of surviving an extreme environment, both are very expensive in terms of energy and risk of predation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plants\">Plants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Plants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One of the most serious problems that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death. Plants have two ways to resist freezing: avoid it or tolerate it. If a plant has taken the avoidance route, it has several different ways to evade freezing. It can build up insulation, have its stem close to the ground, use the insulation from snow cover, and supercool. When <a href=\"/wiki/Supercooling\" title=\"Supercooling\">supercooling</a>, water is able to remain in its liquid state down to \u221238&#160;\u00b0C or \u221236&#160;\u00b0F (compared to its usual 0&#160;\u00b0C or 32&#160;\u00b0F freezing point). After water reaches \u221238&#160;\u00b0C (\u221236&#160;\u00b0F), it spontaneously freezes and plant tissue is destroyed. This is called the <a href=\"/wiki/Nucleation_point\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nucleation point\">nucleation point</a>. The nucleation point can be lowered if dissolved <a href=\"/wiki/Solution\" title=\"Solution\">solutes</a> are present.\n</p><p>If a plant has taken the tolerance route, it has several different ways to tolerate freezing. Some plants allow freezing by allowing <a href=\"/wiki/Extracellular\" title=\"Extracellular\">extracellular</a>, but not <a href=\"/wiki/Intracellular\" title=\"Intracellular\">intracellular</a> freezing. Plants let water freeze in extracellular spaces, which creates a high vapor deficit that pulls water vapor out of the cell. This process dehydrates the cell and allows it to survive temperatures well below \u221238&#160;\u00b0C (\u221236&#160;\u00b0F).\n</p><p>Another problem associated with extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is susceptible to <a href=\"/wiki/Cavitation\" title=\"Cavitation\">cavitation</a> because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. <a href=\"/wiki/Cavitation\" title=\"Cavitation\">Cavitation</a> is much less of problem in trees with <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ring-diffuse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ring-diffuse (page does not exist)\">ring-diffuse</a> wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species are not able to transport water as efficiently.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_Arctic_ecology\">History of Arctic ecology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: History of Arctic ecology\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_history\">Early history</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Early history\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many different peoples had inhabited present-day <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Alaska\" title=\"Alaska\">Alaska</a> by AD 1000.

Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, <a href=\"/wiki/James_Clark_Ross\" title=\"James Clark Ross\">Sir James Ross</a> and a group of <a href=\"/wiki/Eskimo\" title=\"Eskimo\">Eskimos</a> explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the <a href=\"/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole\" title=\"North Magnetic Pole\">Magnetic North Pole</a>. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of <a href=\"/wiki/Spitsbergen\" title=\"Spitsbergen\">Spitsbergen</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Norway\" title=\"Norway\">Norway</a>.

In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to collect data that linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and  indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>During the Cold War, the Canadian government began taking initiatives to secure the continent, and to assert territorial authority over northern Canada, including the Arctic, which at the time had a dominant American presence. The Canadian government demonstrated their desire for national dominance and security by requiring permission from other nations to utilize their land for military initiatives. They also supported and implemented civilian initiatives including resource development, wildlife conservation and the social and economic development of indigenous peoples.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In 1950\u2019s, ecologist Charles Elton was drawn to the Arctic to study the existence, causes and effects of cycles in animal populations, while ecologists Frank Banfield and John Kelsal studied the factors, especially human impacts, influencing hunting and game populations on animals such as caribou.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The 1960s and 1970s brought a decrease in the desire to protect the Arctic as it was seen to lack a significant amount of biodiversity. This allowed for scientists to extend further research in the area. In June 1960, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was constructed, headed by General Duncan Hallock and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The two predecessor organizations that made up the CRREL were the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL), and the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE). The goal of the CREEL laboratory was to bring together the ACFEL and SIPRE to expand the size and scientific reputation of these organizations, solve problems in cold regions and explore the basic environmental characteristics of cold regions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> As a result, study and management of the Arctic was taken over by consulting firms hired and controlled by the government.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Indigenous_peoples_and_research\">Indigenous peoples and research</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Indigenous peoples and research\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As research in the Arctic region of northern <a href=\"/wiki/North_America\" title=\"North America\">North America</a> became more frequent, conflicts between researchers and the indigenous peoples started to occur. Recently, the indigenous communities of the North American Arctic have played a direct role in setting ethical standards for research in the region. Scientists have combined the use of laboratory research and field research in the <a href=\"/wiki/Polar_region\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polar region\">Polar Regions</a> to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its characteristics. Because of scientific research in the north, living in and traveling to the Arctic has become much safer. However, the indigenous peoples viewed the effects of the research and development in the area differently than the scientists did. Since the 1960s, indigenous peoples have been more politically active and began pursuing the recognition of their rights regarding land-claims and self-government institutions. Indigenous communities voiced their concern that this research could lead to undesirable changes to the region\u2019s landscape and economy. Canadian officials responded to their concerns by addressing the responsibility of scientists to consult with indigenous communities before conducting research. In 1977, the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) was founded at Churchill, Manitoba to improve scientific activity in the region. ACUNS published a document aimed at promoting cooperation between the northern indigenous people and researchers called <i>Ethical Principles for the Conduct of Research in the North (1982)</i>. The document was published in English, French, and Inuktitut so it could be clearly understood among different groups.

The Neandertalers made advances in the basic production of stone, bone antler and flint tools, which archaeologists call a <a href=\"/wiki/Mousterian\" title=\"Mousterian\">Mousterian industry</a>. About 40,000 years ago, the Neandertalers quickly disappeared and were replaced by modern humans, <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>. Just a few thousand years after the sudden disappearance of the Neandertalers, modern humans occupied all the land that their predecessors had occupied. Some scientists believe that the Neandertalers were overcome by the incoming modern race, commonly called <a href=\"/wiki/Cro-Magnon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cro-Magnon\">Cro-Magnon</a> people, while others believe the race disappeared by integrating itself within the new population.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Aurignacian\" title=\"Aurignacian\">Aurignacoid</a> (upper Paleolithic tool-making) tradition of the modern people is most associated with a feature called <a href=\"/wiki/Blade\" title=\"Blade\">blade</a>-and-core technology. According to Quaternary scientist C.V. Haynes, Arctic <a href=\"/wiki/Cave_painting\" title=\"Cave painting\">cave art</a> also dates back to the Aurignacoid phase and climaxes during the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pleistocene\" title=\"Pleistocene\">Pleistocene</a>, which encompasses subjects such as hunting and spirituality. People stemming from the <a href=\"/wiki/Clovis_culture\" title=\"Clovis culture\">Clovis culture</a> populated northern regions of Canada and formed what led to the Northern Archaic and Maritime Archaic traditions at the end of the <a href=\"/wiki/Late_Glacial_Maximum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Late Glacial Maximum\">Late Glacial</a> period. Recently, small flint tools and artifacts from about 5,000 years ago were discovered that belonged to a culture now generally called the <a href=\"/wiki/Arctic_Small_Tool_tradition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arctic Small Tool tradition\">Arctic Small Tool tradition</a>. The ASTt people are believed to be the physical and cultural ancestors of modern arctic <a href=\"/wiki/Inuit\" title=\"Inuit\">Inuit</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, as European trade interests among the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay Company expanded into northern Canada, arctic indigenous peoples began to become more involved in the trade process. Increasingly more European goods, including kettles, iron tools, tobacco, alcohol, and guns, were bought and traded by the indigenous peoples within their communities. European imports in exchange for more primitive, native resources and tools made life for the indigenous more efficient and comfortable. Native societies in the early eighteenth century also began to buy guns from European traders, and these guns made hunting easier. They were also occasionally used in native etiquette, medicinal, and religious practices. Because of the natives' increased hunting efficiency, scarcity of resources became an issue in the region, a version of what American human ecologist Garrett Hardin called \"the tragedy of the commons.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Arctic peoples value spiritual connections with their environment, which leads to a spiritual understanding along with their scientific understanding. Their lifestyles, therefore, reflect not only activity that is economically efficient but also that which is in line with their spiritual beliefs and values. The Alaskan Athabascan people, for example, spiritually value the <a href=\"/wiki/Moose\" title=\"Moose\">moose</a>. State law acknowledges this spiritual belief and allows people to take moose for <a href=\"/wiki/Potlatch\" title=\"Potlatch\">potlatches</a> outside of the usual hunting season.

This is evident by warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, shorter durations of sea ice and changing weather and storm patterns. Scientists are especially concerned about four aspects of the continued projected warming of the Arctic.\n</p><p>First, <a href=\"/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation\" title=\"Thermohaline circulation\">thermohaline circulation</a> is a series of underwater oceanic currents fueled by the salinity and temperature of seawater. Melting ice sheets would introduce vast amounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic, causing a change in density which could disrupt the currents. If this circulation slowed or stopped, the climates of northern Europe and North America would be strongly impacted.\n</p><p>Second, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is disrupting the lifestyles of a wide range of species. <a href=\"/wiki/Polar_bear\" title=\"Polar bear\">Polar bears</a> live on the sea ice for much of the year and find their food in the surrounding ocean waters. Recent projections suggest that global warming will lead to the disappearance of most summer sea ice within 40 years.\n</p><p>A third practical concern is the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground surface subsidence and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase <span class=\"chemf nowrap\">CO<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><sup style=\"font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;vertical-align:baseline\"></sup><br /><sub style=\"font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;vertical-align:baseline\">2</sub></span></span> uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases the height of the water table in the Arctic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Finally, the impacts of the release of carbon from the permafrost could be amplified by high levels of <a href=\"/wiki/Deforestation\" title=\"Deforestation\">deforestation</a> in the Boreal forests in Eurasia and Canada. This biome currently serves as a large <a href=\"/wiki/Carbon_sink\" title=\"Carbon sink\">carbon sink</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Carbon_sequestration\" title=\"Carbon sequestration\">sequestering</a> large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, over half of the original forest has been or in danger of harvesting, largely for export. Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which facilitates increased warming of the earth.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Further_exploration\">Further exploration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Further exploration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"/wiki/Meta_analysis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Meta analysis\">meta analysis</a> of the published work in aquatic ecosystems since the term <a href=\"/wiki/Biodiversity\" title=\"Biodiversity\">biodiversity</a> appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to be still unexplored. In addition, the North Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and Pacific Northwest), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world\u2019s aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in terrestrial ecosystems, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially marine ecosystems where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases (Moustakas &amp; Karakassis 2005). Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Arctic Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world\u2019s aquatic biodiversity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Category:Arctic_flora\" title=\"Category:Arctic flora\">Arctic flora</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Arctic_sea_ice_ecology_and_history\" title=\"Arctic sea ice ecology and history\">Arctic sea ice ecology and history</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Arctic_shrinkage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arctic shrinkage\">Arctic shrinkage</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Arctic_ecology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Berkes, Fikret and Dyanna Jolly. \u201cAdapting to Climate Change: Social- Ecological Resilience in a Canadian Western Arctic Community.\u201d Conservation Ecology 5 (2001).
