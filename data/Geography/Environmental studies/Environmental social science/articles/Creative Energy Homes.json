The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/\">[1]</a> to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the <a href=\"/wiki/Passivhaus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Passivhaus\">Passivhaus</a> ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the <a href=\"/wiki/Code_for_Sustainable_Homes\" title=\"Code for Sustainable Homes\">Code for Sustainable Homes</a>.\n</p><p>The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Ground-coupled_heat_exchanger\" title=\"Ground-coupled heat exchanger\">ground-air heat exchanger</a>, supplied by <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.rehau.co.uk/\">Rehau</a>, lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12\u00b0C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.\n</p><p>A <a href=\"/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting\" title=\"Rainwater harvesting\">rainwater harvesting</a> system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design\" title=\"Passive solar building design\">sun space</a>, at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.\n</p><p>On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_E.ON_2016_House\">The E.ON 2016 House</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creative_Energy_Homes&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The E.ON 2016 House\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx\">E.ON House</a> is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.\n</p><p>According to the <a href=\"/wiki/Code_for_Sustainable_Homes\" title=\"Code for Sustainable Homes\">Code for Sustainable Homes</a> (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.\n</p><p>The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:\n</p>\n<ol><li>During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.</li>\n<li>The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.</li>\n<li>In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Photovoltaic_panels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Photovoltaic panels\">Solar panel</a>  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.</li></ol>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Tarmac_Homes\">The Tarmac Homes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creative_Energy_Homes&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Tarmac Homes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/\">Tarmac House</a>.
