 Organizations: The International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) was founded in 1989, based heavily on the work of Herman Daly to promote ecological economics and assist ecological economists and related societies.  The society publishes a monthly journal Ecological Economics, books and other materials, and holds periodic meetings and conferences to facilitate a voice for ecological economists. The ISEE was initially presided over by Robert Costanza who was also the first editor of the journal. Subsequent presidents have been Richard B. Norgaard, John Proops, Charles Perrings, Joan Martinez Alier, Peter May, John Gowdy, Bina Agarwal,  and Marina Fischer-Kowalski, an Austrian sociologist.   The current president is Sabine O'Hara, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability & Environmental Sciences at the University of the District of Columbia.   Cl√≥vis Cavalcanti is the President Elect of the ISEE, his term as president commencing in January 2018.  The journal is currently edited by Richard B. Howarth.  In 1996, the Right Livelihood Award was awarded to steady-state theorist Herman Daly "for defining a path of ecological economics that integrates the key elements of ethics, quality of life, environment and community." He was honored as one of the key figures in the foundation of ISEE, that was considered to be "the major forum that links economists and ecologists, and academics and environmental activists."    Dr. Daly was also awarded the 2014 Japanese Blue Planet Award. The ISEE is divided into regional societies.  There are currently ten regional societies: There is also a Chinese Ecological Economics Society which is not affiliated to the ISEE and an Iberoamerican Network, REDIBEC.
