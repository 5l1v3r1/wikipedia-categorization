CDR operates with a part-time Director, two compensated part-time students who serve as Administrative Manager and Project Manager, and a staff of student interns who earn academic credit for community service learning. The CDR Director is a Department of Environmental Studies faculty member who is responsible for all activities including management of staff, projects, equipment, budget, and adherence to University regulations. The San Jose State University Foundation manages accounting and payroll services.  The CDRâ€™s website assists users to find locations for recycling, reuse, and the donation of goods. It contains specific services available from over 1200 companies and local government for over 2000 product and material types.  Links and documents are provided to assist users with access to multiple information sources that address nearly any question about recycling and waste management.  The site features specific information about recycling and reuse services provided by private business, local government, landfills, and extensive information resources in this expanding field. The CDR was founded in 1989 by Bruce Olszewski.  In 1991, CDR bridged personnel and equipment resources of SJSU with Santa Clara County and its 15 cities that resulted in an alliance to provide cost-effective recycling information services for County residents and businesses that also created student service-learning opportunities. In 1992, the CDR began operating the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline. CDR added a donor funded website in 1999.  In 2017, CDR expanded its organization to include the County of San Mateo. Since 1992,  the CDR has operated the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline under contract with the County of Santa Clara.
