The following is a summary of notable incidents at any of the amusement parks and water parks operated by Six Flags Entertainment Corporation.  In some cases, these incidents occurred while the park was under different management or ownership. This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park operations, or are otherwise significantly noteworthy. The term incidents refers to major accidents, injuries, or deaths that occur at a park.  While these incidents were required to be reported to regulatory authorities due to where they occurred, they usually fall into one of the following categories:  From 2004 to September 2007, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspected Six Flags parks five different times and found a total of four violations. On September 10, 2007, OSHA cited Great America with 38 safety violations, alleging "multiple serious and repeat violations at the amusement park, ranging from defective emergency brakes on an industrial truck to a lack of labeling procedures for preventing inadvertent machine start-ups." OSHA fined the park US$117,700.  • On August 22nd, 2018, Batman: The Dark Knight’s floor refused to come up after the roller coaster finished a run. Riders were stuck for 20 minutes in the heat before maintenance brought the floor back up. On August 7th, 1999, a raft carrying 6 people flipped, trapping some riders under water.  All six riders were injured.
