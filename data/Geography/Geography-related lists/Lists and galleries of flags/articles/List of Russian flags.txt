This is a list of flags used in Russia. The Emperor Alexander refused the title of the head of the Order of Malta and the cross was removed from the chest of the eagle.  This is similar to the Union Jack  which represents the United Kingdom, while Scotland, England, and Wales also have flags of their own. Since the 1990s this flag has been used by monarchists and some extreme right political groups.
