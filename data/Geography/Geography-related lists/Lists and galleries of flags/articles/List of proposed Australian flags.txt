  This is a list comprising flags publicly suggested as alternatives to the current flag of Australia. When hung indoors by the hoist (stars at top) we see Australia: SKY, SEA, BEACH and BUSH  A simple landscape design of an Australian sky with yellow/golden sandy coastal beaches or inland deserts with green tropical forests or grasslands. Retains the current flag’s blue background with white stars. Australia is surrounded by blue oceans plus white surf on our beaches plus the white heat of the outback. Upper hoist (canton) of the flag has white seven pointed Federation Star and the fly has the Southern Cross. Yellow and green stripes are set parallel at the bottom of the flag - Our official sporting colours. Designed in © 2006 by Edward R.
