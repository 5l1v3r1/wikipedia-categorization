The Tuvan People's Republic in its short life span went through a number of flags. Many typical communist icons were used such as the Hammer and Sickle and the color red. The 1921 flag's inscriptions read, "Flag of the executive committee of the People's Revolutionary Party of Tannu Tuva" (tangnu tiva yin arad un qubisyal tu nam un quriyan u tuy). The 1926-1930 flag started being used after the Constitution of 24 November 1926 and the inscription read, "Tuvan People's Republic" (Bügüde Nayiramdaqu Tuva Arad Ulus). The 1941-1943 flag had the initials of the state (Tıwa Arat Respublik) in gold in canton. The 1943-1944 was just the Cyrillic version (Тыва Арат Республик).
