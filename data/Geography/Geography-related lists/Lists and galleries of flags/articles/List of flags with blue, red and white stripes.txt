Flags of white, red and blue stripes (bands) quite often signals the relationships of some nations with other nations (for instance, the flag of Netherlands and flags of its former colonies).  These flags became the flag model which was put forward in the French revolution. These colors later started to spread to other nations, somewhat changing the order and position of stripes (vertical and horizontal).  The colors mentioned in most of the sources as Pan-Slavic colors, received such meanings in the age of pan-Slavistic, neopanslavistic and other movements (Austro-Slavism). All lands in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy are given their flags, then came to the fore and primarily white, red and blue colors, as there lived mostly Slavic nations.
