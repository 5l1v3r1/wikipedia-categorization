This is a list of flags used by and in Germany between 1848 and now. For more information about the current national flag, see Flag of Germany. The flag with the Hakenkreuz and white disc centered was used throughout (1920–45) as the NSDAP party flag (Parteiflagge).  Between 1933 and 1935, it was used as the national flag (Nationalflagge) and merchant flag (Handelsflagge) - interchangeably with the black-white-red horizontal tricolour last used (up to 1918) by the German Empire. In 1935, the black-white-red horizontal tricolour was scrapped again, and the flag with the off-center Hakenkreuz and disc was instituted as the only national flag (and was to remain as such until 1945). The flag with the centered disc only continued to be used as the Parteiflagge after 1935. Allied Control Council (1945–1949) and Saar Protectorate Note: Ottfried Neubecker's proposal of 1919 and those of Josef Wirmer in 1944 and of his brother Ernst in 1948 are clearly modeled on the Nordic Cross flags used in all Nordic countries - the flags of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland all having the same horizontal cross, though differing in color.    The flags of the German overseas colonies were first proposed in 1914, but were never implemented due to the breakout of World War I.
