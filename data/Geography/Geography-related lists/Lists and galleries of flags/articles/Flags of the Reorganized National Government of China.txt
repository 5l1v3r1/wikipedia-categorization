During the Second Sino-Japanese war, the invading Japanese established a variety of puppet governments such as the Provisional Government of China and the Reformed Government of China which used the Five Races Under One Union flag even though the legitimate Chinese Government had switched to the current day modern flag of the Republic of China. When the Wang Jingwei regime was established on 30 March 1940 in Nanjing, Wang Jingwei was slated to take over the previous Japanese-installed governments and centralize the Chinese Nationalists under what they claimed to be the legitimate successor to the Republic of China he demanded to use the modern flag as a means to challenge the authority of the Chongqing government under Chiang Kai-shek and position himself as the rightful successor to Sun Yat-sen. However, the Japanese preferred the Five-Colored Five Races Under One Union flag. As a compromise, the Japanese suggested adding a triangular yellow pennant on top with the slogan "Peace, Anti-Communism, National Construction" (和平反共建國, Hépíng fǎn'gòng jiàn guó) in black, but this was rejected by Wang. In the end, Wang and the Japanese agreed that the yellow banner was to be used outdoors only, until 1943 when the banner was abandoned, leaving two rival governments with the same flag, each claiming to be the legitimate government of China.    The Chinese characters read: Peace and Anticommunism (和平反共).   The Chinese characters read: Peace and National construction (和平建國). There were multiple variants of the pendent used by the Wang Jingwei Government, these variants were based on regional choice.   Naval Jack used by the Republic of China-Nanjing from 1940 until 1945.  War Ensign used by the Republic of China-Nanjing from May 1, 1942 until 1945.  The war ensign was adopted in commemoration of the second anniversary that the capital was relocated on the first of May, 1942.
