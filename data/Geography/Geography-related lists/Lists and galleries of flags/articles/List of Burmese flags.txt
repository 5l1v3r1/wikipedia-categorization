  This is a list of flags used in Myanmar. The flags of the Burmese states and regions exhibit a variety of regional influences and local histories, as well as different styles and design principles. Modern state flags date from the 1940s, when Myanmar was starting to gain its independence from the colonial British Empire. Most state flags were designed and adopted after independence in 1948. The Union Territory of Naypyidaw and the self-administered zones and divisions of Naga Self-Administered Zone, Danu Self-Administered Zone, Pa-O Self-Administered Zone, Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone, Kokang Self-Administered Zone and Wa Self-Administered Division do not seem to have their own flags.
