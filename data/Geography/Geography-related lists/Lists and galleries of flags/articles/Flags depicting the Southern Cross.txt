The Southern Cross or Crux, a constellation visible in the Southern Hemisphere, is depicted on flags and coats of arms of various countries and sub-national entities. This star constellation is visible mostly in the southern hemisphere and it therefore symbolises the southern location of its users. The term Southern Cross can also refer to the blue saltire as used in various flags of the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. This is an incomplete list and some of the flags in this list might not have official status. Also, note that flag proportions may vary between the different flags, and sometimes even vary between different versions of the same flag. Flag of Gulf Province
