This is a list of flags used in Southern Rhodesia between 1890 and 1964 and Rhodesia between 1964 and 1979.  The evolution of Southern Rhodesia from a British South African Company concern, to a British Colony, then to a member of a Federal Government, then to a self-declared state is evident by the different flags used. For flags after these dates see Flags of Zimbabwe.
