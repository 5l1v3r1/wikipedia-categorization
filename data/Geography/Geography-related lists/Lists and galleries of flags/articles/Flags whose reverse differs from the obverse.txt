This article contains a list of flags for which the reverse (back) is different from the obverse (front). It includes current as well as historic flags of both nations and national subdivisions such as provinces, states, territories, and cities (including a few that are not recognized by the United Nations or whose sovereignty is in dispute). When the flag is that of a nation, the Subdivision column is blank. For present-day flags the Dates column is typically blank.  The list below includes the few flags for which the back of the flag is the mirrored reverse of the front. For most flags with an asymmetric design, the back side looks like the mirror image of the front. For example, when viewed from the front, the top left corner of the United States' flag features 50 white stars in a blue rectangle. When viewed from behind, this rectangle is located at the top right. A few flags contain an element for which the mirror image view would be problematic - such as text (e.g. Saudi Arabia's flag contains the shahada, an Islamic creed) or a geographic feature (e.g. the nation of Bangladesh is depicted on its flag). For these flags, the back of the flag is the mirrored reverse of the front. Currently the only UN-recognized country whose flag contains a truly unique image on each side is Paraguay.
