Most Mexican states do not have an official flag.  For these states, a de facto flag is used for civil and state purposes, typically consisting of a white background charged with the state's coat of arms.  At least four states have official flags: Durango, Jalisco, Querétaro and Quintana Roo. Except for Jalisco, each official flag is simply a white background charged with the state's coat of arms. Two states have provisions in their constitutions explicitly declaring that there shall be no official state flag.  These states are Baja California  and Campeche.
