The following is a list of flags of Denmark. Some areas in Denmark have unofficial flags, listed below. The regional flags of Bornholm and Ærø are known to be in active use. The flags of Vendsyssel (Vendelbrog) and the Jutlandic flag ("Den jyske fane") are obscure. None of these flags have legal recognition in Denmark, and are officially considered to be "fantasy flags".  Denmark reserves official recognition to official flags and regional flags (områdeflag) from other jurisdictions.
