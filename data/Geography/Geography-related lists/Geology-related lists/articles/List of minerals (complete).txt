Mineralogy is an active science in which minerals are discovered or recognised on a regular basis. Use of old mineral names is also discontinued, for example when a name is no longer considered valid. Therefore, a list of recognised mineral species is never complete.  Minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties. Differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish the various species. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral variety. The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) is the international group that recognises new minerals and new mineral names.  However, minerals discovered before 1959 did not go through the official naming procedure. Some minerals published previously have been either confirmed or discredited since that date. This list contains a mixture of mineral names that have been approved since 1959 and those mineral names believed to still refer to valid mineral species (these are called "grandfathered" species). Presently, each year about 50-60 new mineral species are officially approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the International Mineralogical Association.  The IMA/CNMNC administrates c. 6,500 names,  and as of  January 2018[update], the Handbook of Mineralogy lists 4,507 species.  As of  March 2018[update], the IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ Rruff Project lists 5,312 valid species (IMA/CNMNC) of a total of 5,525 minerals. There are 1,289 Pre-IMA minerals.  As of  April 2011[update], the Webmineral.com lists 2,722 published and approved (IMA/CNMNC) minerals, 81 discredited minerals (IMA/CNMNC status; Michael Fleischer discredited around thousand species in his lifetime), 2,691 synonyms and 123 "not approved" names.  The IMA - CNMNC Master List of Minerals (status: March 2018) lists 5,336 valid minerals, including c. 1,166 pre-IMA minerals (grandfathered), c. 272 approved minerals but without a published description yet and c. 99 questionable minerals. Due to the length of this list, it is divided into alphabetical groups. The minerals are sorted by name.
