This is a list of lunar sample displays from the Apollo program that were distributed through the United States and around the world. They include samples from the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 missions conducted by NASA from 1969 to the 1970s. The first human mission to the surface of the Moon returned a few dozen pounds/kilos of Lunar material (mainly rock and dust), and the US put about 0.05 grams in little display cases and gave them out all the U.S. states and the nations of the world, as well some extra political entities like the U.S. territories under administration.  This was done again with an Apollo 17 sample..  The display cases included a lunar sample and small flag of the respective political entity that had been to the Moon and back. Something like 135 displays were gifted to nations of the world at that time, so nations created since then are not included and some displays have been inherited from past nations
