This list gives an overview of the classification of minerals (silicates) and includes mostly IMA recognized minerals and its groupings. This list complements the alphabetical list on List of minerals (complete) and List of minerals. Rocks, ores, mineral mixtures, non-IMA approved minerals and non-named minerals are mostly excluded. Mostly major groups only, or groupings used by New Dana Classification and Mindat. The grouping of the New Dana Classification and of the mindat.org is similar only, and so this classification is an overview only. Consistency is missing too on the group name endings (group, subgroup, series) between New Dana Classification and mindat.org. Category, class and supergroup name endings are used as layout tools in the list as well. Note: the amphibole subcommittee (CNMNC/ IMA) published many reports (IMA 1978 s.p., IMA 1997 s.p., IMA 2003 s.p., IMA 2012 s.p.), renaming and redefining many minerals. Working draft: rruff.info, mindat.org and mineralienatlas.de are not up to date yet.
