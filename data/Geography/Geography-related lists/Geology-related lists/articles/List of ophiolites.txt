Ophiolites are sequences of mafic to ultramafic rock generally believed to represent ancient oceanic lithosphere. They are distributed all across the world being all of them located at present or past orogenic belts, sites of mountain building processes.  Ophiolites are common in orogenic belts of Mesozoic age, like those formed by the closure of the Tethys Ocean. Ophiolites in Archean and Paleoproterozoic domains are rare.  5 - Forearc extension and sea-floor spreading in the Thetford Mines Ophiolite complex (link : https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=fr&user=sWm-LdoAAAAJ&cstart=20&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=sWm-LdoAAAAJ:B2rIPIGFPLEC) 6 - Structural evolution of the Thetford Mines Ophiolite Complex, Canada: implications for the southern Québec ophiolitic belt (link :  https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=fr&user=sWm-LdoAAAAJ&cstart=20&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=sWm-LdoAAAAJ:u0Mu_IsstPMC)
