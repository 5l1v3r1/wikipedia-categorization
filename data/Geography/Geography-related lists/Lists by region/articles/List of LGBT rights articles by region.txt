List of LGBT rights by region, including countries, commonwealths, disputed territories, and other regions. As Antarctica has no resident human population, the human presence there is limited to short term research or sporting expeditions. The Antarctic Treaty System provides that all legal rights in Antarctica are governed by those of the person's home nation, and do not change based on which country's Antarctic territorial claim the person happens to be present in at any given time.
