This is a list of seas - large divisions of the World Ocean, including areas of water variously, gulfs, bights, bays, and straits. There are several terms used for bulges of ocean that result from indentations of land, which overlap in definition, and which are not consistently differentiated:  Many features could be considered to be more than one of these, and all of these terms are used in place names inconsistently; especially bays, gulfs, and bights, which can be very large or very small. This list includes large areas of water no matter the term used in the name. Sources differ over which seas are considered marginal seas as well as which ocean a given sea is considered a marginal part of. There is no single ultimate authority on the matter. Sometimes the Arctic Ocean itself is considered a marginal sea of the Atlantic,   in addition to the below. (coast wise north to south) (east to west) (clockwise from 180Â°) Entities called "seas" which are not divisions of the Earth's World Ocean are not included in this list.
