This page contains lists of countries ranked by ethnic and cultural diversity level. The lists are commonly used in Economics literature to compare the levels of ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious fractionalization in different countries.   Fractionalization measures are computing the probability that two randomly drawn individuals (from a country) are not from the same group (ethnic, religious, or whatever the criterion is). The two lists have been described by Alesina and Ferrara as follows:  In the Fearon list, cultural fractionalization is approximated by a measure of similarity between languages, varying from 1 = the population speaks two or more unrelated languages to 0 = the entire population speaks the same language.  This index of cultural diversity is biased towards linguistic variations as opposed to genetic diversity and other variations. This list is based on the analysis of Alesina and others,  they develop fractionalization scores based on ethnicity, religious and linguistic data directly from the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica lists. This list is biased by how the Britannica chooses to list ethnic groups, but it does not make a judgement call on which identities are more salient than others. According to Patsiurko et al.
