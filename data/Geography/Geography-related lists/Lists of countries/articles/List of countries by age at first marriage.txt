 This is a list of countries by age at first marriage.  Definition of marriage is the legally or formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship (historically and in some jurisdictions specifically a union between a man and a woman) . Marriage is a legally recognized union between two partners in a relationship. The average age to first get married varies from one country to another and is affected by several factors such as financial stability, career, academic pursuit, and family background.  This list is current from the most recent surveys and does not treat the topic in history. Because the age distribution of people at first marriage is skewed with a longer tail towards older ages,  the majority of people marry before the average age of first marriage. The median age is a more precise representation of when the majority of people marry,  however, for most reporting sources, only the average age at marriage is reported. Some countries have most recent and updated census while other countries haven't been updated since the 1990s.    Note: the reported age for these countries is the median, not the mean (average). All countries in italics have their data in the mean and not the median.
