This is a list of countries (sovereign states) and territories without an airport. Of the world's independent states,  only the five European microstates have no airport within their boundaries, though all have at least one heliport. All apart from Monaco are landlocked, one of which, Liechtenstein, is doubly landlocked. Of the world's 17 non-self-governing territories, two have no airport within their boundaries: Tokelau and the Pitcairn Islands. Both are islands without land connection, so fairly long boat trips are the only transportation.
