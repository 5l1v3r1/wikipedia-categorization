 This list of sovereign states provides an overview of sovereign states around the world, with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty. Membership within the United Nations system divides the 206 listed states into three categories: 193 member states,  2 observer states, and 11 other states. The sovereignty dispute column indicates states whose sovereignty is undisputed (191 states) and states whose sovereignty is disputed (15 states, out of which there are 5 member states, 1 observer state and 9 other states). Compiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood. For more information on the criteria used to determine the contents of this list, please see the criteria for inclusion section below. The list is intended to include entities that have been recognized to have de facto status as sovereign states, and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms. See Armenia–Pakistan relations and Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. and Brčko District, a self-governing administrative unit.  Additionally, it has sovereignty over the Special Administrative Regions of: China claims, but does not control Taiwan, which is governed by a rival administration (the Republic of China) that claims all of China as its territory.[m] China is not recognised by 19 UN member states and the Holy See, which, with the exception of Bhutan, recognise Taiwan instead.[n] China controls part of the territory of Kashmir, which is disputed by India and Pakistan. The continental territory of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland form the three constituent countries of the Kingdom. The designation "Denmark" can refer either to continental Denmark or to the short name for the entire Kingdom (e.g. in international organizations). The Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the EU, but EU law does not apply to the Faroe Islands and Greenland.   Also see Greenland Treaty.           Israel is not recognised as a state by 32 UN members (including most Arab states) nor by the SADR. South Korea is not recognised by one UN member: North Korea.[w] The continental part of the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten form the four constituent countries of the Kingdom. Three other territories (Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius) are special municipalities of the continental Netherlands. The designation "Netherlands" can refer either to the continental Netherlands or to the short name for the entire Kingdom (e.g. in international organizations). The Kingdom of the Netherlands as a whole is a member of the EU, but EU law applies only to parts within Europe. New Zealand has responsibilities for (but no rights of control over) two freely associated states: The Cook Islands and Niue have diplomatic relations with 46 and 18 UN members respectively.    They have full treaty-making capacity in the UN,  and are members of some UN specialized agencies. Norway has the dependent territories of: Azad Kashmir describes itself as a "self-governing state under Pakistani control", while Gilgit-Baltistan is described in its governance order as a group of "areas" with self-government.    These territories are not usually regarded as sovereign, as they do not fulfill the criteria set out by the declarative theory of statehood (for example, their current laws do not allow them to engage independently in relations with other states). Several state functions of these territories (such as foreign affairs and defence) are performed by Pakistan.    Syria has one self-declared autonomous region: Rojava. The British monarch has direct sovereignty over three self-governing Crown dependencies: It also has sovereignty over several uninhabited territories: It also has sovereignty over the following incorporated territories: Three sovereign states have become associated states of the United States under the Compact of Free Association: It also disputes sovereignty over the following territories: The territory of the ROC is claimed in whole by the PRC.[m] The ROC participates in international organizations under a variety of pseudonyms, most commonly "Chinese Taipei" and in the WTO it has full membership. The ROC was a founding member of the UN and enjoyed membership from 1945 to 1971, with veto power in the UN Security Council. See China and the United Nations. The dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood, which was codified by the Montevideo Convention of 1933. The Convention defines the state as a person of international law if it "possess[es] the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) a capacity to enter into relations with the other states" so long as it was not "obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure". [improper synthesis?] Debate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood. The declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant. On the other end of the spectrum, the constitutive theory of statehood defines a state as a person under international law only if it is recognised as sovereign by other states. For the purposes of this list, included are all states that either: Note that in some cases, there is a divergence of opinion over the interpretation of the first point, and whether an entity satisfies it is disputed. Unique political entities which fail to meet the classification of a sovereign state are considered proto-states.   On the basis of the above criteria, this list includes the following 206 entities: [ab] The table includes bullets representing entities which are either not sovereign states or have a close association to another sovereign state. It also includes subnational areas where the sovereignty of the titular state is limited by an international agreement. Taken together, these include:
