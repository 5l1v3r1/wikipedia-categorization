The under-five mortality rate is the number of deaths of infants and children under five years old per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate for the world is 40.8 deaths according to the World Bank and the World Health Organization. 5.6 million children under age five died in 2016, 15 000 every day.    The infant mortality rate (IMR) figures are from the United Nations World Population Prospects report, by five years averages,  and the CIA World Factbook.  The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country. The infant mortality rate of the world is 49.4 according to the United Nations and 34.1  according to the CIA World Factbook.  Note that due to differences in reporting, these numbers may not be comparable across countries. The WHO recommendation is that all children who show signs of life should be recorded as live births. In many countries this standard is not followed, artificially lowering their infant mortality rates relative to countries which follow those standards.
