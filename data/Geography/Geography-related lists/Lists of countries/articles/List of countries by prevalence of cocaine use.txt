This is a list of countries (and some territories) by the annual prevalence of cocaine use as percentage of the population aged 15â€“64 (unless otherwise indicated). The primary sources of information are the World Drug Report 2016 (WDR 2016) best estimates,  and the World Drug Report 2006 (WDR 2006),  published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The indicator is the "annual prevalence" rate which is the percentage of the youth and adult population who have consumed the drug at least once in the past year. According to a recent study, 5 Swiss cities (St Gallen, Bern, Zurich, Basel and Geneva) were listed among top 10 European cities for cocaine use.
