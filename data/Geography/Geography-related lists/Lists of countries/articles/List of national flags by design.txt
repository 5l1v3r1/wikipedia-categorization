See also the list of flags featuring crescents, below, many of which include a five-pointed star in the crescent. Additionally, the Union Jack features in many territorial and sub-national flags. These are often Red Ensigns (e.g.,  Bermuda) or Blue Ensigns (e.g.,  New South Wales and  Anguilla). A small number have backgrounds of other colours (e.g.  British Antarctic Territory and  Niue) or a unique pattern in the field (e.g.  British Indian Ocean Territory and  Hawaii). A small number put the Union Jack somewhere other than the canton (e.g.  British Columbia). Unofficial flags, such as  Ross Dependency also use it.
