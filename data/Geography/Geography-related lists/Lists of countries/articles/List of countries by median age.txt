This article is a list of countries by median age.  Median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups - that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population.  Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger to 40 or more in several European countries, Canada and Japan.  The median age for females tends to be much greater than that of men in some of the ex-Soviet republics, while in the Global South the difference is far smaller or is reversed.
