The human sex ratio is the number of males for each female in a population. This is a list of sex ratios by country or region. The table's data is derived from The World Factbook,  except when otherwise indicated. It shows the male to female sex ratio as estimated by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency. However, there are differences between the estimates by The World Factbook and numbers reported by the census offices of respective countries. The world average for the ratio of males/females is 1.01, which means there are 1.01 males for every female (more males than females). For example, The World Factbook in 2001 reported Switzerland's sex ratio at birth as 1.05,  while Switzerland's Federal Office of Statistics in 2011 reported Switzerland's sex ratio at birth as 1.07 per its birth records census data.  Similar differences between estimates by "The World Factbook" and census numbers from birth records are known for Sweden, Norway, Ireland, India and Japan. A ratio above 1, e.g. 1.1, means there are 1.1 males for every 1 female (more males than females). A ratio below 1, e.g. 0.8, means there are 0.8 males for every 1 female (more females than males). A ratio of 1 means there are equal numbers of females and males.  Number of males in relation to each female:
