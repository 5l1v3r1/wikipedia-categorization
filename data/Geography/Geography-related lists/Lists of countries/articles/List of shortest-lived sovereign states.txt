This is a list of shortest-lived sovereign states. It lists all previous proclaimed sovereign states (excluding micronations) that lasted for less than 1 year. Some of these states represent transitional periods during the formation or reformation of states; an example of this is the State of Somaliland, formed by the independence of British Somaliland which, after 5 days of nominal existence in 1960, merged with the Trust Territory of Somaliland to form the Somali Republic. Some represent proclamations by secessionist or revolutionary movements that were quickly suppressed by established states, an example of this is the Republic of Puerto Rico declared in the 1868 Lares revolution which was quashed by Spain. Incorporated in 1940 as the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.
