The Next Eleven  (known also by the numeronym N-11) are the eleven countries – Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey, South Korea and Vietnam – identified by Goldman Sachs investment banker and economist Jim O'Neill in a research paper as having a high potential of becoming, along with the BRICS countries, among the world's largest economies in the 21st century.  The bank chose these states, all with promising outlooks for investment and future growth, on December 12, 2005. Next Eleven countries have an area of 10 million sq. kilometers while having a population of 1460 million. Combined nominal GDP of these countries is 6.5 trillion dollars. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), their GDP reached 15.5 trillion dollars. The criteria that Goldman Sachs used were macroeconomic stability, political maturity, openness of trade and investment policies, and the quality of education. The N-11 paper is a follow-up to the bank's 2003 paper on the four emerging "BRIC" economies, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.  It can be compared with the CIVETS list coined by Robert Ward, global forecasting director for the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) – having a few differences, but many similarities.
