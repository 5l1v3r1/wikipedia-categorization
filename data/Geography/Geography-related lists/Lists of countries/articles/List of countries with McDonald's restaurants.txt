Footnotes / references  This is a listing of countries with McDonald's restaurants. McDonald's is the largest chain of fast food restaurants in the world.  It has more than 35,000 outlets worldwide.  The majority of McDonald's outlets outside of the United States are franchises. The biggest temporary McDonald's restaurant in the world was opened during 2012 Summer Olympics in London, which had 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft).        The biggest still standing one is probably that at Will Rogers Turnpike.  The list of countries follows the company's own calculation, and contains several non-sovereign territories.
