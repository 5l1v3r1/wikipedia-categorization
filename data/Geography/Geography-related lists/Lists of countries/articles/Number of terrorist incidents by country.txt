This is a list of the number of incidents labelled as terrorism and not believed to have been carried out by a government or its forces (see state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism). The following tables show the number of incidents, deaths, injuries based on data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) which is collected and collated by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland.  The GTD defines a terrorist attack as "the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non‚Äêstate actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."
