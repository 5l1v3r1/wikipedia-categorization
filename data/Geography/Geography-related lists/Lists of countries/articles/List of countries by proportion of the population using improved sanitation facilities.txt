This is a list of countries by the proportion of their population using improved sanitation facilities. Figures used in this chart are based on data compiled and uploaded by the World Bank on May 2013 through their World Development Indicators initiative.   The information was provided by the respective governments of the listed countries.  As the compiled figures are not collected with the same methodology and with different levels of rigor, there are limitations in their reliability in forming comparisons.
