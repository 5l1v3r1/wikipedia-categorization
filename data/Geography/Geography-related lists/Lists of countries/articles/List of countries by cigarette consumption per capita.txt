This is a list of countries by annual per capita consumption of tobacco cigarettes. Cigarettes are smoked by over 1 billion people, which is nearly 20% of the world population in 2014.  About 800 million of these smokers are men.  While smoking rates have leveled off or declined in developed nations, especially among men, in developing nations tobacco consumption continues to rise.  More than 80% of all smokers now live in countries with low or middle incomes, and 60% in just 10 countries, a list headed by China.    Smokers are over half of adult males in Indonesia (57%, but mostly kretek, a local form of cigarette) and China (53% estimated), and nearly half in Bangladesh, though for women the figure is much lower.  Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 falling from 42% to 20.8% of adults,  with further significant decline to 18% by 2012.   There are large regional differences in smoking rates, with Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Mississippi topping the list, and Idaho, California and Utah at significantly lower rates.  In Australia the incidence of smoking is in decline, with figures from 2014â€“15 showing 14.7% of the population (over 18) to be daily smokers, a decline from 22.3% in 2001.   Young adults are the most likely age group to smoke, with a marked decline in smoking rates with increasing age. The prevalence of smoking is strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage [low earners], with over double the rate in the most disadvantaged quintile of the population as compared to the least.   Smoking rates in rural areas tend to be higher than in city areas.  The worldwide average is 1083 cigarettes per year per person above age 14 according to the same source.
