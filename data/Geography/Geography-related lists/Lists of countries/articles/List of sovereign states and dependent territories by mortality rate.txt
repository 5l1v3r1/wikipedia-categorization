This article includes two versions of the list of countries by crude mortality rate. Crude mortality rate refers to the number of deaths over a given period divided by the person-years lived by the population over that period. It is usually expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year(â€°). The first list is based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "2011 annual statistics". It contains the crude death rate of 236 countries and territories in 2011. The second list is based on CIA World Factbook 2014 estimates.  Dependent territories and not fully recognized states are not ranked.
