This is a list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions emissions per capita from 1990 through 2011. All data were calculated by the US Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), mostly based on data collected from country agencies by the United Nations Statistics Division.  Countries are ranked by their metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per capita in 2009. The data only consider carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but not emissions from land use such as deforestation. Emissions from international shipping or bunker fuels are also not included in national figures,  which can make a significant difference for small countries with important ports. The carbon dioxide emissions of a country are only an indicator of one greenhouse gas. For a more complete idea of how a country influences climate change, gases such as methane and nitrous oxide should be taken into account. This is particularly so in agricultural economies. Carbon dioxide emissions are also known for earlier periods. A study of a global sample of twelve countries provide estimates for CO2 emissions since 1800 and explores the long-run drivers of carbon dioxide emissions by decomposing changes in carbon emissions into population, income, technological and energy mix changes.
