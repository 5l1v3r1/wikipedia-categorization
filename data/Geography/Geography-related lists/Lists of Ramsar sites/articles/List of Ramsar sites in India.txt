The list of Ramsar sites (related to wetland) in India comprises Indian wetlands deemed to be of "international importance" under the Ramsar Convention. For a full list of all Ramsar sites worldwide, see the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance. According to WWF-India, wetlands are one of the most threatened of all ecosystems in India. Loss of vegetation, salinization, excessive inundation, water pollution, invasive species, excessive development and road building, have all damaged the countryâ€™s wetlands.  The Sunderban Reserve Forest, spread over 4,260 sq. km. with over 2,000 sq. km. of mangrove forests and creeks, is likely to be declared a Ramsar Site soon. It is a world heritage site. It is situated in the state of West Bengal. It has got an approval from the state government to arrange all the necessary documents and the government of India will apply to the Ramsar Convention Secretariat for this prestigious status. The total number of Ramsar sites will be 27 if this wetland is included. (as of April 2015)   Threats: Agricultural & Shrimp farm runoff =>High concentration of DDT & HCH in their tissue||
