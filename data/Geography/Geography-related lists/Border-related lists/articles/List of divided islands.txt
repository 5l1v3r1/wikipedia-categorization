This is a list of islands whose land is divided by one or more international borders. Other islands have been divided by international borders in the past but they are now unified. The definite borders of modern nation-states do not apply in other forms of societal organisation, where "divided" islands may consequently be less noteworthy.  For example, in Ancient Greece, the island of Euboea was divided among several city states, including Chalcis and Eretria; and before its settlement by Europeans, the Island of Tasmania was divided among nine indigenous tribes. Islands in wartime may be divided between an invading and defending power, as with Crete in 1645â€“1669 between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. Examples of formerly divided islands include: A few former islands have disappeared because of changes in water levels: There are islands that lie across different provinces or states of the same country. An example would be Killiniq Island of Canada, which is divided between Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut, whereas Melville Island and Victoria Island are divided between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. In Australia, the Boundary Islet is divided between Tasmania and Victoria. Smith Island in Chesapeake Bay and Assateague Island, a barrier island on the Atlantic coast of the United States, are divided between the states of Maryland and Virginia. Fenwick Island, on the coast immediately to the north, is divided between Maryland and Delaware. Ellis Island, itself in the United States state of New Jersey, contains a true exclave of the state of New York; elsewhere in New York Harbor, the northern tip of Shooters Island, otherwise in New York, is in New Jersey. Zhongshan Island, in China, is divided between the province of Guangdong and the special administrative region of Macau.
