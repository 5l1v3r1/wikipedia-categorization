This is a list of countries and territories by border/area ratio. For each country or territory, the total length of the land borders and the total surface area are listed, as well as the ratio between these two parameters. A high border/area ratio means that the country or territory has a long border compared to its surface area. A border/area ratio of zero indicates that the country has no land borders. Countries or territories that are connected only by bridges or other man-made causeways are not considered to have land borders. The countries with the highest border/area ratios are some of the smallest, non-island, nations of the world, such as Vatican City, Monaco and San Marino. Many island nations, lack any land borders and thus have a border/area ratio of zero.
