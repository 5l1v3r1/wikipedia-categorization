Below are separate lists of countries and dependencies with their land boundaries, and lists of which countries and dependencies border oceans and major seas.  The first short section describes the borders or edges of continents and oceans/major seas.  Disputed areas are not considered. (Notes: Dependencies and islands remote from continental land masses are not considered and are excluded from this list section; thus only continental land borders are considered.   The only countries listed either straddle continents or are on a continent border.) Section Key:   ( * ) = represents a country that crosses a continental land border (Notes: Dependencies are excluded from this section.  See below.  Only land boundaries are considered; maritime boundaries are excluded; see the List of countries and territories by maritime boundaries.   Disputed territories are not considered, other than the inclusion by necessity, in a neutral fashion, of Western Sahara.)
