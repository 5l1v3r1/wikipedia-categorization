Since ascending the throne in 1952, Queen Elizabeth II has undertaken a number of state and official visits  as well as trips throughout the Commonwealth, making her the most widely travelled head of state in history. The Queen does not require a British passport for travelling overseas,  as all British passports are issued in her name.  As the sovereign of more than one independent state, Elizabeth II has represented both Canada and the United Kingdom on state visits, though the former on just two occasions. For the countries where Elizabeth II is sovereign, other than the United Kingdom, the relevant governor-general will usually carry out state visits on the Queen's behalf.
