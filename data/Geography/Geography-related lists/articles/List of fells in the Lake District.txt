This is a list of fells, hills, mountains, groups of mountains and subsidiary summits and tops in the Lake District, England. These are the 214 fells selected by Alfred Wainwright for a chapter in his seven Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells. See List of Wainwrights for them sorted by book, and the other Lake District fells he listed in The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. A Marilyn is a hill which has a relative height of at least 150 metres (approximately 500 feet), regardless of its absolute height above sea level. List of Marilyns in England gives a more detailed listing, including the relative height for each fell. The Hewitts are hills which have a relative height of at least 30 metres (approximately 100 feet), and are over 2000 feet (approximately 610 metres) above sea level.
