Lists of foods named after places have been compiled by writers, sometimes on travel websites or food-oriented websites, as well as in books. Since all of these names are words derived from place names, they are all toponyms. This article covers English language food toponyms which may have originated in English or other languages. According to Delish.com, "[T]here's a rich history of naming foods after cities, towns, countries, and even the moon."  The following foods and drinks were named after places. Each non-obvious etymology is supported by a reference on the linked Wikipedia page. Food names are listed by country of the origin of the word, not necessarily where the food originated or was thought to have originated.
