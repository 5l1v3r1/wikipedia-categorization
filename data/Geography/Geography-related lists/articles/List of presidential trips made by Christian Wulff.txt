This is a list of presidential visits to foreign countries made by Christian Wulff as President of Germany. Wulff held the office from his election on 2 July 2010 until his resignation on 17 February 2012. On 12 December, being "on the way to the Emir", Wulff made a controversial call to Kai Diekmann, the chief editor of Bild that sparked the Causa Wulff, which would ultimately lead to the resignation of the President.
