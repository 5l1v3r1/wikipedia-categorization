This is a list of legislatures by country. A "legislature" is the generic name for the National parliaments and congresses that act as a plenary general assembly of representatives and that have the power to legislate. All entities included in the list of countries are included in this list. The legislatures are listed with their names in English and the name in the (most-used) native language of the country (or the official name in the second-most used native language in cases where English is the majority "native" language).
