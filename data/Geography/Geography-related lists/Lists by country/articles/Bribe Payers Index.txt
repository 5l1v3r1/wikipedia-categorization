Bribe Payers Index (BPI) is a measure of how willing a nation's business sector appears to engage in corrupt business practices. The first BPI was published by Transparency International on October 26, 1999. The BPI 2011 ranked 28 of the leading exporting countries on the likelihood their multinational businesses will use bribes when operating abroad. The ranking is calculated from responses by businessmen to two questions on the World Economic Forumâ€™s Executive Opinion Survey. The first question asks for the country of origin of foreign-owned companies doing the most business in their country. The second question is: "In  your  experience,  to  what  extent  do  firms  from  the  countries  you  have  selected  make undocumented extra payments or bribes?" Answers are to be given on a scale of 1 (bribes are common or even mandatory) to 10 (bribes are unknown). The BPI ranking is the averaged score, with higher scores suggesting a lower likelihood of using bribery. These countries were selected as the leading international or regional exporting countries. Their combined global exports represented 75 percent of the world total in 2006.  Countries that had paid the less bribes have a higher BPI.
