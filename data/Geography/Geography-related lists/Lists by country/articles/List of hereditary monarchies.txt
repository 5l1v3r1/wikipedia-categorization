A hereditary monarchy is the most common style of monarchy and is the form that is used by almost all of the world's existing monarchies. Under a hereditary monarchy, all the monarchs come from the same family, and the crown is passed down from one member to another member of the family.

The following list is a list of hereditary monarchies and their current (as of  2008[update]) monarchs. NOTE: The table comprises some sovereign monarchs of the world today, but is incomplete.
