This is a list of noteworthy[a] anime conventions from around the world, as distinct from comic book conventions, furry conventions, gaming conventions, horror conventions, multigenre conventions, and science fiction conventions. This list is sectioned by location, and each convention includes in parentheses the dates during which it is typically held. Dates listed are approximate or traditional time periods for each convention. Multi-genre, comic book, furry, gaming, and science fiction conventions are not listed here. These are notable conventions that have at one time existed, but have either gone on hiatus for more than one year, were merged into other conventions, or have finished operating entirely. Defunct conventions are listed here when where there is an official or reliable announcement and/or the convention's website appears dead. Conventions that are cancelled for a given year, are marked as "On Hiatus".
