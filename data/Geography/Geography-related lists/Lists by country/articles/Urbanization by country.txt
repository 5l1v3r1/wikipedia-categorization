This is a list of countries by urbanization.  There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country.  The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time. The data is taken from the CIA World Factbook with estimates from 2018.
