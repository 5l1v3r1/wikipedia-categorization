  The following is a summary of the use of capital punishment by country. Historically, capital punishment has been used in almost every part of the world. Currently, the large majority of countries have either abolished or discontinued the practice. Japan has the highest inequality-adjusted HDI of any country to use the death penalty; Singapore has the highest unadjusted HDI.        The use of capital punishment is usually divided into the four categories set out below. As of  November 2017[update], of the 195 independent states that are UN members or have UN observer status:  Of the countries/regions categorized as 'very high' on the Human Development Index, 11 countries perform capital punishment: the United States, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Belarus, Oman, Malaysia, and Taiwan. In South Korea and Russia, there is a moratorium. Qatar, the Bahamas, Barbados, and Brunei have a moratorium in practice. In Israel, Kazakhstan, and Chile, it can only be used for crimes committed in wartime. In Africa, there are several countries that use the death penalty. Chad abolished the death penalty in 2014, but reintroduced it for acts of terrorism in 2015. Botswana and Nigeria are examples of countries that still execute people. Most recently, Burkina Faso repealed the death penalty in 2018. In 2018, The Gambia announced a moratorium as a first step toward abolition.  In the Caribbean countries, the death penalty exists at least de jure, except in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which abolished it in 1966 and 1987, respectively. The last execution in the Caribbean, and the last in the Americas outside the United States, was in Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2008. In Central and South America, the death penalty exists in Belize and Guyana, though it has not been used for years. In Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru, the death penalty is only legal in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime and was abolished for other crimes. Opinion polls state sentiment for governments to return to capital punishment remains high in many Caribbean countries and pressure on politicians to retain it factors high. Most executions worldwide take place in Asia. China is the world's most active death penalty country. In Iran and Saudi Arabia, the numbers of executions are also very high. In North Korea, the state utilizes the death penalty against high level criminals and those suspected of committing "grave" offenses. Of the 11 countries with a “very high” Human Development Index which practice executions, 9 are in Asia: Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates. In 2017 Mongolia repealed the death penalty. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte wants to restore executions, but the proposal to do so failed to pass the Senate. Turkish President Recep Erdogan has stated that he wants to restore capital punishment, but this has not happened. India executes criminals only in extreme cases. Only 26 executions have taken place in India since 1991, the last of the terrorist Yakub Memon in 2015. The European Union holds a strong position against the death penalty; its abolition is a key objective for the Union's human rights policy. Abolition is also a pre-condition for entry into the European Union. In Europe, only Belarus and the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic continue to actively use capital punishment.    Russia retains the death penalty in law, but there is a moratorium. The last execution on Russian territory was in Chechnya in 1999. Of the other former Soviet republics, only Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have not formally abolished capital punishment, and only Belarus uses it in practice. In Kazakhstan, it may only be used in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime, and only one individual is on death row. Nearly all countries in this region have abolished the death penalty as a form of punishment, and the two countries that still have it in law (Papua New Guinea and Tonga) have not used it in years. The last known executions in this region took place in Tonga in 1982. At least 23 countries performed executions in 2017: Precise numbers are not available for many countries, so the total number of executions is unknown. Other countries like Libya conducted extrajudicial executions. Of the 54 independent states in Africa that are UN members: Many African countries have carried out no executions for over 10 years, but are not believed to have an abolitionist policy or established practice. The information above is accurate as of  2017[update], when Guinea abolished capital punishment. Chad abolished the death penalty in 2014, but restored it for terrorism in 2015. In 2018, The Gambia announced a moratorium as a first step toward abolition. Executions in Africa in 2017: Egypt (35+), Somalia (24), South Sudan (4)   Note: The tables can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the  icon. Of the 35 independent states in the Americas that are UN members: Many Caribbean countries have carried out no executions for over 10 years, but are not believed to have an abolitionist policy or established practice. Currently (2018), the United States is the only country in the Americas to conduct executions. The last execution elsewhere in the region was in Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2008. The countries in the Americas that most recently abolished the death penalty are Suriname (2015), Argentina (2009), and Bolivia (2009). Guatemala abolished the death penalty for civil cases in 2017. Executions in the Americas in 2017: United States (23).  Note: The tables can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the  icon. Despite this it was reinstated on several occasions: On 26 August 2008, a new Code of Military Justice was promulgated that abolished death penalty. The new Code came into effect 6 months later, on 26 February 2009.   Hanging (in the past, for civil offences), firing squad (military offences). Brazil has always maintained the death penalty in wartime as part of its Military Code but, after Brazil became a Republic in 1889, capital punishment for civil offenses or for military offences committed in peacetime was abolished by the first republican Constitution, adopted in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated (in 1938-46 and 1969–74), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered "internal warfare".      Only one civilian was sentenced to death in the republican period, in 1969, but the sentence was commuted and was not carried out. In the republican era, all military death sentences imposed for crimes committed during wartime (the Second World War was Brazil's last international military conflict) were similarly commuted and not carried out. The current Constitution of Brazil (1988) expressly forbids the use of capital punishment, except for military offences committed during a war duly declared by Congress.  The last person to suffer the death penalty in Brazil was executed in 1876, during the Imperial era. After 1876, Emperor Pedro II adopted in practice an abolitionist policy through his prerrogative of Mercy as Head of State, by directing that all death sentences be submitted by the Courts to the Imperial Government for examination regarding commutation (even without a request for pardon or commutation from the person condemned), and by granting commutations for all death sentences that were passed.

Of the 44 independent countries in Asia that are UN member or observer states: The information above is accurate as of  2017[update], when Mongolia abolished the death penalty, and does not include Taiwan, which is not currently a UN member; Taiwan practises the death penalty by shooting, and conducted one execution in 2016 and one in 2018. Hong Kong and Macau are also listed below (they have abolished the death penalty), but they are not included in the figures above as they do not have UN membership separate from China. Executions in 2017 as amnesty international: China (1,551+), North Korea (unknown number), Iran (506+), Iraq (125+), Saudi Arabia (146), Yemen (2+), Afghanistan (5), Japan (4), Palestine (6), Malaysia (4), Singapore (8), Syria (unknown number), Bangladesh (6), Pakistan (60+), Bahrain (3), Jordan (15), Kuwait (7), United Arab Emirates (1), Vietnam (unknown number).   Note: The tables can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the  icon. Of the 49 independent states in Europe that are UN members or have UN Observer status: Abolition of death penalty is a pre-condition for entry into the European Union, which considers capital punishment a "cruel and inhuman" practice and "not been shown in any way to act as a deterrent to crime".  Since 1999, Belarus has been the only recognized country in Europe to carry out executions. 2009 and 2015 were the first two years in recorded history when Europe was completely free of executions. This century the following European countries have abolished capital punishment: Ukraine (2000), Malta (2000), Cyprus (2002), Turkey (2004), Greece (2004), Moldova (2005), Albania (2007), and Latvia (2012). Executions in Europe in 2017: Belarus (2)   Note: The tables can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the  icon. The self-proclaimed state of Abkhazia, which is claimed by Georgia, still retains the death penalty for wartime treason, but it has been under moratorium since 2007. The self-proclaimed state of Transnistria, which is claimed by Moldova, still retains the death penalty but has observed a moratorium on executions since 1999. Of the 14 independent countries in Oceania that are UN member or observer states: Only Papua New Guinea and Tonga have not formally abolished capital punishment despite not using the practice since 1975 and 1982 respectively. The most recent countries to abolish capital punishment in Oceania are Samoa (2004), Fiji (2015), and Nauru (2016). Note: The tables can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the  icon. The table below lists in chronological order the 105 independent states, that are either UN members or have UN observer status, that have completely abolished the death penalty. In the hundred years following the abolition of capital punishment by Venezuela in 1863 only 11 more countries followed, not counting temporary abolitions which were later reversed. From the 1960s onwards, abolition became far more popular. 4 countries abolished capital punishment in the 1960s (a record up to that time for any decade), 11 in the 1970s, and a further 10 in the 1980s. After the end of the Cold War, many more countries followed. 35 countries abolished capital punishment in the 1990s, with 9 in 1990 alone, and a further 23 in the 2000s. 11 countries have abolished so far in the 2010s. Since 1985, there have been only 6 years when no country has abolished the death penalty: 1988, 2001, 2003, 2011, 2013 and 2014. Note: Where a country has abolished, re-instated, and abolished again (e.g. Philippines, Switzerland, Portugal) only the later abolition date is included. Countries who have abolished and since reinstated (e.g. Liberia) are not included. Non-independent territories are considered to be under the jurisdiction of their parent country – which leads to unexpectedly late abolition dates for the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where Jersey (UK), the Cook Is (NZ), and the Netherlands Antilles, were the last territories of those states to abolish capital punishment, and all were rather later than the more well known abolitions on the respective mainlands. Defunct countries such as the GDR (East Germany), which abolished capital punishment in 1987 but was dissolved in 1990, are also not included.
