The telecommunication administrations in many countries assign specific telephone number prefixes to mobile phones within their telephone numbering plan, however some do not. The North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) in the United States and its territories, Canada, and much of the Caribbean, uses normal geographic area codes for the mobile services so that a mobile telephone number is not easily recognized. If there is only +32.. followed by any other, shorter number, like +32 51 724859, this is the number of a normal phone, not a mobile.
