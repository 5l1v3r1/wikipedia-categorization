This is a list of commercial Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks around the world, grouped by their frequency bands. Some operators use multiple bands and are therefore listed multiple times in respective sections. Note: This list of network deployments does not imply any widespread deployment or national coverage. See List of LTE networks in Africa. Apart from their main spectrum holdings across large regions in the country (listed below) the major US carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile & Verizon) also hold various Cellular Market Area (CMA) and/or Economic Area (EA) licenses for the AWS 1700 band, as well as Major Trading Area (MTA) and/or Basic Trading Area (BTA) licenses for the PCS 1900 band. In several small regional areas the named operators combine these with their major spectrum holdings to increase the bandwidth for their LTE deployments. Due to the large amount of these "single" licenses they are not listed here. Canada: Bell Network Availability within Tier 3 License Areas See List of LTE networks in Asia.
