Copyright is the right to copy and publish a particular work. The terms "copy" and "publish" are quite broad. They also cover copying in electronic form, the making of translated versions, the creation of a television program based on the work, and putting the work on the Internet. A work is protected by copyright if it is a literary or artistic work. This is quite a broad expression, and almost all products of creative and original effort are copyrighted. Note that copyright protects only specific expressions of an idea, not the idea itself. A collection of facts may be copyrighted, assuming there is some creative activity involved in compiling the collection. Several countries provide a separate protection regime for collections of facts that qualify as "databases", but this regime has nothing to do with copyright. Copyright protection is automatic upon creation of the work. In some countries, registration with a Copyright Office has some benefits (like the ability to sue, or to receive more money in damages). When a work's copyright term ends, the work passes into the public domain. The Berne Convention stipulates that the duration of the term for copyright protection is the life of the author plus at least 50 years after their death. For some categories of works, the minimum duration is shorter. For example, the minimum term for applied art is 25 years. Movies have a minimum term of 50 years. Countries may choose a longer term of protection, and most countries have done so. In Berne-signatory countries, the duration of copyright is dependent on the duration of the author's life. Berne requires that copyright exist until a minimum of 50 years after the author's death. A number of countries, including the European Union and the United States, have extended that to 70 years after the author's death. A small number of countries have extended copyright further. The current lengthiest term is 100 years after the death of the author (Mexico). In 1989, the Berne Convention became effective in the U.S., and from that moment on also U.S. authors automatically obtained copyright on their works. However, many U.S. texts on copyright still echo the old registration principle, which can be very confusing at times. To confuse matters even more, the requirement for registration has not been abolished completely in the U.S. To start a lawsuit against infringers, it is still necessary to register the work in some countries. Further, registration offers the possibility to obtain statutory damages, rather than only the actual damages from the infringer. All countries within the European Union are signatory states of the Berne Convention. Additionally, Copyright in the European Union is regulated through European Directives. The member states of the European Union have, following an directive, increased the term to life of the author and 70 years after their death. Although this was not the original intention, this extension applies retroactively. Works that had ended up in the public domain because the author was dead for 50 years now received an additional twenty years of protection. Most European countries, on the other hand, follow the principle that copyright protection is granted automatically upon creation of the work. This principle was first laid down in the Berne Convention (1886). The Berne Convention specifically forbids (in article 5) that a member country can require any formality for getting copyright protection. This is a list of countries and their copyright terms, the lengths of their standard copyrights, in years. The table includes entries for non-country entities: the European Union, Berne Convention, and the Universal Copyright Convention, which set minimum terms for their member states or signatories. The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), though not included, requires a copyright length of at least 50 years after death. 50 years from publication (published after authors' deaths)  50 years from publication (audiovisual works)  50 years from publication (photographic, painting works)  50 years from creation (phonogram)  70 years from publication; 70 years from creation if unpublished (photographic or audiovisual work of joint authorship)  25 years from production (works of applied art) :Art. 20 50 years from creation (photographs or the work of applied art :Art. 59 70 years from publication (anonymous or pseudonymous work) :Art. 18(5) Life + 25 years (photographic works or applied arts)  50 years from creation (broadcast); 50 years after programme included in a cable programme service :s. 12(1) 25 years from publication (typographical arrangement of a published edition) :s. 13 [Life + 50 years (death before 1955)]  50 years after making (television broadcasts and sound broadcasts) :s. 95 25 years from publication (published editions of works) :s. 96 [50 years from publication (photographs, no longer applicable since 1 January 2005)]  40 years from publication or 50 years from completion, whichever is earlier (computer software) :Art. 31(3) 50 years from making (computer-generated work) :s. 10(4) 50 years from publication; 50 years from creation if unpublished (sound recordings and films) :s. 11 50 years from creation (broadcast); 50 years after programme included in a cable programme service :s. 12 25 years from publication (typographical arrangement of a published edition) :s. 13 50 years from fixation (performance) :Art. 38(1) 50 years from publication or if unpublished 50 years from fixation (phonogram) :Art. 38(2) 50 years from the first broadcast or cable transmission :Art. 38(3) Signatories may grant longer terms.  50 years from publication (anonymous or pseudonymous works)  25 years from creation (photographic works)  Signatories may grant longer terms.    50 years from creation (photographic works) :Art. 49a The following additions to copyright term formerly applied to all works, but the French Cour de Cassation has found them to be superseded by later copyright treaties, thus limiting the copyright term to life + 70 years total, at least for non-musical works of authors who did not "die for France".  + 6 years 152 days for musical work published through 1920 :Art.

I.e. photographs, such as snapshots, that are below the threshold of originality to merit copyright protection are given neighbouring rights protection. [..] The Norwegian copyright act does not address public domain directly. The Norwegian copyright law defines two basic rights for authors: economic rights and moral rights. [..] For material that is outside the scope of copyright, the phrase «i det fri» («in the free») is used. This corresponds roughly to the term «public domain» in English. Norwegian copyright law makes a distinction between copyright and neighbouring rights. Only creative and artistic works are subject to copyright. Some other types of works are protected by so‐called neighbouring rights."  120 years from the year following the completion  Life + 74 years (for those who fought in or worked during the war of 1941–45) Date of rehabilitation + 70 (74) years (for unlawfully prosecuted and posthumously rehabilitated) Protection applies if copyright term of Life + 50 years (or Life + 54 years) did not expire by 1 January 1993.  50 years from creation if unpublished, or 50 years from publication (sound records)  70 years from publication (anonymous works)  70 years from publication if published within 70 years from death (posthumous publication) 70 years from publication if published before 3 August 1993 by a corporation (cinematographic, television, radio works, print periodicals and compilations).
