A strong focus is on the community, with segments such as Lost and Found, Jobfile and Community Contact featured throughout the day. Discussions about local events and issues are held regularly, with strong local news heard most hours.

Networked music program My Generation on Sunday mornings from 7am. The station is unique in NSW in that it takes both NRL and AFL coverage, possibly owing to its position near the Victorian border.
