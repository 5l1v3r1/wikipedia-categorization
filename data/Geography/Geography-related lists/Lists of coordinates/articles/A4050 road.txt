  The A4050 road connects Barry, Vale of Glamorgan with Culverhouse Cross on the outskirts of Cardiff, Wales. It is approximately 10 miles (16 km) long, and is the key link road between the M4 motorway and Cardiff International Airport. Wenvoe village lies along the road. In 2008 the Welsh Assembly allocated £576,000 to road resurfacing and improvement, which as of 2012 was still ongoing.  One area given specific attention is the area around Pencoedtre between Waycock Cross and Barry as housing development and a new crematorium has been created in recent times. At Culverhouse Cross, the A4050 connects to the A48 and the A4232.  The A48 links with Cowbridge and to Cowbridge Road West which connects the western Cardiff district of Ely to Canton and the city centre.  The A4232 links with the M4 at junction 33 and Cardiff Bay.
