  The A640 is a road in England which runs between Rochdale in Greater Manchester and Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. The Rochdale terminus is the junction of Drake Street and Manchester Road (A58). From here, the road runs eastward through Newbold, Belfield, Firgrove, Milnrow, Newhey, Ogden, Denshaw, Buckstones, Deanhead, Scammonden, Outlane and in Huddersfield (Salendine Nook, Oakes and Marsh, before meeting the A62 at Huddersfield's town centre ring road.) The road is often closed during periods of snow due to its remote nature. This cuts off the non-motorway route from Huddersfield to Manchester.
