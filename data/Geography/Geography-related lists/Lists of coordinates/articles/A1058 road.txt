  The A1058 or the Coast Road is a major road in North Tyneside.  It runs from Jesmond in Newcastle upon Tyne to Tynemouth, on the coast 8 miles (13 km) to the east from Newcastle City Centre. From Heaton to Billy Mill, the road is built to grade-separated dual carriageway standard. East of Billy Mill, it is known as Beach Road. Just west of Heaton, a new route was built across Jesmond Dene in the 1990s, attracting opposition from environmentalists. The website Pathetic Motorways has speculated that a section of Newcastle's Central Motorway (A167(M)) is part of the A1058 even if it is not signed as A1058(M).
