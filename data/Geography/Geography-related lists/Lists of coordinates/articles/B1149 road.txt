  The B1149 is the most direct route between the town of Holt and the city of Norwich in the county of Norfolk, England.  There is no direct A-road alternative. The road joins the A140 north of Norwich at a traffic island close to Norwich International Airport. From north to south the road passes through: The route of the B1149 can be seen clearly on Faden’s large-scale map (at one inch to the mile) of the county of Norfolk of 1779,  which shows that this road’s route has changed very little over the years, even after the Parliamentary Enclosure of the early 19th century. On this early map the road is labeled as the Norwich–to–Cley next the Sea road,  indicating the road's importance farther back to the 13th century, when Cley was a busy seaport. The road would have been used by the wealthy merchants of Norwich to transport their goods to the port, where a healthy trade was carried out between Norfolk and the Low Countries. Approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) on the left from Holt the road passes Holt Country Park.  At Saxthorpe, after 5.8 miles (9.3 km), the road now has a bypass to avoid a bridge over the River Bure in Corpusty, which has a 7.5-tonne weight restriction that until recent times meant a large detour for HGVs travelling from Norwich to Holt.  At the roundabout at the northern end of the Corpusty bypass, the road is joined from the west by the B1354 from Thursford. After 10.8 miles (17.4 km) the road is dissected by the B1145 that connects Kings Lynn to Mundesley on the northeastern coast of Norfolk. In the morning and evening rush hours the road gets very congested at its southwesterly end, where it converges with the A140 at a roundabout. The proposed Norwich Northern Distributor Road would link to the A140 road close the its junction with the southern end of B1149 close to Norwich Airport.
