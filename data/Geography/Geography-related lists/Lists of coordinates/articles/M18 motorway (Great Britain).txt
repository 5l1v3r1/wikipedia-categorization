  The M18 is a motorway in Yorkshire, England. It runs from the east of Rotherham to Goole and is approximately 26 miles (42 km) long.  A section of the road forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E13. The M18 runs in a north east/south west direction from junction 32 of the M1 motorway to junction 35 of the M62 motorway.  It passes east of Rotherham, southeast of Doncaster and Armthorpe, and west of Thorne. It meets the A1(M) at junction 2 (A1(M) junction 35)--known as the Wadworth Interchange—and the M180 motorway at junction 5. Access to Doncaster is provided from junctions 3 (A6182) and 4 (A630) Much of the M18 is a two lane dual carriageway, and carries relatively low volumes of traffic. However, the section linking the M1 and A1(M) is much busier and has three lanes in each direction.  It then passes over the Wadworth Viaduct.  To the north it then crosses the East Coast Main Line, and until its closure and the dismantling of the pit head gear, a large colliery could be seen to the south at Rossington. Great Yorkshire Way (formerly Finningley and Rossington Regeneration Route Scheme (FARRRS)) is a new road scheme  running between the M18 at Junction 3 and Doncaster Sheffield Airport, improving access primarily to the airport, Rossington and the new Doncaster iPort. Work started in 2013 and the first phase of the road between M18 junction 3 and the A638 road became operational in February 2016.  Work on the second and final phase connecting the A638 and the airport began in June 2017  and was completed in June 2018.  In order to provide better access to FARRRS and Doncaster town centre, the section of the M18 between junctions 2 and 3 northbound was upgraded to 3 lanes, between 20 June 2014 and 12 June 2015.  The M18 was originally to be part of the M1, but it was decided to route the M1 towards Leeds instead of Doncaster, and the routing of what would have been the M1 east of Sheffield became the M18.  Data from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information.   The location sequence is a continuation of the M1 location sequence. Route map: Google
