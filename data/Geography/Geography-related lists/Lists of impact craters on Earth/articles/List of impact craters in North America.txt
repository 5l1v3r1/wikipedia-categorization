This list includes all 60 confirmed impact craters in North America in the Earth Impact Database. (There are 59 if Calvin crater is excluded.)  These features were caused by the collision of large meteorites or comets with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original rim diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.
