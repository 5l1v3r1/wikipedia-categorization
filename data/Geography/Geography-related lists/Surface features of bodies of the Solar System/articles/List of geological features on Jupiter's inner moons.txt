In addition to the large Galilean moons, Jupiter is orbited by sixty three smaller moons, but only two of them, Amalthea and Thebe, have been imaged at sufficient resolution for surface features to become apparent. Amalthean craters are named after characters in Greek mythology associated with Zeus and Amalthea. Faculae on Amalthea are named after locations in Greek mythology associated with Zeus. The only Theban named feature is Zethus Crater, named after Zethus, the husband of Thebe.
