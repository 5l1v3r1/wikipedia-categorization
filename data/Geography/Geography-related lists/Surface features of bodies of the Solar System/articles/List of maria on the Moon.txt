This is a list of maria (large, dark, basaltic plains) on the Moon. It also includes the one oceanus and the features known by the names lacus, palus and sinus. The modern system of lunar nomenclature was introduced in 1651 by Giovanni Battista Riccioli.  Riccioli's map of the moon was drawn by Francesco Maria Grimaldi, who has a crater named after him. There was also a region on the Lunar farside that was briefly misidentified as a mare and named Mare Desiderii (Sea of Desire). It is no longer recognized. Other former maria include: A related set of features are the Lunar lacus (singular lacus, Latin for "lake"), which are smaller basaltic plains of similar origin: A related set of features are the sinus (singular sinus, Latin for "bay") and paludes (singular palus, Latin for "marsh"): Some sources also list a Palus Nebularum ("Marsh of Mists") at 38.0° N, 1.0° E. However the designation for this feature has not been officially recognized by the IAU.
