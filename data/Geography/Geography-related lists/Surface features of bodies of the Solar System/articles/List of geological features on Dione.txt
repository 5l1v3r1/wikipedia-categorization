This is a list of named geological features on Dione, a moon of Saturn. Dionean geological features are named after people and places in Roman mythology. Catenae are crater chains. They are named after rivers in Roman mythology. Dionean chasms are called chasmata. They are named after important locations in Roman mythology and history. Dionean ridges are called dorsa.  They are named after Roman hills. Dionean fossae (long narrow depressions) are named after cities, streets and rivers in Roman mythology. Originally, three geological features were labelled lineae (bright wispy markings). However, later evidence from the Cassini probe revealed them to be chasms, and they were all renamed as such (see above). Dionean craters are named after figures from Greek and Roman mythology, especially Virgil's Aeneid. Other craters: Erulus, Lagus, Sagaris
