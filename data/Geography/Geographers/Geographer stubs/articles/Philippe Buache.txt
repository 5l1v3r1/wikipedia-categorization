Philippe Buache (born La Neuville-au-Pont, 7 February 1700; died Paris, 24 January 1773) was a French geographer.  Buache was trained under the geographer Guillaume Delisle, whose daughter he married, and whom he succeeded in the Acad√©mie des sciences in 1730. Buache was nominated first geographer of the king in 1729. He established the division of the world by seas and river systems. He believed in a southern continent, an hypothesis which was confirmed by later discoveries.  In 1754, he published an "Atlas physique."  He also wrote several pamphlets. His nephew, Jean Nicolas Buache (born La Neuville-au-Pont, 15 February 1741; died Paris, 21 November 1825), was also a geographer of the king.
