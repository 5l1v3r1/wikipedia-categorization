His seven sons whom he positioned in seven different commercial centers from his base in Yemen, enhanced his trading business by sending goods from foreign markets.  He had lost 11 ships in the Indian Ocean but recovered his fortunes when his 12th ship safely arrived from China which carried porcelain and aloewood.
