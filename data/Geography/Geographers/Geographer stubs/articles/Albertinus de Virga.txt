Albertinus de Virga (or Albertin de Virga) was a 15th-century Venetian cartographer. Practically nothing is known of his life, save that he was probably Venetian.  Virga is the author of two famous maps: It has been tentatively suggested that Virga might also have been the author of a third map, an anonymous portolan chart dating from the beginning of the 15th century currently held  (Port.40) by the Museo Correr in Venice, Italy.
