Aurel Krause (December 30, 1848 â€“ March 14, 1908) was a German geographer known today for his early ethnography of the Tlingit Indians of southeast Alaska, published in 1885. Krause was born in Polnisch Konopath near Schwetz, West Prussia.  He and his brother Arthur Krause were employed by the Geographical Society of Bremen in Germany when they conducted ethnological research in Siberia, followed by Aurel Krause's mostly solo research with the Tlingit of Klukwan, Alaska, in 1881 and 1882.
