Giampiero Cotti Cometti (Lovere, 11 January 1935 â€“ Milan, 31 December 2009) was an Italian geographer and Marxist, who studied problems of the Third World as well as the mountains. Giampiero was a professor of Geography at the University of Turin  from 1976 until his death in 2009. Giampiero dedicated much of his time to translating many texts and geographical manuals from the Russian Academy of Sciences, which he believed was the most advanced level of research and teaching of geography.  In order to make geographical texts available to aspiring geographers, both for research and teaching, he founded the Cesviet publishing house.  As an advertising journalist Giampiero wrote numerous articles for the 'Page of Science' of the Corriere della Sera (1964-1965). He is also the author of the voices of Asia,  Sahara,  Burma,  Cambodia,  Laos,  and Thailand.
