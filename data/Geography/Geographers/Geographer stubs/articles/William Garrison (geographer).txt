William Louis Garrison was an American geographer, transportation analyst and professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  While at the Department of Geography, University of Washington in the 1950s, Garrison led the "quantitative revolution" in geography, which applied computers and statistics to the study of spatial problems. As such, he was one of the founders of regional science. Many of his students (dubbed the "space cadets") went on to become noted professors themselves, including: Brian Berry, Ronald Boyce, Duane Marble, Richard Morrill, John Nystuen, William Bunge, Michael Dacey, Arthur Getis, and Waldo Tobler.  His transportation work focused on innovation, the deployment of modes and logistic curves,  alternative vehicles and the future of the car.
