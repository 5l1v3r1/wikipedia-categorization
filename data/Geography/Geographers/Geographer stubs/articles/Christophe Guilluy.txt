  Christophe Guilluy (born 14 October 1964 in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis) is a French geographer and author. In France, he is known for his theory on la France périphérique ("peripheral France"), but elsewhere, he is mostly unknown.  His books state that many members of the political elite have lost contact to the lower classes, which are mainly in rural France, which he calls "peripheral France". He has used that theory to explain the rise of the National Front in France.  Also, he tried to explain US support for Donald Trump by the existence of a peripheral America during an interview in the French magazine Le Point.
