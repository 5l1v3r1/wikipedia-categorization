Lake Monoleus was a coastal feature mentioned by Pliny,  as being on the Red Sea Coast near Ptolemais Theron. The lake was probably a coastal lagoon.  According to Pliny   the city of Ptolemais Theron was situated adjacent to Lake Monoleus,  at a distance of 4820 stadia from  Berenice  and located in Ã†thiopia, though modern Eritrea is more probable. The lake must have been not connected to the Red Sea as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea chapter 3 written (mid 1st century) notes that Ptolemais Theron had "no harbor, and can only be reached by small boats".  The location of the lake (if that is what it was) remains unknown, though several locations have been conjectured.
