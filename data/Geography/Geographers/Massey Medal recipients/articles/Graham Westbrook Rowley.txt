Graham Westbrook Rowley CM MBE (October 31, 1912 â€“ December 31, 2003) was an Arctic explorer.   Rowley was born on October 31, 1912 in Manchester, England. He received his B.A. from the University of Cambridge in 1934 and his M.A. from the same institution in 1936.  From 1936 to 1939, Rowley engaged in an archaeological excavation in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. During this time, he discovered new islands in Fox Basin, carried out the original exploration of the Baffin Island coast, crossed Baffin Island by a new route, and excavated the first major site in Dorset culture. Because of his work with the Inuit and Dorset peoples, Rowley had a large island and river in the Arctic named after him. A Fellow of the Royal Canadian Georgraphical Society, Rowley was awarded the Society's Massey Medal in 1963 for his geographical work. As a scientist with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in the early 1970s, he created a training program for Northern scientists and developed ground and air support services for scientific groups working in the Arctic.  He was made an honorary member of the American Polar Society in 1985. He died in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on December 31, 2003.
