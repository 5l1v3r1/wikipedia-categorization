Ḥamdallāh Mustawfī Qazvīnī (1281–1349; Persian: حمدالله مستوفى قزوینی‬‎) was a Persian    historian, geographer and epic poet of Arab ancestry.  His tomb at Qazvinis surmounted by a turquoise blue conical dome. In his History of Tabriz, Mustawfi writes that the people of Tabriz had spoken Pahalavi Persian before the arrival of the Mongols but that during Illkhanate rule they had adopted Adhari Turkish. He mentions further that the people of Maragha, Zanjan and Ardabil had had their own Persian dialects. Verily God hath preferred amongst His creatures of the Arabs the Quraysh, and among the Persians the men of Fars : for which reason the people of this province . . . were known as ' the Best of the Persians.
