This is a List of places visited by Ibn Battuta in the years 1325-1353. The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta set out from his native town of Tangiers on a pilgrimage to Mecca in June 1325, when he was 21 years old. On completing his first hajj he continued travelling, only returning to Morocco twenty four years later in 1349. In 1350, Battuta visited Al-Andalus and then between 1352-1353 he crossed the Sahara Desert to visit the Kingdom of Mali in West Africa. On his return to Fes he dictated an account of his travels to Ibn Juzayy, a scribe employed by Abu Inan Faris, the Marinid ruler of Morocco.  Ibn Juzayy's Arabic text was translated into English by Hamilton Gibb and Charles Beckingham and published by the Hakluyt Society in four volumes between 1958 and 1994.  Over his lifetime, Ibn Battuta travelled over 73,000 miles (117,000Â km) and visited around 40 present-day countries.  In the following list the Romanization used by Gibb and Beckingham is given in parentheses. The states are modern. Within each section the towns are listed in the order that they are first mentioned in Ibn Battuta's rihla. Historians such as Hamilton Gibb and Ross Dunn have argued that some parts of Ibn Battuta's rihla are fictional and it is extremely unlikely that he visited all the places that he claimed. The cities for which Ibn Battuta's visit is believed to be fictional are flagged as "doubtful" in the list below.
