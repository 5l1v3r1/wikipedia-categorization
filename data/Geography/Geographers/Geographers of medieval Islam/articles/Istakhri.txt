Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Farisi al-Istakhri (آبو إسحاق إبراهيم بن محمد الفارسي الإصطخري) (also Estakhri, Persian: استخری‎, i.e. from the Iranian city of Istakhr, b. - d. 957 AD [346AH] ) was a Persian medieval geographer in medieval Islam and traveler of the 10th century. Estakhri created the earliest known account of windmills. His Arabic language works included masalik al-mamalik (مسالك الممالك, "Traditions of Countries") and Suwar al-Aqaaleem ( صور الاقاليم, "Shapes of the Climates"). He was a traveller whose geographical work has been translated into German by Mordtmann. When Istakhari was in the Indus Valley he met another celebrated traveller, Ibn Haukul.
