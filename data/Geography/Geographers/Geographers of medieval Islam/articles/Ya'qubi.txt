Ahmad ibn Abu Ya'qub ibn Ja'far ibn Wahb Ibn Wadih al-Ya'qubi (died 897/8), known as Ahmad al-Ya'qubi, or Ya'qubi (Arabic: اليعقوبي‎), was a Muslim geographer  and perhaps the first historian of world culture in the Abbasid Caliphate.  He was a great-grandson of Wadih, the freedman of the caliph Al-Mansur. Until 873 he lived in Armenia and Khorasan, working under the patronage of the Iranian dynasty of the Tahirids; then he traveled to India, Egypt and the Maghreb,  and died in Egypt. He died in AH 284 (897/8).  His Shia sympathies are found throughout his works.  In 872, he lists the kingdoms of Bilad el-Sudan, including Ghana, Gao, and Kanem.
