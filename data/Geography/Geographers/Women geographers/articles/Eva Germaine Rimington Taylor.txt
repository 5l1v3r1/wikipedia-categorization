Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor (1879â€“1966) was an English geographer and historian of science, the first woman to hold an academic chair of geography in the United Kingdom.  Taylor was educated at the Camden School for Girls, the North London Collegiate School, and Royal Holloway College. In 1903 she obtained a first class BSc in chemistry from the University of London. While teaching chemistry she studied at the University of Oxford and from 1908 to 1910 acted as research assistant to A. J. Herbertson, head of the Oxford Geography School. She wrote school geography textbooks in collaboration with J. F. Unstead, and lectured at Clapham Training College for Teachers, the Froebel Institute, the East London College (later Queen Mary College), and Birkbeck College. Gaining a DSc in geography from the University of London in 1929, she was appointed professor of geography in 1930, and held the post until 1944.
