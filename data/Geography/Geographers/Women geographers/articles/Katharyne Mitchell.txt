Katharyne Mitchell (born 20 February 1961) is an American geographer who is currently Professor of Sociology and Dean of the Social Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Mitchell grew up in Boston, Massachusetts and graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. in Art and Archaeology. She received her M.A. and Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Berkeley under the direction of Allan Pred. Mitchell was previously Professor of Geography at the University of Washington, and held the inaugural position as Simpson Professor of the Public Humanities from 2004–2007.  She was a visiting professor at St. Catherine’s College and Hertford College at the University of Oxford in 2000–2001. Mitchell currently serves on the editorial boards of Annals of the AAG, Cultural Geographies, Fennia, Global Networks, and Urban Geography. The recipient of Guggenheim  and Brocher Foundation  fellowships, Mitchell’s research spans several categories including migration, citizenship, critical race theory, transnationalism, urban political geography, critical humanitarian studies, education, and geographies of religion. Her current research examines the spaces of migration, faith and sanctuary in the context of the current refugee situation in Europe.  She has also written on celebrity humanitarianism and philanthropy in the context of late neoliberalism, including publications on the Gates Foundation  and Bono’s ONE campaign.  Mitchell’s 2004 book, Crossing the Neoliberal Line: Pacific Rim Migration and the Metropolis, is regarded as “an important contribution to urban and transnational studies.”  Her 2008 edited volume, Practising Public Scholarship: Experiences and Possibilities Beyond the Academy, brings together work from scholars such as Terry Eagleton, Howard Zinn, Doreen Massey, Michael Burawoy, and Don Mitchell,  and has been called “one of the best books on what it really means to be a public intellectual.”
