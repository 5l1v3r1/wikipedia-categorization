Sally Eden (1967–2016) was a British geographer and Professor of Human geography at the University of Hull. Sally Eden’s research and writing focuses on important and significant questions about how society understands and manages the environment, including issues of sustainable consumption, green lifestyles, environmental action and forms of public engagement with the environment. In a series of research projects she examined how scientific knowledge about the environment is used within and outside of government, how river restoration projects are designed and justified and how ordinary people get involved with and make sense of how environments are managed.  In her writing she has developed carefully critical lines of analysis and argument drawing on concepts from human geography but also science and technology studies and environmental politics. Much of her work has been drawn together in the book ‘Environmental Publics’ (Routledge 2017) which from the starting point that ‘the public’ is not one thing and their engagements with the environment take multiple forms, provides a fascinating account of how environmental publics know, participate, consume, enjoy, campaign, vote and work.
