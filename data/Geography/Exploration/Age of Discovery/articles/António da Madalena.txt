He was born in Coimbra and lived in the Alcobaça Monastery from 1575 to 1579. He travelled to Goa in 1580, to establish a library for his order. In 1583 he travelled overland to what is today Cambodia, where in 1586 he was the first Western visitor to Angkor. In 1589, gave an account of his impressions to the historian Diogo do Couto before being killed in a shipwreck off Natal. He attempted to aid in a reconstruction effort of Angkor, but the project was unsuccessful.
