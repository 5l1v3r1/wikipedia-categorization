Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. The first guns on ships were small wrought-iron pieces mounted on the open decks and in the <a href=\"/wiki/Fighting_top\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fighting top\">fighting tops</a>, often requiring only one or two men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, shock and frighten the enemy prior to boarding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As guns were made more durable to withstand stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical damage to the vessel rather than just its crew. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, they had to be placed lower in the ships, and fire from <a href=\"/wiki/Gunport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gunport\">gunports</a>, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with <a href=\"/wiki/Clinker_(boat_building)\" title=\"Clinker (boat building)\">clinker</a> planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of <a href=\"/wiki/Carvel_(boat_building)\" title=\"Carvel (boat building)\">carvel</a>-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The development of propulsion during the 15th century from single-masted, square-rigged <a href=\"/wiki/Cog_(ship)\" title=\"Cog (ship)\">cogs</a> to three-masted <a href=\"/wiki/Carrack\" title=\"Carrack\">carracks</a> with a mix of square and <a href=\"/wiki/Lateen\" title=\"Lateen\">lateen</a> sails made ships nimbler and easier to manoeuvre.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501. According to tradition the inventor was a Breton shipwright called Descharges, but it is just as likely to have been a gradual adaptation of loading ports in the stern of merchant vessels that had already been in use for centuries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Initially, the gunports were used to mount heavy so-called stern chasers pointing aft, but soon gun ports migrated to the sides of ships. This made possible coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, <a href=\"/wiki/Broadside\" title=\"Broadside\">broadsides</a>, for the first time in history, at least in theory. Guns in the 16th century were considered to be in fixed positions and were intended to be fired independently rather than in concerted volleys. It was not until the 1590s that the word \"broadside\" in English was commonly used to refer to gunfire from the side of a ship rather than the ship's side itself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century, however, was focused on countering the oar-powered <a href=\"/wiki/Galley\" title=\"Galley\">galleys</a> that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Though far less seaworthy than sailing vessels and highly vulnerable to boarding by ships that rode higher in the water, the galleys were a serious threat due to their ability to aim accurate heavy gunfire low in the hulls of larger sailing ships and to escape solely sail-powered opponents by rowing into the wind.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Initial_tactics\">Initial tactics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Initial tactics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Line_of_battle\" title=\"Line of battle\">line of battle</a> tactic that allowed efficient use of broadside fire was not put into general use until the mid 17th century, as was described by English General at Sea <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Blake_(admiral)\" title=\"Robert Blake (admiral)\">Robert Blake</a> in his Laws of War and Ordinances of the sea. The previous solution was to make sailing ships fire backwards from the stern, as a defensive measure, or forward from the bow, as an offensive measure. The latter was only partially achieved either by canting (angling) the side guns towards the bow or stern as far as the ship's structure would allow, or to place guns on the <a href=\"/wiki/Sterncastle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sterncastle\">sterncastle</a> and fire them in an arc on either side of the forecastle. Both solutions were problematic since they created a blind spot dead ahead and made it especially difficult to hit low-lying targets, like galleys. The method that was deemed most effective by contemporaries was to simply counter the threat of galleys with other galleys.\n</p><p>Despite the technical innovations, naval <a href=\"/wiki/Cannon\" title=\"Cannon\">cannon</a> fire also remained grossly inaccurate except at very close ranges. Difficulties in achieving standardization in <a href=\"/wiki/Metallurgy\" title=\"Metallurgy\">metallurgy</a> meant that all guns allowed for considerable \"windage\", meaning that bore diameters were about 10 percent larger than their ammunition. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms meant that naval tactics for sailing ships throughout the 16th century remained focused on boarding as a means of decisive victory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Naval tactics in the <a href=\"/wiki/Age_of_Sail\" title=\"Age of Sail\">Age of Sail</a> were primarily determined by the <a href=\"/wiki/Sailing_ship\" title=\"Sailing ship\">sailing</a> and fighting qualities of the sailing <a href=\"/wiki/Warship\" title=\"Warship\">warships</a> of the time. Three factors, in particular, constrained what a sailing <a href=\"/wiki/Admiral\" title=\"Admiral\">admiral</a> could order his fleet to do. \n</p>\n<ul><li>The first constraint was that, like all sailing vessels, sailing warships could not sail directly into the <a href=\"/wiki/Wind\" title=\"Wind\">wind</a>. Most could sail not much closer than 70 degrees off the wind. This limited the maneuverability of a fleet during battles at close quarters. Holding the <a href=\"/wiki/Naval_tactics_in_the_Age_of_Sail#Importance_of_the_weather_gage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Naval tactics in the Age of Sail\">weather gage</a>, i.e. being upwind of one's opponent, conferred considerable tactical advantages.</li>\n<li>The second constraint was that the ships of the time carried their guns in two large batteries, one on each broadside, with only a few mounted to fire directly ahead or <a href=\"/wiki/Astern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Astern\">astern</a>. The sailing warship was immensely powerful on its sides, but very weak on its <a href=\"/wiki/Bow_(ship)\" title=\"Bow (ship)\">bow</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Stern\" title=\"Stern\">stern</a>. The sides of the ship were built with strong <a href=\"/wiki/Timber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Timber\">timbers</a>, but the stern, in particular, was fragile with a flimsy structure around the large windows of the officers' cabins. The bow and, particularly, the stern of the ship were vulnerable to <a href=\"/wiki/Raking_fire\" title=\"Raking fire\">raking fire</a>. Raking another ship by firing the length of a ship from either the bow or stern caused tremendous damage, because a single shot would fly down the length of the <a href=\"/wiki/Deck_(ship)\" title=\"Deck (ship)\">decks</a>, while the ship being raked could not return fire with its broadsides. Moreover, the externally-mounted rudder was at the stern, and any hit there would render the ship essentially unsteerable and without the ability to maneuver, even with masts and sails intact.</li>\n<li>The third constraint was the difficulty of communicating at sea. Written communication was almost impossible in a moving fleet, while hailing was extremely difficult above the noise of wind and weather. So admirals were forced to rely on a pre-arranged set of <a href=\"/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags\" title=\"International maritime signal flags\">signal flags</a> hoisted aboard the admiral's <a href=\"/wiki/Flagship\" title=\"Flagship\">flagship</a>. In the smoke of battle, these were often hard or impossible to see.</li></ul>\n<p>The 16th century saw the development of the <a href=\"/wiki/Man-of-war\" title=\"Man-of-war\">man-of-war</a>, a truly ocean-going warship, carrying <a href=\"/wiki/Square-rigged\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Square-rigged\">square-rigged</a> sails that permitted tacking into the wind, and heavily armed with <a href=\"/wiki/Cannon\" title=\"Cannon\">cannons</a>. The adoption of heavy guns necessitated their being mounted lower down than on top of the fore and after castles as previously where anti-personnel weapons had been positioned through the later Middle Ages, due to the possibility of <a href=\"/wiki/Capsize\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Capsize\">capsizing</a>. This meant that what had earlier been the hold of a ship that could be used either as a merchant ship or warship was now full with cannon and ammunition. Hence ships became specialised as warships, which would lead to a standing fleet instead of one based on placing temporary contracts.\n</p><p>The man-of-war eventually rendered the galley obsolete except for operations close to shore in calm weather. With the development of the sailing man-of-war, and the beginning of the great sailing fleets capable of keeping at sea for long periods together, came the need for a new adaptation of old principles of <a href=\"/wiki/Naval_tactics\" title=\"Naval tactics\">naval tactics</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A ship that depended on the wind for its motive power could not hope to ram. A sailing vessel could not ram unless it was running before a good breeze. In a light wind, the charge would be ineffective, and it could not be made at all from <a href=\"/wiki/Leeward\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leeward\">leeward</a>. It could still board, and the Spanish did for long make it their main object to run their bow over an enemy's sides, and invade the deck. In order to carry out this kind of attack they would naturally try to get to <a href=\"/wiki/Windward\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Windward\">windward</a> and then bear down before the wind in line abreast ship upon ship. But an opponent to leeward could always baffle this attack by edging away, and in the meantime fire with his broadside to cripple his opponent's <a href=\"/wiki/Spar_(sailing)\" title=\"Spar (sailing)\">spars</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An important organizational innovation was made by <a href=\"/wiki/Francis_Drake\" title=\"Francis Drake\">Sir Francis Drake</a>. Prior to his leadership, a warship was typically run by a committee of the <a href=\"/wiki/Sailing_master\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sailing master\">sailing master</a>, navigator, master-gunner and captain of marines presided over by an aristocrat. Drake saw no purpose in having a member of the aristocracy without specialist knowledge and established the principle that the captain of the ship would be in sole command, based upon his skill and experience rather than social position. This transformation was never quite made in the <a href=\"/wiki/Spanish_Navy\" title=\"Spanish Navy\">Spanish Navy</a> where the \"gentlemen\" continued to obstruct operations throughout the Age of Sail.\n</p><p>The Revolutionary French Navy made an opposite mistake in promoting seamen without sufficient experience or training, which worked well in the army, but not at sea. The Royal Navy by contrast was well served by many distinguished commanders of middle-class origin, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Horatio_Nelson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Horatio Nelson\">Horatio Nelson</a> (son of a parson), <a href=\"/wiki/John_Jervis,_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent\" title=\"John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent\">Jervis</a> (son of a solicitor) or <a href=\"/wiki/Cuthbert_Collingwood,_1st_Baron_Collingwood\" title=\"Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood\">Collingwood</a> (son of a butcher) as well as by aristocrats who proved themselves at sea such as <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Cochrane,_10th_Earl_of_Dundonald\" title=\"Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald\">Thomas Cochrane</a> and even members of the working-class, such as <a href=\"/wiki/John_Benbow\" title=\"John Benbow\">John Benbow</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Line_of_battle\">Line of battle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Line of battle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Line_of_battle\" title=\"Line of battle\">Line of battle</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Abraham_Willaerts,_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Abraham_Willaerts%2C_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg/220px-Abraham_Willaerts%2C_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg\" width=\"220\" height=\"139\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Abraham_Willaerts%2C_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg/330px-Abraham_Willaerts%2C_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Abraham_Willaerts%2C_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg/440px-Abraham_Willaerts%2C_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"700\" data-file-height=\"441\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Abraham_Willaerts,_Galley_and_men_of_war.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>A French <a href=\"/wiki/Galley\" title=\"Galley\">galley</a> and Dutch man-of-war off a port</i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Abraham_Willaerts\" title=\"Abraham Willaerts\">Abraham Willaerts</a>, painted 17th century.</div></div></div>\n<p>The first recorded mention of the use of a <i>line of battle</i> tactic is attested from 1500. The <i>Instructions</i> provided in 1500 by King <a href=\"/wiki/Manuel_I_of_Portugal\" title=\"Manuel I of Portugal\">Manuel I of Portugal</a> to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, <i>The Art of War at Sea</i>, Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, <a href=\"/wiki/Fern%C3%A3o_de_Oliveira\" title=\"Fern\u00e3o de Oliveira\">Fern\u00e3o de Oliveira</a>, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese \"fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...\". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An early line of battle tactic had been used by the <a href=\"/wiki/4th_Portuguese_India_Armada_(Gama,_1502)\" title=\"4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)\">Fourth Portuguese India Armada</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Calicut_(1502)\" title=\"Battle of Calicut (1502)\">battle of Calicut</a>, under <a href=\"/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama\" title=\"Vasco da Gama\">Vasco da Gama</a> in 1502, near <a href=\"/wiki/Zamorin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Zamorin\">Malabar</a>, against a Muslim fleet.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> One of the earliest recorded deliberate use is also documented in the <a href=\"/wiki/First_Battle_of_Cannanore\" title=\"First Battle of Cannanore\">First Battle of Cannanore</a> between the <a href=\"/wiki/3rd_Portuguese_India_Armada_(Nova,_1501)\" title=\"3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)\">Third Portuguese India Armada</a> under <a href=\"/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_da_Nova\" title=\"Jo\u00e3o da Nova\">Jo\u00e3o da Nova</a> and the naval forces of <a href=\"/wiki/Kozhikode\" title=\"Kozhikode\">Calicut</a>, earlier in the same year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> This early use of this strategy also consisted in its implementation, in both battles, on only one side of the contenders.\n</p><p>The evolution of naval <a href=\"/wiki/Cannon\" title=\"Cannon\">cannons</a> during the first half of the 17th century soon led to the conclusion that the fleet had to fight in a single line to make the maximum use of its firepower without one ship getting in the way of another.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Line_of_battle\" title=\"Line of battle\">line of battle</a> was traditionally attributed to the <a href=\"/wiki/Navy\" title=\"Navy\">navy</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England\" title=\"Commonwealth of England\">Commonwealth of England</a> and especially to General at Sea <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Blake_(admiral)\" title=\"Robert Blake (admiral)\">Robert Blake</a> who wrote the <i>Sailing and Fighting Instructions</i> of 1653. One of the first documented deliberate use seems to be somewhat earlier in the <a href=\"/wiki/Action_of_18_September_1639\" title=\"Action of 18 September 1639\">Action of 18 September 1639</a> by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral <a href=\"/wiki/Maarten_Tromp\" title=\"Maarten Tromp\">Maarten Tromp</a> against the Spanish. The tactic was used by both sides in the <a href=\"/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars\" title=\"Anglo-Dutch Wars\">Anglo-Dutch Wars</a>, and was codified in written 'fighting instructions'. These formed the basis of the whole tactical system of the 17th and 18th centuries in naval warfare.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_7-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One consequence of the line of battle was that a ship had to be strong enough to stand in it. In the old type of m\u00eal\u00e9e battle a small ship could seek out an opponent of her own size, or combine with others to attack a larger one. As the <a href=\"/wiki/Line_of_battle\" title=\"Line of battle\">line of battle</a> was adopted, navies began to distinguish between vessels that were fit to form parts of the line in action, and the smaller ships that were not. By the time the line of battle was firmly established as the standard tactical formation during the 1660s, <a href=\"/wiki/Merchant_ship\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Merchant ship\">merchant ships</a> and lightly armed warships became less able to sustain their place in a pitched battle. In the line of battle, each ship had to stand and fight the opposing ship in the enemy line, however powerful she might be. The purpose-built ships powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a <a href=\"/wiki/Ship_of_the_line\" title=\"Ship of the line\">ship of the line</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Importance_of_the_weather_gage\">Importance of the weather gage</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Importance of the weather gage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Holding the weather, or windward, gage conferred several important tactical advantages. The admiral holding the <a href=\"/wiki/Weather_gage\" title=\"Weather gage\">weather gage</a> held the tactical initiative, able to accept battle by bearing down on his opponent or to refuse it, by remaining upwind. The fleet with the lee gage could avoid battle by withdrawing to leeward, but could not force action. Even retreating downwind could be difficult once two fleets were at close quarters because the ships risked being raked as they turned downwind. A second disadvantage of the leeward gage was that in anything more than a light wind, a sailing ship that is sailing close hauled (or beating) will heel to leeward under the pressure of the wind on its sails. The ships of a fleet on the leeward gage heel away from their opponents, exposing part of their bottoms to shot. If a ship is penetrated in an area of the hull that is normally under water, she is then in danger of taking on water or even sinking when on the other tack. This is known as \"hulled between wind and water\". Finally, smoke from the gunfire of the ships to windward would blow down on the fleet on the leeward gage. So it was common for battles to involve days of manoeuvring as one admiral strove to take the weather gage from his opponent in order to force him to action, as at the battles of <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Ushant_(1778)\" title=\"Battle of Ushant (1778)\">Ushant</a> (1778), St Lucia Channel (1780) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Glorious_First_of_June\" title=\"Glorious First of June\">First of June</a> (1794).\n</p><p>Only in heavy weather could the windward gage become a disadvantage, because the lower gun ports on the leeward side of a ship would be awash, preventing her from opening her lower-deck ports to use the guns \u2013 or risking being swamped if she did. So, in strong winds, a ship attacking from windward would not be able to bring her heavy lower-deck guns into action, while the enemy ship to leeward would have no such problem as the guns on her windward side would be raised by the heel. For this reason, Admiral <a href=\"/wiki/George_Brydges_Rodney,_1st_Baron_Rodney\" title=\"George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney\">Rodney</a> ordered his ships to attack the Spanish from leeward in the stormy weather at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_St._Vincent_(1780)\" title=\"Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)\">Battle of Cape St. Vincent</a> in 1780.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development_of_tactics_in_the_French_Navy\">Development of tactics in the French Navy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Development of tactics in the French Navy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Navy\" title=\"French Navy\">French Navy</a>, sailing tactics were developed by the treatises of the French tacticians Paul Hoste, <a href=\"/wiki/Bigot_de_Morogues\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bigot de Morogues\">Bigot de Morogues</a> and Bourde de Villehuet, which developed the traditional code of practice and were all translated into other languages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_7-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> \nDuring the 18th century, French governments developed the strategic doctrine of focusing on the mission, rather than fighting for command of the sea. The French government was often reluctant to take tactical risks to achieve its strategic objectives. The navy was hampered by the timidity of its orders. French fleets and squadrons typically sought to avoid battle rather than risk a contest with a British force, as De Ternay did in June 1780 on meeting a smaller British squadron under <a href=\"/wiki/William_Cornwallis\" title=\"William Cornwallis\">Cornwallis</a> off <a href=\"/wiki/Bermuda\" title=\"Bermuda\">Bermuda</a>.\nThis strategy had important tactical ramifications. French ships tended to fire at the rigging of their opponents to disable them and allow the French ships to escape and continue with their mission. French ships typically fired their broadsides on the upward roll of the ship, disabling their opponents but doing little damage to the enemy ships or their crews. This was compounded by the French tendency to fight from the leeward gage, causing the guns to point high as the ships heeled with the wind. British and Dutch ships, by contrast, tended to use the opposite tactic of firing on the downward roll into the enemy hulls, causing a storm of flying splinters that killed and maimed the enemy gun crews. This difference in tactics goes some way to explaining the difference in casualty figures between British and French crews, with French fleets tending to suffer not only more casualties but also a higher proportion of killed than wounded.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tactical_stagnation_in_the_mid-18th_century\">Tactical stagnation in the mid-18th century</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Tactical stagnation in the mid-18th century\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>When the conflict came to be between the British and the French in the 18th century, battles between equal or approximately equal forces became largely inconclusive. The French, who had fewer ships than the British throughout the century, were anxious to fight at the least possible cost, lest their fleet should be worn out by severe action, leaving Britain with an unreachable numerical superiority. Therefore, they preferred to engage to leeward, a position which left them free to retreat before the wind. They allowed the British fleet to get to windward, and, when it was parallel with them and bore up before the wind to attack, they moved onwards. The attacking fleet had then to advance, not directly before the wind with its ships moving along lines perpendicular to the line attacked, but in slanting or curving lines. The assailants would be thrown into \"a bow and quarter line\" \u2013 with the bow of the second level with the after part of the first and so on from end to end. In the case of a number of ships of various powers of sailing, it was a difficult formation to maintain.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_7-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The result was often that the ships of the attacking line which were steering to attack the enemy's centre came into action first and were liable to be crippled in the rigging. If the same formation was to be maintained, the others were now limited to the speed of the injured vessels, and the enemy to leeward slipped away. At all times a fleet advancing from windward was liable to injury in spars, even if the leeward fleet did not deliberately aim at them. The leeward ships would be leaning away from the wind, and their shot would always have a tendency to fly high. So long as the assailant remained to windward, the ships to leeward could always slip off.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_7-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The wars of the 18th century produced a series of tactically indecisive naval battles between evenly matched fleets in line ahead, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_M%C3%A1laga_(1704)\" title=\"Battle of M\u00e1laga (1704)\">M\u00e1laga</a> (1704), <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_R%C3%BCgen_Island&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Battle of R\u00fcgen Island (page does not exist)\">R\u00fcgen Island</a> (1715), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Toulon_(1744)\" title=\"Battle of Toulon (1744)\">Toulon</a> (1744), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Minorca_(1756)\" title=\"Battle of Minorca (1756)\">Minorca</a> (1756), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Negapatam_(1758)\" title=\"Battle of Negapatam (1758)\">Negapatam</a> (1758), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Cuddalore_(1758)\" title=\"Battle of Cuddalore (1758)\">Cuddalore</a> (1758), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Pondicherry\" title=\"Battle of Pondicherry\">Pondicherry</a> (1759), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Ushant_(1778)\" title=\"Battle of Ushant (1778)\">Ushant</a> (1778), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Dogger_Bank_(1781)\" title=\"Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)\">Dogger Bank</a> (1781), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake\" title=\"Battle of the Chesapeake\">the Chesapeake</a> (1781), <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Hogland\" title=\"Battle of Hogland\">Hogland</a> (1788) and <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_%C3%96land_(1789)\" title=\"Battle of \u00d6land (1789)\">\u00d6land</a> (1789).

These innovations were:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>The <a href=\"/wiki/Carronade\" title=\"Carronade\">carronade</a></b>: the carronade was a short-barrelled gun which threw a heavy ball developed by the <a href=\"/wiki/Carron_Company\" title=\"Carron Company\">Carron Company</a>, a Scottish ironworks, in 1778. Because of irregularities in the size of cannonballs and the difficulty of boring out gun barrels there was usually a considerable gap between the ball and the bore - often as much as a quarter of an inch - with a consequent loss of efficiency. This gap was known as the \"windage\". The manufacturing practices introduced by the Carron Company reduced the windage considerably, enabling the ball to be fired with less powder and hence a smaller and lighter gun. The carronade was half the weight of an equivalent long gun, but could throw a heavy ball over a limited distance. The light weight of the carronade meant that the guns could be added to the forecastle and quarterdeck of frigates and ships of the line, increasing firepower without affecting the ship's sailing qualities. It became known as the \u201csmasher\u201d and gave ships armed with carronades a great advantage at short range.</li>\n<li><b>The <a href=\"/wiki/Flintlock\" title=\"Flintlock\">flintlock</a></b>: flintlock firing mechanisms for cannon were suggested by Captain Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Douglas_(admiral)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charles Douglas (admiral)\">Charles Douglas</a> and introduced during the American War of Independence in place of the traditional matches. Flintlocks enabled a higher rate of fire and greater accuracy as the gun captain could choose the exact moment of firing. Prior to this the Royal Navy introduced the use of goose quills filled with powder during the <a href=\"/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\" title=\"Seven Years&#39; War\">Seven Years' War</a> giving an almost instantaneous burn time compared with earlier methods of detonation.</li>\n<li><b>A wider field of fire</b>: by the simple expedient of attaching the gun ropes at a greater distance from the gunports, the British gunnery innovator Captain Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Douglas_(admiral)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Charles Douglas (admiral)\">Charles Douglas</a> increased the range through which each cannon could be traversed, increasing the ship's field of fire. The new system was first tested at the Battle of the Saintes, in 1782, where the <i>Duke</i>, <i>Formidable</i> and <i>Arrogant</i>, and perhaps other British ships, had adopted Douglas's new system.</li>\n<li><b>Copper sheathing</b>: after many trials, <a href=\"/wiki/Copper\" title=\"Copper\">copper</a> was found to be a practicable means of protecting the hulls of ships from <a href=\"/wiki/Barnacle\" title=\"Barnacle\">marine growth</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Biofouling\" title=\"Biofouling\">fouling</a>. Copper sheathing delayed the growth of weeds on the hull, improving the sailing performance of ships that had been long out of dock. This had significant strategic as well as tactical implications. Up to 1780, the British, who kept their ships at sea for longer periods had almost always found that the clean French ships were faster and could therefore avoid battle if they wished. The introduction of copper sheathing meant that ships that had spent months on blockade were not necessarily at an immediate speed disadvantage to enemy ships coming freshly out of port.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Developments_during_the_French_Revolutionary_and_Napoleonic_Wars\">Developments during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Developments during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>By the outbreak of the <a href=\"/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars\" title=\"French Revolutionary Wars\">French Revolutionary Wars</a> in 1793, technical innovations and the disorganization of the French Navy wrought by the revolution had combined to give British ships a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies.

Throughout the 18th century the French and, particularly, the Spanish navy suffered from serious manning difficulties and were often forced to complete the ships' crews with soldiers or landsmen.\n</p><p>British ships not only had a higher proportion of seamen in the first place, but the long months at sea on <a href=\"/wiki/Blockade\" title=\"Blockade\">blockade</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Convoy\" title=\"Convoy\">convoy</a> escort gave British captains plenty of opportunities to train their crews. British gun crews seem to have achieved a much higher rate of fire than French or Spanish gun crews, contributing to the much higher casualties suffered by ships from those fleets. The better seamanship, faster gunnery and higher morale of British crews was a decisive advantage that could not be compensated for by any amount of bravery on the part of their opponents.\n</p><p>The leading British admirals like <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Howe,_1st_Earl_Howe\" title=\"Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe\">Howe</a> devoted their thoughts to how to break the enemy's line in order to bring on the kind of pell mell battle that would bring decisive results.

It should be borne in mind that a vessel, while bearing down on an enemy's line, could not be exposed to the fire of three enemies at once when at a distance less than 950 yards, because the guns could not be trained to converge on a nearer point.

If properly prepared, the ships would have \"springs\"; extra cables bound to the anchor cables, which they could haul in or let out to veer the ship to bring its guns to bear over a wide arc. If close to a naval establishment (such as at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen_(1801)\" title=\"Battle of Copenhagen (1801)\">Battle of Copenhagen</a>), they could rely on boats from the shore to bring extra ammunition or replacements for casualties and if in range the defending ships could be aided by coastal gun batteries.  The worst British naval reverse of the Napoleonic wars occurred during an attack on a protected anchorage at the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Grand_Port\" title=\"Battle of Grand Port\">Battle of Grand Port</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Naval_tactics\" title=\"Naval tactics\">Naval tactics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Naval_strategy\" title=\"Naval strategy\">Naval strategy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Ship_of_the_line\" title=\"Ship of the line\">Ship of the line</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Naval_artillery_in_the_Age_of_Sail\" title=\"Naval artillery in the Age of Sail\">Naval artillery in the Age of Sail</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Naval_operations_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War\">Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sailing_ship_tactics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rodger (1997), pp. 205\u20136 .</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Marsden (2003), pp. 137\u2013142.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rodger (1997), pp. 71\u201372 .</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rodger (1997), p. 207.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rodger (1996), pp. 312, 316.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rodger (1996); Rodger (1997), pp. 206\u20138, 215.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-EB1911-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-6\"><sup><i><b>g</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-7\"><sup><i><b>h</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-8\"><sup><i><b>i</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-9\"><sup><i><b>j</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-10\"><sup><i><b>k</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-11\"><sup><i><b>l</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-EB1911_7-12\"><sup><i><b>m</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\" width=\"12\" height=\"13\" class=\"noviewer\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/18px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/24px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"410\" data-file-height=\"430\" />&#160;One or more of the preceding sentences&#160;incorporates text from a publication now in the <a href=\"/wiki/Public_domain\" title=\"Public domain\">public domain</a>:&#160;<cite id=\"CITEREFHannay1911\" class=\"citation encyclopaedia\">Hannay, David (1911). \"<a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Navy\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikisource:1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Navy\">Navy</a>\".
