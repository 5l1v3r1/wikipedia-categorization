  Crane climbing is the act, usually illicit, of climbing a crane. It is a worldwide phenomenon that was said to be growing in popularity in the mid-2010s, in a category with the illicit climbing of skyscrapers and tall monuments.   Canada's York Regional Police view crane climbers as thrill seekers influenced by the popularity of crane climbing video on YouTube, and warns that in addition to putting themselves at risk, crane climbers put the lives of first responders at risk.  Crane climbers are routinely arrested and charged.
