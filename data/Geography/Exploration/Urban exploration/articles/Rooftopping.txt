Rooftopping sometimes called roofing refers to the unsecured ascent of rooftops, cranes, antennas, smokestacks, etc., usually illegally, and for the purpose of getting an adrenaline rush  and taking selfie photos or videos and panoramic photographs  of the scene below.  It is chiefly an undertaking of millennials  seeking social-media exposure, and has been especially popular in Russia.  It is generally accomplished by clandestine access to off-limits staircases, roof hatches, ladders, etc., and incorporates some aspects of buildering. It is understood as an offshoot development of urban exploring, but is not universally condoned among urban explorers due to its high risk taking for intense photography. Because it is often practiced in the pursuit of viral-ready videos and selfies, it tends to bring attention to urban exploring that can result in heightened security and greater restriction against access to desirable exploration venues.  Rooftoppers often use head-cams such as GoPro or other helmet cameras for videos.     Some also use quadcopter drones for exploration and recording.
