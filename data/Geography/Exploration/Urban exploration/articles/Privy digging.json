From a conventional academic perspective, it is assumed that all privies contain vital and unique information which cannot be found elsewhere and that a costly forensic approach is required.  Privy diggers who are not professional archaeologists are labeled \u201clooters\u201d, even while working on sites which are in the process of being destroyed or have already been examined and worked by archaeologists.<sup id=\"cite_ref-jordan_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jordan-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  While both parties are engaging in similar activities, each is confronted with very different logistics, constraints, and unique opportunities for genuine discovery.\n</p><p>US academics responding to the threat of privy digging, dump digging, metal detecting, and so on have helped create laws protecting objects of a certain age, usually only 50\u2013100 years old, from exploitation by opportunistic looters and other thieves that disturb historic context in pursuit of treasure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  Laws intended to safeguard legitimate national and cultural treasures are applied to any item found while digging.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Privies\">Privies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Privy_digging&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Privies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Privies can be constructed of stone, brick, or wood and vary considerably from place to place.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Dantwell_&amp;_diZerega_Wall_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Dantwell_&amp;_diZerega_Wall-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  Some privy vaults are less than 2 feet deep and others are more than 25 feet.  They can be as narrow as 2 feet or as wide as 10 feet, particularly in urban settings where a large privy shed with multiple doors and inner compartments once stood.  Some vaults are cylindrical, these are usually made of stone or brick.  Though there are cylindrical privies that are actual wooden barrels placed in the ground.  Others are rectangular and commonly made of stone, brick, or wood.  Many shallower rectangular vaults were only wood-lined.\n</p><p>Many privies were cleaned out periodically (\u201cdipped\u201d). This routine process addressed the growing concern for foul odors and airborne illnesses which was prevalent at the time.  Dipping also provided some of the necessary organic material for the fertilizer industry. Around the time that modern plumbing was installed, many were cleaned out and backfilled with newer material. These dipped vaults do not have an undisturbed night soil layer and the probability of one containing anything of major archaeological importance is extremely low.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sites\">Sites</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Privy_digging&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Sites\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Woodlined_privy.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Woodlined_privy.jpg/300px-Woodlined_privy.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Woodlined_privy.jpg/450px-Woodlined_privy.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Woodlined_privy.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"451\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Woodlined_privy.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Excavating a small wood-lined privy located behind a residence which was built around 1876.</div></div></div>\n<p>Most privies are located behind the building or buildings which they served.

It is assumed that these particular vaults were incorporated into a neighboring lot or perhaps placed within the structure itself somewhere, possibly the basement.  Some insurance maps show outbuildings and sheds, and occasionally privy outlines too.  For example, 19th century insurance maps for New York City generally do not have markings indicating privy placements and some for New Jersey do. However, when researching the latter, privy diggers find no evidence that a privy ever existed where the map outline indicates one should be.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Probing.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Probing.jpg/300px-Probing.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Probing.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"400\" data-file-height=\"326\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Probing.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Investigating a barren wood-lined privy (ca. 1840).</div></div></div>\n<p>Some privy diggers also research excavation sites where old houses and other buildings, such as factories, saloons, and hotels once were.

The basic probe is made of <a href=\"/wiki/Spring_steel\" title=\"Spring steel\">spring steel</a> and between 4\u2019 and 6\u2019 feet in length.  Many variations exist and each locale being probed has its own peculiarities regarding which equipment and what techniques should be applied.  Adept privy diggers develop considerable skill interpreting the faint residues which come up on the end of a probe and the subtle noise variations encountered while sliding it in and out of the ground.<sup id=\"cite_ref-brater_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-brater-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Test digging involves making a small hole, and going down a few feet, to determine that a probe reading is accurate.  Once something other than dirt and rocks are being encountered and man-made objects are buried deeply in a particular spot, the outline of the privy is carefully excavated.  This can take hours or days depending on its size and the materials being dug through.  Dug dirt or \u201cfluff\u201d as it is sometimes called, is systematically removed from the hole by shoveling.  Deeper holes require a rope and bucket setup and sometimes a tripod mechanism to assist with the removal of material.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Privy_maintenance_and_garbage_disposal\">Privy maintenance and garbage disposal</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Privy_digging&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Privy maintenance and garbage disposal\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bricklined_privy.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Bricklined_privy.jpg/300px-Bricklined_privy.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Bricklined_privy.jpg/450px-Bricklined_privy.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Bricklined_privy.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"433\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Bricklined_privy.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Near the bottom of a brick-lined urban privy awaiting demolition (ca. 1855).

This is commonly referred to as \u201cdipping\u201d among privy diggers.  The amount of dipping that occurred, how far down a well material was cleared and how frequently it was cleared, varied from privy to privy.  After plumbing was installed at the residence there was a final cleaning, which had a tendency of removing everything down to the deepest level of the vault.\n</p><p>Even at depths reaching 30 feet or more, some of the deepest vaults known to exist, many were cleaned to the base. Alternatively, a small percentage of shallow vaults extending down about 3 feet or less have contained noteworthy bottles, numerous fragments of dinner plates, cups, bowls, pitchers, tobacco pipes, clam and oyster shells, food bones and even sparse night soil pockets around the edges.\n</p><p>During the mid 19th century operators connected to the booming waste-generated fertilizer (night soil) business circulated cities and towns emptying vaults.  In rural areas where vaults are usually much smaller and shallower farmers and other property owners often conducted this task themselves.  Despite lying in human waste and other decaying refuse for years, many recyclable bottles of the time, and other reusable items, were retrieved during the dipping process.  Genuine garbage would be taken to landfills and other suitable locations and dumped, along with a never ending supply of stove and fireplace ashes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-miller_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-miller-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The evidence suggests that not all dippers were equally concerned with being meticulous and periodically dozens of bottles, and even some night soil, can still be found while privy digging.  The many out of place bottles sometimes discovered in clusters near the top or bottom of a dipped out vault are referred to by diggers as \u201ckick-backs\u201d, or \u201cthrow-ins\u201d, and were left intentionally by the workers who cleaned out the privy.\n</p><p>Throughout the decades of the middle and late 19th century, the years diggers tend to focus on due to rapid changes in bottle manufacturing, privies were only incidental or sporadic dumping spots for bottles, kitchen garbage and other refuse.  Some privies were never used for that purpose at all and for practical reasons only a very small percentage of a household\u2019s total trash could ever be distributed there.  Due to the enormous quantities of everyday garbage being produced by this time in history, not to mention the hundreds of millions of bottles sold each year in the United States alone, the vaults would have filled up very quickly requiring constant maintenance instead of being emptied just every so often.\n</p><p>Moreover, it was generally acceptable to dump reeking trash just about anywhere then without worrying about legal consequences.  Preferred places were lowland areas near the edges of towns and cities, down embankments and into ravines, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, bogs, shorelines, backyard burning pits and other locales.  For example, New York City sent scows brimming with garbage out into the harbor everyday where very cheap labor shoveled it directly into the water without a second thought.<sup id=\"cite_ref-miller_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-miller-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  This process went on for centuries and an endless supply of collectable items, antiques and archaeological information alike remain in these dumping places to this day.\n</p><p>A sterile mixture of dirt, sand, rocks, ashes, brick bats and other worthless debris manufactured around 1880-1920 was used to backfill privies once plumbing was installed at a particular address.  With or without night soil deposits remaining down below there is no longer any offensive odor.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Items_recovered\">Items recovered</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Privy_digging&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Items recovered\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:132px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Yale_bottle.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Yale_bottle.gif\" width=\"130\" height=\"215\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"130\" data-file-height=\"215\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Yale_bottle.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>An iron pontiled soda or beer bottle, ca. 1855.</div></div></div>\n<p>Privy digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting. Glass or clay bottles are the most likely items to be found in an average 19th century privy. Yet, more often than not they are found prohibitively damaged. This may be due to the large number of brickbats and stones which are found at all levels of the privy.  Excavators have theorized that at least some of them were thrown in with the intention of crushing down the contents of the vault, so it could be used longer without needing to be cleaned.  The high percentage of broken items is one reason why privy digging is one of the most unpredictable and arduous methods of attempting to form a bottle collection.\n</p><p>Pontiled medicine bottles, ink bottles, beer and soda bottles, and many others, particularly those manufactured between the 1830s-1860s are among the most sought after and can sell for thousands of dollars each.  However, in reality an average pontiled find discovered while privy digging is worth less than twenty dollars.  Even these are not discovered consistently in most locations.\n</p><p>Not unlike old stamps and coins invariably they are required to be in mint or very good condition to be sufficiently interesting to a serious bottle collector.  An enormous quantity of rare bottles are known to exist in private collections, museums, museum and university basements, and elsewhere but these prime examples are seldom found on average privy digs.  In fact a high percentage of all valuable bottles and related containers were never buried in privies, dumps or elsewhere; these are known as \u201cattic\u201d bottles among privy diggers and bottle collectors.\n</p><p>There are exceptions and over time some groups of regularly active diggers, operating in good locations, will encounter thousands of antique bottles and other interesting things.

Privy digging and dump digging are equally concerned with antique bottles and related items.  Though many exceptions exist in most instances even the oldest dump-bottles are not as old as privy bottles can be.\n</p><p>Dumps are commonly associated with bottles and trash manufactured between the 1880s-1920s.  This was a time when everyday bottles were being mass-produced annually by the hundreds of millions.  They were reused less and often thrown away rather than recycled due to their relatively inexpensive production costs.\n</p><p>Many bottles were still being mouth-blown and their lips formed by assorted tooling devices as late as 1915-20.  The patent for the first fully automatic bottle machine, the Owens Automatic Bottle Machine, was not issued until 1903.  And by 1906 it was swiftly replacing the old method at glasshouses nationwide.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>   Early examples of machine made bottles manufactured between about 1906 and 1915 often resemble their predecessors in shape and color and can be nominally valuable for that reason.\n</p><p>Whether found in privies or dumps late period mouth-blown bottles manufactured between about 1880-1915 have a lesser amount of serious collectable potential depending on rarity, condition and color.  Dug bottles manufactured between 1880 and 1915 have sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars but statistically this is very rare.\n</p><p>Although privy diggers usually attempt to focus on the contents of vaults built before the Civil War, these too can also contain bottles made as late as the 1920s or later up near the top.  Depending on when a vault went into permanent disuse it could contain bottles and debris deposited as late as the second half of the 20th century.  According to a 1950 census 50 million homes reported no indoor plumbing. In 1990 more than 4 million old style privies were still in use coast to coast.<sup id=\"cite_ref-barlow_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-barlow-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>  No matter what is encountered near the top assuming a given vault was active in 1850 its potential for older bottles lying at a lower section has a consistently strong draw for serious privy diggers.\n</p><p>Whether mold blown or free blown (both forms of mouth-blowing and considered hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base.  This mark is the result of removing the pontil rod.  Something which was temporarily fused to the base in order to handle them effectively while they were still exceedingly hot, as their necks and lips were being tooled at the glassworks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  The decades just prior to the absence of pontil rods from bottle-glass making were a time when endless variations pertaining to shape, size, style, color and embossing were being produced regularly in an unprecedented quantity.  Some of the most interesting bottles were manufactured during this time; 1830s-1860s.\n</p><p>Even after the pontil rod was replaced by assorted clamping mechanisms known as \u201csnap cases\u201d, many bottles were still being created in the same interesting molds and sold in huge quantities annually.  These are known as smooth base bottles and are sometimes found in privies which were in use after the 1860s and as late as the 1880s.  Visually, the difference between an early smooth base and a pontiled example of exactly the same bottle is insignificant but to a collector it often means everything.  Rare early smooth base bottles can occasionally be as valuable as rare pontiled bottles but statistically they are unlikely to be discovered with any regularity on average privy digs.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Privy_digging&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"div-col columns column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em;\">\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Bottles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bottles\">Bottles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Dump_digging\" title=\"Dump digging\">Dump digging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Historical_digging\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Historical digging\">Historical digging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Nightsoil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nightsoil\">Nightsoil</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Outhouse\" title=\"Outhouse\">Outhouse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sanitation\" title=\"Sanitation\">Sanitation</a></li></ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Privy_digging&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-jordan-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-jordan_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-jordan_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation book\">Jordan, S.
