The project partners with the National Geographic Explorers, filmmakers and scientists.  In 2018 Jackson was announced as a TED Fellow.   Jackson's first book, While Glaciers Slept, was published by Green Writer's Press in June 2015.  It explores the parallels between the destruction of the planet as a result of climate change and a family facing the loss of parents.  The book combines personal science with exploration, and was well received by critics.   The foreword is by Bill McKibben.  She has given several talks about her book and exploration work.    In 2018 she will publish her second book, The Secret Lives of Icelandic Glaciers, the stories of people in Iceleand impacted by climate change.
