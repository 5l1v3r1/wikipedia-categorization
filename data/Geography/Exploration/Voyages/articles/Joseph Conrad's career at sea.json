This did not seem to have stirred his enthusiasm for the seaman's profession. He gave himself six months' rest from the sea, socializing and spending in excess of the generous allowance that he received from his maternal uncle, <a href=\"/wiki/Tadeusz_Bobrowski\" title=\"Tadeusz Bobrowski\">Tadeusz Bobrowski</a>.  The uncle indulged his nephew's financial demands but sent him lengthy letters of reproof that included his usual criticisms of Conrad's improvident paternal line.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>51\u201354</span></sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;note 3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 10 July 1876 Conrad sailed for the <a href=\"/wiki/West_Indies\" title=\"West Indies\">West Indies</a> as a steward (at a salary of 35 francs, equivalent to one-fifth the allowance he received from his uncle) in the barque <i>Saint-Antoine</i>, making <a href=\"/wiki/Saint-Pierre,_Martinique\" title=\"Saint-Pierre, Martinique\">Saint-Pierre</a> on 18 August.  The <a href=\"/wiki/First_mate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First mate\">first mate</a> was a 42-year-old <a href=\"/wiki/Corsica\" title=\"Corsica\">Corsican</a>, Dominique Cervoni, who would become a prototype for the title character of Conrad's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nostromo\" title=\"Nostromo\">Nostromo</a></i>: \"In his eyes lurked a look of perfectly remorseless irony, as though he had been provided with an extremely experienced soul; and the slightest distension of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look of extraordinary boldness.  This was the only play of feature of which he seemed capable, being a Southerner of a concentrated, deliberate type.\"  The <i>Saint-Antoine</i>, after visiting Martinique, St. Thomas and <a href=\"/wiki/Haiti\" title=\"Haiti\">Haiti</a>, returned on 15 February 1877 to Marseilles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>54\u201355</span></sup>\n</p><p>In his novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Arrow_of_Gold\" title=\"The Arrow of Gold\">The Arrow of Gold</a></i>, Conrad alludes to smuggling \"by sea of arms and ammunition to the Carlist detachments in the South [of Spain].\"  This apparently involved Dominique Cervoni.  Conrad's first biographer, <a href=\"/wiki/Georges_Jean-Aubry\" title=\"Georges Jean-Aubry\">Georges Jean-Aubry</a> (1882\u20131950), built on this allusion a tale about Cervoni and Conrad smuggling arms to a <a href=\"/wiki/Central_America\" title=\"Central America\">Central American</a> republic.  The pre-eminent Conrad chronicler and scholar <a href=\"/wiki/Zdzis%C5%82aw_Najder\" title=\"Zdzis\u0142aw Najder\">Zdzis\u0142aw Najder</a> (born 1930) is skeptical about the story and surmises that Conrad \"might have heard... stories [about gun-running] from the experienced Cervoni.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>55\u201356</span></sup>\n</p><p>In December 1877 it transpired that, as a foreigner and Russian subject, Conrad could not serve on French ships without permission from the Russian consul.

Najder finds this, for a variety of reasons, virtually impossible.  If Conrad did participate in running contraband to Spain, it likely would have involved something other than weapons.  But in the two books written three and four decades later, he embellished his memories, probably borrowing from past adventures of Marseilles friends.  To admit that his illicit activities had been conducted for profit would have conflicted with the position that he wished to occupy in literature.  And attempts to track down the reality behind his accounts are complicated by Conrad's habit of using some external characteristics, and often the names, of actual people but of furnishing them with different life histories (as in the cases of Almayer, Lingard, Jim, and Kurtz).<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>59\u201361</span></sup>   Najder writes:\n</p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r856303468\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>A careful reading of \"The <i>Tremolino</i>\" and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Arrow_of_Gold\" title=\"The Arrow of Gold\">The Arrow of Gold</a></i> reveals that the whole Carlist plot is a sideline, an ornament that does not affect the course of action; its only function seems to be to glamorize and idealize smuggling.  Two elements overlap in these books:  the author's own recollections, modified in many respects, of the years 1877 and 1878, and his knowledge of Carlist activities and supporters in 1874 through 1876; they may prove more authentic taken separately than taken together.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>60</span></sup>  \n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another Marseilles legend concerns Conrad's great love affair.

He had probably joined the ship not as a crew member but as an unofficial apprentice.  It is not clear whether he had been on board during the Russian leg of its itinerary, which would have been hazardous for the Tsar's Polish subject.  He still planned to return to France and enlist in the French navy.  A conflict with Captain Samuel William Pipe prompted Conrad to leave the ship.  He departed for London, where he quickly went through half his ready cash.  Appealing to his uncle, he received additional funds, along with a long letter exhorting him to \"think for yourself and fend for yourself... don't idle; learn, and don't pretend to be a rich young gentleman....

Thus, there is no documentary evidence of a collision with a steamship at Newcastle; the story's hero is four years younger than Conrad; there was only one attempt, not several, to leave <a href=\"/wiki/Falmouth,_Cornwall\" title=\"Falmouth, Cornwall\">Falmouth, Cornwall</a>, as the ship was continuously under repair; and there are other, more striking discrepancies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>90</span></sup>\n</p><p>The <i>Palestine</i>, carrying a cargo of coal, left Newcastle for Bangkok on 29 November 1881.

Conrad was, for the first time, fully in charge of a four-man watch \u2014 an important step forward in an officer's advancement.  The ambiguous status of a novice second mate on a small barque such as the <i>Palestine</i> required him to be tough and strong-minded, especially in front of the sailors.  The passage was slow, uneventful, monotonous, until 11 March 1883, when, in the Bangka Strait between <a href=\"/wiki/Sumatra\" title=\"Sumatra\">Sumatra</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Bangka_Island\" title=\"Bangka Island\">Bangka Island</a>, a smell resembling paraffin oil was noted.  Next day, smoke was discovered issuing from the coals; water was thrown on them.  On 13 March, four tons of coals were thrown overboard and more water poured down the hold.  On 14 March, the hatches not being battened down, the decks blew up fore and aft.  The vessel headed for the Sumatra shore, and the <i>S.S. Somerset</i> took it in tow.  The fire increased rapidly, and the <i>Somerset</i> declined to tow the barque on shore.  The vessel became a mass of fire, and the crew got off into three boats, which remained by the vessel until the morning of 15 March 1883.  That evening the boats arrived at <a href=\"/wiki/Muntok\" title=\"Muntok\">Muntok</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>92\u201393</span></sup>\n</p><p>In his story \"<a href=\"/wiki/Youth_(Conrad_story)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Youth (Conrad story)\">Youth</a>\", Conrad dramatized the accident, stretching it out in time and space and giving a different reason for parting with the towing steamer.  In the story, the parting seems very risky; in reality, the disaster took place near shore.  And the boats did not steer for <a href=\"/wiki/Java\" title=\"Java\">Java</a>, to the east of Sumatra, but toward the port of Muntok on Bangka Island, off the east coast of Sumatra.  Indeed, <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Curle\" title=\"Richard Curle\">Richard Curle</a>'s 1922 identification of Muntok as the port where the story's hero experienced his first fascinating encounter with the exotic East revealed the story's greatest exaggeration: the boats could reach shore in some dozen hours, with no need to \"knock about in an open boat\" for \"nights and days\".  Conrad had also forgotten, after all those years, that he had three, not two, sailors with him in his boat.  But the most interesting discrepancy between story and reality consisted in Conrad's extolling the crew as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Liverpool\" title=\"Liverpool\">Liverpool</a> hard cases\", whereas in fact there was not a single Liverpudlian in the crew, and half were non-Britons.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>93\u201394</span></sup>\n</p><p>The <i>Palestine</i>\u2019s Irish <a href=\"/wiki/Chief_mate\" title=\"Chief mate\">first officer</a>, H.

There Captain McDonald, a Scot who kept the ship's officers at a distance and treated them \"as machines, to be worked by himself when and as he pleased,\" suffered some kind of \"attack\" which Conrad described to the physician whom he fetched, as alcoholic inebriation.  After Captain McDonald learned from a friend, a steamer captain, how Conrad had represented his condition, on 15 April 1884 McDonald dismissed Conrad, with a less than satisfactory certificate, issued on 17 April 1884.

He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge.

After a passage of 97 days, on 30 January 1893, the <i>Torrens</i> arrived at Port Adelaide.  Writing to Poradowska, Conrad complained of \"the uniform grey of my existence\" and expressed nostalgia for cultivated life and the broad intellectual interests of his correspondent's milieu.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-70\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>181\u20132</span></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:John_galsworthy.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/John_galsworthy.jpg/220px-John_galsworthy.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"296\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/John_galsworthy.jpg/330px-John_galsworthy.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/John_galsworthy.jpg/440px-John_galsworthy.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1635\" data-file-height=\"2200\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:John_galsworthy.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/John_Galsworthy\" title=\"John Galsworthy\">John Galsworthy</a>, whom Conrad met on the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Torrens_(clipper_ship)\" title=\"Torrens (clipper ship)\">Torrens</a></i></div></div></div>\n<p>When the <i>Torrens</i> left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and <a href=\"/wiki/New_Zealand\" title=\"New Zealand\">New Zealand</a>:  25-year-old lawyer and future novelist <a href=\"/wiki/John_Galsworthy\" title=\"John Galsworthy\">John Galsworthy</a>; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at <a href=\"/wiki/Elstree_School\" title=\"Elstree School\">Elstree</a>.  They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship.  The protagonist of one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, \"The Doldrums\" (1895\u201396), the first mate Armand, is obviously modeled on Conrad.  At Cape Town, where the <i>Torrens</i> remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines.  Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad.  On 26 July 1893 the <i>Torrens</i> docked at London, and \"J.

He wrote Poradowska that he had spent five days ill in bed, \"nursed [by Uncle Tadeusz] as if I were a little child.\"  She, in a letter, made something of a jealous scene over Maria O\u0142dakowska, a niece of her late husband Aleksander Poradowski who was getting married.<sup id=\"cite_ref-najder_5-73\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-najder-5\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>184\u20135</span></sup>\n</p><p>Najder writes that a graph of Conrad's sailing career would be \"a broken line, but one that climbs between 1874 and 1889.... The expedition to Africa stops this upward climb and marks the beginning of a steady... decline.

Writing Poradowska, Conrad considered the possibility of a job as a pilot on the <a href=\"/wiki/Suez_Canal\" title=\"Suez Canal\">Suez Canal</a>.  Bored at Rouen, he there began work on chapter 10 (of the 12 chapters) of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Almayer%27s_Folly\" title=\"Almayer&#39;s Folly\">Almayer's Folly</a></i>.

Conrad departed from the truth in reporting the length of his service and posts held.  He maintained that he had spent 18 months on the <a href=\"/wiki/Congo_River\" title=\"Congo River\">Congo River</a> \"in command of a steamer,\" when in fact he had spent only six weeks on the Congo; he also added three months to his command of the <i>Otago</i>, and claimed that he had made two voyages to <a href=\"/wiki/Mauritius\" title=\"Mauritius\">Mauritius</a> and two passages through <a href=\"/wiki/Torres_Strait\" title=\"Torres Strait\">Torres Strait</a>; he lengthened his service in the <i>Torrens</i> by three months; and he alleged that he had made a transatlantic voyage in the <i>Adowa</i>.
