Concepción was an early-16th-century Spanish carrack and one of the five ships of the Magellan-Elcano expedition to the Spice Islands (the Moluccas). The expedition, finding itself short-handed, burnt the ship in the Philippines in 1521. The ship weighed 90 tons and cost 228,750 maravedis.  After leaving Seville on 10 August 1519, Concepción's crew consisted of 44 men, including Gaspar de Quesada as captain and Juan Sebastían Elcano as boatswain. The latter would complete the expedition with the Victoria carrack in 1522, the first ship to circumnavigate the globe.
