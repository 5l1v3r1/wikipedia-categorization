The winter-over syndrome is a condition found in individuals who "winter-over" throughout the Antarctic (or Arctic) winter. It has been observed in inhabitants of research stations in Antarctica, as well as in polar bases such as Thule, Alert and Eureka. It consists of a variety of behavioral and medical disturbances, including irritability, depression, insomnia, absentmindedness, aggressive behavior, and irritable bowel syndrome.   Possible contributing causes of winter-over syndrome include stress, social isolation, subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder and polar T3 syndrome.
