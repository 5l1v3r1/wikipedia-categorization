A maximum-value composite procedure (or MVC) is a procedure used in satellite imaging, which is applied to vegetation studies. It requires that a series of multi-temporal geo-referenced satellite data be processed into NDVI images. On a pixel-by-pixel basis, each NDVI value is examined, and only the highest value is retained for each pixel location. After all pixels have been evaluated, the result is known as an MVC image.
