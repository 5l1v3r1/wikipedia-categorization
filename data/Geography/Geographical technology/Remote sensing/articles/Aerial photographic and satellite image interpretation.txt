Photographic interpretation is “the act of examining photographic images for the purpose of identifying objects and judging their significance” (Colwell, 1997). This mainly refers to its usage in military aerial reconnaissance using photographs taken from reconnaissance aircraft. Principles of image interpretation have been developed empirically for more than 150 years.  The most basic of these principles are the elements of image interpretation.  They are: location, size, shape, shadow, tone/color, texture, pattern, height/depth and site/situation/association.  These are routinely used when interpreting an aerial photo or analyzing a photo-like image.  A well-trained image interpreter uses many of these elements during their analysis without really thinking about them.  However, a beginner may not only have to force themselves to consciously evaluate an unknown object with respect to these elements, but also analyze its significance in relation to the other objects or phenomena in the photo or image. The following are elements of aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation. Color imagery is often preferred because, as opposed to shades of gray, humans can detect thousands of different colors.  Color aids in the process of photo interpretation.
