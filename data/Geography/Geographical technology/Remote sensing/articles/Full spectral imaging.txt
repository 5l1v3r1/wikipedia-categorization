Full spectral imaging is a form of Imaging spectroscopy and is the successor to Hyperspectral imaging.  Full Spectral Imaging was developed to improve the capabilities of Earth remote sensing (see also remote sensing).  Hyperspectral imaging acquires data as many contiguous spectral bands.  Full Spectral Imaging (FSI) acquires data as spectral curves.  A significant advantage of FSI over Hyperspectral is a significant reduction in data rate and volume.  FSI extracts and saves only the information that is in the raw data.  The information is contained in the shape of the spectral curves.  The rate at which data is produced by an FSI system is proportional to the amount of information in the scene/image. Full Spectral Imaging, along with Empirical reflectance retrieval and Autonomous Remote Sensing are the components of the New System for Remote Sensing.  The New System for Remote Sensing could be the successor to the Landsat series of satellites of the Landsat program.  The concepts mentioned above have been developed in collaboration with many experts, most of whom have little to nothing to do with traditional remote sensing.  These concepts rely solely on currently available off-the-shelf technology, and on existing infrastructure. The first discussion of Full Spectral Imaging was presented SPIE International Remote Sensing Conference in Barcelona in 2004 in the paper; "Full spectral imaging: a revisited approach to remote sensing".   or doi:10.1117/12.510485.
