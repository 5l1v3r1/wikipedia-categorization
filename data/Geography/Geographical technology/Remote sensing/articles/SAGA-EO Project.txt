The SAGA-EO Project (Support Action to GMES Africa on Earth Observation) consists of a feasibility study on critical pieces of the puzzle of the Lisbon Declaration Implementation Plan on GMES Africa and to complement previous experience in that field. The main finding driving the concept is that no project tackles the Earth observation (EO) field as a global approach (technological, organizational and institutional). The way to implement this EO capacity-building challenge is to set up dedicated EO networks of users belonging to a same African country and to link them with existing initiatives in Africa and Europe. The main purpose and objectives of the SAGA-EO project are to study this organisational model and its associated technology and to prove that the concept is viable in five African countries through the following actions: The SAGA-EO project guarantees to achieve those objectives and proposed actions based on the following key issues: Experienced system architect with in-depth knowledge of methodologies, standards and services organisation This project is in the frame of the Seventh Framework Programme, Theme 9, Space Call 2, FP7-SPACE-2009-1 of the European Commission.
