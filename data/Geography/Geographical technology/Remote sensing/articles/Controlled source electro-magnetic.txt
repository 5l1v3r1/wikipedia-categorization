The controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method is an offshore geophysical technique,   employing electromagnetic remote-sensing technology to indicate the presence and extent of hydrocarbon below the seabed, but often noise perturbs the delineation and quantification.  The CSEM survey uses a dipole source that is towed just above the seafloor to transmit a time-varying electromagnetic field into the earth . This field is modified by the presence of subsurface resistive layers and these changes are detected and logged by an array of receivers placed on the seabed. Because hydrocarbon-bearing formations are highly resistive compared with surrounding formations, a CSEM survey can indicate the presence of oil and gas in offshore situations.
