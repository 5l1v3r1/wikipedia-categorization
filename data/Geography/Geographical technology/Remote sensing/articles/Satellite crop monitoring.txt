Satellite crop monitoring is the technology which facilitates real-time crop vegetation index monitoring via spectral analysis  of high resolution satellite images for different fields and crops which enables to track positive and negative dynamics of crop development.   The difference in vegetation index informs about single-crop development disproportions that speaks for the necessity of additional agriculture works on particular field zones â€”that is because satellite crop monitoring belongs to precision agriculture methods. Satellite crop monitoring technology allows to perform online crop monitoring on different fields, located in different areas, regions, even countries and on different continents. The technology's significant advantage is a high automation level of sown area condition and its interpretation in an interactive map which can be read by different groups of users.    Satellite crop monitoring technology users are:
