Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) is a computer database for disaster response that provides graphical, real-time information to responders.  Four phases of an emergency are Preparedness, Risk Mitigation, Response and Recovery. An EMIS shall enable emergency managers or any emergency stakeholder (affected civilians, police, fireman, Non Government Organizations (NGO), etc.)  make their required activities in any phase of an emergency in an easy and speedy way.  An EMIS interacts with many other early alert systems and communicates with many legacy systems.
