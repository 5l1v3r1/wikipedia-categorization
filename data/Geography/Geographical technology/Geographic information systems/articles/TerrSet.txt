TerrSet (formerly IDRISI) is an integrated geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing software developed by Clark Labs at Clark University for the analysis and display of digital geospatial information. TerrSet is a PC grid-based system that offers tools for researchers and scientists engaged in analyzing earth system dynamics for effective and responsible decision making for environmental management, sustainable resource development and equitable resource allocation. Key features of TerrSet include: TerrSet was first developed in 1987 by Prof. J. Ronald Eastman    of Clark University, Department of Geography. Dr. Eastman continues to be the prime developer and chief architect of the software. The software was initially named after cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi (1100â€“1166). In January 2015 Clark Labs released the TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling software, version 18.   Besides its primary research and scientific focus, TerrSet is popular as an academic tool for teaching the principal theories behind GIS at colleges and universities. Since 1987 TerrSet has been used by professionals in a wide range of industries in more than 180 countries worldwide. In total, there are over 300 modules for the analysis and display of digital spatial information. TerrSet is managed and updated by Clark Labs. Based within the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University, Clark Labs and its software tools are known for advancements in areas such as decision support, uncertainty management, classifier development, change and time series analysis, and dynamic modeling. Clark Labs partners with organizations such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,  Google.org,  USDA, the United Nations, Conservation International, Imazon   and Wildlife Conservation Society.
