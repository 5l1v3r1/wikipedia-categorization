Sliver Polygons is a technical term of the field of Geographic Information System and describes unwanted small polygons resulting from layer intersection. Sliver Polygons are small areas which result from spatial overlays of different GIS layers. Typically sliver polygons occur if slightly different (often manually) digitalized areas are spatially intersected. Sliver polygons often are characterised by long, elongated areas which do not represent an entity in reality and therefore need to be removed.
