{"parse":{"title":"Mapping Services Agreement","pageid":3386148,"revid":822179546,"text":{"*":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>The <b>Mapping Services Agreement</b> (MSA) is a licensing <a href=\"/wiki/Contract\" title=\"Contract\">contract</a> between local authorities in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> and suppliers of <a href=\"/wiki/Geographic_data\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Geographic data\">geographic data</a>. Most of its contents are covered by commercial in confidence requirements. The general outcome of the MSA, however, is the supply of geographic data to local authorities and the defining of licensing issues regarding address data.\n</p><p>The MSA replaced an existing agreement for the supply of geographic data between local authorities, police, fire and other emergency services, and the national mapping agency, <a href=\"/wiki/Ordnance_Survey\" title=\"Ordnance Survey\">Ordnance Survey</a> (OS). It also complied with <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a> rules on procurement. As a result, suppliers of geographic information had to go through a process of open procurement managed on behalf of local authorities by the IDeA, an umbrella government organisation coordinating and promoting local authority good practice.\n</p><p>The result was that three suppliers were selected: Ordnance Survey, Intermap and Intelligent Addressing. For local authorities this meant little change in the supply of mapping data which continued to be supplied by OS. Intermap, however, supplied height data not previously covered by other arrangements.\n</p><p>Perhaps the most significant outcome of the MSA is the resolution of ownership, licensing and royalty issues that had existed between local authorities and OS. In the agreement the address databases (called <a href=\"/wiki/Local_Land_and_Property_Gazetteer\" title=\"Local Land and Property Gazetteer\">Local Land and Property Gazetteers</a> \u2013 LLPG) maintained by local authorities acknowledged the partial input of OS's address product, <a href=\"/wiki/Address_Point\" title=\"Address Point\">Address Point</a> to these databases. In effect local authorities became \"value added resellers\" of ADDRESS-POINT and are required to pay OS royalties for the proportion of their use of the OS product.\n</p><p>The agreement also puts into place funding for the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Land_and_Property_Gazetteer\" title=\"National Land and Property Gazetteer\">National Land and Property Gazetteer</a> (NLPG), the UK's national address infrastructure, which is made up of the LLPGs compiled by local authorities. It also enables the NLPG to compel local authorities to maintain their LLPGs and thus ensure the nationwide coverage and compliance by local authorities.\n</p><p>The Mapping Services Agreement contract expired on 31 March 2012 and was replaced by the Data Co-operation Agreement.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mapping_Services_Agreement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090809185343/http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=8035840\">MSA page on the IDeA website</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070318062808/http://www.agi.org.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_TECHART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_TECHART_161676\">AGI (Association of Geographic Information) MSA page</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1223\nCached time: 20180912120646\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 11/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:3386148-0!canonical and timestamp 20180912120646 and revision id 822179546\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Law_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Geography_of_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Geographic_information_systems"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Address Point"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Contract"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"European Union"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Geographic data"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Local Land and Property Gazetteer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Land and Property Gazetteer"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ordnance Survey"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United Kingdom"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["https://web.archive.org/web/20090809185343/http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=8035840","https://web.archive.org/web/20070318062808/http://www.agi.org.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_TECHART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_TECHART_161676"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Mapping_Services_Agreement","byteoffset":2231,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Mapping Services Agreement","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6754172"}]}}
