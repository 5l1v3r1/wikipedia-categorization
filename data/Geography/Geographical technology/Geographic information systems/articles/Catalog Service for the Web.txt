Catalog Service for the Web (CSW), sometimes seen as Catalog Service - Web, is a standard for exposing a catalogue of geospatial records in XML on the Internet (over HTTP). The catalogue is made up of records that describe geospatial data (e.g. KML), geospatial services (e.g. WMS), and related resources. CSW is one part (or "profile") of the OGC Catalog Service, which defines common interfaces to discover, browse, and query metadata about data, services, and other potential resources. Version 2.0 of the specification was released in May 2004. The most recent release is 2.0.2, which was published in 2007.    The records are in XML according to the standard.  Typically the records include Dublin Core, ISO 19139 or FGDC metadata, encoded in UTF-8 characters. Each record must contain certain core fields including: Title, Format, Type (e.g. Dataset, DatasetCollection or Service), BoundingBox (a rectangle of interest, expressed in latitude and longitude), Coordinate Reference System, and Association (a link to another metadata record). Operations defined by the CSW standard include:   Requests can encode the parameters in three different ways: Responses are in XML. GeoServer implements many OGC standards, including CSW. An example of the DescribeRecord operation is as follows:  A (truncated) response: Versions 2.0.0, 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 are subtly different, and different vendors implement them with variations.  Typically a CSW server will accept requests in one CSW version only, and it is up to the client to be flexible. e.g. ESRI Geoportal can be configured to harvest documents from CSW servers of a variety of versions and vendor variants   such as "GeoNetwork CSW 2.0.2 APISO".
