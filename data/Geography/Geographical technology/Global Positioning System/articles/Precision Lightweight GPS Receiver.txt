The AN/PSN-11 Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR, colloquially "plugger") is a ruggedized, hand-held, single-frequency GPS receiver fielded by the US military. It incorporates the Precise Positioning Service - Security Module (PPS-SM) to access the encrypted P(Y)-code GPS signal. Introduced in January 1990, and extensively fielded until 2004 when it was replaced by its successor, the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR). In that time period more than 165,000 PLGRs were procured worldwide, and despite being superseded by the DAGR, large numbers remain in unit inventories and it continues to be the most widely used GPS receiver in the US military.  The PLGR measures 9.5 by 4.1 by 2.6 inches (24 cm × 10 cm × 7 cm) and weighs 2.75 pounds (1.25 kg) with batteries. It was originally delivered to the US military with a six-year warranty, however this was extended to 10 years in June 2000.
