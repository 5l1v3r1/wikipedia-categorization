EUREF Permanent Network (EPN) is a European Network of more than 300 continuously operating GNSS reference stations with precisely known coordinates referenced to the ETRS89. EPN is the key instrument in the maintenance of ETRS89 geodetic datum. The EPN stations collect continuously the observation data from high accuracy multi-GNSS receivers. The data is processed in the centralized way in a few data processing centres. EPN is created and maintained by a voluntary agreement of about 100 European agencies and universities. EPN activities are coordinated by EUREF.    The EPN consists of the following components: EPN data are raw multi-GNSS pseudorange and phase observations, broadcast ephemerides, and supporting types of raw data (such as meteorological) as they are gathered by the Tracking Stations. The EPN data is available in daily, hourly, 15-min RINEX-formatted files, and for many stations as a real-time data stream via NTRIP. EPN products include
