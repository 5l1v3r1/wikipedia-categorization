Dilution of precision (DOP), or geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), is a term used in satellite navigation and geomatics engineering to specify the additional multiplicative effect of navigation satellite geometry on positional measurement precision. The concept of dilution of precision (DOP) originated with users of the Loran-C navigation system.  The idea of Geometric DOP is to state how errors in the measurement will affect the final state estimation. This can be defined as:                          G         D         O         P         =                                                Δ               (                                                   O                   u                   t                   p                   u                   t                                       L                   o                   c                   a                   t                   i                   o                   n                                               )                                         Δ               (                                                   M                   e                   a                   s                   u                   r                   e                   d                                       D                   a                   t                   a                                               )                                                  {\displaystyle GDOP={\frac {\Delta ({\rm {Output\ Location}})}{\Delta ({\rm {Measured\ Data}})}}}     Conceptually you can geometrically imagine errors on a measurement resulting in the                         Δ         (                                 M             e             a             s             u             r             e             d                           D             a             t             a                             )                 {\displaystyle \Delta ({\rm {Measured\ Data}})}     term changing. Ideally small changes in the measured data will not result in large changes in output location, as such a result would indicate the solution is very sensitive to errors. The interpretation of this formula is shown in the figure to the right, showing two possible scenarios with acceptable and poor GDOP. More recently, the term has come into much wider usage with the development and adoption of GPS. Neglecting ionospheric   and tropospheric  effects, the signal from navigation satellites has a fixed precision. Therefore, the relative satellite-receiver geometry plays a major role in determining the precision of estimated positions and times.  Due to the relative geometry of any given satellite to a receiver, the precision in the pseudorange of the satellite translates to a corresponding component in each of the four dimensions of position measured by the receiver (i.e.,                         x                 {\displaystyle x}    ,                         y                 {\displaystyle y}    ,                         z                 {\displaystyle z}    , and                         t                 {\displaystyle t}    ).  The precision of multiple satellites in view of a receiver combine according to the relative position of the satellites to determine the level of precision in each dimension of the receiver measurement.  When visible navigation satellites are close together in the sky, the geometry is said to be weak and the DOP value is high; when far apart, the geometry is strong and the DOP value is low.  Consider two overlapping rings, or annuli, of different centres.  If they overlap at right angles, the greatest extent of the overlap is much smaller than if they overlap in near parallel. Thus a low DOP value represents a better positional precision due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate a unit's position.  Other factors that can increase the effective DOP are obstructions such as nearby mountains or buildings. DOP can be expressed as a number of separate measurements: These values follow mathematically from the positions of the usable satellites. Signal receivers allow the display of these positions (skyplot) as well as the DOP values. The term can also be applied to other location systems that employ several geographical spaced sites.  It can occur in electronic-counter-counter-measures (electronic warfare) when computing the location of enemy emitters (radar jammers and radio communications devices).  Using such an interferometry technique can provide certain geometric layout where there are degrees of freedom that cannot be accounted for due to inadequate configurations. The effect of geometry of the satellites on position error is called geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and it is roughly interpreted as ratio of position error to the range error.  Imagine that a square pyramid is formed by lines joining four satellites with the receiver at the tip of the pyramid.  The larger the volume of the pyramid, the better (lower) the value of GDOP; the smaller its volume, the worse (higher) the value of GDOP will be.  Similarly, the greater the number of satellites, the better the value of GDOP. The DOP factors are functions of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the parameters, expressed either in a global or a local geodetic frame. As a first step in computing DOP, consider the unit vectors from the receiver to satellite i:                                    (                                                                           (                                        x                                            i                                                           −                   x                   )                                                     R                                        i                                                                             ,                                                                (                                        y                                            i                                                           −                   y                   )                                                     R                                        i                                                                             ,                                                                (                                        z                                            i                                                           −                   z                   )                                                     R                                        i                                                                                      )                          {\displaystyle \left({\frac {(x_{i}-x)}{R_{i}}},{\frac {(y_{i}-y)}{R_{i}}},{\frac {(z_{i}-z)}{R_{i}}}\right)}     where                                    R                        i                             =                                 (                            x                                i                                         −             x                            )                                2                                         +             (                            y                                i                                         −             y                            )                                2                                         +             (                            z                                i                                         −             z                            )                                2                                                                 {\displaystyle R_{i}={\sqrt {(x_{i}-x)^{2}+(y_{i}-y)^{2}+(z_{i}-z)^{2}}}}     and where                         x         ,         y                 {\displaystyle x,y}     and                         z                 {\displaystyle z}     denote the position of the receiver and                                    x                        i                             ,                    y                        i                                     {\displaystyle x_{i},y_{i}}     and                                    z                        i                                     {\displaystyle z_{i}}     denote the position of satellite i.

When                                    C                        d                                     {\displaystyle C_{d}}     is a noise covariance matrix,                         Q                 {\displaystyle Q}     is an estimate of the matrix of covariance of noise in the unknowns due to the noise in the measured quantities.  It is the estimate obtained by the First Order second Moment (F.OR.M.) uncertainty quantification technique which was state of the art in the 1980s. In order for the F.OR.M. theory to be strictly applicable, either the input noise distributions need to be Gaussian or the measurement noise standard deviations need to be small relative to rate of change in the output near the solution.  In this context, the second criteria is typically the one that is satisfied. This (i.e. for the 4 range measurement residual equations) computation is in accordance with   where the weighting matrix,                         P         =         (                    J                        d                                        C                        d                                        J                        d                                   T                                        )                        −             1                                     {\displaystyle P=(J_{d}C_{d}J_{d}^{T})^{-1}}    , has been set to the identity matrix. The elements of Q are designated as: PDOP, TDOP and GDOP are given by: in agreement with Section 1.4.9 of Principles of Satellite Positioning. More generally, GDOP is the square root of the trace of the                         Q                 {\displaystyle Q}     matrix.
