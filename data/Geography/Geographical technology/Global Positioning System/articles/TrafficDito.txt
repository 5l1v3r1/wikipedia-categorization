TrafficDito is a free traffic monitoring website and GPS-enabled iOS application for iPhones launched in the Philippines on October 21, 2011 by the TrafficDito Team, a local startup in the country. It works by sorting through Twitter users’ public tweets and its iPhone app-generated traffic reports describing road conditions along major roads   in the cities of Makati, Pasig, Caloocan, Taguig, Parañaque, Manila, Mandaluyong, and Quezon City. Tweets and reports not older than 3 hours are filtered by an algorithm that will determine the expressed sentiment as light, moderate, or heavy traffic. They are then labeled, color-coded and displayed in a stream that can be sorted via search. TrafficDito currently does not support cities outside Metro Manila, nor can it be used in countries outside the Philippines. The TrafficDito iPhone application  has features not available on its browser-based counterpart. Users on the iPhone app can send geo-tagged traffic reports labeled by users as light, moderate, or heavy, alongside any optional text details that may be added. App users may then view the crowdsourced reports and geo-tagged tweets as color-coded dots overlaid on a Google map of Metro Manila. In its latest updates,  the iPhone app was given additional reporting features such as automatic bearing-detection, Twitter integration, offline mode, and the ability to display geo-tagged reports sourced from tweets  by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.
