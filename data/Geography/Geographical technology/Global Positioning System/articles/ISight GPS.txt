 iSight GPS vehicle tracking systems were introduced by RFTrax in June 2008 to provide consumers and small businesses inexpensive real-time vehicle GPS using RFTrax asset tracking technologies. The iSight-CT model was designed for parents to monitor their most valuable and often at risk asset; their teenage drivers. A simple under-dash or windshield-mounted device transmits the car’s location, speed and direction every 30 seconds to a secure database via the GSM cellular network. The data can be viewed and mapped in real time from any internet enabled computer using a secure login to the company’s proprietary web site. Parents can set speed limits and establish geofences that can deliver email or SMS text message notices when guidelines they have established with their young drivers have been stretched.
