The Singapore Satellite Positioning Reference Network or in short SiReNT, is an infrastructure set up by the Survey Services section of the Singapore Land Authority to define Singapore's official spatial reference framework and to support the gazetted cadastral system in SVY21. It is a multi-purpose high precision positioning infrastructure which provides both Post Process Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) DGPS services and Real Time DGPS services. The system supports all types of GPS positioning modes and formats. SiReNT comprises five GPS reference stations connected to a Data Control Centre (DCC) at Government Data Centre (GDC). The entire set-up is made up of advanced GPS equipment and sophisticated computer hardware, software, communications and network. SiReNT supports a great variety of applications. It provides data reliability, efficiency and productivity of survey work for land surveyors with the aid of GPS technology. It also offers a wide range of GPS data services with various accuracy levels ranging from metres to centimetres to suit different applications from positioning to tracking and monitoring. These six GPS Reference Stations receive satellite signals 24 hours a day and transmit GPS data continuously to the Data Control Centre (DCC) for storage and processing. Corrections processed from the data are then streamed to subscribed users. The six reference stations are strategically located at extreme corners of Singapore Island - Senoko, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Keppel, Nanyang Polytechnic, Loyang and Pulau Semakau, so as to provide an extensive coverage. SiReNT offers 4 types of services, namely Post Processing (PP) On-Demand, Post Processing (PP) Archive, Real Time Kinematic (RTK) and low accuracy Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) to suit different applications. In 2010, SiReNT introduced support for telematics and structural monitoring solutions.
