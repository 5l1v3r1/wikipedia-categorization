TraceME is a tracking device created and developed by KCS, a Dutch electronics company headquartered in Dordrecht. The KCS TraceME GPRS/GPS range of modules enable you to remotely track & trace a variety of objects, e.g. cars, trucks, containers, (motor)cycles. TraceME Micro is the latest addition, targeted for personal use and any other application that need a minimum size while maintaining exactly the same options and server connection the full-size units have. Equipped with a state-of-the-art GPS receiver, the KCS TraceME Module provides reliable and accurate navigational data. All communication is handled rapidly and effectively by a GPRS/GSM modem (QUAD band version) through GPRS or SMS. In areas without network coverage, position-data and events are stored in memory (up to 55,000 positions). As soon as communication is restored, all information can be transmitted. A unique feature is the user-configuration menu, which controls all actions like sending position-information, depending on all possible events. http://www.trace.me
