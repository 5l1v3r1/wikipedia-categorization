The Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (NTRIP) is a protocol for streaming differential GPS (DGPS) data over the Internet in accordance with specification published by RTCM.  NTRIP is a generic, stateless protocol based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP/1.1 and is enhanced for GNSS data streams.   NTRIP was developed by the German Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG) and the Dortmund University Department of Computer Science. Ntrip was released in September 2004 as "RTCM Recommended Standards for Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (Ntrip), Version 1.0". The current version of the protocol is Version 2.0 with Amendment 1, June 28, 2011.  NTRIP is an open standard protocol. The protocol can be freely downloaded from BKG and there is an open source implementation available from software.rtcm-ntrip.org.
