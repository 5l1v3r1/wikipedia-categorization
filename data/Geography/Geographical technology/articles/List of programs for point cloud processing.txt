This is an overview of programs for processing 3D point clouds from appropriate photos or surveys with laser scanners. The programs create point clouds based on appropriate photos to process them to 3D models, e.g. for meshing. 4K videos in avi, mov, wmv, and mp4 <2D> • Orthomosaic in GeoTIFF  • Map tiles in KML, HTML  • Vegetation index map in GeoTIFF  • Application map in SHP  • Thermal maps in GeoTiff  <3D> • 3D PDF for 3D mesh • DSM and DTM in GeoTIFF • 3D textured mesh in OBJ, PLY, DXF, and FBX  • 3D level-of-detail (LoD) mesh in SLPK and OSGB  • Point cloud in LAS, LAZ, XYZ and PLY  • Contour lines in SHP, DXF, and PDF  • Vector objects in DXF, SHP, DGN and KML The programs can import data of laser scanners or point clouds to preprocess them for 3D modeling. The programs can import data of laser scanners, images or point clouds and process them for 3D modeling.
