The Charles P. Daly Medal is awarded to individuals by the American Geographical Society (AGS) "for valuable or distinguished geographical services or labors." The medal was established in 1902.  This medal was originally designed by Victor D. Brenner, but the destruction of the dies caused the medal to be redesigned in 1924 by Brenda Putnam. Charles P. Daly was President of the AGS from 1864 until September 19, 1899. However, during this time he rose to prominence in New York State as a Judge on the Court of Common Pleas and became Chief Justice in 1871. In 1902, Dalyâ€™s willed funds were used to establish this medal.  Source: American Geographical Society
