The Livingstone Medal is awarded by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in recognition of outstanding public service in which geography has played an important part.    Named after the African explorer David Livingstone it was endowed in 1901 by his daughter, Agnes Livingstone Bruce. Designed by the sculptor James Pittendrigh MacGillivray, it has a portrait of Livingstone on the front and a depiction of the Spirit of Civilisation on the reverse.   Source: RSGS
