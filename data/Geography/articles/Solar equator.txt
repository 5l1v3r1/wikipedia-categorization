The solar equator is the latitude on Earth at which the Sun is directly overhead; where the sun is vertically above at midday.  Because of the inclination of the Earth's orbit the solar equator varies during the year, from the Tropic of Capricorn on the December solstice to the Tropic of Cancer on the June solstice. During the equinoxes, the sun is directly overhead on the equator and the sun can never be overhead areas outside of the tropics.
