Coordinates: 54°00′13″N 2°32′52″W﻿ / ﻿54.003644°N 2.547859°W﻿ / 54.003644; -2.547859 Brennand Farm is often claimed to be the true centre of Great Britain. This is about seven kilometres north-west of Dunsop Bridge - which has the nearest BT phone box to the 'true centre'.  A plaque reads “You are calling from the BT payphone that marks the centre of Great Britain”.  The location was calculated by Ordnance Survey as the centroid of the two-dimensional shape of Great Britain, including all its islands. Haltwhistle claims to be the centre by a different method.
