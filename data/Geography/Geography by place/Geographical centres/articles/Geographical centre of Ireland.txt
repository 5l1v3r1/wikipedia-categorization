The geographical centre of Ireland is in the townland of Carnagh East (Irish: An Charnach Thoir), County Roscommon on the western shore of Lough Ree, where the 8° Meridian West meets the 53°30' North Latitude. It is opposite the Cribby Islands and 8.85 kilometres NNW of Athlone Town.  Lecarrow is the closest population centre. In Irish mythology, The Hill of Uisneach (which is on the road from Mullingar to Athlone, about 17.7 kilometres west of Mullingar and two kilometres from the village of Loughanavally) was generally considered to be the ceremonial centre of Ireland, though at times the Hill of Tara was also regarded in a similar manner. Up to 2007, a fire was lit every May Day and a Mass was celebrated on the hill of Uisneach.  Coordinates: 53°30′N 8°00′W﻿ / ﻿53.500°N 8.000°W﻿ / 53.500; -8.000
