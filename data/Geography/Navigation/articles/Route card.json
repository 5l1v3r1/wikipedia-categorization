Whenever possible, each leg will start and finish at a clearly defined topographical feature such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Lake\" title=\"Lake\">lake</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Hillock\" title=\"Hillock\">knoll</a>, saddle, <a href=\"/wiki/Stream\" title=\"Stream\">stream</a> junction and so on.  In most cases the legs are defined as being the longest section that might be safely followed on a single <a href=\"/wiki/Compass\" title=\"Compass\">compass</a> bearing.  The object is to split the overall route into sections that can be readily undertaken in conditions of poor visibility such as in <a href=\"/wiki/Cloud\" title=\"Cloud\">cloud</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Fog\" title=\"Fog\">fog</a> or at night.\n</p><p>In addition to the compass bearing, for each leg the total distance will be measured as well as the height gained or lost and the steepness of the ground. Using this information an estimated time to complete the leg will be calculated usually using <a href=\"/wiki/Naismith%27s_Rule\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Naismith&#39;s Rule\">Naismith's Rule</a> or one of its variations.  These times are then added to estimate the total time needed for the expedition.\n</p><p>For each leg note may also be taken of potential sources of danger along the route such as <a href=\"/wiki/Cliff\" title=\"Cliff\">cliffs</a> or of handrail/collecting features to aid in confirming the route.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Additional_information\">Additional information</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Route_card&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Additional information\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For formal expeditions or excursions the leader may include the following information.\n</p>\n<ul><li>composition of the party with the names of the members, car registration numbers.</li>\n<li>actual start time and date.</li>\n<li>estimated time and date of arrival at finish.</li>\n<li>mobile <a href=\"/wiki/Telephone\" title=\"Telephone\">telephone</a> number and/or <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> frequencies in use</li>\n<li>notes regarding special equipment carried, <a href=\"/wiki/Tent\" title=\"Tent\">tents</a>, emergency shelters, food etc.</li></ul>\n<p>A copy of the route card is then left with a responsible person so as to assist the emergency services in the event that the group should suffer a mishap.

When following legs on a compass bearing, the estimated time is not usually used as a precise indicator of when the leg is over but as a kind of fail-safe to stop the group from overshooting the actual objective and getting lost.  If a precise estimate is needed, pace-counting may be used instead if terrain permits.  Nowadays, it is typical to enter the co-ordinates from the route card into a handheld <a href=\"/wiki/GPS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GPS\">GPS</a> unit and use this in conjunction with a compass if conditions deteriorate.  In some cases, each member of the expedition may memorize a section of the route and have their own compass preset to the relevant bearing.  This is a particular technique for military night patrols where the <a href=\"/wiki/Soldier\" title=\"Soldier\">soldiers</a> each lead a section of the route.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_of_Moon_route_cards\">Use of Moon route cards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Route_card&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Use of Moon route cards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Military use these to assist a planned route for night navigation same as a route card.\n</p><p>It is very simply a route card just showing the legs or stages of the route. Some commanders have a full detailed route card as well as the moon route card when doing night navigation. \n</p><p>The two reasons for this is that you can pull the Moon card out on the march and hold it up to the moon light to check the bearing or grid reference of the next leg, and to stop you getting out your torch and giving your position away.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Route_card&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.simonstewart.ie/Turks/turk_nw.htm\">Sample route card for the Maamturks ridge in Ireland</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.expedition-info.com/moon-route-card\">Expedition-info - A free website to access a Moon route card</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://boreal.net/resources/pdfs/BWI-Basic-Routecard.pdf\">Basic Route Card</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://boreal.net/resources/pdfs/BWI-Routecard.pdf\">Leg by Leg Route Card</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2166\nCached time: 20180913143929\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.013 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 31/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:4625156-0!canonical and timestamp 20180913143929 and revision id 712717022\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Hiking"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Navigation"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Aids_to_navigation"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cliff"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Cloud"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Compass"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Fog"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"GPS"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hillock"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Hillwalker"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lake"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Naismith's Rule"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Navigation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Patrol"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Radio"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Soldier"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Stream"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Telephone"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tent"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.simonstewart.ie/Turks/turk_nw.htm","http://www.expedition-info.com/moon-route-card","http://boreal.net/resources/pdfs/BWI-Basic-Routecard.pdf","http://boreal.net/resources/pdfs/BWI-Routecard.pdf"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Core information: The planned route","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Route_card","byteoffset":204,"anchor":"Core_information:_The_planned_route"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Additional information","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Route_card","byteoffset":1343,"anchor":"Additional_information"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Use of route cards","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Route_card","byteoffset":2012,"anchor":"Use_of_route_cards"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Use of Moon route cards","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Route_card","byteoffset":2916,"anchor":"Use_of_Moon_route_cards"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"5","index":"5","fromtitle":"Route_card","byteoffset":3460,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Route card","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7371567"}]}}
