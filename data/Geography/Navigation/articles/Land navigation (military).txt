Land navigation, or orienteering, is the military term for the study of traversing through unfamiliar terrain by foot or in a land vehicle. Land navigation includes the ability to read maps, use a compass, and other navigational skills.   Land navigation courses are an essential part of military training.  Often, these courses are several miles long in rough terrain and are performed under adverse conditions, such as at night or in the rain.  In the late 19th century, land navigation developed into the sport of orienteering.  The earliest use of the term 'orienteering' appears to be in 1886.  Nordic military garrisons began orienteering competitions in 1895.  In the United States military, land navigation courses are required for the Marine Corps  and the Army.  Air Force escape and evasion training includes aspects of land navigation. Army Field Manual 3-25.26 is devoted to land navigation.
