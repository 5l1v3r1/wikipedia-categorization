Summer draft is a naval term for the worst-case loaded draft a ship can have. This draft is corrected for the worst-case seasonal conditions (summer in this case). During summer the water is warmer, and thus less dense and expands slightly: see Thermal expansion. This makes ships float deeper in the water. Summer draft is the opposite of Light ship condition.
