The GPS2SMS term describes the transfer of co-ordinates of an object or person by means of SMS text messaging. For this, the following applications are suitable: SMS messages can be sent from any device that has a GSM modem or phone and a GPS receiver. There are commercial handheld devices in the market, built-in systems for vehicles, software for computers or mobile devices, as well as some homebuilding projects, such as a small device that connects a mobile phone with a GPS. For the detection of theft of a vehicle, a device may be used which sends an SMS alert to the monitor coordinates of the object, as soon as it leaves a particular area.
