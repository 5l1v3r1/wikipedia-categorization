Navigational instruments refers to the instruments used by nautical navigators and pilots as tools of their trade. The purpose of navigation is to ascertain the present position and to determine the speed, direction etc. to arrive at the port or point of destination. These instruments are used primarily to measure the elevation or altitude of a celestial object: These instruments are also used to measure the angular distance between objects: All those mentioned were the traditional instruments used until well into the second half of the 20th century.  After World War II electronic aids to navigation developed very rapidly and, to a great extent, replaced more traditional tools. Electronic speed and depth finders have totally replaced their older counterparts.  Radar has become widespread even in small boats.  Some Electronic aids to navigation like LORAN have already become obsolete themselves and have been replaced by GPS.
