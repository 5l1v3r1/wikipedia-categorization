Windage is a force created on an object by friction when there is relative movement between air and the object. Windage loss is the reduction in efficiency due to windage forces. There are two causes of windage: The term can refer to: Aerodynamic streamlining can be used to reduce windage. There is a hydrodynamic effect similar to windage. In firearms parlance, the word windage refers to the sight adjustment used to compensate for the horizontal deviation of the projectile trajectory from the intended point of impact due to wind drift or Coriolis effect.  By contrast, the adjustment for the vertical deviation is the elevation.  Kentucky windage refers to the practice of aiming to one side of the target to adjust for wind, without changing the existing settings on the gunsight.  Windage can also refer to the difference in diameter between the bore and the shot, especially in muskets and cannons.  In automotive parlance, windage refers to parasitic drag on the crankshaft due to sump oil splashing on the cranktrain during rough driving, and/or dissipating energy in turbulence from the cranktrain moving the crankcase gas and oil mist at high RPM. Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump and back to the oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.
