Navigational algorithms is a source of information whose purpose is to make available the scientific part of the art of navigation, containing specialized articles and software that implements the various procedures of calculus. The topics covered are: Include articles about piloting and astronavigation: Corrections for sextant altitude, Sight Reduction with calculator-Form & Plotting sheet for celestial LoPs, Celestial Fix - 2 LoPs, Celestial Fix - n LoPs NA Sight Reduction algorithm, Vector equation of the Circle of equal altitude, Vector Solution for the intersection of two Circles of Equal Altitude, Sight Reduction - Matrix solution. Include papers about introduction to navigation, tides, naval kinematics, weather and oceanography This section gives a brief description of the free programs available for navigation. Run under Windows XP, (maybe under 95/98/2000/NT) Ephemerides of the celestial bodies used in navigation. Astronavigation solution for sight reduction for n observations made with a marine sextant & running fixes The algorithms implemented are: For n = 2 observations For n â‰¥ 2 observations Any measure of course made with a magnetic compass must be corrected because of the magnetic declination or local variation.
