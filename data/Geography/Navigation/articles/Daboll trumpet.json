Daboll, granted June 26, 1860</div></div></div>\n<p>A <b>Daboll trumpet</b> is an air trumpet <a href=\"/wiki/Foghorn\" title=\"Foghorn\">foghorn</a> which was developed by an American, <a href=\"/wiki/Celadon_Leeds_Daboll\" title=\"Celadon Leeds Daboll\">Celadon Leeds Daboll</a>, of <a href=\"/wiki/New_London,_Connecticut\" title=\"New London, Connecticut\">New London</a>, Connecticut.  It was basically a small coal-fired <a href=\"/wiki/Hot_air_engine\" title=\"Hot air engine\">hot air engine</a>, which compressed air in a cylinder on top of which was a reed horn.\n</p><p>The Daboll trumpet, consists of a steel reed vibrating within a horn, which uses the hot air engine to force cold air by means of an air pump into a boiler, from which it escapes into the horn through a valve, causing the vibrations of the reed, which are regulated by an automatic cam.\n</p><p>Daboll's cousin, Charles Miner Daboll (1823-), inventor of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Daboll_bushing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Daboll bushing (page does not exist)\">Daboll bushing</a>, is credited with developing the Daboll trumpet for practical use.\n</p><p>The following citation is from: <i>Scientific American Supplement</i>, Vol. XIX, No. 470, Jan. 3, 1885.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Daboll trumpet was invented by Mr. C.L. Daboll, of\nConnecticut, who was experimenting to meet the announced wants of the\nUnited States Lighthouse Board. The largest consists of a huge trumpet\nseventeen feet long, with a throat three and one-half inches in diameter,\nand a flaring mouth thirty-eight inches across. In the trumpet is a\nresounding cavity, and a tongue-like steel reed ten inches long, two and\nthree-quarter inches wide, one inch thick at its fixed end, and half that\nat its free end. Air is condensed in a reservoir and driven through the\ntrumpet by hot air or steam machinery at a pressure of from fifteen to\ntwenty pounds, and is capable of making a shriek which can be heard at a\ngreat distance for a certain number of seconds each minute, by about\none-quarter of the power expended in the case of the whistle. In all his\nexperiments against and at right angles and at other angles to the wind,\nthe trumpet stood first and the whistle came next in power. In the trial\nof the relative power of various instruments made by Gen. Duane in 1874,\nthe twelve-inch whistle was reported as exceeding the first-class Daboll\ntrumpet. Beaseley reports that the trumpet has done good work at various\nBritish stations, making itself heard from five to ten miles. The engineer\nin charge of the lighthouses of Canada says: \"The expense for repairs, and\nthe frequent stoppages to make these repairs during the four years they\ncontinued in use, made them [the trumpets] expensive and unreliable. The\nfrequent stoppages during foggy weather made them sources of danger\ninstead of aids to navigation. The sound of these trumpets has\ndeteriorated during the last year or so.\" Gen. Duane, reporting as to his\nexperiments in 1881, says: \"The Daboll trumpet, operated by a caloric\nengine, should only be employed in exceptional cases, such as at stations\nwhere no water can be procured, and where from the proximity of other\nsignals it may be necessary to vary the nature of the sound.\" Thus it\nwould seem that the Daboll trumpet is an exceptionally fine instrument,\nproducing a sound of great penetration and of sufficient power for\nordinary practical use, but that to be kept going it requires skillful\nmanagement and constant care.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Congress made an appropriation in 1860 authorizing the Light-House Board to make\nexperiments with \"Daboll's trumpet and other ear signals,\" but nothing was done until some time later.\"\n</p><p>Daboll's trumpet were installed at the following during trials:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Ann_Light\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cape Ann Light\">Cape Ann Light</a> - Thatcher's Island ..... \" June 30, 1869</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Execution_Rocks_Light\" title=\"Execution Rocks Light\">Execution Rocks Light</a> - Long Island Sound January 25, 1869</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Monhegan_Island_Light\" title=\"Monhegan Island Light\">Monhegan Island Light</a> - <a href=\"/wiki/Manana_Island_Sound_Signal_Station\" title=\"Manana Island Sound Signal Station\">Manana Island Sound Signal Station</a>, Maine, April 4, 1870</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Boston_Light\" title=\"Boston Light\">Boston Light</a> - Boston, Massachusetts, October 29, 1871</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Portland_Head_Light\" title=\"Portland Head Light\">Portland Head Light</a>-Portland, Maine November, 1871</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Montauk_Point_Light\" title=\"Montauk Point Light\">Montauk Point Light</a> - <a href=\"/wiki/Long_Island\" title=\"Long Island\">Long Island</a> May 1, 1873</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Highland_Light\" title=\"Highland Light\">Highland Light</a> - <a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Cod\" title=\"Cape Cod\">Cape Cod</a> June 23, 1873<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Daboll_trumpet&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">History of American Steam Navigation, John H.
