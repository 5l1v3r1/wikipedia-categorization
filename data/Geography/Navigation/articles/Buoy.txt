A buoy (/ˈbɔɪ/ or  US: /ˈbuːiː/) is a floating device that can have many purposes. It can be anchored (stationary) or allowed to drift with ocean currents. The word, of Old French or Middle Dutch origin, is in British English most commonly pronounced /ˈbɔɪ/ (identical to boy, as in buoyant). In American English the pronunciation is closer to "boo-ee."
