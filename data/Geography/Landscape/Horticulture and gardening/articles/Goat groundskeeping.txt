Goat groundskeeping is the use of goats to eat vegetation as a form of landscape maintenance or conservation grazing.  As goats are herd animals, several goats are usually used together and so companies such as California Grazing, Eco-Goats and Rent A Goat exist to rent such herds out, as needed.   This may be expensive and their smell may be a nuisance.  Chattannooga, TN and Spartanburg, SC have used goats to control kudzu, an invasive plant species prevalent in the southeastern United States.
