Pot-in-pot is a type of system used in plant nurseries.  Plants are planted in pots that will accommodate their point-of-sale size, and those pots are placed into slightly larger pots planted in a field.  These pots are usually planted in long rows in large fields.  The larger pots are usually connected to a central irrigation system, and often fertilized through this system as well.  When the plants have grown to their point-of-sale size, they can be removed in their pots and sold immediately.  The larger pots (also called socket pots) remain in the field to be reused. This system allows growers to offset labor costs associated with planting and re-planting in the field with a significant initial investment.
