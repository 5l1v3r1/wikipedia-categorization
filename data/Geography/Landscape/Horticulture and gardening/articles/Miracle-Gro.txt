Miracle-Gro usually refers to a plant food brand made by Scotts Miracle-Gro Company.  It is commonly used in gardens and houseplants because Miracle-Gro provides nutrients to plants that are otherwise depleted from the soil over time. This allows plants fed with Miracle-Gro to grow faster than unfertilized plants because Miracle-Gro provides readily available material for plants to use in the production of new plant cell structures.  One of the main components of this fertilizer is nitrogen derived from ammonium and nitrates. Miracle-Gro fertilizers come in different ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Miracle-Gro for flowers has a 15-30-15 ratio, meaning that there is 15% nitrogen, 30% phosphorus, and 15% potassium by weight.  The original Miracle-Gro was developed and launched by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in the late 1940s.  Hagedorn created the product brand name and its distinctive package design. Horace Hagedorn died in 2006, just short of his 90th birthday. Otto Stern, the co-founder, was the uncle of noted historian Fritz Stern. In "The Five Germanys I Have Known," Fritz Stern mentions his very rich uncle Otto who had invented Miracle-Gro. Miracle-Gro has several different fertilizer mixes which include: All Purpose (24-8-16), Rose (18-24-16), Flowers (15-30-15), Trees & Shrubs (15-10-9) and Tomato (18-18-21). Note, these values are based on water-soluble dry mix or tree spikes, not on ready to feed fertilizer values.  Miracle-Gro also makes a variety of products including hose feeders, soils, and weed controls.
