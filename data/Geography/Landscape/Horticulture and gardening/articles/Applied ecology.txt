Applied ecology is a subfield within ecology, which considers the application of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions.  It is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management.  It is also called ecological or environmental technology.  Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.
