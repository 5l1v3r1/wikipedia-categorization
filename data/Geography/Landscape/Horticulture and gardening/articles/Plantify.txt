The plant shop supplies over 3150 plants sourced from small British growers and hosts a Plant Finder encyclopedia and free garden design tool.

The Badger Beer Garden, and  The 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' garden designed by Bestique's garden designer, Anoushka Feiler won three awards; Best in Show, a Gold medal and the People's Choice award.  Plantify had serious problems with customer service in 2015.  The company attributed this to a move of premises which appears to have been very poorly organised. They ceased trading in early June 2015. This notice appeared on their website. "As you may be aware we have struggled to meet our normal customer service standards following the short notice move of our packing area. Despite the best efforts of our small team over the last few weeks, we are simply unable to recover from this devastating move fast enough. We have thus made the decision to stop trading. If you have an order outstanding, please refer to your credit card company or PayPal who will arrange a refund."   has been featured in newspapers including the Saturday Telegraph   and Sunday Telegraph,  women’s and gardening magazines   and on radio.   Independent reviews through blogs have also featured plantify.co.uk from both amateur and professional gardeners alike.          20) The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/oct/08/showcase-marketing-pr-plantify 21) The Horticulture Week Magazine http://www.hortweek.com/Landscape/article/1187050/Horticultural-society-appoints-Plantify-create-floral-triumphant-arch-coronation-commemoration-gift
