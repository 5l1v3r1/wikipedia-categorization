Foodscaping, sometimes called edible landscaping or front yard farming,  is a type of landscaping in which all or major areas of a lawn on private property or sometimes public property are used to grow food.   It has been considered as a hybrid between farming and landscaping in the sense of having an "all-encompassing way of growing a garden, feeding yourself, and making it look pretty"  with an "integrative landscape".  Grass and shrubberies are replaced with berry bushes or other plants which yield fruits and vegetables which can mean lower bills at the grocery store.  In contrast to having a backyard vegetable garden or raised bed for flowers or other enclosed or fenced-in space where fruits and vegetables are grown, foodscaping is more extensive, with "implementation of edible foods into the landscape."  Instead of just planting shrubs, trees, vines, grasses and ground covers, foodscaping involves adding edible plants that add interest, color, texture and, of course, taste.Foodscaping became more widely practiced as a response to high food prices as well as the economic downturn of 2008.    Sometimes it requires planting to take advantage of natural flows of water, which is sometimes called waterscaping.
