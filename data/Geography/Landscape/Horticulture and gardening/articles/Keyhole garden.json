The indentation allows gardeners to add uncooked vegetable scraps, <a href=\"/wiki/Greywater\" title=\"Greywater\">greywater</a>, and manure into a <a href=\"/wiki/Compost\" title=\"Compost\">composting</a> basket that sits in the center of the bed. In this way, composting materials can be added to the basket throughout the growing season to provide nutrients for the plants. The upper layer of soil is hilled up against the center basket so the soil slopes gently down from the center to the sides. Most keyhole gardens rise about one meter above the ground and have walls made of stone. The stone wall not only gives the garden its form, but helps trap moisture within the bed. Keyhole gardens originated in <a href=\"/wiki/Lesotho\" title=\"Lesotho\">Lesotho</a> and are well adapted to dry <a href=\"/wiki/Arid\" title=\"Arid\">arid</a> lands and deserts.  In Africa they are positioned close to the kitchen and used to raise <a href=\"/wiki/Leafy_greens\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leafy greens\">leafy greens</a> such as lettuce, kale, and spinach; herbs; and <a href=\"/wiki/Root_crop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Root crop\">root crops</a> such as onions, garlic, carrots, and beets. Keyhole gardens are ideal for intensive planting, a technique in which plants are placed close together to maximize production. Plants with wide reaching root systems such as tomatoes and zucchini may not perform well in a keyhole garden.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG/220px-St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG/330px-St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG/440px-St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3264\" data-file-height=\"2448\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:St_Ann%27s_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A keyhole garden at St Ann's Community Orchard, <a href=\"/wiki/Nottingham\" title=\"Nottingham\">Nottingham</a></div></div></div>\n<p>The keyhole garden was developed in Lesotho by the Consortium for Southern Africa Food Security Emergency (C-SAFE), based upon a design that originated with <a href=\"/wiki/CARE_(relief_agency)\" title=\"CARE (relief agency)\">CARE</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Zimbabwe\" title=\"Zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a>. In the mid-1990s Lesotho had one of the highest AIDS/HIV rates in the world. C-SAFE designed the keyhole garden for people who suffered from AIDS or were otherwise unable to tend a traditional garden.  They are tall enough that people don\u2019t have to bend over while working in them; sturdy enough that a person who is weak can lean against them while they work; and are small enough that the entire bed is within arm\u2019s reach. The garden is constructed using layers of compost, manure, wood ash and other nutrient rich materials so they are more productive than most home gardens; and they hold water making them <a href=\"/wiki/Drought\" title=\"Drought\">drought</a> resistant. The walls can be made of common stones picked up from a field, cinderblocks, bricks, or any material strong enough to hold in the soil. Clean water is used when watering the plants on the surface, while household greywater is poured down into the compost basket.\n</p><p>While they are designed for people who were too sick to tend a traditional garden, because they were so productive, people in good health started building them as <a href=\"/wiki/Kitchen_garden\" title=\"Kitchen garden\">kitchen gardens</a>. Here the family could grow its high value crops using <a href=\"/wiki/Succession_planting\" title=\"Succession planting\">succession planting</a>.  In the end C-SAFE helped build over 20,000 keyhole gardens, and when they returned a couple of years later, more than 90% were still in use. Today keyhole gardens are found in many places throughout Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Sudan, and Nigeria.\n</p><p>African style keyhole gardens have been built in Texas and other places in the US. The Texas <a href=\"/wiki/Master_Gardeners\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Master Gardeners\">Master Gardeners</a> Association has put on several workshops to promote them. They have modified the basic design, having standardized on a 6-foot wide bed with a 12-inch tube made of rabbit fencing or chicken wire for the compost basket. It is common in Texas to add <a href=\"/wiki/Eisenia_fetida\" title=\"Eisenia fetida\">red-wiggler worms</a> to the compost basket to help break down the organic matter.\n</p><p>The term \"keyhole garden\" is also used in <a href=\"/wiki/Permaculture\" title=\"Permaculture\">permaculture</a> to describe a garden bed that has been laid out with one or more paths that dead-end rather than continuing through, in order to reduce the area of paths. Permaculture keyhole gardens tend to be wider and flatter than the African variety and do not generally incorporate a compost basket or compost pile built into the bed. The tall beds that incorporate compost are referred to as \"banana circles\" by permaculturalists.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Keyhole_garden&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Raised-bed_gardening\" title=\"Raised-bed gardening\">Raised-bed gardening</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Square_foot_gardening\" title=\"Square foot gardening\">Square foot gardening</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1300\nCached time: 20180909215129\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.048 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.071 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 84/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4015/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 12/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.020/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   51.412      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   51.412      1 -total\n 64.02%   32.915      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:17747808-0!canonical and timestamp 20180909215129 and revision id 843977206\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"ar","url":"https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9_%D8%AB%D9%82%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD","langname":"Arabic","autonym":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629","*":"\u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062b\u0642\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062d"},{"lang":"de","url":"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%BCssellochgarten","langname":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","*":"Schl\u00fcssellochgarten"},{"lang":"fr","url":"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_en_trou_de_serrure","langname":"French","autonym":"fran\u00e7ais","*":"Jardin en trou de serrure"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2018"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Composting"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Horticulture_and_gardening"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Organic_gardening"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Sustainable_food_system"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from January 2018"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Arid"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"CARE (relief agency)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Compost"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Drought"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Eisenia fetida"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Greywater"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kitchen garden"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Leafy greens"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lesotho"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Master Gardeners"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Nottingham"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Permaculture"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Raised-bed gardening"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Root crop"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Square foot gardening"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Succession planting"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Zimbabwe"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg","St_Ann's_Community_Orchard_African_keyhole_bed_1304.JPG"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Keyhole_garden","byteoffset":3977,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Keyhole garden","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q23581343"}]}}
