Mosaiculture is the horticultural art of creating giant topiary-like sculptures using thousands of annual bedding plants to carpet steel armature forms.  It is different from classical topiary.  Mosaïcultures Internationales® is the name of an international competition governed by the International Mosaiculture Committee, which was formed in 2000, the first year the event was staged. Mosaïcultures Internationales® is an internationally protected name and patent.  In 2013 an international competition in Mosaicultures was held in Montreal, Canada.  As part of Canada's 150th anniversary celebrations in 2017, a large exhibition of Mosaiculture was held at Jacques Cartier Park in Gatineau, Quebec. MOSAICANADA150 featured sculptures representing Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories, and indigenous peoples.  In 2018, many of the sculptures will be moved to their home province to be displayed.   Lise Cormier, head of the City of Montréal's Parks, Gardens and Green Spaces Department and the Botanical Garden, first got the idea to launch an international mosaiculture competition in 1998.
