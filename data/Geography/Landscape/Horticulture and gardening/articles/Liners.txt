"Liners" is a horticultural term referring to trays of very young plants, usually grown for sale to retailers or wholesalers, who then grow them to a larger size before selling them to consumers.  Liners are usually grown from seed, but may also be grown from cuttings or tissue culture.  They are grown in plastic trays with many "cells," each of which contains a single liner plant.
