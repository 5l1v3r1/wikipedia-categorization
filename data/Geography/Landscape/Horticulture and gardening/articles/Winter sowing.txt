Winter sowing is a method of starting seeds outdoors in winter. This is generally done with seeds that require a period of cold stratification. The method takes advantage of natural temperatures, rather than artificially refrigerating seeds. Winter sowing involves sowing seeds in a miniature greenhouse outside during winter, allowing them to germinate in spring. Users of this method have had success in most hardiness zones. There are many advantages to winter sowing: Anything that is translucent enough to allow light to pass through and that can be made to have drainage holes, a lid, and a ventilation hole(s) can be used for winter sowing. Options include, but are not limited to, plastic jugs,  water or soda bottles, take out containers, disposable foil pans with plastic covers, clamshell containers, disposable beverage cups, plastic tubs,  and plastic totes.
