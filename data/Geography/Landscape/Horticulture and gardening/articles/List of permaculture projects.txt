A consortium of NGOs including Lom Orng  and Ockenden  is doing a post-flood livelihood and infrastructure regeneration project, in the country's northwest, which includes permaculture principles, and the establishment of a permaculture demonstration farm in Battambang Province which serves as a community farm and education site and includes a native tree nursery and biogas system providing clean cooking fuel and lighting.  A Facebook Permaculture Cambodia page list various Permaculutre projects in the Cambodia region and the proprietors. The Himalayan Permaculture Centre (HPC) is a grass roots non-government organisation (NGO) set up by trained and motivated farmers from Surkhet district (Mid-Western Nepal) in 2010 to implement sustainable rural development programs in Nepal.  The Al Baydha Project, a land restoration and rural community development program in Western Saudi Arabia. GROL Garden - Girne: An Urban Permaculture Project that accepts Volunteers who come under a work-exchange agreement. GROL Garden provides food, accommodation, yoga classes, and hands-on learning in exchange for assistance on their Projects.    Red de Permacultura Ib√©rica (Iberic Permaculture Network)  In Portugal there are several Permaculture projects. There's a bottom-up initiative that is mapping most of them called Rede CONVERGIR.  There are a number of example permaculture projects in the UK, including: Other projects tend to be more community oriented, particularly in urban areas. These include Naturewise, a north London based group that tends a number of forest gardens and allotments as well as running regular permaculture introductory and design courses;  and Organiclea, a workers cooperative that is involved in developing local food-growing and distribution initiatives around the Walthamstow area of east London.  The Transition Towns movement initiated in Totnes and Kinsale by Rob Hopkins is underpinned by permaculture design principles in its attempts to visualise sustainable communities beyond peak oil.  The UK Permaculture Association publishes an extensive directory of other projects and example sites throughout the country. The Permaculture Association of Teachers and Organizers on WiserEarth maintains a US listing.  Maya Mountain Research Farm in San Pedro Columbia, Toledo, Belize, is a permaculture project founded in 1988 by Christopher Nesbitt on a 70-acre abandoned citrus and cattle land. The land is up the Columbia Branch of Rio Grande from the Kekchi maya community. Presently the farm manages over 500 species of plants. The farm works on agroecology, permaculture, stacked polycultures and installs photovoltaic systems in schools in indigenous communities as well as protected areas. The farm works closely with farmers organizations and holds one Permaculture Design Course per year. Saint Michaels Sustainable Community started building their Permaculture Ranch in 2001 in the mountains of Esterillos, Costa Rica 3.5 Kilometers from the beach. By 2015 they have become internationally recognized model of regenerative agriculture. The building of the community was accomplished by interns, volunteers, woofers, ecological experts, a NASA scientist,agriculture students, permaculturists, local farmers, and environmentalists (some that formerly worked for oil companies)and a regenerative rancher, Justin Dolan. Under Dolans' leadership five living roof homes have been designed and built using permaculture principals and two other homes have been built with rainwater harvesting roofs.  A natural salt water swimming pools was installed in a food forest containing over hundreds of types of fruits, medicinal herbs, a free energy aquaponics system, 12 rotational pastures, chickens, lambs, a herd of cattle, reforestation, an equestrian center, organic orchards, and a disc golf course. The Community is home to the Permaculture Country Club of Costa Rica (PCC). The club teaches a Journeyman Apprentice Program.

It is a not-for-profit community organization focused on the development of self-sufficient communities through the responsible management of natural resources, using permaculture techniques and ancestral and traditional knowledge. Areas of focus include: the cultural and biological diversity of Mesoamerica; food security and food sovereignty; organic production systems at the community and familial level; and permaculture education and environmental stewardship. Since 1993, Cuba has transformed its food production using low-input, or organic agriculture and, to some degree, permaculture. Havana produces up to 50% of its food requirements within the city limits, much of it organic and produced by people in their homes, gardens and in municipal spaces  The transformation in agriculture originated as a response to a crisis which is known as the Special Period. Starting in 1993 Australian permaculturists traveled to Cuba to educate Cuban gardeners in permaculture practices.   The movement of sustainable communities in Ecuador reflects a bit the fact that it sits on the halfway mark of the Earth: it is neither invisible nor well defined, though small, it has many projects, although they are not necessarily part of a functional network.
