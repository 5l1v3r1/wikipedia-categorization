Gumbo soil is a mixture which often has some small amounts of sand and/or organic material, but is typically defined by the overwhelming presence of very fine particles of clay    Although gumbo soils are exceptional at water retention, they can be difficult to farm, as precipitation will turn gumbo into a unique muddy fiasco that is challenging to work using large commercial farming equipment. Avoiding tillage of this type of soil, thru "no-till" farming, appears strongly correlated to higher yields versus more traditional tilling practices.
