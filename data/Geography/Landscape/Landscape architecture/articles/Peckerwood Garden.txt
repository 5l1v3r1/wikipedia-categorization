Peckerwood Garden is a Garden Conservancy garden located in Hempstead, Texas.  The garden was founded by John G. Fairey, who gathered seeds of rare and endangered plants through a series of expeditions into Mexico, and created an aesthetic setting for them at Peckerwood Garden. The garden is located between Austin and Houston, and sits at the border of three climatic zones, supporting a wide-ranging collection of plants native to the southern United States, Mexico, and Asia. The arboretum brings together examples of many different species of acer, ilex, liquidambar, magnolia, styrax, taxus, quercus, many of which are recent plant discoveries from remote mountain ranges in Mexico.  It also features outdoor sculptures and a collection of folk art from Mexico and the United States. In 1998, with guidance from the Garden Conservancy, the non-profit Peckerwood Garden Conservation Foundation was formed to ensure the preservation and continued development of the garden and its educational and conservation projects.  The Foundation's goals include preserving existing collections, supporting continued plant explorations and trials, and developing, maintaining and preserving the land and facilities of Peckerwood Garden.  Peckerwood Garden now sells seeds online. At their onsite nursery, many of the plants found in the garden can be purchased. The garden is open on selected weekends, and no appointment is needed.  It is open for private tours all year - by appointment.
