The Country Place Era was a period, from about 1890 to 1930, of American landscape architecture design during which wealthy Americans commissioned extensive gardens at their country estates, emulating European gardens that the Americans had seen in their European travels.  An example is Castle Hill in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Landscape architects that were involved included Charles Gillette, Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles Adam Platt, and Beatrix Farrand.  Marian Cruger Coffin, an early female architect, was another partipant.
