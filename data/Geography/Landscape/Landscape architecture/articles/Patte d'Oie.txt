Patte d'oie describes a design whereby three, four, or five straight roads or paths radiate out from a central point, so called from its resemblance to a goose's foot. Common in French formal gardens, the patte d'oie may have originated in town planning schemes where roads converged onto a single space or feature, such as the Piazza del PÃ²polo in Rome.
