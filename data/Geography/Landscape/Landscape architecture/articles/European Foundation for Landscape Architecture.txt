Membership of EFLA is open to national associations for landscape architecture in countries which are members of the Council of Europe. EFLA constitutes the European Region of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA). It also works closely with ECLAS (the European Council of Landscape Architecture Schools) and ELASA (the European Landscape Architecture Students' Association), and participates in the Le:Notre thematic network.
