Sambal-Lei Sekpil is the world's tallest topiary.  Created by Moirangthem Okendra Kumbi, it is modelled in the shape of a series of open umbrellas and spheres.  Okendra started mending the Sambal-Lei in 1983, originally planted by his sister in a small mustard oil can.  Sambal-Lei is a flowering shrub use for fencing gardens in Manipur - Sambal means fencing and Lei means flower in Meitei language. Sekpil indicates the shape of the topiary and is derived from an ancient Meitei word for a decorative bamboo post with rounded structured cloths forming canopy in many stages. The sekpil, at present also called as "Shattra" is generally used in worship and festivals in Manipur.
