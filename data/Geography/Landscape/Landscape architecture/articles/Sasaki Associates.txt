Sasaki is a global design firm specializing in architecture, interior design, planning, urban design, landscape architecture, strategic planning, graphic design, and civil engineering.   Sasaki was founded in 1953 by acclaimed landscape architect, Hideo Sasaki in Watertown, Massachusetts, while he served as a professor and landscape architecture department chair at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  When Sasaki partnered with Peter Walker in 1957 the firm became Sasaki, Walker and Associates. In 1959, Walker opened up a new branch of the firm in San Francisco, and in 1964 the Watertown location was renamed Sasaki, Dawnson & DeMay.  Sasaki, Dawson and DeMay redesigned Copley Square in 1970.   The firm's work includes Christopher Columbus Park (also called the Waterfront Park) and the plaza at the First Church of Christ.  Sasaki won an international design competition for the 2008 Beijing Olympics Green. The design included over 1,700 acres of woods and wetlands. Alan Ward was the lead landscape architect.   Sasaki principal Dennis Pieprz also wanted the Olympic Green design to be useful in the long-term.  The Olympic Forest Park is Beijing's largest public green space.  Led by Sasaki Principals Michael Grove, Mark Dawson, and Tao Zhang, the firm opened its Shanghai office in 2012 where it worked on influential projects including the 798 Art Zone, the master plan for Suzhou Creek, and a vision plan for the Songzhuang art colony.
