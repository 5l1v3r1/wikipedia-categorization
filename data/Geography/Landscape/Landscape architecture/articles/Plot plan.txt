A plot plan is an architecture, engineering, and/or landscape architecture plan drawingâ€”diagram which shows the buildings, utility runs, and equipment layout, the position of roads,  and other constructions of an existing or proposed project site at a defined scale.  Plot plans are also known more commonly as site plans. The plot plan is a 'top-down' orientation. The specific objects and relations shown are dependent on the purpose for creating the plot plan, but typically contain: retained and proposed  buildings, landscape elements, above ground features and obstructions, major infrastructure routes, and critical legal considerations such as property boundaries, setbacks, and rights of way. Specific design disciplines' plot plans can be part of a complex project's documents, such as grading, landscape, foundation engineering, and utilities (e.g. in architecture, a plot plan drawing shows all the major features and structures on a piece of property like: buildings, porches, decks, sheds, swimming pool, etc.).
