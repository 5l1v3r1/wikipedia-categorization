The landscape architecture firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, and later of his sons John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. (known as the Olmsted Brothers), produced designs and plans for hundreds of parks, campuses and other projects throughout the United States and Canada. This is an non-exhaustive list of those projects. Olmsted designed numerous school and college campuses between 1857 and 1895. From 1895 to 1950, the Olmsted Brothers (his successors) added to some of their father's initial projects, as well as designing new ones. (See § Olmsted Brothers for those projects.) Together, these works totaled 355. Some of the most famous of Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. are listed here. After the retirement of Frederick Law Olmsted Sr in 1895, the firm was managed by John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., as Olmsted and Olmsted, Olmsted Olmsted and Eliot, and Olmsted Brothers. Works from this period are often misattributed to Frederick Sr.
