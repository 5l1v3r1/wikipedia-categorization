The original city of Gibellina was completely destroyed in the 1968 Belice earthquake.  Gibellina has since been rebuilt, about 20 km from the city's original location.  In 2015 to mark what would have been Burri's one hundredth birthday the work was completed at last.  The work is the subject of a short documentary by the Dutch filmmaker Petra Noordkamp which was created as commissioned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum to be screened at the Alberto Burri retrospective held at the institution from October 9, 2015 until January 6, 2016.
