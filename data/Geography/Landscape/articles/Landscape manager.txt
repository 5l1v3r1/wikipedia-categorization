Landscape managers are professionally trained and qualified experts in landscaping management for conservation and recreation stewardship of designed and natural landscapes. Landscape managers work with designed landscapes, such as public parks, private gardens and public botanic gardens, and golf courses and sports centers. They also work with natural landscapes, such as nature reserves, natural open space parks, and national parks. The United Kingdom Landscape Institute has a landscape management division whose members describe themselves as landscape architects. There are undergraduate degree programs leading to qualifications in landscape management and membership of professional institutes. In the United States 4-year undergraduate degrees are offered for dual majors of Construction management and Ornamental horticulture or Landscape architecture.
