The Botanical garden of Upper Brittany (French: Jardin botanique de Haute-Bretagne) is a private estate, open to the public, with an area of 25 hectares, located in the Ille-et-Vilaine department of  Brittany, near the medieval city of Fougères. The park is part of the estate of "La Foltière", where stands the "Château de la Foltière", built in 1847. The Botanical garden of Upper Brittany is located on the village of Le Châtellier (Ille-et-Vilaine), approximately 10 kilometers from the city of Fougères, between Rennes and the Mont Saint-Michel, near the A84 motorway. "Foltiere" is the name of the estate, which means "ground where beech trees grow", the word "fou" being ancient french for "beech tree". The park was created in 1847,  around the Château de la Foltière. In 1796 the old manor house was the headquarters of an uprising against the government of the French Republic led by Count Joseph de Puisaye.  In 1820, the Estate of "La Foltière" is bought by the family Frontin des Buffards.  In 1847, the land surrounding the pond in the park was redesigned as an English romantic landscape garden, with winding paths that follow the terrain, and a view from the lawn in front of the house to the church tower in the village. The botanical park is made up of three parts : The first part : Arcadia refers to classical antiquity and the youthfulness of the garden. The second part represents maturity and plenitude - construction of the manor house and development and perfection of the gardens. Here is a romantic landscape garden where dreams and exotism are part of everyday life. The third part offers a timeless composition which represents the development of the garden, old age and twilight of life. The French Ministry of Culture classified the Parc botanique de Haute-Bretagne as a "Jardin remarquable", Notable gardens of France. The French Ministry of Tourism allotted to the botanical garden the label « Qualité Tourisme » in 2011.
