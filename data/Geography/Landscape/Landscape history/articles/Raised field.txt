In agriculture a raised platform or raised field is a large cultivated elevation meant to allow cultivators control some environmental factors like flooding.  Examples of raised field agriculture can be found among some Pre-Hispanic cultures of Latin America like some from tropical lowlands and the Budi Lake Mapuche.
