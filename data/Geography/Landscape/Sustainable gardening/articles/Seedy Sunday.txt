The titles Seedy Saturday and Seedy Sunday are dedicated to the public domain by the event founder Sharon Rempel (submitted by Sharon Rempel, event founder, wwww.grassrootsolutions.com). The first Seedy Saturday was at the VanDusen Botanical garden in Vancouver B.C. in 1990. The heart of a Seedy Sunday or Seedy Saturday event is the swapping and sale of seeds of landraces, folk varieties, farmer varieties and heritage seed. Sharing information about the social, cultural and culinary aspects of the seed is an important part of heritage seed saving around the world. Providing education about techniques for seed-saving, small-scale agriculture and horticulture, and about local, national and international laws that affect public-domain crop plants can also be an important part of the event. In Canada, Seedy Saturdays and Seed Sundays continue to be locally or regionally organized events. Almost all of these events occur in the late winter, with a few in the autumn.  In 2012 there were more than 100 events held in Canada.  The idea of conserving heritage varieties of garden and field crops was in its infancy in Canada in 1989. It was very difficult to find heritage varieties of vegetables, fruits, flowers and grains.  In 1988 Sharon Rempel wanted to find period-appropriate heritage vegetables,flowers and wheat for the 1880s heritage gardens she was creating at the Keremeos Grist Mill museum. The Abundant Life Seed Foundation in Washington state was her sole source that added the date of the variety with the seed listing. The first Seedy Saturday event was organized by Sharon Rempel.  It was held at the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in spring 1990.
