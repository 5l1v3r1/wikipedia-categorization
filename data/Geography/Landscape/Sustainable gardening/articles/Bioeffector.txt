A Bioeffector  is a viable microorganism or active natural compound which directly or indirectly affects plant performance (Biofertilizer), and thus has the potential to reduce fertilizer and pesticide use in crop production.  Bioeffectors have a direct or indirect effect on plant performance by influencing the functional implementation or activation of biological mechanisms, particularly those interfering with soil-plant-microbe interactions.  In contrast to conventional fertilizers and pesticides, the effectiveness of bioeffectors is not based on a substantial direct input of mineral plant nutrients, either in inorganic or organic forms. Under the Acronym Biofector the European Union supports the Research of Bioeffectors under the leadership of the University of Hohenheim (Coordinator Guenter Neumann). The results of the project will be evaluated by the members of the Association Biostimulants in Agriculture (ABISTA) and provided agriculture for use and EU institutions for the legislative and registration procedures.   Other Biostimulants Organisations are European Biostimulant Industry Council, International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association and Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting.
