Oma forest is a work of art created by Agustin Ibarrola, a Basque sculptor and painter. The work is located in a forest near Kortezubi (Bizkaia, Basque Country), in the natural reserve of Urdaibai. It is also known as the "painted forest". The work follows the modern art trend called “Land art”. Most of the trees are Monterey pines. The projects aims to display the horrible and ghastly harmony between nature and human presence by painting on the trunks of trees, human figures, animals and geometric shapes, some of which are visible only from certain positions. Agustin is a member of “Basta Ya", a group which aims to aid victims of terrorism. Some 100 trees of the natural reserve were destroyed in 2000 and Oma forest was damaged to protest his stand.
