Agricultural and farming practices often require intensive irrigation systems to achieve appropriate production levels. This creates a high demand on waterways as water is diverted and used to irrigate crops and pasture. This decreases the flow rate within the river system, which in turn lowers the sediment carrying capacity of the river as the energy within is less.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Carter,_1987_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Carter,_1987-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  Sediment is deposited along the reach of the river and takes much longer to reach the coastal zone if at all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_on_the_coast\">Effects on the coast</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coastal_sediment_supply&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Effects on the coast\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This changing coastal sediment supply regime leads to predominantly erosional outcomes but it is a case by case, river by river scenario. There are areas where the coastal sediment flux has increased and accretion of the shoreline has been evident. The effects of changing sediment flux can be very localised but pronounced, below are examples within the <a href=\"/wiki/Bohai_Sea\" title=\"Bohai Sea\">Bohai Sea</a>. The <a href=\"/wiki/Yellow_River\" title=\"Yellow River\">Yellow River</a> delta is undergoing an accretion phase while 200&#160;km across the sea the Laun River area has experienced increased erosion rates along the coastline as a result of the changing sediment input.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Accretion\">Accretion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Coastal_sediment_supply&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Accretion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Yellow River transports an order of magnitude more sediment than it did prior to widespread cultivation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Loess_plateau\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Loess plateau\">loess plateaus</a> in northern <a href=\"/wiki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>, about 2400 years ago.

With 45% of the world\u2019s population living within 100&#160;km of a coastline.

This sharp reduction in sediment discharge has been accompanied by phase shift of the Luan River Delta into para-abandonment. This drop in sediment yield has inevitably altered the longshore transport equilibrium in the local coastal area. With prevailing northward winds, shoreline retreat rates north of the Luan River have increased from 1&#160;m/y to 3.7&#160;m/y over twenty-year period since dam construction, rapidly changing the morphology and<sup id=\"cite_ref-Zuo,_2009_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Zuo,_2009-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> beach profile via positive feedback until a new equilibrium was reached, at which the present retreat is back at its original 1&#160;m/y.
