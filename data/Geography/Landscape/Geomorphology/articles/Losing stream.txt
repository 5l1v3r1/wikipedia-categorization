A losing stream, disappearing stream,  influent stream or sinking river is a stream or river that loses water  as it flows downstream. The water  infiltrates into the ground recharging the local groundwater, because the water table is below the bottom of the stream channel. This is the opposite of a more common gaining  stream (or effluent stream) which increases in water volume farther down stream as it gains water from the local aquifer. Losing streams are common in arid areas due to the climate which results in huge amounts of water evaporating from the river generally towards the mouth.  Losing streams are also common in regions of karst topography where the streamwater may be completely captured by an underground cavern system, becoming a subterranean river. There are many natural examples of subterranean rivers including:
