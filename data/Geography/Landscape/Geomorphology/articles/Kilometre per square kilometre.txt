Kilometre per square kilometre is an SI derived unit of reciprocal length used for measurement of density of a linear feature in an area. It is used to measure, for example, drainage density  or road density (i.e. kilometres of road per square kilometre of land).  In the European Union, Kilometer per square kilometer is the unit of measure of transport network density.  According to Europa.eu, Despite having only a small motorway network (91 km), the island of Malta reported the highest motorway network density among all regions of the EU. Usually, the densest motorway networks are found around capital cities and other big cities, in large industrial conurbations and around major sea-ports. The regions with the higher motorway density are: respectively) For cities, most cities are rounded by a motorway ring, so the density metric is dependent on the size of the city: EU-15 had 48.3 km of railways per 1 000 square kilometres in 2000), more than in the United States (30.6 km/1 000 km2 in 1999, including Alaska and Hawaii and inland waters) but less than in Japan (53.5 km/ 1000km2 in 1999) . For rail networkds, in Europe, the highest network density can be found in the Czech Republic, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany (above 100 km/1 000 km²), followed by the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and Poland (65 to 86 km/1 000 km²). At the lower end of the range are Turkey, Norway, Finland and Greece, with values of 20 km/1 000 km² and below .
