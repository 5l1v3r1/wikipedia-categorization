Shear Velocity, also called friction velocity, is a form by which a shear stress may be re-written in units of velocity. It is useful as a method in fluid mechanics to compare true velocities, such as the velocity of a flow in a stream, to a velocity that relates shear between layers of flow. Shear velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe: Shear velocity also helps in thinking about the rate of shear and dispersion in a flow. Shear velocity scales well to rates of dispersion and bedload sediment transport. A general rule is that the shear velocity is between 5% to 10% of the mean flow velocity. For river base case, the shear velocity can be calculated by Manning's equation. Instead of finding                         n                 {\displaystyle n}     and                                    R                        h                                     {\displaystyle R_{h}}     for your specific river of interest, you can examine the range of possible values and note that for most rivers,                                    u                        ∗                                     {\displaystyle u^{*}}     is between 5% and 10% of                         ⟨         u         ⟩                 {\displaystyle \langle u\rangle }    : For general case where τ is the shear stress in an arbitrary layer of fluid and ρ is the density of the fluid. Typically, for sediment transport applications, the shear velocity is evaluated at the lower boundary of an open channel: where τb is the shear stress given at the boundary. Shear velocity can also be defined in terms of the local velocity and shear stress fields (as opposed to whole-channel values, as given above). The friction velocity is often used as a scaling parameter for the fluctuating component of velocity in turbulent flows.  One method of obtaining the shear velocity is through non-dimensionalization of the turbulent equations of motion. For example, in a fully developed turbulent channel flow or turbulent boundary layer, the streamwise momentum equation in the very near wall region reduces to: By integrating in the y-direction once, then non-dimensionalizing with an unknown velocity scale u∗ and viscous length scale ν/u∗, the equation reduces down to: or Since the right hand side is in non-dimensional variables, they must be of order 1. This results in the left hand side also being of order one, which in turn give us a velocity scale for the turbulent fluctuations (as seen above): Here, τw refers to the local shear stress at the wall.  Within the lowest portion of the planetary boundary layer a semi-empirical log wind profile is commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds. The simplified equation that describe it is                         u         (         z         )         =                                                u                                ∗                                         κ                                        [                        ln             ⁡                            (                                                                        z                     −                     d                                                           z                                            0                                                                                       )                                   ]                          {\displaystyle u(z)={\frac {u_{*}}{\kappa }}\left[\ln \left({\frac {z-d}{z_{0}}}\right)\right]}     where                         κ                 {\displaystyle \kappa }     is the Von Kármán constant (~0.41),                         d                 {\displaystyle d}     is the zero plane displacement (in metres). The zero-plane displacement (                        d                 {\displaystyle d}    ) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  It can be approximated as 2/3 to 3/4 of the average height of the obstacles.   For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m. Thus, you can extract the friction velocity by knowing the wind velocity at two levels (z).                                    u                        ∗                             =                                                κ               (               u               (               z               2               )               −               u               (               z               1               )               )                                         ln               ⁡                                (                                                                                z                       2                       −                       d                                                                 z                       1                       −                       d                                                                          )                                                                 {\displaystyle u_{*}={\frac {\kappa (u(z2)-u(z1))}{\ln \left({\frac {z2-d}{z1-d}}\right)}}}
