Tinaja is a term originating in the American Southwest for surface pockets (depressions) formed in bedrock that occur below waterfalls, are carved out by spring flow or seepage,  or are caused by sand and gravel scouring in intermittent streams (arroyos).   Tinajas are an important source of surface water storage in arid environments.     These relatively rare landforms are important ecologically, because they support unique plant communities and provide important services to terrestrial wildlife.
