Following is a list of golf courses designed by Jack Nicklaus and his company Nicklaus Design,  one of the largest golf design practices in the world. In the mid-1960s, Pete Dye initially requested Nicklaus' advice for the design of The Golf Club in suburban Columbus, Ohio. His first design Harbour Town Golf Links, co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969.  A subsequent early, yet more prominent design was Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio which opened in 1974 and has hosted the Memorial Tournament since its inception in 1976. This course has also hosted the 1987 Ryder Cup and the 1998 Solheim Cup matches. For the first few years, all of his projects were co-designs with either Pete Dye or Desmond Muirhead. Nicklaus is in partnership with his four sons and his son-in-law through their company, Nicklaus Design. The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, nearly 1% of all the courses in the world.  While the majority of Nicklaus-designed courses stand in the United States, a significant presence also occupies Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Mexico.
