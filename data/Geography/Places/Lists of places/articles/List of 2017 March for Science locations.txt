 The March for Science was a series of protests that occurred across the United States and around the World on April 22, 2017. The protests were organized due to the perceived hostility of the Trump administration, as well as proposed budget cuts to federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute of Health. A major goal of the march was convincing government officials to adopt policies in-line with the scientific understanding of issues such as climate change and vaccines.
