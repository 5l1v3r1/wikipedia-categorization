 This is a list of social nudity places in Africa. The list includes nude beaches and naturist resorts, where people practise skinny dipping, naked bodysurfing or any other form of nude recreation.   There are no beaches in South Africa where the right to bathe nude is protected. However, Sandy Bay and the Umhlanga Lagoon and Mpenjati beach are beaches where nudity is accepted  and bathers are very unlikely to be prosecuted for simply being naked. Mpenjati beach was approved as a naturist beach by the local town council in charge of the area, however the Public Protector ruled that the proper procedures had not been followed in proclaiming Mpenjati as a naturist beach.   The situation at the other beaches is less certain. Nudist beaches are by nature remote and secluded and it is unfortunate that in South Africa this makes them unsafe as criminals find them ideal for their purposes too. Nudists are advised to try to keep in big groups, singles and couples should exercise a great deal of caution if visiting the lesser known nudist beaches.
