 The 2017 Women's March was a series of political rallies that took place in cities around the world on January 21, 2017, with the goals of: protesting against Donald J. Trump's positions and Presidency; promoting women's rights, immigration reform, climate science, and health care reform; countering religious discrimination, violence against women, and LGBTQ abuse; and addressing racial inequities (e.g. Black Lives Matter), workers' issues, and environmental issues.  Listed below are 680 marches in the U.S. in support of the 2017 Women's March. The march was endorsed by former Texas State Senator and 2014 Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, Texas Representative Senfronia Thompson, and author Lizzie Velasquez, who gave speeches at the Texas State Capital in downtown Austin. Austin Mayor Steve Adler and U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett were also in attendance.  Organizations such as Women Rising and Taylor Collective Solutions, Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, Texas Freedom Network, Progress Texas and Annie's List also endorsed the march.
