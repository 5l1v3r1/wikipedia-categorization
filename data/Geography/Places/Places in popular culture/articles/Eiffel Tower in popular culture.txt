 The Eiffel Tower has appeared frequently in works of fiction because of its iconic nature. Movie critic Roger Ebert has noted in his online column that no matter where in Paris a film scene is set the Eiffel Tower will be visible in the background.  In some cases the tower is the key plot element or a significant plot element. In a notable subtype, the action of all or part of the work centers around the real or threatened destruction of the tower. In another notable sub-type, the tower and its destruction is used as a symbol of the real or threatened destruction of the city, or the world. In others, the tower is used as an embodiment of Paris, the symbol of the city, to set the scene for a film or other work centered on the city. In yet others, as a symbol of the city in a more peripheral way. Other uses, to establish the tower simply as a well known visual element.
