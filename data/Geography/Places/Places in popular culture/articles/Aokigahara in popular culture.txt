Aokigahara is frequently featured in popular culture due to its historic association with "yūrei" or ghosts of the dead in Japanese mythology and is a notoriously common suicide site (wherein 54 took place in 2010).  The forest is said to be the world’s second most popular suicide spot, the first being the Golden Gate Bridge.  The rate of suicide has led officials to place a sign at the forest's entry, written in Japanese, urging suicidal visitors to seek help and not take their own lives. Annual body searches have been conducted by police, volunteers, and attendant journalists since 1970.  This page lists Aokigahara in popular culture from both within Japan and abroad. It is not an exhaustive list of the many games, films, manga and other cultural products that mention Aokigahara. (Alphabetical by author's surname)
