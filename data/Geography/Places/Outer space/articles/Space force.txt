 A space force is a military branch that conducts space warfare. Currently, one country has previously had an independent space force. The Russian Space Forces was an independent organization that existed from 1992 to 1997 and from 2001 to 2011; it was reestablished in 2015 as a branch of the Russian Aerospace Forces.  A space force is almost always a part of the air force, which may function as an air and space force or as an aerospace force, as the United States Air Force does.     In an announcement on June 18, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed the establishment of the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.  On August 9, 2018, United States Vice President Mike Pence announced a plan to create the proposed service by 2020.
