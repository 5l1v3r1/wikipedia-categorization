  Little Compton Street was a street in Soho, London WC2, England. It connected the east end of Old Compton Street at its junction with Charing Cross Road to New Compton Street at Stacey Street. Until 1896, the current eastern section of Old Compton Street (the part east of Greek Street) was known as Little Compton Street.   The section of Little Compton Street between Charing Cross Road and New Compton Street is now blocked by an office block. A street sign for Little Compton Street remains visible on a wall of a utility tunnel beneath a street grate on a traffic island in the middle of the junction of Old Compton Street and Charing Cross Road. Contrary to popular belief, this was a tunnel that previously ran under Little Compton Street, rather than the latter having been "buried."  It now forms part of the Cambridge Circus Utility Tunnels.  Coordinates: 51°30′50.7″N 0°7′44.5″W﻿ / ﻿51.514083°N 0.129028°W﻿ / 51.514083; -0.129028
