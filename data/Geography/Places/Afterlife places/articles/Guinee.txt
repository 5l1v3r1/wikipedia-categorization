In Vodou, Guinee is the spirit world. It is where the souls of the dead live. It is controlled by the loa Baron Samedi, believed to be the symbol of life and death.  There are seven gates through which Guinee can be entered. They are as follows: The spirits of the dead have to pass through these seven gates to be reunited to the already dead ones.  Many practitioners of this faith believe that these seven gates are physically present in different areas in New Orleans.
