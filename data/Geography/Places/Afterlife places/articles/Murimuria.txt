In  pre-Christian Fijian mythology, Murimuria is part of the underworld. After a man dies, his soul is judged by the god called Degei. Those who had the favor of Degei are instructed not to try to cross the lake. These go to Burotu. The rest inevitably try cross the lake by a boat that always capsizes. They eventually sink to the bottom, Murimuria, and are rewarded and punished appropriately.  Murimuria is considered a place neither of happiness, nor of unhappiness. As such, residence in Murimuria is characterized by both punishment and peace.  Some of the souls in Murimuria are punished for sins committed while alive. However, these sins do not necessarily correspond to  Christian notions of sin. For example, those who did not kill in life are forced to pound muck with clubs. Those who did not have their ears pierced are forced to carry upon their shoulders large logs of wood upon which tapa cloth is beaten out. Women who were not tattooed are chased by ghosts who use sharp shells to tear at their skin. Anyone who has done an act which displeases the gods are laid prone and turned into beds.
