Tourist trap is an establishment, or group of establishments, that has been created or re-purposed with the aim of attracting tourists  and their money. Tourist traps will typically provide services, entertainment, food, souvenirs and other products for tourists to purchase. While some establishments may be viewed by tourists as fun and interesting diversions, tourist traps can also have negative connotations when they direct travelers off highways into commercial areas. In some areas, simple facilities may be a sufficient draw to entice tourists to stop. Wall Drug, in South Dakota, began its tourist trade simply by offering ice water.  Breezewood, Pennsylvania represents a physical tourist trap at the intersection of Interstate 70 and Interstate 76, where the two major highways are not directly connected; forcing transiting drivers off the interstate and "into several suddenly urban blocks with traffic lights and a dense bazaar of gas stations, fast food restaurants and motels."  A few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as "Da Yoopers Tourist Trap",  run by the comedy troupe Da Yoopers in Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula, and "The Tourist Trap"  at Deep Creek Lake, Maryland.  Other establishments like The "Trees of Mystery"  in Klamath, California avoid the phrase. Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls is a popular tourist trap in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The street attractions are owned by two entities. The area also extends to a small portion north of Victoria Avenue east and west of Clifton Hill and Centre Street north of Victoria Avenue. There are a large number of "big things" in Australia. Many of those were initially created as Tourist Traps, but have gained cult status in the country since.
