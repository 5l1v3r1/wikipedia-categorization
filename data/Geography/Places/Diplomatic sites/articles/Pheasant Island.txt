 Pheasant Island (Spanish: Isla de los Faisanes, French: Île des Faisans, Basque: Konpantzia) is an uninhabited river island in the Bidasoa river, located between France and Spain and currently administered by the former. The island is a condominium  established by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, under joint sovereignty of Spain and France, and for alternating periods of six months is officially under the governance of the naval commanders of San Sebastián, Spain (1 February – 31 July) and of Bayonne, France (1 August – 31 January); in effect it is administered respectively by Irun (in Gipuzkoa, Spain) and Hendaye (in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France).  As of  January 2018[update] the island is approximately 200 metres (660 ft) long and 40 metres (130 ft) wide and is eroding.  The most important historical event that took place on the island was the meeting place for the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. It was the climax to a series of 24 conferences held between Luis de Haro, a Grandee of Spain and Cardinal Mazarin, Chief Minister of France, in 1659 following the end of the Thirty Years' War. A monolith was built in the centre of the island to commemorate the meeting. The island has also been used for several other royal meetings: The island can sometimes be reached from the Spanish side at low tide.  It is uninhabited, and access is forbidden  except very occasionally on heritage open days.
