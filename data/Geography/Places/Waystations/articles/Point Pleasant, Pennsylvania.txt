Its proximity to the river led to the development of grist mills. Grain for the soldiers during the Revolutionary War was ground here.  In later years, Point Pleasant was a resting spot for canalmen along the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, and a waystation for the Doylestown-Frenchtown-NewYork stage. The Bridge in Tinicum Township, Cabin Run Covered Bridge, Frankenfield Covered Bridge, and Point Pleasant Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Point Pleasant is the location of a major water pump installation on the Delaware River, since 1989. This water supplies the Bradshaw Reservoir and Lake Galena Reservoir for Montgomery County and Bucks County drinking water.  Water is pumped into the North Branch Neshaminy Creek.

Aside from being located along the Delaware River, Point Pleasant lies along Pennsylvania Route 32, which connects it to New Hope to the south.
