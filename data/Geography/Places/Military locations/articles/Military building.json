Prior to the nineteenth century, military hospitals as we know them today did not exist.  Soldiers wounded in combat were treated in the field or in makeshift facilities commandeered near the field of battle.  Medical technology at the time was such that most serious wounds were fatal and, accordingly, there was little need for facilities that provided for long-term care and recuperation.  Battlefield <a href=\"/wiki/Amputations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Amputations\">amputations</a> were one of the most common procedures and were only successful in saving the life of the victim in a limited number of cases.\n</p><p>However, beginning in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, advances in <a href=\"/wiki/Blood_transfusion\" title=\"Blood transfusion\">blood transfusion</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Anesthesia\" title=\"Anesthesia\">anesthesia</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Antibiotics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antibiotics\">antibiotics</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Physical_trauma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Physical trauma\">trauma</a> treatment meant that many more soldiers could survive wounds although the treatment time was much longer.  Also, advances in the treatment of <a href=\"/wiki/Infectious_diseases\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Infectious diseases\">infectious diseases</a> meant that many more personnel required treatment for non-combat conditions.\n</p><p>All of these conditions, plus an increasing number of personnel with families, have led to the construction of full service military hospitals.  These hospitals treat both members of the military and their families.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Housing\">Housing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Military_building&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Housing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Military housing includes <a href=\"/wiki/Barracks\" title=\"Barracks\">barracks</a>, UOQs (unescorted or \"bachelor\" officer quarters), and family housing.  The age and condition of these facilities varies widely.  A few officer family housing units are very <a href=\"/wiki/Historic_building\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Historic building\">historical</a> in nature and can be quite large and ornate.  Most family and UOQ housing is now similar in nature to civilian housing stock.  In most advanced countries, barracks housing has been modernized, but remnants of housing from <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> and older periods still remains in the inventory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mess\">Mess</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Military_building&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Mess\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>\u201cMess\u201d is the military term for any facility serving food to large groups.
