The White Jade River, also known by the native names Baiyu or Yurungkash, is a river in the southern Xinjiang region of China. The head waters of the river rise in the Kunlun Mountains, in the area of Aksai Chin in Kashmir in the Togatax area (35°36′N 81°24′E﻿ / ﻿35.6°N 81.4°E﻿ / 35.6; 81.4). The river flows east for some 200 km and then north for another 200 km before passing Khotan (37°07′N 79°58′E﻿ / ﻿37.11°N 79.97°E﻿ / 37.11; 79.97). North of Khotan,  it eventually dries up in the Taklamakan desert, its seasonal bed joined  by that of the Black Jade River (Karakash River) near Koxlax (some 200 km north of Khotan, 38°05′N 80°34′E﻿ / ﻿38.08°N 80.56°E﻿ / 38.08; 80.56), from where it continues north as the Khotan River passing  Piqanlik (40°03′N 80°53′E﻿ / ﻿40.05°N 80.89°E﻿ / 40.05; 80.89), and seasonally crossing the desert, joining the Tarim River. The river drains an area of 14,575 km2 (5,627 sq mi) and has a discharge of 72.3 cubic metres per second (2,550 cu ft/s). The river gets its name from the white jade that is often found in its alluvial deposits. The jade can also however be found in semi-shallow areas of the river. .
