A territorial entity is an entity that covers a part of the surface of the Earth with specified borders. Established by a non-physical act, such as a law, order, decree, for administrative tasks. Can include political entities with their own government, but also statistical regions or reserves. Established by physical acts, e.g. settlement, see List of uninhabited regions.
