The SLV Launch Pad or the Sriharikota SLV of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre is a rocket launch site in Sriharikota, India that began operation in 1979 and was decommissioned in 1994. It was used by two launch vehicles of the ISRO: the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV).  Initially it was built for launching SLV-3s but was later also used as an ASLV launch complex.  The first launch from this pad occurred on 10 August 1979, and was that of the first experimental flight of SLV-3 carrying the Rohini Technology Payload satellite. The last flight was of ASLV on 4 May 1994 carrying SROSS-C2.  At the time of decommission, 4 SLV-3s (1 Failure, 1 Partial Failure and 2 Successes) and 4 ASLVs (2 Failures, 1 Partial Failure and 1 Successes) had been launched from here. The last launch was on 4 May 1994 of an ASLV.
