  Human Space Flight Rated The Third Launch Pad (TLP) of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre is an under development rocket launch site in Sriharikota, India. When the launch pad will be completely built, it will be the third launch pad in the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, the other two being First Launch Pad and the Second Launch Pad. This launch pad is intended to be used for future Indian rockets like the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III and Avatar RLV (Avatar Reusable Launch Vehicle) as well as the older ones like Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.  This is the launch pad which will be used for the Indian human spaceflight programme as well as for India's manned mission to the Moon.  One of the main reasons of building this launch pad is that it will increase the frequency of orbital launches by ISRO.  Several facilities have been proposed to be built at the Third Launch Pad. They include a vehicle assembly building, mobile pedestals, umbilical towers, emergency exits, ground escape system, crew ingress and egress systems, safety bunkers, material handling equipment and related electrical systems.  Construction of the launch pad started in September 2012.  The total cost of the new launch pad is estimated to be ₹120 billion (US$1.7 billion).
