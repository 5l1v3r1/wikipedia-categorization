RTTC conducted flight-testing of small rockets and guided missiles, and performed life cycle testing for weapon components. It occupied over 265 buildings and 14,000 acres (57 km2) of Redstone Arsenal, near Huntsville, Alabama.  In October 2010, as part of the Base Reallocation and Closure (BRAC) process, RTTC was combined with the Aviation Technical Test Center from Fort Rucker to form the U.S. Army Redstone Test Center. The RTTC has developed a capability for static firing hypergolic liquid rocket engines. RTTC's facilities and procedures may be used for future testing of Army, DoD, NASA, and private industry's liquid rocket engines as part of the National Rocket Propulsion Test Alliance (NRPTA).
