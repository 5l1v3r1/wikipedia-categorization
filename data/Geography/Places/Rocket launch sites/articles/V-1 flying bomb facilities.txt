In order to carry out the planned V-1 "flying bomb" attacks on the United Kingdom, Germany built a number of military installations including launching sites and depots. Some of the installations were huge concrete fortifications. The Allies became aware of the sites at an early stage and carried out numerous bombing raids to destroy them before they came into use. The unpiloted aircraft was assembled at the KdF-Stadt[note 1] Volkswagenwerke (described as "the largest pressed-steel works in Germany" )  near Fallersleben,  at Cham/Bruns Werke, :40[verification needed] and at the Mittelwerk. underground factory in central Germany.  Production plants to modify several hundred standard V-1s to Reichenberg R-III manned aircraft were in the woods of Dannenburg and at Pulverhof, with air-launch trials at Lärz and Rechlin. :133,135  Flight testing was performed by the Luftwaffe at Peenemünde West and, after the August 1943 Operation Hydra bombing, at Brüsterort. :27  Launch crew training was at Zempin, and the headquarters for the operational unit, FR 155(W),  was originally based at Saleux, near Amiens, :173 but was subsequently moved c. December 1943 to a chateau near Creil ("FlakGruppeCreil"), with the unit's telephone relay station at Doullens.  Other V-1 production-related sites included a Barth plant which used forced labor,   Buchenwald (V-1 parts),  and Allrich in the Harz.  In addition to the storage and launching sites listed below, operational facilities included the airfields for Heinkel He 111 H-22 bombers which air-launched the V-1 from low altitude over the North Sea. The ten-day-long aircrew training was at Peenemünde, and the bases were in Gilze Rijen, Holland for launches through 15 September 1944, and in Venlo for launches after the 1st week in December. Aircrews were billeted five miles away at Grossenkneten for secrecy. :126 To supply the V-1 flying bomb launch sites in the Calais region, construction began on several storage depots in August 1943. Sites at Biennais, Oisemont Neuville-au-Bois, and Saint-Martin-l'Hortier were not completed.[why?]   An RCAF Halifax pilot's logbook describes the target of his raids on "flying-bomb sites" on July 1, 4, and 5, 1944, as "Biennais #1", "Biennais #2," and "Biennais #3".  This suggests that these storage sites were perhaps not completed because they were destroyed prior to completion. The completed sites were: For serving the ten launch sites planned for Normandy, a depot was constructed at  Beauvais. It was bombed June 14, 15 and 16, 1944  A depot to serve Cherbourg launches was near  Valognes. By February/March 1944, a plan for three new underground V-1 storage sites was put into effect.  The Nucourt limestone cave complex between Pontoise and Gisors was bombed on June 22, 1944  with 298 V-1s buried or severely damaged  One in the Rilly-la-Montagne railway tunnel was attacked by the British with Tallboy earthquake bombs on July 31 collapsing both ends of the tunnel.  The Saint-Leu-d'Esserent mushroom caves was the largest of the underground V-1 sites. It was attacked by No. 617 Squadron RAF with Tallboys on 4 July.   A larger "Heavy Crossbow"  bunker was built at Siracourt, between Calais and the river Somme,  as a V-1 storage depot.  RAF records refer to flying-bomb stores at Bois de Cassan (bombed August 2–4, 1944),  Forêt de Nieppe (bombed July 24,25,   31, August 3,4,   5,6, 1944 and Trossy St. Maximin (bombed August 3–4, 1944 )   V-1 launching sites in France were located in nine general areas - four of which had the ramps aligned toward London, and the remainder toward Brighton, Dover, Newhaven, Hastings, Southampton, Manchester, Portsmouth, Bristol, and Plymouth. The sites on the Cherbourg peninsula targeting Bristol and Plymouth were captured before being used, and eventually launching ramps were moved to Holland to target Antwerp (first launched on 3 March 1945 from Delft). :48,80,82,100 Initially the V-1 launching sites had storage buildings that were curved at the end to protect the contents against damage from air attacks. On aerial reconnaissance pictures these storage from above looked like snow skis ("ski sites"). An October 28, 1943 intelligence report regarding construction at Bois Carré near Yvrench :300e prompted No. 170 Squadron RAF reconnaissance sortie E/463 on November 3 which detected "ski-shaped buildings 240-270 feet long." :360  By November 1943, 72 of the ski sites had been located by allied reconnaissance,  and Operation Crossbow began bombing the original ski sites on December 5, 1943.  Nazi Germany subsequently began constructing modified sites with limited structures that could be completed quickly, as necessary. This also allowed the modified sites to be quickly repaired after bombing. However, the work to complete a modified site before launching allowed the allied photographic interpreters to predict on June 11, 1944 that the V-1 attacks would begin within 48 hours, and the first attacks began on June 13.
