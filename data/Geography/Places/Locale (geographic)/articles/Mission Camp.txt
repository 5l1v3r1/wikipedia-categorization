Mission Camp, is a historic locale, site of a later Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach station, located about four and a half miles west of Wellton on the south bank of the Gila River, in Yuma County, Arizona.  It was located 11.49 miles east of Gila City, Arizona and 4.51 miles west of the original Butterfield stage station at Filibusters Camp and 15.14 miles west of Antelope Hill Station, a later station that with Mission Camp Station replaced Filibusters Camp Station.   During the American Civil War, in 1862, Detachment at Mission Camp, a Union Army garrisoned a post at the stage station, held by California Volunteers, located about 35 miles east of Yuma. After stagecoach travel resumed in the late 1860s Mission Camp became a stagecoach station once again until the Southern Pacific Railroad came into Arizona from Yuma, making it obsolete in 1879.
