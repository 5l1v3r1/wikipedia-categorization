Alam al-Jabarut (Arabic: عالم الجبروت‎, meaning the world of power ) is the highest realm in Islamic cosmology. The realm Al-Malakut is below Alam al Jabarut, but still higher than Alam al Mulk. The higher realms impinge the realms below and are not separated worlds.  Although some scholars were not able to see any difference between Alam al Jabarut and Al-Malakut,  others thought this to be the realm of angels and spirits and the other a realm below. Thus this realm is also considered to be the created aspect of Rasul and the created reality of Adam, here representing the perfect human (Al-Insān al-Kāmil). While angels also dwell in Al-Malakut to encounter humans and perform tasks on earth, the most elected angels inhabit Al-Jabarut.  Therefore, this is the domain of angelic manifestations and therefore the realm of archetypes, thrones and powers and also the paradise of the afterlife, with the exception of the supreme paradise.  This realm is thus eternal existence, while the others are created and limited.
