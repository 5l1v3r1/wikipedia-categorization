Paristan or Pari-estan (Persian: پریستان‎ Pariyestân, "fairyland"; پری pari [fairy] + the suffix -stan) is a name of a fairyland in the mythology of the Middle East. In many children's stories Koh-e-Qaf is also used for fairyland. Koh-e-Qaf (Persian: کوہ قاف‎) refers to the Caucasus mountains. It has since entered the folklore of South Asia and Central Asia. Most of the fairies are depicted as young females with very fair colour, golden hair and light colored eyes.  The location of Koh-e-Qaf is usually claimed to be around Baghdad (Iraq). The story named "Thief of Baghdad" mentions that the fairies of Koh-e-Qaf live in a place near Baghdad.
