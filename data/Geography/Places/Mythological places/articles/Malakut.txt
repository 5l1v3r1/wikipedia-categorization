Al-Malakut meaning Realm of Dominion (Arabic: عالم الملكوت‎), is a realm of invisible, in Islamic cosmology, containing several metaphysical beings and places in islamic lore, like angels, demons, jinn, hell and the seven heavens.  It is sometimes used  interchangeable with Alam al Mithal, but otherwise distinguished from it, as a realm above Alam al Mithal, but still sublunary to Alam al Jabarut, as a lower plane for angels, but still higher than the plane of jinn.  The higher realms are not separated worlds in islamic thought, rather they impinges the realms below.  The realm called Al Malakut or Alam al Mithal (translated as imaginal realm) terms the concept of a realm where all ideas, thoughts and actions are manifested, including supernatural experiences,   conversations with angels and encounters with jinn.  Additionally, the lower soul (nafs), came from there and the dreamer enters this realm again during sleep.  It is held to be between the material realm (Alam al Mulk) and the spiritual realm (Alam al Jabarut).
