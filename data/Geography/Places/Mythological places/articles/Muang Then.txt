Muang Thaeng is a legendary Tai locality believed to be associated with modern-day Điện Biên Phủ, Vietnam.     In legend, it is significant as the initial settlement of Tai people migrating southward from Yunnan around the time of the Kingdom of Nanzhao under their leader Khun Borom, who is associated  with Piluoge (ruler of Nanzhao from 728-748).
