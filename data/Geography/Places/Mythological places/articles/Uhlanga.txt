In Zulu mythology, Uhlanga is the marsh from which humanity was born. Hahn suggests that the amaZulu people borrowed this creation myth from the Khoikhoi from whom they appropriated their lands, but that they misunderstood the word uhlanga which in isiZulu means marsh reed, but which means "offshoot" in some Khoikhoi languages. However, myths about people emerging from a marsh, a cave, or a hole in the ground are widespread in Bantu language speaking societies. Unkulunkulu is humanity's progenitor and was the offshoot of Umvelinqangi.
