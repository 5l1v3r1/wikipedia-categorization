These lists give the states of primary affiliation and of birth for each President of the United States. Twenty-one states claim the distinction of being the birthplace of a president. One president's birth state is in dispute; North and South Carolina (British colonies at the time) both lay claim to Andrew Jackson, who was born in 1767, in the Waxhaw region along their common border. Jackson himself considered South Carolina as his birth state.  Born on December 5, 1782, Martin Van Buren was the first president born an American citizen (and not a British subject).   The term Virginia dynasty is sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five U.S. presidents were from Virginia. The number of presidents born per state, counting Jackson as being from South Carolina, are: The birthplaces and early childhood residences of many U.S. presidents have been preserved or replicated. In instances where a physical structure is absent, a monument or roadside marker has been erected to denote the site's historic significance. All sites in the table below are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. A dramatic shift in childbirth from home to hospital occurred in the United States in the early 20th century (midâ€“1920s to 1940).

Nineteen Presidents (denoted with an asterisk) primarily resided in states other than their respective birth states, which are listed above.
