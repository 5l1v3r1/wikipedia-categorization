An autonomous space or safe space is a social space restricted with respect to social relations, language, political views, and/or behavior.  For example, a club or forum may be limited to nonwhite women, gay men, etc.  Proponents say that the point of a safe space is to provide social space that is safe for marginalized people to freely communicate and express ideas. [unreliable source?]  Organizations, particularly institutions of higher learning, may establish policies which prohibit harassment, but may permit discussion of controversial issues: At Portsmouth University, student union president Grant Clarke says in a statement that policies aimed at defending students from racist, sexist and homophobic harassment don’t preclude people from openly talking and discussing these issues, “but we don’t accept these behaviours on our campus”. Others may offer refuges even from talk considered traumatic  or prohibit events or persons whose presence might, for some, make a campus not safe.
