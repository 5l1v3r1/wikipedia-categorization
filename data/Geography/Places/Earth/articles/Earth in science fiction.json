The aliens are often used to portray nearly all-powerful beings, placing the strongest forces on Earth at the receiving end of attacks that they can barely understand. This theme is one of the earliest in science fiction, demonstrated by <a href=\"/wiki/H._G._Wells\" title=\"H. G. Wells\">H. G. Wells</a> in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds\" title=\"The War of the Worlds\">The War of the Worlds</a></i> and Doctor Who, where the invasions in the 1960s, 70s and the 80s are small scale, and the invasions from the 1990s and later are more-large scale, in works such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)\" title=\"Independence Day (1996 film)\">Independence Day</a></i>. In such scenarios, the author often uses <a href=\"/wiki/Deus_ex_machina\" title=\"Deus ex machina\">deus ex machina</a> to allow the invasion to be repulsed. In others, like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Footfall\" title=\"Footfall\">Footfall</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Worldwar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Worldwar\">Worldwar</a></i>, the author depicts aliens only slightly more advanced than the inhabitants of Earth, and are fought to a stand-still or defeated in battle. The opposite has also been depicted, with Earth becoming a refuge to aliens as seen in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Men_in_Black_(1997_film)\" title=\"Men in Black (1997 film)\">Men in Black</a></i> series of movies, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Alien_Nation_(1989_TV_series)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alien Nation (1989 TV series)\">Alien Nation</a></i> series.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<ul><li><b>Forgotten or mythical</b>\n<ul><li>The memory of Earth, and its location may be lost to the sands of time or shrouded in myth as mankind abandons the Earth. <a href=\"/wiki/Isaac_Asimov\" title=\"Isaac Asimov\">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Foundation_series\" title=\"Foundation series\">Foundation</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(series)\" title=\"Galactic Empire (series)\">Empire</a></i> series depict a common theme of a destroyed Earth. In other works, such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica\" title=\"Battlestar Galactica\">Battlestar Galactica</a></i>, it is largely forgotten except by the religious. In the numerous books of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dumarest_saga\" title=\"Dumarest saga\"><i>Dumarest</i> saga</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/E.C._Tubb\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"E.C. Tubb\">E.C. Tubb</a>, the adventurer protagonist was born on a \"galactic backwater\" Earth and at a young age had stowed away on a rare spaceship touching down on the planet; having seen more than enough of the galaxy he wants to go back, but no one else had ever heard of the planet. The first Terran inhabitants of the Koprulu Sector are Earth-born criminals in <a href=\"/wiki/Sleeper_ship\" title=\"Sleeper ship\">sleeper ships</a> in <i><a href=\"/wiki/StarCraft\" title=\"StarCraft\">StarCraft</a></i>. The expansion also mentions about Earth: upon hearing of the United Earth Directorate's forces' arrival, Zeratul remarks \"Raynor [a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Terran#Adjective\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:Terran\">Terran</a> captain] spoke to me of the distant Terran homeworld of Earth.\" This implies that the Terrans still know about Earth but its location is lost (<i>StarCraft</i> manual mentions that the sleeper ships have become lost in hyperspace when an error erased the intended destination's coordinates, as well as those of Earth's, resulting in the ships going at full speed for several decades until the engines broke down). Also, the Terran Confederacy uses the same flag as the Confederacy in the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Civil_War\" title=\"American Civil War\">American Civil War</a>. Also, in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html\">Zodiac</a> series by Romina Russell, it states that \"history tells us the original human colonizers came from a distant and long-gone planet called Earth, and they traveled through a portal in Helios to get here\u2014but the portal is just another myth.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Destruction</b></li></ul>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Category:Apocalyptic_fiction\" title=\"Category:Apocalyptic fiction\">Category:Apocalyptic fiction</a></div>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>Earth could have been completely destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, but its location (or at least its former location) is well known.

Later in the series, Earth under the now-immortal Rhodan becomes a major player in the universe, establishing a benevolent empire. During an invasion of the Milkyway by the <i>Laren</i>, Earth and the Moon with its 20 billion inhabitants are supposed to be teleported to a different system, but accidentally end up in the bridge between two collided galaxies (called <i>Maelstrom of Stars</i>) and moved into orbit about a star. 120 years later the system falls into a giant energy vortex and is again transported to another galaxy, and most of the humans in it become part of the <i>superintelligence IT</i>.

The ultimate fate of Earth, and those that were left behind, was unknown, with many thinking it was lost forever.

But since developing faster-than-light travel among other advanced technologies, there have been  significant improvements to the state of the planet. The Systems Alliance itself is regarded as a sleeping giant, and humanity has quickly established itself as one of the most important and powerful races in the galaxy. Earth, like a number of other planets in the Mass Effect series, is attacked at the onset of the Reaper War and suffers catastrophic damage due to it being the focal point of the war, resulting in huge losses of life and many cities left in ruins, though it is implied that Earth is subsequently repaired in time.</li>\n<li>In his work <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\">A Journey to the Center of the Earth</a></i>, French author <a href=\"/wiki/Jules_Verne\" title=\"Jules Verne\">Jules Verne</a> presented the concept of a hollow center of the planet inhabited by prehistoric beings.

In ancient history many groups of humans were kidnapped and enslaved by powerful alien races, primarily the <a href=\"/wiki/Goa%27uld\" title=\"Goa&#39;uld\">Goa'uld</a>. Others remained to form present day Earth societies, which interact covertly with other extraterrestrial races and civilizations, many of them human. Earth first became important in the scene after the <a href=\"/wiki/Alterans\" title=\"Alterans\">Alterans</a> occupied it as their new capital (its name was Terra at that point). When they were forced to relocate to Lantea in the Pegasus galaxy (several million years ago), they \"seeded\" the planet with a less advanced form of themselves. Eventually, the Goa'uld found the planet and determined that the human body is the ultimate host body for their parasitic race. Many humans were kidnapped through the Stargate the Supreme System Lord <a href=\"/wiki/Ra_(Stargate)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ra (Stargate)\">Ra</a> brought to Earth (Earth already had its own Stargate in Antarctica but it was inoperable) but the leftover population wasn't touched; they eventually rebelled and drove the Goa'uld off the planet in 3000 BC. About 8000 BC, the Lantean remnants returned to the planet but the primitive civilization extinguished their last hope of rebuilding their once great civilization due to the presence of the Goa'uld; as such, the Ancients slowly died out or <a href=\"/wiki/Ascension_(Stargate)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ascension (Stargate)\">Ascended</a> since their numbers were too small to survive, even by crossbreeding with regular humans.\n</p><p>With Earth largely left alone for millennia, its human population continued to advance until the rediscovery of the Stargate in 1928 and its subsequent reactivation in 1994 (since its DHD activation device was missing, they had been unable to determine its purpose until they were able to create a computer interface). Unlike an enormous majority of planets, the Stargate on Earth was kept secret from the general populace to prevent widespread panic because \"we are not alone\".\n</p><p>Humans who are from Earth are referred to as the <a href=\"/wiki/Tau%27ri\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tau&#39;ri\">Tau'ri</a> by most other life forms in the galaxy, including the <a href=\"/wiki/Goa%27uld\" title=\"Goa&#39;uld\">Goa'uld</a>. Earth is a relatively important player on account of the radical change it unwittingly brought about when troops under the command of Colonel <a href=\"/wiki/Jack_O%27Neill\" title=\"Jack O&#39;Neill\">Jack O'Neill</a> killed Goa'uld Supreme System Lord <a href=\"/wiki/Ra_(Stargate)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ra (Stargate)\">Ra</a> and started a guerrilla war against the Goa'uld. However, its importance pales in comparison to the power of the <a href=\"/wiki/System_Lords\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"System Lords\">System Lords</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Free_Jaffa_Nation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free Jaffa Nation\">Free Jaffa Nation</a>, even though after the extinction of the Asgard and the defeat of the <a href=\"/wiki/Ori_(Stargate)\" title=\"Ori (Stargate)\">Ori</a>, the Tau'ri became the dominant race of known space \u2014 although they were initially at a huge technological disadvantage, they later managed to reverse-engineer Goa'uld technology to the point where they started building their own ships, though much of it was rendered obsolete when the Asgard granted a significant amount of non-weapon technology. The Tau'ri also created remarkable technological feats, such as fighters equipped with hyperdrives powered by an unstable isotope. Their power increased further when they discovered that, due to crossbreeding with Ancients before their extinction, some Earth-born humans actually possessed a unique gene required to operate some of the more advanced Ancient technology. The peak of their power occurred when the Asgard donated their entire technological knowledge to Earth prior to their extinction. With this and some Ancient technology, the Tau'ri actually surpassed their precursors and defeated the Ori.\n</p><p>The main interaction between Earth and the rest of the universe is via three organizations:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The <b><a href=\"/wiki/International_Oversight_Advisory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"International Oversight Advisory\">International Oversight Advisory</a></b> (IOA) coordinates funds and control between the nations of the Earth <a href=\"/wiki/Stargate_(device)\" title=\"Stargate (device)\">Stargate</a>; the <a href=\"/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis\" title=\"Stargate Atlantis\">Atlantis Expedition</a> was sent to the Pegasus Galaxy under its authority.

These groups included humanist factions as well as religious conservatives who resorted to terrorism in these turbulent times.

The UPL banned many religions and made English the worldwide language.\n</p><p>The UPL proceeded to arrest and kill many people who opposed its \"divinity of mankind\" philosophy (which included \"purity\" from cybernetics, mutations, and so forth).

In 1999 during a global war the (future) SDF-1 an alien warship crashed to Earth on Macross island. Discovering they were not alone in the universe (and in secret the fact that the SDF-1 was a warship for a giant sized alien race) the human race united and rebuilt the ship as well as using the technology to advance their own and to create a small defence fleet for earth.\n</p><p>Ten years later the ship was ready but as preparation for launch on a mission of exploration continued Zentradi warships arrived in orbit to search for the ship. Though humanity tried peaceful contact a booby trap in the SDF-1 fired the huge main gun at the Zentradi committing Earth to a devastating interstellar war. To lure the Zentradi away from Earth the SDF-1 attempted a space fold <a href=\"/wiki/Faster-than-light\" title=\"Faster-than-light\">FTL jump</a>. This went wrong transporting not only the SDF-1 but part of Macross Island, 70,000 civilians and two navy warships to an area near Pluto. Pressure held in sub-surface shelters long enough to evacuate the civilians while the ships were grafted on to the SDF-1 as flight decks. However the jump also caused the FTL drive to vanish (for unknown reasons) as such the SDF-1 had to return home under normal thrust fighting Zentradi all the way and unable to talk to earth due to jamming.\n</p><p>During the conflict many Zentradi became fascinated by Earth culture and over a million ships eventually defected. The ship finally returned to Earth but was driven back into space to draw off the Zentradi again. However the Zentradi bought over four million ships to Earth and bombarded the planet. The SDF-1 took out most ships with an overload of its shield system but in the process the ship was left incapable of flight and most of the Earth's population was killed. Over the next two years the survivors tried to rebuild and at last the Earth began to green again.\n</p><p>Twenty years later the Earth had recovered during the war with the Robotech masters, but even after Earth's victory the planet was then attacked and occupied by another set of aliens The Invid in 2031. The Invid collected what they could of the Protoculture on Earth but seem to have left the population (now millions once more) largely alone.\n</p><p>In 2042 the Robotech Mars expedition returned from deep space but was wiped out by the Invid during the battle to liberate the planet. The survivors were forced down to Earth where they hooked up with the local resistance groups.\n</p><p>Two years later a massive fleet arrived with more advanced technology given to them by the alien Hydenites. The Invid quickly left Earth rather than risk Earth's destruction by deadly weapons the Neutron_S missiles which were far more dangerous than man believed. As Humanity celebrated however the Hydenites were revealed as the Children of Shadow who had destroyed the Invid homeworld eons before.

As a result, most sentient species in the universe are members of various clans and factions, often quite powerful, with varying beliefs.\n</p><p>Earth was overlooked and humans evolved, evidently without a patron race.  However, by the time of first contact with galactic civilization, humans had themselves raised chimpanzees and dolphins to sentience, giving the human race a claim to patron status.  This claim is provisionally accepted by the major institutions of galactic civilization even as it is hotly contested by a number of senior patron races.\n</p><p>Galactic civilization holds humanity's claim of having evolved to sentience independently to be highly controversial at best, and an offensive heresy at worst. Some clans holding the latter view have actively conspired to have humanity's patron status officially vacated and to adopt the \"wolfling\" race themselves, thus gaining three sentient races and control of \"fallow\" genetic material: Earth's wealth of species with uplift potential.  Only the conservative and ponderous nature of galactic institutions and the rivalry of other clans reluctant to see the Earth's races claimed by another have prevented this.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Worldwar\"><i>Worldwar</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Earth_in_science_fiction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Worldwar\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/Worldwar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Worldwar\">Worldwar</a> novels by <a href=\"/wiki/Harry_Turtledove\" title=\"Harry Turtledove\">Harry Turtledove</a>, Earth is the human homeworld and is attacked by the aliens known as The Race in 1942.
