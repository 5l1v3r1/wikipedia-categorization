A question is posed to the students in such a manner that the students can write multiple answers for a given question. A timer is set and the students are asked to write the answers. Each student of a group writes one answer and passes the paper to his other group member. Till the time is up, the students keep writing answers by passing the paper in group. After the time is up, the student is asked to read out the answer he has written. This enables the entire group to work together and come up with suitable answers.
