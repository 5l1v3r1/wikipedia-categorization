At the time it was considered a natural outcome of the principle of equality, which was part and parcel of the kibbutz life. The education authority of the kibbutz was responsible for the rearing and well being of all the children born on the kibbutz, taking care of their food, clothing and medical treatment. Everybody received the same share of everything. <a href=\"/wiki/Parents\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Parents\">Parents</a> were not involved economically in the upbringing of their children.\n</p><p>Children's lives had three focal points: the children's house, parents' house and the whole kibbutz. They lived in the children's house where they had communal sleeping arrangements and visited their parents for 2\u20133 hours a day.\n</p><p>Non-selectivity was a fundamental principle of collective education; every child got 12 years of study, they took no tests whatsoever and no grades were recorded. The founders of the kibbutz actually aimed at creating \"the 'new man' of a utopian society.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div

Each house had a dining hall, a <a href=\"/wiki/Classroom\" title=\"Classroom\">classroom</a>, bedrooms (3-4 children in each room) and a bathroom. Boys and girls took showers together during elementary school up to the sixth grade and usually shared their bedrooms even until the end of high school.\n</p><p>This was the kibbutz children's house, where they learned, had their meals, took their showers, slept and woke up in the morning. This was where they got their clean clothes and from there their dirty laundry was sent, all tied up in a big bundle, back to the collective <a href=\"/wiki/Laundry\" title=\"Laundry\">laundry</a>.\n</p><p>Every child had a towel on a hanger in the bathroom and a smaller hand towel near the sink, with a small cup for the toothbrush. Each also had two closet shelves, one for the morning clothing and another for the afternoon clothing.

The kibbutz authorities provided equally for all children born to its members and they shared everything equally. The provision of health and psychological care was according to specific needs. Kibbutz members who were considered the most educated and esteemed got the position of educators. The nanny position was always a woman's role.

Kibbutz people believed that a woman's work outside of her house conflicted with her duties as a mother. In their eyes the kibbutz achieved woman's social and economic liberation without hindering her role as a mother.

Family was neither the only nor the main focus in the children's education, since they had the educators and the whole kibbutz to support them. While the child's emotional needs were catered for by his or her family, the physical well being, health care and education as a whole were trusted to the educators' expertise.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Fathers were supposed to bond with their children through quality time, much more so than in non-kibbutz environment, where they may be required to spend long hours at work.\n</p><p>Kibbutz people believed that as the necessary demands and requirements that are an essential part of every education process were eliminated from family life, the relationships between parents and their children got a chance to become much more moderate and harmonious. This, so they claimed,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> is how strong emotional ties with toddlers, friendship in childhood and comradeship in youth facilitate strong family attachment and healthy influence of parents on their children.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education_organization\">Education organization</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kibbutz_communal_child_rearing_and_collective_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Education organization\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Education organization was divided into stages:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Babies (up to 1 year old) and toddlers (up to the age of 4 years) were kept in small sets of 4-8 children, mostly sextuplets</li>\n<li>Kindergarten (ages 4 to 7) was made up of 3 sextuplets, and this group of 14-22 children would stay together until they completed the 12th grade</li>\n<li>Children's society \u2013 first (in some cases only from second) grade up to sixth grade</li>\n<li>Youth society \u2013 seventh grade to twelfth grade</li></ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Babies_.28up_to_1_year_old.29_and_toddlers\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Babies_(up_to_1_year_old)_and_toddlers\">Babies (up to 1 year old) and toddlers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Kibbutz_communal_child_rearing_and_collective_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Babies (up to 1 year old) and toddlers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg/220px-PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"326\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg/330px-PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg/440px-PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1228\" data-file-height=\"1818\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:PikiWiki_Israel_3561_Education_in_Israel.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Toddlers in Kibbutz <a href=\"/wiki/Merom_Golan\" title=\"Merom Golan\">Merom Golan</a> 1968-72</div></div></div>\n<p>The newborn baby was brought from the hospital directly to the babies' house.

As years went by, the attitude became more relaxed in this matter and parents were allowed to visit their offspring during the day, in order to spend time together and establish emotional bonding. In addition to taking care of the baby it was the nanny's responsibility to support the mothers, especially the young and inexperienced ones.\n</p><p>The arrangement of the newborns' house, its equipment and playground, and the correct way of offering toys in the right stage, all these were believed to create the proper stimuli and the environment that might best fit babies, in order to avert boredom and satisfy the toddlers' emotional needs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Babies were transferred to the toddlers' house by their second year.

Other kibbutzim maintained a local high school and had their children stay at home, eat in the kibbutz dining hall and work with the kibbutz members.\n</p><p>The founding fathers of the collective education strongly believed that by this age the group held a major significance for its members.

Putting forth an effort, moral behavior, and social involvement were seen as equivalent to academic achievements and so was youth movement leadership.\n</p><p>Any distinction between formal teaching and other forms of educating was non-existent, and both were under the guidance of the education team. Although collective education was non-selective and all children were entitled to the same learning circumstances, no demand was made to have equal achievements.
