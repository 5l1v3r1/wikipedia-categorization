Growing Without Schooling (GWS) was a homeschooling newsletter focused primarily on unschooling. It was founded in 1977 by educator John Holt, and was published in Boston, Massachusetts. Reportedly the first such publication in the United States, it was read worldwide, and helped to catalyze the early growth and development of the homeschooling movement. Following Holt's death in 1985, his assistants, Susannah Sheffer and Patrick Farenga, took over as editor and publisher respectively. Publication ceased in 2001 after 143 issues. One of the first documentaries about homeschooling, Grown Without Schooling, was named in homage to the magazine and profiled several of the grown homeschoolers who had written for it. Its producer, Peter Kowalke, also wrote occasionally for the magazine.
