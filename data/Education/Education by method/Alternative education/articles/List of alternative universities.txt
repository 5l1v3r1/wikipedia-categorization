Alternative universities or colleges in the United States offer an education, and in some cases a lifestyle, that is intentionally not mainstream compared to other institutions. Through the use of experimental and unconventional curricula and offering choice to students as to what and how they will study, such institutions distinguish themselves from traditional faculties. They often attract faculty and students who are interested in such values and are often politically liberal . Additionally, some of them expand on the concept of democratic education to integrate students in various facets of school administration. Methods of evaluation frequently favor detailed written evaluations instead of grades. Some institutions do not require an SAT/ACT, but rather ask for a series of essays. Many of these institutions are private, though most offer scholarships, grants, and other aid. Â· LIU Global http://www.liu.edu/Global
