The most common term used is <b><a href=\"/wiki/Business_game\" title=\"Business game\">business game</a></b> but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments.\n</p><p>Klabbers (1999)<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> notes that gaming is sometimes associated with something that is frivolous, just for the fun of it. This hampers its scientific endeavor and the more serious connotations of gaming in the scientific arena. The term game is used to describe activities in which some or all of these characteristics are prominent:<sup id=\"cite_ref-Elgood,_Chris_1996_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Elgood,_Chris_1996-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>human, humanly controlled, opponents, whose actions have an effect upon each other and upon the environment,</li>\n<li>an emphasis on competitiveness and winning,</li>\n<li>an emphasis on pleasure, humour and enjoyment,</li>\n<li>a repetitive cycle of making decisions and encountering a result, allowing the hope of improvement and 'doing better next time'.</li></ul>\n<p>Games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs, according to an agreed set of rules. Players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jaques,_David_1995_pp._21-38_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jaques,_David_1995_pp._21-38-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Games are social systems and they include actors (players), rules and resources, which are the basic building blocks of social systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> In each game, the players (actors) interact with one another, while applying different rules, and utilizing different resources.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> note that the simulation gaming community is still struggling to establish itself as a discipline, although 35 years have passed since the International Simulation and Gaming Association (<b>ISAGA</b>) was established. To be a discipline, simulation gaming needs a theory, methodology, and application and validation. Of these, forming a theory is the most difficult challenge. Similar comments come from Wolfe and Crookall.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology, let alone taxonomy, of the nature of simulation gaming. According to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview, based on underlying theory and precepts. Without this, the field has been stuck, despite its age, at a relatively low level of development.\n</p><p>In most cases, the terms <b>business (simulation) game</b> and <b>management (simulation) game</b> can be used interchangeably and there is no well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Greenlaw,_Paul_S._1962_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Greenlaw,_Paul_S._1962-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> determine a business game (or business simulation) as <i>a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation</i>. The descriptions given for a management game, for example, by Forrester<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and Naylor<sup id=\"cite_ref-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood<sup id=\"cite_ref-Elgood,_Chris_1996_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Elgood,_Chris_1996-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe<sup id=\"cite_ref-Keys_1990_pp._307-336_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Keys_1990_pp._307-336-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise.\n</p><p>Gredler<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> divides experiential simulations into the following four categories:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Data management simulations,</li>\n<li>Diagnostic simulations,</li>\n<li>Crisis management simulations, and</li>\n<li>Social-process simulations.</li></ol>\n<p>Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal.\n</p><p>Business strategy games are intended to enhance students' decision-making skills, especially under conditions defined by limited time and information.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> They vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a company's share of the market. Typically, the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the player's initial choices. The game proceeds through several series of these interactive, iterative steps. As can be noted, this definition does not consider continuous (real-time) processing an alternative.\n</p><p>In business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions \u2013 on price, advertising, production targets, etc. \u2013 about how their company should be run. A business game may have an industrial, commercial or financial background (Elgood, 1996). Ju and Wagner<sup id=\"cite_ref-Wagner,_Christian_1997_pp._78-92_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Wagner,_Christian_1997_pp._78-92-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> mention that the nature of business games can include decision-making tasks, which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents. These simulations have a nature of strategy or war games, but usually are very terse in their user interface. Other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games, in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant, production, operations, marketing, and human resources, in order to produce and sell goods.\n</p><p>According to Senge and Lannon<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> in <b>managerial microworlds</b> \u2013 like business simulation games \u2013 unlike in the actual world, managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company. This process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world. Thus, Senge and Lannon argue, managers learn about the long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Such \"virtual worlds\" are particularly important in team learning. Managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts.\n</p><p>Naylor<sup id=\"cite_ref-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> in 1971 gives quite a detailed view of the contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed on the basis of a set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of <b>(a)</b> a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and <b>(b)</b> the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports \u2013 for example, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports \u2013 at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock. For more information about this topic see Lainema (2003).<sup id=\"cite_ref-info.tse.fi_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-info.tse.fi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Business_simulation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first use of games for education and development was the war game simulations in China in about 3,000 B.C. These games bore a vague similarity to the early 17th century chess.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Keys_1990_pp._307-336_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Keys_1990_pp._307-336-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> In the Western world, war games date back to at least the German Kriegspiel of the mid-nineteenth century (Faria and Dickinson).<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Faria and Dickinson note that different war games have also been conducted in Japan before the Second World War and war games have been long used by the British and the Americans to test battle strategies. Military officers trained with war games in the 1930s and 1940s started to use their military training to manage civilian businesses. Some of the business game evolution can be traced to a 1955 Rand Corporation game, which simulated the U.S. Air Force inventory management within its supply system.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Greenlaw et al.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Greenlaw,_Paul_S._1962_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Greenlaw,_Paul_S._1962-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> state that business simulation exercises may be considered an outgrowth of earlier developments in three fields: military war gaming, operations research, and educational role-playing.\n</p><p>According to Naylor,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971_13-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> the use of games in business and economics goes back to 1956 when the American Management Association developed the first so-called management decision-making game, called the Top Management Decision Game. Faria and Dickinson and Greenlaw et al. also find this the first widely known business decision-making simulation, although Greenlaw et al. date the origin of the game to 1957 and further specify that it was the first non-military competitive business game. Greenlaw et al. note that the Top Management Decision Simulation stimulated the design and use of dozens of other games. In this simulation five teams of players operated firms competing in a hypothetical, one-product industry. Teams made quarterly decisions covering price, production volume, budgets, research and development, advertising, and sales force and could request selected marketing research information. During the period 1955-1957 only one or two new games appeared each year (Faria, 1990).<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A rapid growth in the number of business games occurred over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some business games available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different business games or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor<sup id=\"cite_ref-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Naylor,_Thomas_H._1971-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>  provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989)<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the United States in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Wagner,_Christian_1997_pp._78-92_17-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Wagner,_Christian_1997_pp._78-92-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the United States, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games. Still, Faria estimated that only 12.5% of all US business firms with training and development managers used computerized business games.\n</p><p>The penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors:<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes.\n</p><p>Larsen and Lomi<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged. Instead of focusing on predicting, simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industry's problems and opportunities. Simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference \u2013 or mental models. Larsen and Lomi further note, that the emphasis of computer-based simulation models has shifted:\n</p>\n<ol><li>from predicting the future, to understanding how multiple possible futures might be linked to decisions and actions that must be taken today, and</li>\n<li>from designing the best strategy, to analyzing how robust our preferred strategy would be under different assumptions about how the future might unfold, or about how the past actually produced the events that we perceive.</li></ol>\n<p>In the late 1990s, training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs. The business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen. The business simulations allowed participants to test their decision-making skills, make mistakes, and safely learn from their experience. Some refer to this type of employee education as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Experiential_learning\" title=\"Experiential learning\">experiential learning</a>\".  By 2000, business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen (financial) skills  with the softer \u2013 interpersonal \u2013 skills required for effective leadership development.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scenario_simulations\">Scenario simulations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Business_simulation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Scenario simulations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"/wiki/Business_game\" title=\"Business game\">business game</a> or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations.

Simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle, which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Jaques,_David_1995_pp._21-38_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Jaques,_David_1995_pp._21-38-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Thiagarajan<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> lists six phases of debriefing, presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirements:\n</p>\n<ol><li>How do you feel? Gives the participants an opportunity to get some of their strong feelings about the simulation game off their chest.</li>\n<li>What happened? Makes it possible for the participants to compare and to contrast participant recollections and to draw some general conclusions during the next phase.</li>\n<li>What did you learn? Encourage the generation and testing of different hypotheses. Ask the participants to come up with general principles based on their experiences from the game and to offer evidence to support or to reject the principles.</li>\n<li>How does this relate to the real world? Encourage a discussion of the relevance of the game to the participants' real world workplace.</li>\n<li>What if\u2026? Encourage the participants to apply their insights to new contexts.</li>\n<li>What next? Participants use their insights to come up with strategies for the simulation game and for the workplace.</li></ol>\n<p>Van Ments<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> notes that the aim of debriefing is to: deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends (including scoring); draw out general conclusions about the session; and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world. Furthermore, the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback (Gentry, 1990).<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> The participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned, and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective. Gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback. As games are less-than-perfect representations of the real world, it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued, not the gaming outcome.\nThe importance of reflection, debriefing and feedback highlight the need for business simulations to supported by carefully considered learning outcomes, pedagogy and assessment tasks. Student factors such as low motivation to engage and prior skill weaknesses can undermine the ability of authentic assessment regimes to achieve the purported learning benefits.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> The Online Business Simulations Project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching has developed a range of resources to help educators embed simulations into their classes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-bizsims_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-bizsims-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Business_simulation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Marketing_simulation_game\" title=\"Marketing simulation game\">Marketing simulation game</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Project_management_simulation\" title=\"Project management simulation\">Project management simulation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Simulations_and_games_in_economics_education\" title=\"Simulations and games in economics education\">Simulations and games in economics education</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Training_simulation\" title=\"Training simulation\">Training simulation</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Business_simulation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 35em; -webkit-column-width: 35em; column-width: 35em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-bizsims-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-bizsims_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-bizsims_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bizsims.edu.au/\">Online Business Simulations</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-info.tse.fi-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-info.tse.fi_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-info.tse.fi_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Lainema (2003).
