In the most common use of such audience response systems, presentation slides built with the audience response software display questions with several possible answers, more commonly referred to as <a href=\"/wiki/Multiple_choice\" title=\"Multiple choice\">multiple choice</a> questions. The audience participates by selecting the answer they believe to be correct and pushing the corresponding key on their individual <a href=\"/wiki/Wireless\" title=\"Wireless\">wireless</a> keypad. Their answer is then sent to a base station \u2013 or receiver \u2013 that is also attached to the presenter's computer. The audience response software collects the results, and the aggregate <a href=\"/wiki/Data\" title=\"Data\">data</a> is graphically displayed within the presentation for all to see.  Some clickers also have additional keys, allowing the presenter to ask (and audience members to answer) True/False questions or even questions calling for particular numerical answers.\n</p><p>Depending on the presenter's requirements, the data can either be collected anonymously (e.g., in the case of voting) or it can be traced to individual participants in circumstances where tracking is required (e.g., classroom quizzes, homework, or questions that ultimately count towards a student's course grade). Incoming data may also be stored in a <a href=\"/wiki/Database\" title=\"Database\">database</a> that resides on the host computer, and data reports can be created after the presentation for further <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/analysis\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:analysis\">analysis</a>.\n</p><p>Software/Cloud Based Audience Response:\nThe presenter uses a <a href=\"/wiki/Computer\" title=\"Computer\">computer</a> to create the questions, sometimes called <a href=\"/wiki/Opinion_poll\" title=\"Opinion poll\">polls</a>.  In this case however, those questions can be open ended, dial testing, and votable open ended as well as <a href=\"/wiki/Multiple_choice\" title=\"Multiple choice\">multiple choice</a>.   Those questions are then downloaded into the presenter's <a href=\"/wiki/Presentation_program\" title=\"Presentation program\">presentation program</a> of choice.  During the presentation, the questions automatically display within the presentation program, or from a <a href=\"/wiki/Web_browser\" title=\"Web browser\">web browser</a>, and can in some cases even be displayed only on the participant's <a href=\"/wiki/Tablet_computer\" title=\"Tablet computer\">tablet computer</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Smartphone\" title=\"Smartphone\">smartphone</a>. Results are instantly tabulated via the internet, and presented on screen in real time, including grading the \"correct\" answer if desired.  Some services offer presenters real time <a href=\"/wiki/Moderation\" title=\"Moderation\">moderation</a> for open ended responses or questions prior to displaying them on screen.\n</p><p>Depending on the presenter's requirements, the data can be collected anonymously, or it can be traced to individual participants who have created accounts in advance of the poll.  This method is commonly used on corporate training where attendance must be verified, and in classrooms, where grades must be assigned.  Data from both methods can be saved and analyzed by the presenter and loaded manually or via <a href=\"/wiki/API\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"API\">API</a> into <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_management_systems\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Learning management systems\">learning management systems</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Distributed.2C_virtual.2C_or_hybrid\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Distributed,_virtual,_or_hybrid\">Distributed, virtual, or hybrid</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Distributed, virtual, or hybrid\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Only software or cloud based audience response systems can accommodate distributed audiences, due to the inconveniences and costs of hardware devices.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Benefits\">Benefits</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Benefits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are many reasons for the use of audience response systems (ARS). The tendency to answer based on <a href=\"/wiki/Crowd_psychology\" title=\"Crowd psychology\">crowd psychology</a> is reduced because, unlike hand raising, it is difficult to see which selection others are making. The ARS also allows for faster tabulation of answers for large groups than manual methods. Additionally, many college professors use ARS systems to take attendance or grade answers in large lecture halls, which would be highly time-consuming without the system.\n</p><p>Audience response offers many potential benefits to those who use it in group settings.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Improve attentiveness: In a study done at four University of Wisconsin campuses (<a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Milwaukee\" title=\"University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee\">University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Eau_Claire\" title=\"University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire\">University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Oshkosh\" title=\"University of Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh\">University of Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater\" title=\"University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater\">University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater</a>), faculty members and students in courses using clickers were given a survey that assessed their attitudes about clicker use in Fall 2005 and its effect on teaching and learning.  Of the 27 faculty members who responded to the survey, 94 percent either agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \"Clickers increased student engagement in the classroom,\" with the remaining six percent responding that they were neutral about that claim.  (None of the faculty respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the claim.)  Similarly, 69 percent of the 2,684 student respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \"Clickers led me to become engaged in class,\" with only 13 percent disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with that claim.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Increase knowledge retention: In the same University of Wisconsin study, 74 percent of the faculty respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \"Clickers have been beneficial to my students' learning,\" with the remaining 26 percent choosing a \"neutral\" response.  (No faculty respondent disagreed or strongly disagreed with the claim.)  Similarly, 53 percent of the student respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \"Clickers have been beneficial to my learning,\" with only 19 percent disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with that claim.<sup id=\"cite_ref-educause.edu_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-educause.edu-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  In a different but related study, Catherine Crouch and Eric Mazur more directly measured the results of Peer Instruction and \"ConcepTests\" on student learning and retention of information at the end of a semester.  Faculty members using this \"Peer Instruction\" pedagogical technique present information to students, then ask the students a question that tests their understanding of a key concept.  Students indicate their answer to the instructor using an audience response system, and then they discuss with their fellow students why they chose a particular answer, trying to explain to one another their underlying thinking.  The instructor then asks the question again to see the new student results.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  The study authors used scanned forms and hand-raising for audience response in the initial year of the study, and then they switched to a computer-based audience response system in the following years.  The \"clicker\" use was only part of a multi-pronged attempt to introduce peer instruction, but overall they found that \"the students taught with P[eer] I[instruction] (Spring 2000, <i>N</i>&#160;=&#160;155) significantly outperformed the students taught traditionally (Spring 1999, <i>N</i>&#160;=&#160;178)\" on  two standard tests \u2013 the \"Force Concept Inventory and the Mechanics Baseline Test\" \u2013 and on traditional course exams as well.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> A Johns Hopkins study on the use of audience response systems in Continuing Medical Education (CME) for physicians and other health personnel found no significant difference in knowledge scores between ARS and non-ARS participants in a clinical round table trial involving 42 programs across the United States.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Poll anonymously: Unlike a show of hands or a raising of cards with letters on them, sending responses by hand-held remotes is much more anonymous.  Except perhaps for a student (our audience member) who watches what the person next to him/her submits, the other students (or audience members) can't really see what response his/her fellow audience members are giving, and the software that summarizes the results aggregates the responses, listing what percent of respondents chose a particular answer, but not what individual respondents said.  With some audience response systems, the software allows you to ask questions in truly anonymous mode, so that the database (or \"gradebook\") is not even associating answers with individual respondents.</li>\n<li>Track individual responses: The \"clickers\" that audience members use to send their responses to the receiver (and thus to the presenter's computer) are often registered to a particular user, with some kind of identifying number.  When a user sends his/her response, the information is stored in a <a href=\"/wiki/Database\" title=\"Database\">database</a> (sometimes called the \"Gradebook\" in academic models of audience response systems) associated with each particular number, and presenters have access to that information after the end of the interactive session.  Audience response systems can often be linked to a <a href=\"/wiki/Learning_management_system\" title=\"Learning management system\">Learning management system</a>, which increases the ability to keep track of individual student performance in an academic setting.</li>\n<li>Display polling results immediately: The audience response system includes software that runs on the presenter's computer that records and tabulates the responses by audience members.  Generally, once a question has ended (polling from the audience has ceased), the software displays a <a href=\"/wiki/Bar_chart\" title=\"Bar chart\">bar chart</a> indicating what percent of audience members chose the various possible responses.  For questions with right/wrong answers, audience members can get immediate feedback about whether they chose the correct answer, since it can be indicated on the bar chart.  For survey-type polling questions, audience members can see from the summary how many other audience members chose the same response, along with how many audience members (or what percent of the audience) chose different responses.</li>\n<li>Create an interactive and fun learning environment: Clickers are in many ways novel devices, so the novelty itself can add interest to the learning environment.  More important, though, is the interactive nature of audience response systems.  Having been asked a particular question about a concept or opinion, students are genuinely interested in seeing the results.  They want to learn if they answered the question correctly, and they want to see how their response compares to the responses of their fellow audience members.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Beatty,_Ian_2004,_p._5_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Beatty,_Ian_2004,_p._5-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  The increased student engagement cited in the University of Wisconsin study (see footnote 1 below) attests to the ability of audience response systems to improve the learning environment.</li>\n<li>Confirm audience understanding of key points immediately: In the University of Wisconsin study previously cited, faculty members were unanimous in their recognition of this key advantage of audience response systems.  In other words, 100% of the faculty respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \"Clickers allowed me to assess student knowledge on a particular concept.\".  Students also recognized this benefit for their own self-assessment.  75% of student respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim, \"Clickers helped me get instant feedback on what I knew and didn't know.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-educause.edu_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-educause.edu-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  In a published article, a member of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Physics Education Research Group (UMPERG)articulated this advantage in more detail, using the term \"Classroom Communication System (CCS)\" for what we have been calling an audience response system:</li></ul>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>By providing feedback to an instructor about students' background knowledge and preconceptions, CCS-based pedagogy can help the instructor design learning and experiences appropriate to student's state of knowledge and explicitly confront and resolve misconceptions.  By providing frequent feedback about students' ongoing learning and confusions, it can help an instructor dynamically adjust her teaching to students' real, immediate, changing needs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Beatty,_Ian_2004,_p._5_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Beatty,_Ian_2004,_p._5-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<ul><li>Gather data for reporting and analysis: Unlike other forms of audience participation (such as a show of hands or holding up of response cards), audience response systems use software to record audience responses, and those responses are stored in a <a href=\"/wiki/Database\" title=\"Database\">database</a>.  Database entries are linked to a particular user, based on some ID number entered into the handheld remote device or based on a registration between the user and the company that manufactures the handheld device.

Depending on the solution chosen, each person has a device with which selections can be made, or a mobile device that they can use to respond. In a hardware solution, each remote communicates with a computer via receivers located around the room or via a single receiver connected to the presenter's computer using a <a href=\"/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universal Serial Bus\">USB</a> connector. In a software solution, each device communicates with the question via SMS or the internet.  After a set time \u2013 or after all participants have answered \u2013 the system ends the polling for that particular question and tabulates the results. Typically, the results are instantly made available to the participants via a <a href=\"/wiki/Bar_graph\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bar graph\">bar graph</a> displayed on the projector but can also be viewed in a web browser for some systems.\n</p><p>In situations where tracking is required, the <a href=\"/wiki/Serial_number\" title=\"Serial number\">serial number</a> of each remote control or the students identity number is entered beforehand in the control computer's database.

Often, a client would show different versions to different audiences, e.g. different movie endings, to gauge their relative effectiveness.  ASI would give out free tickets on the street to bring people into the theater, called the \"Preview House,\" for particular showings where each attendee would fill out a questionnaire and then be placed in a seat with a \"dial\" handset outfitted with a single knob that each attendee would turn to a position to indicate his or her level of interest. Turning the knob all the way left for \"dull\" to turning all the way to the right for \"great.\"  In 1976, ASI upgraded their system to become fully digital, have Yes/No buttons and, in some cases, numeric keys for entering in numbers, choices and monetary amounts.\n</p><p>Another of the industry\u2019s very earliest systems was the Consensor.

Results could be tallied and displayed to the class.\n</p><p>Audience response technology has evolved over time, moving away from hardware that required extensive wiring towards hand held wireless devices and small, portable receivers. In the 1980s, the Consensor product line evolved toward <a href=\"/wiki/Peripheral\" title=\"Peripheral\">peripherals</a> that could be plugged into a PC, and a software application to run thereon.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SimmonsElsberry1988p193_17-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SimmonsElsberry1988p193-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Wireless LANs allow today's peripherals to be cordless. Another example of this is <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft%27s\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Microsoft&#39;s\">Microsoft's</a> Mouse Mischief, a <a href=\"/wiki/PowerPoint\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PowerPoint\">PowerPoint</a> add-in, which has made it easier for teachers, professors, and office professionals to integrate audience response into their presentations.\n</p><p>The advent of smartphones has made possible systems in which audience members download an app (or run it as <a href=\"/wiki/SaaS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SaaS\">SaaS</a> in their <a href=\"/wiki/Web_browser\" title=\"Web browser\">web browser</a>) which then communicates with the audience response system (which is itself just software running on someone's device, whether desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone) via the local wireless network, the cellular telephone network, or both. In this model, the entire audience response system is a software product; all of the hardware is what the users brought with them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Devaney_2011-04-29_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Devaney_2011-04-29-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Experts\">Experts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Experts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are two books that have been written specifically about audience response systems by people who are considered experts in the use of audience response technology. In 2009, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Derek_Bruff&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Derek Bruff (page does not exist)\">Derek Bruff</a>, a professor at <a href=\"/wiki/Vanderbilt_University\" title=\"Vanderbilt University\">Vanderbilt University</a>, published <i>Teaching with Classroom Response Systems: Creating Active Learning Environments</i>. In 2015,  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=David_Campt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"David Campt (page does not exist)\">David Campt</a>, a meeting strategist and civic engagement consultant, released <i>Read the Room for Real: How a Simple Technology Creates Better Meetings</i> was published; this book focused on using audience response technology in non-academic environments.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hardware\">Hardware</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Hardware\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The majority of current audience response systems use wireless hardware. Two primary technologies exist to transmit data from the keypads to the base stations: <a href=\"/wiki/Infrared\" title=\"Infrared\">infrared</a> (IR) and <a href=\"/wiki/Radio_frequency\" title=\"Radio frequency\">radio frequency</a> (RF). A few companies also offer <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wide_Web\" title=\"World Wide Web\">Web</a>-based software that routes the data over the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> (sometimes in a unified system with IR and RF equipment). Cell phone-based systems are also becoming available.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Infrared\">Infrared</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Infrared\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The oldest of these technologies, IR audience response systems are better suited for smaller groups. IR uses the same technology as a TV remote, and is therefore the only one of the four technologies that requires line-of-sight between the keypad and receiver. This works well for a single keypad but can fail due to interference when signals from multiple keypads arrive simultaneously at the receiver. IR systems are typically more affordable than RF systems, but do not provide information back to the keypad.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_in_educational_settings\">Use in educational settings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Use in educational settings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Audience response systems can be used as a way of incorporating <a href=\"/wiki/Active_learning\" title=\"Active learning\">active learning</a> in a lecture or other classroom-type setting, for example by quizzing students, taking a quick survey, etc.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> They can also be used for taking attendance.  They can be used effectively by students as young as 9 or 10, depending on their maturity level.  An educator is able to generate worksheets and let students enter their answer choices at their own pace. After each question, the educator is able to instantly show the results of any quiz, for example in the form of <a href=\"/wiki/Histogram\" title=\"Histogram\">histogram</a> thus creating rapid 2-way feedback about how well learners are doing.\n</p><p>The fact that students can send responses anonymously means that sensitive topics can be included more readily than would otherwise be the case. An example of this is in helping students to learn about plagiarism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Audience response systems can also be used in classroom settings to simulate randomized controlled trials (RCT) such as 'Live the Trial', a mock RCT used to teach the concepts of clinical research. The mock trial answered the question 'Do red smarties make you happier?\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Radio_frequency_.28RF.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Radio_frequency_(RF)\">Radio frequency (RF)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Radio frequency (RF)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Ideal for large group environments, RF systems can accommodate hundreds of voters on a single base station. Using some systems, multiple base stations can be linked together in order to handle audiences that number in thousands. Other systems allow over a thousand on just one base. Because the data travels via radio frequency, the participant merely needs to be within range of the base station (300 \u2013 500&#160;feet). Some advanced models can accommodate additional features, such as short word answers, user log-in capabilities, and even multi-site polling.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internet\">Internet</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Internet\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Web-based audience response systems work with the participants' existing computing devices. These include <a href=\"/wiki/Notebook_computer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Notebook computer\">notebook computers</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Smartphone\" title=\"Smartphone\">smartphones</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant\" title=\"Personal digital assistant\">PDAs</a>, which are typically connected to the Internet via <a href=\"/wiki/Wi-Fi\" title=\"Wi-Fi\">Wi-Fi</a>, as well as classroom desktop computers. If the facilitator's computer is also Wi-Fi-enabled, they can even create their own IP network, allowing a closed system that doesn't depend on a separate base station.  The web server resides on or is accessible to the facilitator's computer, letting them control a set of web pages presenting questions. Participants log into the server using web browsers and see the questions with forms to input their responses. The summarized responses are available on a different set of pages, which can be displayed through the projector and also on each participant's device.\n</p><p>Internet has also made it possible to gather audience responses in massive scale. Various implementations of the concept exist. For example, Microsoft featured <a href=\"/wiki/Bing_Pulse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bing Pulse\">Bing Pulse</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> during the 2013 State of The Union (US) address by president Barack Obama. The system allowed registered users to input their responses (positive, negative, neutral) to the address and visualized the results as a trending graph in real time. Bing Pulse has since been used to cast over 35 million votes during national news broadcasts and other live meetings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Over 10,000 viewers powered the iPowow Viewer Vote <sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> which tracked live viewer emotional response for Channel 7 during the <a href=\"/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_2013\" title=\"Australian federal election, 2013\">2013 Australian Federal Election</a> debates and displayed as a live \"worm\" graph on the broadcast screen. For advertising and media research, online \"dial testing\" using an onscreen scale slider that is controlled by a mouse (or finger swipe on a touchscreen) is being used in conjunction with surveys and online communities to gather continuous feedback on video or audio files.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cell_phone\">Cell phone</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Cell phone\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The familiarity and widespread use of cell phones and text messaging has now given rise to systems that collect <a href=\"/wiki/SMS\" title=\"SMS\">SMS</a> responses and display them through a web page.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> These solutions don't require specialized voting hardware, but they do require telecom hardware (such as a mobile phone) and software, along with a web server, and therefore tend to be operated by dedicated vendors selling usage. They are typically favored by traveling speaking professionals and large conference halls that don't want to distribute, rent, or purchase proprietary ARS hardware. Computing devices with web browsers can also use these serviceLLs through <a href=\"/wiki/SMS_gateway\" title=\"SMS gateway\">SMS gateways</a>, if a separate web interface isn't provided.\n</p><p>Cell Phone enabled response systems, such as SMS Response System, are able to take text inputs from the audience and receive multiple responses to questions per SMS.  This allows a new pedagogical approach to teaching and learning, such as the work by Derek Bruff and an initiative on SMSRS.\n</p><p>The advantage of using such SMS type of response system is not limited to the logistical advantage of the presenter keeping no device inventory, it comes with an associated range of pedagogical advantages, such as agile learning, peer instruction (as possible with all types of response systems), it affords additional educational features like MCQ-Reasoning \u2013 a feature developed in a SMSRS system in Singapore that allows respondents to tag a reason to their choice of options in an MCQ, thus eliminating potential case of \"guessing-the-correct-answer\" syndrome, and text mining of SMS responses (to provide the gist of the messages collectively in a visual map).\n</p><p>Interactive SMS Forum is another feature that is proprietary to SMS-type response systems where audiences not only post their questions, but can also answer the questions posted by others via SMS.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Smartphone_.2F_HTTP_voting\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Smartphone_/_HTTP_voting\">Smartphone / HTTP voting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Smartphone / HTTP voting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With increasing penetration of smartphones with permanent internet connections, live audience response/voting can be achieved over the <a href=\"/wiki/HTTP_protocol\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HTTP protocol\">HTTP protocol</a>. SMS is still a solid solution because of its penetration and stability, but won't easily allow multi-voting support and might cause problem with multi-country audiences. The issue with SMS not supporting multi-country audiences is projected to be solved with <a href=\"/wiki/SMS_hubbing\" title=\"SMS hubbing\">SMS hubbing</a>.\n</p><p>In classrooms and conferences with <a href=\"/wiki/Wi-Fi\" title=\"Wi-Fi\">Wi-Fi</a> support or anywhere with <a href=\"/wiki/GPRS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GPRS\">GPRS</a> coverage, software systems can be used for live audience feedback, mood measurement or live polling. These systems frequently support voting with both <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_apps\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mobile apps\">mobile apps</a> as well as mobile browsers. These apps invoke available local area networks (LAN) and provide a charge-free and cuts the needs to devoted hardware.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With mobile apps and browser enabled voting, there aren't any setup costs for hardware since the audience uses their own phones as voting devices and the result is often presented in any browser controlled by the lecturer.\n</p><p>With a standard mobile browser solution these are click and go solutions without additional installations. Therefore, live audiences can be reached, and smartphone voting can be used \u2013 as with SMS \u2013 in any number of different locations. With the <a href=\"/wiki/GPRS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GPRS\">GPRS</a> solution the audience does not necessary need to be in the same area as the lecturer as with radio frequency, infrared or <a href=\"/wiki/Bluetooth\" title=\"Bluetooth\">Bluetooth</a>-based response systems.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Software\">Software</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Audience_response&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Software\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Audience response software enables the presenter to collect participant data, display graphical polling results, and export the data to be used in reporting and analysis.
