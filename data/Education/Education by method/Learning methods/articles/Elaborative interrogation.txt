Elaborative interrogation is one of a simple strategy used for the enhancement of memory during the process of learning. This method involves the prompting learner to read the fact-to-be-remembered and generate an explanation for it. The learner uses questions like Why? and How? to understand the meaning of the information, for example, Why do leaves of a tree fall during winter? or How do falling of leaves occur during winter?. Elaboration technique that is used here aids in clarifying the relationship that exists between the subject(leaves) and the predicate (fall during winter)in the given information. And as a result, the clarifying relationship that was seen is basically drawn from the memory however, the exact prior knowledge that is required for this is not clear. Some researchers emphasize on the importance of knowledge on the subject while others give importance towards knowing the abstract details of the information.
