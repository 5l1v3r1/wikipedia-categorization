Traditionally, virtual worlds have been used for entertainment. However,  \nstarting from approximately 2004 both corporate world and academia started to recognize business value\nof virtual worlds for training and education, collaboration, and marketing. Development and maturity \nof most popular virtual world - <a href=\"/wiki/Second_Life\" title=\"Second Life\">Second Life</a> - played a significant role in corporate movement \ntowards virtual worlds for several reasons:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Second Life was the first public virtual world that did not offer any topic, or theme. Each user is free to create their own objects, personalized environment, and / or to hold any events of their choice. This immediately sparked the idea of creating meeting rooms and virtual classrooms, first within academia, quickly followed by corporate users. Later, meetings and events developed into more advanced uses, from training simulations and communication training using robotic avatars, to 3D visualization, prototyping and collaboration <sup id=\"cite_ref-Heiphetz_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Heiphetz-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>From 2005 to 2007 Second Life experienced explosive growth of the userbase. Companies were eager to reach this potential customer base and started marketing programs in Second Life. Without a good plan, knowledge of the audience and without good understanding of the new medium many of the early corporate marketing efforts failed, producing a backlash against corporate adoption of virtual worlds.</li>\n<li>Second Life provided a wide array of tools for building 3D objects, scripting language to apply required behavior to the objects and easy entry path (users can register and try everything free of charge, and can purchase their own land - to which they can control access - at a reasonable price).</li></ul>\n<p>By early 2010 several corporate applications of virtual worlds were shown to be successful:\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Corporate_training\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Corporate training</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#What_can_be_done_with_virtual_worlds_that_cannot_be_done_otherwise\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">What can be done with virtual worlds that cannot be done otherwise</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Procedural_training\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Procedural training</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Communication_training\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Communication training</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Enterprise_collaboration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Enterprise collaboration</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Corporate_training\">Corporate training</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corporate_use_of_Second_Life&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Corporate training\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_can_be_done_with_virtual_worlds_that_cannot_be_done_otherwise\">What can be done with virtual worlds that cannot be done otherwise</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corporate_use_of_Second_Life&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: What can be done with virtual worlds that cannot be done otherwise\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Generally, all kinds of learning involve several stages:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Accumulation of knowledge</b> is accomplished by absorbing information via reading materials, listening to live, videotaped or recorded lectures, and watching demonstrations. Also known as <i>explicit</i> knowledge,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Polanyi_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Polanyi-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> it has long been foundation of learning. Combination of classroom instruction and <a href=\"/wiki/E-learning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"E-learning\">e-learning</a>, provides a good way for acquiring explicit knowledge. Virtual worlds have a limited use and value during accumulation of knowledge stage, utilized perhaps to conduct classes in a virtual classroom.

Thus, procedural training is an important part of corporate training. Procedural training involves memorizing step-by-step how to perform a certain operation. Examples of operations can include anything from lock-out / tag-out equipment procedures on a manufacturing plant, preparing an experiment in chemical lab, or various medical procedures performed by a nurse.\n</p><p>Procedures are impossible to learn by reading books,  watching movies or listening to instructor.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2011)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> A trainee needs to practice procedure multiple times to receive the necessary skill. Virtual Worlds provide a unique fit for procedural training, since they allow for creation of a realistic environment and tools for trainees to practice at their own pace,\nany time until they know the procedure by heart - without a need to involve real life locations, equipment and instructors.\n</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.thevirtualworldsbook.com\">Training and Collaboration with Virtual Worlds</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-Heiphetz_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Heiphetz-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> describes training by The Nurse Anesthesia (NURA) Department of <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Kansas\" title=\"University of Kansas\">University of Kansas</a>.\nA team led by David M. Antonacci and Stephanie P. Gerald of University of Kansas Medical Center Teaching &amp; Learning Technologies (TLT) Department supported the technical side of the project. They created simulation of <i>induction</i> procedure for student nurses.\nInduction is a complex medical procedure in which a nurse anesthetist prepares a patient for surgery.\nIt consists of many steps, and involves both \"how to\" knowledge (how to manipulate the equipment)\nand procedural knowledge (steps to do and what decision to make when).\nSecond Life simulation helps students to learn procedural part in a safe and controlled learning space.\nIt does not provide students with tactile feedback, and is not intended to teach them how to manipulate actual physical equipment or patients. These skills are better taught in physical world, using real equipment. Rather, it's the sequence of events that is at issue in the simulated\ntraining. For example, students learn when to use a <a href=\"/wiki/Laryngoscope\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Laryngoscope\">laryngoscope</a> in the induction procedure\nusing simulation, but they learn how to use the laryngoscope for <a href=\"/wiki/Intubation\" title=\"Intubation\">intubation</a> later, using a\nreal laryngoscope and a mannequin-like patient simulator.\n</p><p>Even though the virtual world does not provide practice with the physical \"how-to\" aspects of\ninduction, the immersive setting does allow students to learn the sequence of steps and\nbranching decision making\u2014which, when it comes to anesthesia, is as important as the physical\naspects. Separating these functions reduces <a href=\"/wiki/Cognitive_load\" title=\"Cognitive load\">cognitive load</a> for the nurse in training, and\nimproves the overall result by breaking a very complex procedure into manageable units.\nIn other words, students master execution of the induction routine using the virtual\nworld simulation. By the time they advance to the next level, they are able to concentrate\nfully on learning how to physically handle the patient and equipment without being distracted\nby trying to learn the sequence of steps.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Communication_training\">Communication training</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corporate_use_of_Second_Life&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Communication training\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Communication training in virtual worlds started as synchronous role-play, similar\nto role-play sessions being conducted in a real life.

During the next step trainee selects the next best response from the dialog and robotic avatar provides a new response.\nThe advantage of this method is that trainees can practice at any time, at their own pace, without\nexternal pressure. At the same time, availability of only pre-scripted dialogs and the absence of\na live instructor are certainly a disadvantage of this methodology that can be corrected by scheduling live role-play sessions and discussions with\ninstructor in person or using Second Life.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Enterprise_collaboration\">Enterprise collaboration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Corporate_use_of_Second_Life&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Enterprise collaboration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the world of business, collaboration has become an important tool in reducing time-to-market and increasing cost savings \n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cohen_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cohen-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\nAs more and more corporations acquire expanded or global presence and work projects are often supported by geographically dispersed \nteams, virtual collaboration becomes increasingly important.
