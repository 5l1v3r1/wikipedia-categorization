A study group is a small group of people who regularly meet to discuss shared fields of study.  These groups can be found in high school and college setting, within companies, occasionally primary/junior school and sometimes Middle School/Intermediate. Professional advancement organizations also may encourage study groups. Study groups have helped students who have trouble being in a large group setting. Each group is unique and draws on the backgrounds and abilities of its members to determine the material that will be covered. Often, a leader who is not actively studying the material will direct group activities. Some colleges actively set up study group programs for students to sign up. Typical college level academic groups include 5-20 students and an administrator or tutor drawn from the graduate program or an upperclassman. Professional groups are often smaller. Researchers have found that there are many benefits in utilizing a study group to learn or prepare for a test. Study groups serve as a procrastination solution; when working in a group, you are less likely to procrastinate because you have other individuals holding you accountable and or depending on you. Other benefits include but are not limited to, learning material faster, learning new study techniques from other individuals, acquiring new perspectives and breaking the monotony.   skills are extremely important to your success. Study groups copy what its like to work with a group of employees to solve a problem.
