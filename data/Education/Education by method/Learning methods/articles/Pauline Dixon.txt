  Pauline Dixon is a Professor of International Development and Education at Newcastle University in North East England. She is the Research Director of the E.G. West Centre  at the University and Degree Programme Director of the Masters in International Development and Education. Dixon has been involved in multiple projects predominately focusing on researching the role of school choice and potential solutions for achieving Education For All in Asia and Africa. Her work is closely linked to the philosophy of Professor James Tooley who she has worked with on various funded John Templeton Foundation projects. Between 2003–2005 both explored the nature and existence of private schools for the poor in India, resulting in multiple academic articles and exposing an under the radar network of schools throughout the developing world. Following the success of the project both Tooley and Dixon lead on further Templeton funded research that aimed to look at 'education in conflict zones' with a focus on African schools (2011-2013). Her last research project was funded by the ESRC focusing on Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and identifying high ability and creative children in poor areas of the Kinondoni District. In conjunction with her work in India she has worked as an advisor and education consultant for the British-based charity Absolute Return for Kids (ARK), where she helped initiate the ASPIRE programme (Allow Synthetic Phonics to Improve Results in English).  Dixon delivers keynote speeches and presentations around the world including at Capitol Hill Washington D.C., University of Connecticut, and Brown University, USA, Free Market Foundation of South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa, Waterloo Global Science Initiative (WGSI),  Ontario, Canada, and Panama City, Panama. She also delivers talks in Europe including Uppsala University, Sweden, Riksdagen, the Swedish Parliament,  Zurich, Liechtenstein, Durham, Glasgow, London, and Vienna. She has also presented the research findings to government officials in India and Africa. She gave a TEDx talk at Glasgow in 2012 "How Private Schools are Serving the Poorest".
