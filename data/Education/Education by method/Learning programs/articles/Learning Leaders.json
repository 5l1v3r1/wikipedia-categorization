It offers a wide range of interactive parent workshops in multiple languages. The workshops cover topics including supporting literacy and math skills at home, understanding child and adolescent development and navigating the middle and high school applications process.  The program aims to help increase parent knowledge about the public school system and learning standards and to develop strategies for effectively supporting their children\u2019s education.\n</p><p><b>Bringing Community and Family Resources to Schools</b>\n</p><p>Learning Leaders divides its volunteer programs into two main models: the Core Program and the Enrichment Programs. The Core Program recruits and trains community and family volunteers to provide students with one-on-one tutoring in reading, writing, ESL, math and other academic subjects at the elementary and middle school levels, as well as non-instructional support such as general office and library assistance.\n</p><p>Through Learning Leaders\u2019 Enrichment Programs, volunteers supplement students\u2019 education beyond core academic support. These programs, which include BookTalk and Book Buddies, promote a life-long love of reading and literature, encourage students to discuss and think critically and develop confidence and communication skills.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Learning_Leaders&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nyparenting.com/stories/2011/4/fp_learningleaders_2011_04.html\">\"A History of Learning Leaders\"</a>, New York Parenting, April 2011</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nyparenting.com/stories/2011/4/fp_learningleaders_2011_04.html\">\"A History of Learning Leaders\"</a>, New York Parenting, April 2011</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.thirteen.org/nyvoices/yearofchange/timeline.html\">\"A Year of Change: Leadership in the Principal's Office\"</a>, THIRTEEN, WNET New York Public Media</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation news\">Roberts, Sam (July 6, 2005). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss\">\"New York Times: City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million\"</a>. <i>The New York Times</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
