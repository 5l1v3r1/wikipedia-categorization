The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is a U.S. federal government initiative to enhance the national security of the U.S. by  increasing the national capacity to understand and interact effectively with foreign cultures and languages.  NSEP oversees nine critical initiatives designed to attract, recruit, and train a future national security workforce.  Some funding comes in exchange for a commitment to U.S. federal government service upon completion of academic study. NSEP is aimed at building a wider pool of Americans with foreign language and international skills by involving participants in "innovative, intensive, and long-term programs designed to provide meaningful opportunities to gain significant competencies in these languages and cultures."    NSEP was established by the National Security Education Act. Oversight for NSEP is provided by the National Security Education Board (NSEB), which meets "to review and make recommendations based on program mission and objectives." The NSEB consists of a 13-member board including representatives from seven Cabinet-level departments.  Six non-federal members, appointed by the President also serve on the NSEB. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OSD/P&R) provides policy oversight to NSEP.  On February 6, 2012, the Defense Language Office and the National Security Education Program were merged to form the Defense Language and National Security Education Office.
