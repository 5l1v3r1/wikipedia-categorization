Playlyfe is an online gamification platform headquartered in Bangalore, India. It aims to reduce the barrier to gamification by simplifying the process of designing gamified systems. Playlyfe offers gamification on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. While working for the student volunteer organization AIESEC Jaipur, Johny Jose struck upon the idea of increasing engagement of its volunteers by using game mechanics. At that time, Johny was pursuing his B.Tech from LNMIIT, Jaipur. He pitched this idea to his batchmates - Kumar Harsh and Bhavya Agarwal, who banded together, and Playlyfe started off in 2011.  After graduating from college in 2012, they continued working on the product in New Delhi. Around the end of that year, Bhavya left to pursue higher education, and the rest of the team went through three iterations of the product, refining the user experience and the mechanics Playlyfe offered. Playlyfe moved base to Bangalore in 2014, where Chitresh Parihar, a friend of Johny who was serving as a President of AIESEC Jaipur chapter, joined as a co-founder. Playlyfe offers a developer-focussed platform which lets its users design gamified systems in their browsers, test its effectiveness in a simulation environment, and then integrate the design with their web and mobile apps or websites via Playlyfe's REST API. Rated as one of the top 10 enterprise-grade gamification platforms in the world in the Gamification Industry Report  compiled by the Enterprise Gamification Consultancy.  Playlyfe won the most promising startup award at InTech50 2015  organised by iSPIRT â€” the Indian Software Product Industry Roundtable,  an Indian software industry think tank.
