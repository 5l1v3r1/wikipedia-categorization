The following is a list of the presidents and executive secretaries of the Religious Education Association. The Religious Education Association is a nonprofit member association, serving as a professional and learned society for scholars and researchers involved in the field of religious education.  In 2003 it merged formally with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education. Up until that date, REA presidents could serve for more than a year at a time, while APRRE presidents served for only one year at a time. At the moment of merger, presidential terms were limited to one year and "practitioners" was added to the title of the organization, making it the "Religious Education Association: An Association of Professors, Practitioners and Researchers in Religious Education" (REA: APPRRE).
