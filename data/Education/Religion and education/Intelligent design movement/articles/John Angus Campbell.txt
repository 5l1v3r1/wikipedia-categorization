Meyer (who is also a Fellow of the Center for Science and Culture) he edited Darwinism, Design and Public Education,  a collection of articles from the journal Rhetoric and Public Affairs  Campbell was slated to appear as a witness for the defense in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, but withdrew on June 2, 2005, the day of his scheduled deposition.   In 2007 Campbell ran for a seat on the school board in North Mason County, Washington. He offered his services to "restore trust," and "establish transparency", but did not disclose his links to intelligent design. In a telephone interview he stated that he would not be dealing with curricula, and that he is a "Darwinist" who considers that debating Darwin can engage the interest of students and improve their skills in critical thinking. He was quoted as saying "Rather than demonizing people that believe in ID, I think there are ways people could use their ideas to study Darwinism more closely."   The election was held on November 6, 2007, and the unofficial results showed John Campbell defeating the incumbent Glenn Landram by 2,996 votes (68.06%) to 1,406 (31.94%).   He currently serves on the schoolboard.  Court documents
