HiBuR's main purpose is to forge connections between students of the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by offering joint educational activities and practical experiences at both universities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Academic_Exchange\">Academic Exchange</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hibur&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Academic Exchange\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Student Exchange \u2013 One of Hibur's current endeavors is to establish a program that provides students the opportunity to study abroad.  This experience will enable students to:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Globalize their educational experience</li>\n<li>Enhance academic opportunities that may otherwise be limited or unavailable</li>\n<li>Establish professional and career opportunities through networking</li>\n<li>Improve language skills and cultural understanding</li>\n<li>Experience personal growth</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internships\">Internships</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hibur&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Internships\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Hibur\u2019s internship program offers students the chance to live, study and work in a foreign country. Internship departments in Boston and Haifa strive to find the best match for the students when placing them in corporate and academic environments in Israel and the United States.\n</p><p>As a result of faculty and student interest MISTI <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/misti/\">[1]</a> decided to create MISTI Israel <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/misti/mit-israel/\">[2]</a> in the Summer of 2008.\n</p><p>The Haifa Department, with the collaboration of MISTI Israel, helped find internships for MIT students in Haifa-based high-tech companies and Technion campus laboratories,\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Technion-MIT_Activities\">Technion-MIT Activities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hibur&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Technion-MIT Activities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Hibur\u2019s joint educational activities including video lectures, workshops, delegations, and various enrichment and higher learning opportunities, form an integral part of the program.\n</p><p><b>Video Lecture</b> \u2013 Throughout the academic year, Technion and MIT researchers give online, dynamic lectures in real-time about the latest research in their fields of expertise.  The video lectures are available to the greater student body and do not require prior background knowledge.\n</p><p><b>Teaching Assistant Workshops</b> \u2013 Every year, MIT conducts a workshop focusing on improving the quality of academic classes. These workshops are geared to teaching assistants and professors alike.  In the past, Hibur organized online workshops in which Technion teaching assistants and professors exchanged ideas and information with their MIT counterparts\n</p><p><b>Delegations</b> \u2013 Every year Hibur sends an Academic delegation of approximately eight to fifteen students to the Technion and MIT to exchange ideas, knowledge, and perspectives with students at the visited campus.  This delegation provides a great resource for students to swap information regarding their universities, native countries and ongoing research projects.\n</p><p><b>BizTEC &amp; 100K</b> \u2013 The Technion holds a yearly entrepreneur competition called BizTEC.  The ten finalists of BizTEC then have the opportunity to compete in the equivalent entrepreneur competition at MIT, The MIT 100K.Entrepreneureship Competition.  In order to compete, participating groups must have at least one representative from the university that holds the competition.  Hibur\u2019s programs offer students from the Technion and MIT the opportunity to connect and form groups that can work well and participate together in competitions at both universities.\n</p><p><b>Joint Academic Projects</b> \u2013 Hibur\u2019s online platform unites students from the Technion and MIT who would like to collaborate on final projects within similar disciplines.  Students can perform research, write, and exchange information through Hibur\u2019s website. Hibur also assists with the logistics involved in connecting researchers with students from each university and building joint intercontinental projects.\n</p><p><b>MathWorks</b> \u2013 Hibur has implemented a preparation course, which has helped hundreds of students, in Matlab for the Technion pre-university refresher program. Matlab, developed by MathWorks Inc., is a technical computing software program used by engineers and scientists.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1332\nCached time: 20180908211209\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.072 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.098 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 476/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 2978/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 490/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.023/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 961 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   82.306      1 Template:Infobox_company\n100.00%   82.306      1 -total\n 77.69%   63.940      1 Template:Infobox\n 13.53%   11.135      1 Template:Br_separated_entries\n  6.00%    4.937      1 Template:Main_other\n  3.39%    2.790      1 Template:Comma_separated_entries\n  2.68%    2.206      1 Template:Template_other\n  2.28%    1.873      1 Template:Longitem\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:13075933-0!canonical and timestamp 20180908211209 and revision id 767793242\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Student_exchange"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Technion_\u2013_Israel_Institute_of_Technology"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Israel\u2013United_States_relations"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Boston, Massachusetts"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Haifa"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Israel"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"List of business entities"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Non Profit Organization"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"United States"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox company"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Infobox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Longitem"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Br separated entries"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Comma separated entries"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Template other"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Infobox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Navbar"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:InfoboxImage"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Separated entries"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:TableTools"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://web.mit.edu/misti/","http://web.mit.edu/misti/mit-israel/","http://hibur.technion.ac.il"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Academic Exchange","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Hibur","byteoffset":684,"anchor":"Academic_Exchange"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Internships","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Hibur","byteoffset":1148,"anchor":"Internships"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Technion-MIT Activities","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Hibur","byteoffset":1790,"anchor":"Technion-MIT_Activities"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Hibur","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q16995329"}]}}
