BAHCEP (Beijing And Hong Kong Cultural Exchange Program) is an annual exchange initiative organized by the China Study Society, Hong Kong University Student's Union (CSS, HKUSU). In 2012, the three participating universities include Peking University, Tsinghua University and the University of Hong Kong. These are generally considered as the best universities of their respective regions. 20 students from Beijing are going to spend a week in Hong Kong together with local students during their autumn break (29 September - 6 October). The goal of this exchange is to give them an opportunity to communicate freely and come to a mutual understanding. Therefore, unguided face-to-face group discussions are the main focus of this event.
