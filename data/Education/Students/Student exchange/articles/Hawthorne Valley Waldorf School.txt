Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School (HVWS) is an independent co-ed Waldorf day school set in the foothills of the Taconic Mountains in Ghent, Columbia County, New York. The school offers classes from pre-kindergarten through grade 12; it is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools and by the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America. Founded in 1973, the school is one of the oldest and largest of the approximately 170 independent Waldorf schools in North America. The first high school class of HVWS graduated in 1983. The high school has a boarding program for students from other schools. It currently enrolls students from Afghanistan, Canada, China, several European nations, and Mexico. The school follows an interdisciplinary approach based on the Waldorf curriculum, with a strong emphasis on English, math, and science skills and on art, music, and intercultural understanding. The high school curriculum is college preparatory. Situated on an organic biodynamic farm, all grades at the school have classes that integrate farm science (biology, economics, nutrition) with their curriculum. In 3rd and 9th grade, HVWS students spend a week directly learning at the farm. The lower school offers the EARTH program for students who might not thrive in a traditional classroom environment. The EARTH program combines a land-based and classroom curriculum. The school's annual public events include the following: HVWS competes with public and private schools in cross-country, volleyball, and basketball. It also fields club soccer teams for boys and girls. HVWS is a branch of the Hawthorne Valley Association, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to social renewal through education, agriculture, and the arts.
