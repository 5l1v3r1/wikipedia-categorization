The Australia-Indonesia Youth Exchange Program (AIYEP) is an exchange program which aims to provide opportunities for young Australians and Indonesians through social, professional and cultural exchange.  The program sees 18 Indonesian participants (9 male, 9 female) aged between 21-25 undertake professional development activities in an Australian state or territory to experience through a rural and urban phase. Then after two months, they meet their Australian counterparts - and together they travel to Indonesia where they undertake a similar experience in an Indonesian province as a group of 36. In Indonesia they experience both a rural village-stay and an urban environment. The program was established in 1981 and is an initiative of the Australia-Indonesia Institute (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).
