During the final days of the campaign, he held \"bitch-ins\" at the Rock, a centrally located student landmark, which led to two marches to the 619 Clark Street administration office. In response to the second march, two university leaders, Dean Payson Wild and Vice-president Franklin Kreml, came onto the steps of the building as Mr. Pines fielded questions from several hundred random (non-radical, non-organized) students while local TV stations recorded the event. The presence of the university officials gave some credibility to the campaign, and Mr. Pines narrowly won the election by 83 votes.\n</p><p>Archival documents referenced seem to associate this protest with a Vietnam War teach-in that happened in the same month, indicating that \"in April 1967, the first anti-war rally took place on the Northwestern campus in the form of a Vietnam teach-in.\" Careful reading, however, shows that the events were concurrent but not connected.\n</p><p>According to Ellis Pines himself, this demonstration, the first of its kind at the university, took place during his candidacy and was not directed against the Vietnam War. Rather it focused on \"student life\" issues, i.e. parietal hours, open occupancy in Evanston housing for African-American students, greater autonomy in pursuing a creative education, etc. A faculty member, the late political science instructor Edward W. \"Ted\" Gude, took Mr. Pines aside during the campaign and told him that he would have faculty support so long as he addressed campus but not international issues. Mr. Pines complied,  and he said nothing about Vietnam during his campaign and brief tenure in office. The international pledge, however, was broken when the distinguished and popular Slavic Languages and Literature Professor Irwin Weil approached Mr. Pines about sending a supportive message to President Lyndon Johnson on behalf of Israel from the Student Senate on the eve of the Six Day War (June 1967). Professor Weil was concerned that academia's opposition to the Vietnam War would be misconstrued as general anti-war opposition to President Johnson should he need to use force in the Middle East situation. Although Mr. Pines agreed to Professor Weil's request in bringing the matter to the attention of the Student Senate, he also invited officers from Chicago's Arab nation consulates to participate in what became a rousing but polite debate with the Israel advocates.\n</p><p>At a later time, Professor Gude did participate in a Vietnam teach-in.\n</p><p><br />\nOn April 27, 1967, a demonstration by the name \"Gentle Thursday\" took place outside Harris Hall in view of the weekly NROTC drill on Deering Meadow. It was described that \"the gathering resembled a student carnival more than a protest by militants.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dow_Chemical_Company_Demonstration\">Dow Chemical Company Demonstration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Northwestern_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Dow Chemical Company Demonstration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In early February 1968, students heard news of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dow_Chemical_Company\" title=\"Dow Chemical Company\">Dow Chemical Company</a>, the producer of the chemical weapon on <a href=\"/wiki/Napalm\" title=\"Napalm\">napalm</a>, recruiting on campus and began protesting.

One was that University President Morton Schapiro has to approve all voting members of the committee, and the other was that Chief Investment Officer Will McLean only has to forward recommendations of the committee to the Board of Trustees if he concurs. However, according to a copy of the charter obtained by The Daily, both components remained as of two weeks ago. \"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>\"Three divestment campaigns are currently pushing for changes to the University's investments: In early March, ASG Senate passed an Unshackle NU-sponsored resolution that calls on the University to divest from corporations the group says promote mass incarceration.\n</p><p>Last February, after a tense five hours of debate, Senate narrowly passed a Northwestern Divest-sponsored resolution that called on the University to divest from six corporations the authors say violate Palestinians\u2019 human rights.\n</p><p>As for coal divestment, Fossil Free NU has pushed the University to divest from fossil fuels since November 2014.

He spoke to Fitz about his concerns for healthcare after college athletes were done playing their sport and also for athletes being unfairly exploited. He partnered with Ramogi Huma, who played linebacker for UCLA in the late 1990s, to bring his case to the National Labor Relations Board.\n</p><p>Using ideas that he got from the National College Players Association, which started as the Collegiate Athletes Coalition created by Huma in 1996, Colter came up with the College Athletes Players Association, which very closely resembled the National Football League Players Association and the National Basketball Association Players Association. When Huma reached out to Colter on the phone the first thing Colter told him was that he wanted to unionize Northwestern's football team.\n</p><p>Although Colter's main concern was with longterm healthcare provisions for player, after talking with fellow athletes around the country other issues were brought to his attention such as the athlete stipend not being adequate enough to cover the total coast of attending college as an athlete, not having enough money to buy food, and not having scholarships that ensure four years of eligibility, meaning at the end of each season the head coach decides whether or not he wants to let you stay in the program and maintain your scholarship for another year. With all these things in mind Colter, partnered with Huma and Tim Waters, who headed the movement for the unionization of steelworkers, to create APU or All Players United.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Northwestern_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://exhibits.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/1968/documents/williamsonwild.pdf\">\"Northwestern Archives - Student Faculty AntiWar\"</a> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(PDF)</span>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.btitle=Northwestern+Archives+-+Student+Faculty+AntiWar&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fexhibits.library.northwestern.edu%2Farchives%2Fexhibits%2F1968%2Fdocuments%2Fwilliamsonwild.pdf&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AStudent+activism+at+Northwestern+University\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-:0-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-:0_2-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-:0_2-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-:0_2-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/catalog/inu-ead-nua-archon-1044\">\"Northwestern Archives\"</a>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.btitle=Northwestern+Archives&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Ffindingaids.library.northwestern.edu%2Fcatalog%2Finu-ead-nua-archon-1044&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AStudent+activism+at+Northwestern+University\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Northwestern University.
