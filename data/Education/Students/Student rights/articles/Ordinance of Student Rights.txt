Student Human Rights Ordinance (Korean: 학생인권조례) is an ordinance in operation in some cities and provinces in South Korea. It first began in Gyeonggi (2010) and expanded to Gwangju (2011), Seoul (2012), and the Jeollabuk-do Province (2013) (North Jeolla Province). The primary objective of this ordinance is to guarantee human rights of student and youth in South Korea.  The four ordinances are very similar, however some cities neglected certain rights and actions. The Gyeonggi-do Student Human Rights Ordinance and Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights are the only two to include the right to not be discriminated against due to pregnancy.   Rights surrounding gender and sexuality differs in each location. The Seoul ordinance as well as Gyeonggi-do ordinance include sexual orientation and gender identity.   Gwangju ordinance only includes sexual orientation and Jeollabuk-do only includes gender equality. Seoul, Jeollabuk-do and Gyeonggi-do each dedicate a day to celebrate Student Human Rights Day in efforts to expand interest and participation in the human rights of the student.    Gwangju has not created a day devoted to student human rights. Seoul’s ordinance mandates that basic human rights must always be upheld even if they are not listed in the ordinance. The ordinances state that each city and province has to stay updated on a plan to ensure human rights. In Gwangju there is a survey conducted every two years to keep the human rights plan up to date.  In Gyeonggi-do, the Superintendent of Public Instruction conducts an annual survey on student human rights.  In Seoul, the Superintendent conducts an annual survey on the actual conditions of student human rights and reflect the results in the drafting of the comprehensive human rights plan for students.  In Jeollabuk-do, the Chancellor conducts a survey on the condition of student human rights every year to reflect them in the education of human rights of students.
