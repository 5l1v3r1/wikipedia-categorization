Hotlist is a geo-social networking aggregator that enables users to coordinate plans with friends and discover what will be happening at millions of popular venues all over the world.  Hotlist's web platform and iPhone app   are the only Location-based services that emphasize plans.  The service aggregates data from across the web in order to show users which places will be trending nearby. Users can take "virtual peeks" into venues in advance to see Facebook profile photos of the expected crowds, details on upcoming events, male:female ratios, and which of their Facebook friends plan to attend.  The site and application also provide personalized recommendations based on the People, Places, and Interests that users Follow. As of November, 2011, Hotlist utilizes over 100 million people's plans to provide social information on over 3 million venues in more than 40,000 cities.  Hotlist was founded by Gianni Martire and Chris Mirabile.  NYU Stern gave Hotlist a $25,000 grant after winning NYU's 10th Annual Business Plan Competition.  This was followed by $800,000 in angel capital from Centurion Holdings, led by former UBS Chairman & CEO Joseph J. Grano, Jr.  Hotlist's first headquarters were Carlyle Court, an NYU dorm.  It then relocated to the NYU Poly Incubator set up by NYU Poly and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  In July 2011, Hotlist moved into its own loft style office in the SoHo district of New York City.
