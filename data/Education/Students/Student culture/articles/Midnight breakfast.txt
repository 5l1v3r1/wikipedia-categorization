Midnight breakfast is a generic term for a communal meal served at some American colleges and universities. Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence "midnight") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event. Midnight breakfast is usually at most a weekly event and at least an annual event, and should not be confused with school dining facilities that operate 24 hours a day on a regular basis.
