The rates of college students binge drinking in the United States have fluctuated for the past years.  As high as 40% of college students could now be considered alcoholics, as defined by the next edition psychiatry's diagnostic manual, but many of these individuals would be regarded as having only a mild drinking problem. Most college binge drinkers and drug users don't develop lifelong problems.   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reported in 2012, that more than 80% of college students drink alcohol, with estimated 40% report binge drinking in the past 2 weeks, and about 25% report having academic consequences because of their drinking.  56% of students reported binge drinking once a week.  In comparison, the comparable figure of alcoholism for American Indian and Alaskan Native youth ("Native youth" hereafter) is approximately 80 percent (Beauvais, Oetting, & Wolf, 1989). Individual and environmental factors for experiencing alcohol-related consequences have been identified such as drinking during high-risk periods, such as spring break, or belonging to specific student subgroups (e.g., Greek organizations).  Drinking throughout high school also played a role, suggesting that binge drinking starts earlier than college for some.  7. Dodd, L.J., Al-Nakeeb, Y., Nevill, A. and Forshaw, M.J., 2010.
