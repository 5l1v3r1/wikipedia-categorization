A Neighborhood Assistant (NA) is another term for a Residential Assistant. The intention of Neighborhood Assistants are to bring a community together and to support people within a community. This title was changed at Oakes college, University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), as Oakes' College's Neighborhood Assistants collectively decided that this would be a better term to suit their role in the community. Leonel, one of such Neighborhood Assistants, commented, "Oakes would not be the same if my title was Residential Assistant because people usually feel a 'police' figure from the word Residential and neighborhood sounds friendly."
