Dead week is a slang term for the week before schools' final examinations in the United States of America. The week is known thus because of its notorious stress; the propensity for college and university students to save exam study until the last possible week; and because term papers are often due. Students prepare for the exams and papers by engaging in all-night studying sessions, often with the aid of stimulants such as coffee, caffeine tablets, energy drinks, adderall,  or other prescription amphetamines.  During this period, some students suffer from sleep deprivation, increased irritability, and  vomiting.  At some schools, this week is referred to as Hell Week, Reading Period, or Reading Week. Many campus dormitories/residence halls require near silence for most of the day during the week before finals, to aid to those studying for their finals or writing papers.  Depending on the school there may also be a moratorium on paper assignments, exams, and student organizational activities during dead week. Libraries may also be open for extended hours, or might stay available all night. Many schools have a tradition, known by various names, where students open their doors and windows and scream as loudly as they can (usually at midnight) on one or all nights of this week.
