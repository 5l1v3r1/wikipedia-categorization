Skip Day (also called Ditch Day, Senior Ditch Day, Cut Day or Senior Skip Day) is a tradition in some American schools where the majority  of the senior class skips school.  It is commonly held the Monday following Senior Prom or another large event.  School administration reactions can vary greatly in response to Senior Skip Day.  Some schools openly encourage the practice, helping the students pick a day to take off and advising teachers not to schedule quizzes or exams on the given skip day.   Other schools, however, may severely punish students for willfully being absent from school to the extent of assigning detention, suspending students, or even going so far as to provide a failing grade or withdrawing a college recommendation.[improper synthesis?] There is no generally agreed upon beginning to this unofficial tradition, but the practice has been in effect since at least the 1970s.  The film Ferris Bueller's Day Off was a catalyst for several Senior Skip Days in the 1980s and mid 1990s .  At Caltech, "Ditch Day" has become an annual tradition.
