A varsity match is a sporting fixture between two university rivals. It is most commonly used to describe meetings between Cambridge University and Oxford University. The Scottish Varsity rugby match between the University of St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh at Murrayfield stadium claims to be the oldest recurring Varsity match in the world, having been played since the 1860s. However, the Varsity Match in Cricket between Oxford and Cambridge predates it, having first been played in 1827. By far the country's longest-running series of varsity matches is played between the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford with some rivalries airing live on national television. Unlike in North America, the broadcast of university sport is not commonplace. In recent years, city and regional sporting rivalries have developed.
