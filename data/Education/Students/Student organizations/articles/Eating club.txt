An eating club is a social club found in American universities.  Eating clubs date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are intended to allow college students to enjoy meals and pleasant discourse.  Some clubs are referred to as bicker clubs  because of the process of bickering over which applicants to accept as members.  Replaced largely by the modern fraternity and sorority system, eating clubs are now limited to a few colleges and universities, most notably Princeton University, Davidson College, Mount Olive College, and Reed College in the United States. The origins of such clubs are collegiate dining clubs in the United Kingdom, specifically founded earlier than or contemporarily with the foundation of the early American universities such as The Pitt Club, The Bullingdon Club, and The 16' Club.
