A junior is a student in their third year of study (generally referring to high school or college/university study) as coming immediately before their senior year.   Juniors are considered upperclassmen.  In the United States, the 11th grade is usually the third year of a student's high school period and is referred to as junior year. In the U.S., colleges generally require students to declare an academic major by the beginning of their junior year.  College juniors are advised to begin the internship process and preparing for additional education (medical school, law school, etc.) by completing applications and taking additional examinations.  In the UK, any child in key stage 2 (Year 3 – Year 6) is known as a junior, having developed from previously being infants. At the end of Year 6 (usually age 11), they leave primary school and go to secondary school — the transition from Junior to Senior (unless they live in an area with a middle school system).
