The Medical Student (TMS) is a monthly print newspaper published entirely by full-time medical students from the five medical schools in London (King's College London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Imperial College School of Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, UCL Medical School, St George's, University of London). TMS is affiliated to London Medgroup, a collective body of Students' Union presidents and British Medical Association representatives from each of the five member medical schools. It is an editorially independent publication with control over content and editorial appointments vested in the elected Editor-in-Chief and executive committee. TMS regularly publishes stories concerning medical politics, Modernising Medical Careers, London medical student issues, society, culture and United Hospitals sports news. The newspaper was founded in February 2004 by the University of London Union Medical Students Officer, Johann Malawana, as a means to inform London medical students of the key national medical and political issues affecting them, as well as publishing news concerning the five London medical schools.  The initial motivation for founding the publication was to inform students of the changes that would ensue as a result of the Modernising Medical Careers policy. The publication ran into managerial and financial difficulties between 2008 and 2010, and was put on hiatus. In February 2011, MS was restarted by a newly elected committee.  In January 2015, the paper stopped printing physical copies and became online only.
