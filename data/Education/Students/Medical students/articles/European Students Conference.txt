The European Students' Conference (ESC) is an international scientific conference held annually for a week in autumn. Run by a team of mostly medical students, ESC is one of the largest student-run biomedical scientific conferences worldwide. It takes place at the Charité  Medical School in Berlin, Germany. From 27 to 30 September 2017 the conference will be held for the 28th time and its theme is: "Genetic Engineering- when chance meets choice". ESC has become one of the main scientific events at the Charité Medical School.  Founded in 1989, at the time of major political changes at the then most prestigious medical school of the German Democratic Republic, it is today one of the largest and well-known conferences of its kind. From the onset, the idea behind the ESC was to foster a better relationship between East and West. German reunification in October 1990 created the opportunity to transfer knowledge and to create a closer relationship between medical faculties in East and West. The role of the ESC now is the support of young scientists and the advance of biomedical science on a more international scale. 28th European Students' Conference - “Genetic Engineering – when chance meets choice” The objective of the conference is to present and discuss the newest developments and breakthroughs that could very soon become clinical routine. Researchers from all over the world will speak about modern technologies as well as medical ethics that might come along with the integration of those technologies into clinical medicine.
