Imperial governments provided pathways for selected nationals to pursue <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">higher education</a>.

The policy of distributing scientific knowledge and sharing industrial progress with the developing world required the help of higher education institutions. Support for USAID linked the foreign policy mission with support to higher education.

Established in 1946, the Fulbright Program provides grants for students, scholars, teachers and professionals to undertake studies and research.

The Colombo Plan was established in 1951 with the intention of strengthening economic and social development of the <a href=\"/wiki/Asia_Pacific\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Asia Pacific\">Asia Pacific</a> region. The Colombo Plan has been responsible for sponsoring over 40,000 Asian students to study or train in Australian higher education institutions.

For example, students in Arab countries migrate to Egypt and Jordan to pursue their studies, and many students from Bangladesh and Nepal travel to India.\nThe flow of students from <a href=\"/wiki/Developing_countries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Developing countries\">developing countries</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Developed_countries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Developed countries\">developed countries</a> is often due to the belief that the quality and standards of education offered in <a href=\"/wiki/OECD\" title=\"OECD\">OECD</a> countries is superior to what is offered in the country of origin.<sup id=\"cite_ref-varghese_3-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-varghese-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Higher education has become a major global export commodity with <a href=\"/wiki/Developing_countries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Developing countries\">developing countries</a> capitalising on domestic shortages by recruiting <a href=\"/wiki/Foreign_student\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Foreign student\">foreign students</a>.  Subsequently, changes to visa and immigration policies have provided incentives for students to travel abroad and potentially offer a gateway to permanent residency within a host nation.  Migration opportunities are one of the major contributions to the growth of student migration.  A 2006 survey, undertaken by Australia\u2019s Monash University, produced statistics which showed 75% of Indian students who completed university education in Australia applied for and were granted residency.  The author of the research, Michiel Bass suggests that the most influential reason Indian students studied in Australia was not because of academic reputation, but the opportunity to gain permanent residency.<sup id=\"cite_ref-verbik_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-verbik-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An important factor contributing to student migration is the desire to study in a language other than the student's first language. For example, a growth in the number of students travelling to study in the UK from Central and Eastern Europe has been partially attributed to the wish \"to study in a higher education environment where communication is in English\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-catterall_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-catterall-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Other factors for the rise in student migration include lowering travel expenses and greater <a href=\"/wiki/Communication_technology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Communication technology\">communication technology</a> which has made studying abroad more accessible.<sup id=\"cite_ref-gribble_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gribble-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Student_visa_and_immigration_policies\">Student visa and immigration policies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_migration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Student visa and immigration policies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Student_migration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The US attracts a large number of foreigners to its workforce each year, however international graduates of US institutions do not automatically have the right to remain in the country for work purposes upon completion of their course.

The greatest changes to visa regulations occurred after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when the US immediately implemented tougher visa and immigration requirements.  Under the Enhanced Border Security and Visas Entry Reform Act (2002) the US introduced a new overseas student tax in order to fund an advanced computer tracking system for visa applications, but also made it more difficult for applicants to transfer between visa categories.<sup id=\"cite_ref-verbik_8-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-verbik-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, recently the <a href=\"/wiki/US_Department_of_State\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US Department of State\">US Department of State</a> has established a new <a href=\"/wiki/Internship\" title=\"Internship\">internship</a> scheme which has been specifically designed for foreign students.
