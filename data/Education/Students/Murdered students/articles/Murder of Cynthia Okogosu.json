She had three elder brothers. Her eldest brother is Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Uchechukwu Osokogu. Her immediate elder brother is an Assistant Superintendent of Customs, Mr. Williams Ehiedu Osokogu. Her third elder brother, Mr. Tony Azubike Osokogu, lived in Greece.\nShe started schooling at the Command Children School, <a href=\"/wiki/Ilorin\" title=\"Ilorin\">Ilorin</a> and moved to the Command Secondary School, <a href=\"/wiki/Jos\" title=\"Jos\">Jos</a> from 1997 to 2004. She was a graduate of English Language at <a href=\"/wiki/Nasarawa_State_University\" title=\"Nasarawa State University\">Nasarawa State University</a> and was pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in Public Administration in the same institution after resigning from a job with <a href=\"/wiki/MTN_Group\" title=\"MTN Group\">MTN</a>. Cynthia was also a former model. She, owned a boutique 'Dress Code' which she opened in Keffi, a town in <a href=\"/wiki/Nasarawa_State\" title=\"Nasarawa State\">Nasarawa State</a> in 2007. She was described as hardworking, loving and industrious by her family. She had achieved so much at age 24.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Incident\">Incident</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Cynthia_Okogosu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Incident\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cynthia developed some friendships via  the social networking site Facebook after chatting with a newly added \u201cfriend\u201d; Okwumi Echezona Nwabufor via her <a href=\"/wiki/BlackBerry_Messenger\" title=\"BlackBerry Messenger\">BlackBerry Messenger</a> over the pace of about four months and soon she had also \"friended\" his cousin, Ezike Ilechukwu Olisaeloka. Even though she already had a relation in the United States who often sent her goods to sell in her retailing business, they told her they were in the same business, that they were also retailers and offered to sell her the items at cheaper prices. She believed them. These young men seemed normal and promised to host Cynthia when she came to Lagos. What Cynthia didn't know was that Nwabufor had been stalking her for months, patiently gaining her confidence through frequent chats and postings. When she informed them she usually comes to buy goods in Lagos, they made arrangements for her visit while promising to help her get the goods at cheaper prices. The trip was organized by Echezona Nwabufor, one of the two new friends. On July 21, 2012, Cynthia flew to Lagos from the Abuja to meet with these new \"retailers\" regarding the better price offer on the clothes and accessories for her fashion boutique. After landing, she called her mother to tell her that she had arrived safely. The two young men picked Cynthia up from the <a href=\"/wiki/Murtala_Muhammed_International_Airport\" title=\"Murtala Muhammed International Airport\">Murtala Muhammed International Airport</a>, Ikeja and drove her to Cosmilla Hotel in  Lakeview estate in <a href=\"/wiki/Festac_Town\" title=\"Festac Town\">Festac Town</a>. At the hotel, they entertained her with a <a href=\"/wiki/Ribena\" title=\"Ribena\">Ribena</a> drink (unknown to her the drink was already drugged with <a href=\"/wiki/Flunitrazepam\" title=\"Flunitrazepam\">Rohypnol Flunitrazepam</a>.) Their effort to drug her drink was fruitless as they discovered the drug \u201cdid not work\" quickly on her. After that, they beat her and asked her to reveal where she kept her money. They presumed she would hold a lot of money, but she said she didn\u2019t have any money to spare. When they didn\u2019t get any money from her, they tied her up, robbed her of all the money she brought to shop for her business, her three blackberry phones, jewelries, international passport, a drivers\u2019 licence, then they raped her and finally strangled her to death.\nThe next morning, after having spent the night with Cynthia's body, they then abandoned her, left the hotel and quickly <a href=\"/wiki/Friending_and_following\" title=\"Friending and following\">unfriended</a> her from their Facebook friends list to remove any trace of their connection. Unknown to them, there was a hidden <a href=\"/wiki/CCTV\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CCTV\">CCTV</a> camera in the hotel which recorded part of the event.\nAccording to the hotel receptionist's account (Ms. Ifeyinwa Njebu). The two checked in at the hotel at 8 a.m. on July 21st, 2012. By the time they checked out, she had handed over to the second receptionist (Vivian Anuonye), who had taken over duty; so she asked her to check them out. They checked in again (with Cynthia) at the hotel at about 12 a.m. on July 21, 2012. When Ms. Njebu resumed the next day by July 22nd, Vivian handed over to her and gave her details about the room already occupied.\nThe room that Ms Njebu checked in the couple was to expire on July 22nd, 12 noon. After the two left in the morning, his brother came to take over the room. So she noted that and she was also aware that the other person as still occupying the room. Mrs. Njebu routinely called all the rooms in the hotel to ascertain those who are still in and those about to check out. After sometime, she saw Nwabufor coming down the stairs. Mrs. Njebu asked Nwabufor after calling his room to know if he was still staying. When Nwabufor reached down the stairs, he told her that he would be staying behind but that she should permit him to withdraw money from the ATM machine to pay for the day. When he told her his girlfriend (referring to Cynthia) was still upstairs, she did not go to check. He was not a regular guest at the hotel. He assured her that his girlfriend was there with the room key. Mrs. Njebu told Mr. Nwabufor to return to the hotel before 12 noon, when the payment for their room would expire. He didn\u2019t submit the key to her. Olisaeloka came out from the bar and they both left the hotel. She never saw them again. At about 3 p.m. she received a phone call from one of them. The caller said that he was the occupant of the room who left recently and that he was not coming back and he instructed her to remove the \"idiot\" out of the room. She replied him politely to remind him that, he promised to come back and pay for the day. He said he was not coming back and dropped the call. Mrs. Njebu informed the hotel\u2019s manager about the development and he assured her that since the caller\u2019s girlfriend is still in; she would pay for the room. So the manager told her to call the room through the intercom. She called many times but no response. The manager went upstairs, knocked several times but didn't get any response. The hotel management directed her to use the master key to access the room, as a last resort. So she went upstairs, knocked again. After, no one responded, she used her master key to open the door. And from the door, she saw Cynthia's lifeless body lying naked on the bed. She was lying horizontal with her legs touching the ground. She screamed with shock and rushed downstairs to inform the manager, who alerted the police.\nFrom the CCTV footage played to her by the police, Mrs. Njebu identified Messrs Nwabufo and Olisaeloka.\nShe was able to recognize the duo when the police brought them to the Area E police station in Festac Town, Lagos.\nAfter the hotel found her body, since her ID cards and mobile phones had been stolen, they could not identify her immediately or call friends and family. Her body was deposited in a morgue in Lagos.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Investigations\">Investigations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Cynthia_Okogosu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Investigations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"infobox biography vcard\" style=\"width:22em\"><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:125%;font-weight:bold\"><span class=\"fn\">Cynthia Okogosu</span></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Born</th><td>\n<span class=\"nickname\">Cynthia Osokogu</span><br /><span style=\"display:none\">(<span class=\"bday\">1987-11-10</span>)</span>November 10, 1987<br /><span class=\"birthplace\">Nigeria</span></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Died</th><td>\nJuly 21, 2012<span style=\"display:none\">(2012-07-21)</span> (aged&#160;24)<br /><span class=\"deathplace\">Lagos</span></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Cause&#160;of death</th><td>\nAsphyxiation from strangulation.</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Occupation</th><td class=\"role\">\nstudent, businesswoman</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>All this time, unaware of Cynthia's murder, her family and friends were praying for her safe return. Meanwhile, Cynthia's mother Mrs. Osokogu tried calling Cynthia's cell phone for five days but her phone was switched off. On the seventh day, she recalled that one of the men picked her call and told her that Cynthia was sick. Not too long afterwards, they implied that Cynthia had been kidnapped and asked her mother for 20 million Naira ransome money. Cynthia's mum asked them if they killed her daughter and they said no, she was just sick and couldn't come to the phone. The phone call was traced to Festac. There, her missing person\u2019s police report was submitted to the Area E Command in Festac. This enabled her family to trace her body to the morgue and also led them to the hotel.\nThe police in Lagos delayed the release Cynthia's body to her parents for burial because they had intended to carry out an autopsy on the body at the <a href=\"/wiki/Ikeja_General_Hospital\" title=\"Ikeja General Hospital\">Ikeja General Hospital</a> morgue. Police Commissioner Umaru Manko revealed that the pathologist was still working on the autopsy which was  ongoing at the time she was identified. Eventually, her body was released for burial and she was laid to rest in her hometown.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> A ceremonial burial was performed at the family residence in Boji-Boji Owa, Ika North Local Government Area of Delta State after a requiem mass. The Governor of Delta State, Mr. <a href=\"/wiki/Emmanuel_Uduaghan\" title=\"Emmanuel Uduaghan\">Emmanuel Uduaghan</a> condoled with the Osokogu family and called on the police to conclude investigation quickly and bring the culprits to book. After Cynthia's murder and investigations progressed through cell phone records and CCTV footages, the police arrested the suspects.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crime_scene\">Crime scene</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Cynthia_Okogosu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Crime scene\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Cynthia's body was found naked with her two hands tied behind her back with a brown tape and supported with a padlocked chain; her two legs were also taped together. Her mouth was stuffed with hair net and handkerchief, also tied with brown tape round her head to seal her mouth and secure the materials inside. There were pin-point holes in her white eye as well as inside the upper part of her air ways and surface of her lungs, a condition described as \u2018petechial hemorrhage'. The pathologist also revealed that Cynthia had suffered pulmonary Oedema, an overweight of the lungs from being soaked by blood. Her left and right lungs weighed 400 and 500 grams respectively due to blood accumulation\u201d, noting that the normal weight would be 250 to 350 grams. The final autopsy stated that Cynthia was asphyxiated; suffocated to death through blockage of air into her lungs. Apart from her death resulting from <a href=\"/wiki/Asphyxia\" title=\"Asphyxia\">asphyxia</a>, the pathologist, John Oladapo Obafunwa also observed that she had multiple bruises and abrasions suspected to be from biting. Her autopsy further revealed that a dose of \u2018Rohypnol\u2019 sold to the suspects by a pharmacist, Osita Orji, was not responsible for Cynthia\u2019s death. After the arrest, several other women came forward to reveal that they had also been drugged, tied up and robbed by the suspects, but they all survived to tell the story. According to reports, these two young men also confessed that they had robbed several other women prior to Cynthia who happens to be their sixth victim. The gang reportedly specializes in luring unsuspecting young women, robbing them of their possessions before killing them. Although there were speculations that their motive was ritualistic, it appeared that it was greed and their main goal was to rob and kill. The specific reason Cynthia was killed was not fully established. The police proposed some theories; Perhaps, the suspects became enraged at the lack of payday after spending so much money to get her there. Or, probably, Cynthia struggled or attempted to scream even after being drugged with the sedative Rohypnol. \"She was struggling to see how she could liberate herself or make noise in order to attract people to rescue her\"; The investigating officer FESTAC Area Commander, Dan Okoro said \"But they overpowered her.\"\nThe police also stated that it was very likely that the culprits targeted her as they believed she would be carrying large amounts of cash.\nShe was targeted, because the suspects had figured out that she was the daughter of a retired Army general. They assumed that she would come to Lagos with big cash, a large bank account and jewellery. \"At some point they discovered that she came from a very good home and felt that they could make some quick money out of her.\" But her elder brother, Kenneth stated that Cynthia never carried any large sums of cash and she never even had an ATM card, she used a checkbook,\"\nSeveral other men were arrested in connection with the crime including the pharmacists who sold the Rohypnol to the suspected killers without a prescription, their driver who always accompanied them during their robberies and a \"fence\" -- the man who sold Cynthia's and the other victims goods.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trial\">Trial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Cynthia_Okogosu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Trial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>About one month after Cynthia was laid to rest, the trial commenced  at Yaba Magistrate court, Lagos on August 27, 2012. Six people were arrested at the beginning of the investigation, they included: Olisaeloka Ezike, 23, and Okwuno Nwabufor, 33; both of whom were identified as the Facebook friends.\nOthers were Osita Orji, the pharmacist who sold Rohypnol to them and Nonso Ezike, Olisaeloka's brother who assisted in selling the deceased\u2019s Blackberry phone. The eight-count charge of conspiracy, murder, armed robbery, rape, \u201cunlawful administration of obnoxious substance\u201d and \u201cforceful administration of obnoxious substance\u201d with a view to causing bodily harm were read to them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-vanguard_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-vanguard-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>The trial commenced with the prosecution, the Lagos State Government calling its first witness.\nOkwumo Nwabufo and Olisaeloka Ezike were charged with conspiracy to commit murder, and felony. Orji Osita, a pharmacist, was charged with negligently selling the Rohypnol Flunitrazepan tablets to Ezike, the 2nd defendant, without a doctor\u2019s prescription and without showing due care. Nonso Ezike (Nwabufo's younger brother) was charged with being in possession of the three stolen blackberry mobile phones belonging to the late Cynthia Osokogu.\nAll the accused  initially pleaded not guilty to all six counts. \nJustice Olabisi Akinlade of the Lagos High Court sitting at Igbosere admitted as evidence,  confessional statements of the culprits recorded in a video. When the first defendant was arrested, he confessed that he knew what he did and that everything was over. The first defendant then operated the Blackberry phone to reveal the chain used in tying his victim. The first defendant was arrested on August 20, 2012, after which he made the confessional statement.\nThe <a href=\"/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Lagos_State\" title=\"Attorney General of Lagos State\">Attorney General of Lagos State</a>, Mr <a href=\"/wiki/Ade_Ipaye\" title=\"Ade Ipaye\">Ade Ipaye</a>, prosecuted the suspected murderer suspects, revealing details of pictures from the crime scene in the court from a laptop. The witness added that he and his team followed the first defendant to his home in Festac and recovered the said laptop, along with some phones and various network SIM cards.\nOn that same date, the first defendant was asked to open the laptop, which he carried by himself to the Area Commander\u2019s office. Pictures of the deceased lying down and her international passport lying on her chest was revealed,\u201d the witness said\nAnother prosecution\u2019s witness, testified that from his investigation, it was discovered that the fourth defendant (Nonso) received different stolen phones from the first and second defendant on three occasions. The fourth defendant stole somebody\u2019s receipt in Ladipo Market which he used in selling the deceased\u2019s phone to somebody in Port Harcourt and the person was arrested.\nThe witness also told the court of another investigation against the defendants, in two separate hotels-Chelsea Suit and Penny Hotel-Festac, where they were alleged to have carried out similar acts. The cases were separated because the incidents did not happen on the same day. It was based on the confessional statement by the first and second defendant that they carried out similar acts in other hotels in Festac.\nIn one of his appearances in court, Nwabufo denied ever knowing about Rohypnol nor did he put it into Cynthia\u2019s drink. He also claimed that Cynthia was his lover and that they were planning to get married before her death.\nNwabufo, said he met her at Shoprite Mall in <a href=\"/wiki/Lekki\" title=\"Lekki\">Lekki</a>, in 2011 where he went for shopping, while she was also shopping at a fashion shop, dismissing the allegations that they met on Facebook. He also added that when he met her, she was making inquires so he introduced himself to her and she did the same, adding that they exchanged contacts afterwards. He also said that they developed friendship after exchanging addresses and became very close since then. However, there has been no sufficient evidence to warrant this claim. The judge also dismissed the claim by Mr. Nwabufor that Ms. Osokogu was his fianc\u00e9e and was going to introduce him to her father, saying that the \"lover's\" story was false because under cross-examination Nwabufor could not tell Cynthia\u2019s birthday, the name of her mother, a home town or in fact anything about her. Though the convicts pleaded not guilty and tried to withdraw the confessional statement they made to the police, claiming they were made under duress, the court admitted the statements they made were corroborated by the testimonies of the witnesses and the evidence provided by the police. The judge said the fact that the police produced a video footage of the convicts making the confessional statement also helped in countering the claim by the convicts that they made the statement under duress.\nThe court was satisfied that the confessional statements were not <a href=\"/wiki/Forced_confession\" title=\"Forced confession\">given under duress</a> and admitted them in evidence. A confession is sufficient to gain conviction, the judge said.\nThe confessional statement of the accused is consistent with the state of the body and consistent to the medical evidence. The judge said she would act on it accordingly.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> While delivering the judgement, the judge said the accused deserved the sentence as they were not remorseful of their action, and were telling the court lies after offering confessional statements to the police. The judge also found the duo guilty on three other counts and sentenced them to a total of 20 years imprisonment each. They were sentenced to 14 years in jail for conspiracy to commit murder, three years for conspiracy to commit felony by stealing, and three years for stealing a Blackberry phone.\nThe judge acquitted and discharged Osita and Nonso. While delivering the judgement, Mrs. Akinlade said she relied on the evidence and testimonies provided by the prosecution.\nShe said having carefully analysed the evidence and testimonies before the court, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that Messrs. Nwabufor and Ezike murdered Ms. Osokogu.\nThe judge stated that the evidence of the prosecution remained uncontroverted and relies mainly on the testimonies of witnesses and evidence. It was also very clear that the first defendant was untruthful and deceived the court.\nIn sentencing both men to <a href=\"/wiki/Capital_punishment\" title=\"Capital punishment\">death by hanging</a>, the judge said it was no longer relevant to know who, between the two, actually killed Ms. Osokogu.\nThe second defendant acted in consent with the first defendant and will bear the consequences of their action irrespective of whoever committed the offence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\nThe Judge held that with its 10 witnesses and 17 exhibits, the prosecution\u2019s case against Nwabufo and Ezike was uncontroverted and that the circumstantial evidence brought by the state was \u201ccogent, complete, unequivocal and compelling.\u201d The judge held that the circumstantial evidence brought by the state in proof of the six counts of conspiracy, murder and stealing against the accused persons were cogent, complete, unequivocal and compelling. Counsel for Orji and Nonso had requested bail for their clients and Justice Akinlade had granted bail to Orji with two sureties.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The court granted bail to Orji Osita and Ezike Nonso, while the other two who allegedly committed the offence of murder were remanded at the Kirikiri prison, Lagos. For Nonso, Olisaeloka\u2019s younger brother, the judge granted him bail with two sureties, adding that one of the sureties must be a civil servant not less than Grade Level 14 while the other must be a property owner with a genuine Certificate of Occupancy. On March 23, 2017, the Lagos state high court, Igbosere, sentenced Nwabufo and Ezike to death by hanging.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aftermath\">Aftermath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Cynthia_Okogosu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Aftermath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cynthia's murder exposed the dark side of the internet in a way that most people could not imagine. Her mother advised youths to be very cautious of making friends with people that they did not know.
