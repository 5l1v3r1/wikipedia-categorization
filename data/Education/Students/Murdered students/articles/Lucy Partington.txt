  Lucy Katherine Partington (4 March 1952 – some time between 28 December 1973 and 2 January 1974; aged 21) was a British murder victim. She was born in St Albans, the third child of Roger and Margaret (Bardwell) Partington. On the night of 27 December 1973, during her final year of reading English Literature at Exeter University,  she was abducted by serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. Her precise date of death is unknown. However, at twenty-five past midnight on 3 January 1974, Fred West admitted himself into the casualty unit at Gloucester Royal hospital with a serious laceration of his right-hand that required several stitches, leading to speculation that she could have been kept alive and tortured for several days in the cellar of the Wests' home in Cromwell Street before finally being murdered.  Her remains were discovered there on 6 March 1994 alongside the knife Fred West used to dismember them.  On 16 February 1995, Partington's remains were reburied in Exeter, Devon. Partington’s sister, Marian Partington, wrote about the impact of Lucy’s life, disappearance, and death in her memoir, If You Sit Very Still, in May 2012.  The book builds on Salvaging the Sacred, an essay written by Marian and published in The Guardian Weekend in May 1996.  The essay inspired a play by Bryony Lavery and a feature film by Juliet McKoen, both entitled Frozen. Partington was the cousin of novelist Martin Amis. He dedicated his novel The Information to her and writes about her life and death in his memoir Experience.
