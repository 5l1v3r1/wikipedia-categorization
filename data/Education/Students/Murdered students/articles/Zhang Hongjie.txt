  Zhang Hongjie (1979â€“2004), also known as Steffi Zhang was a female 25-year-old Chinese University of Canberra communications student found murdered in her flat in Belconnen, Australia, in January 2005.  The killing caused an uproar, because the body was not discovered for seven months after the murder, which was said to have happened in June 2004. Police identified a suspect in the killing, her boyfriend at the time: Zhang Long from the city of Dalian. He flew to Shanghai, China shortly after the incident, where he was being held as of August 2005. No charge is being laid and China has not agreed to extradite him, although asked to by the Australian government. After the killing, the University of Canberra introduced changes to their policy for international students and management. The Federal Government of Australia wants the Australian Capital Territory (ACT includes Canberra) to cooperate with the Chinese investigation into the murder, as written by a letter from John Howard to Chief Minister Stanhope in May 2005, and another request from Justice Minister Chris Ellison in June. The ACT government does not want to because it may mean Zhang would face a firing squad in China if convicted.  On 27 February 2005 a warrant was issued in the ACT Magistrates court for Zhang's arrest.  The ACT Liberal opposition wants the Chief Minister to use his Chinese contacts to bring Zhang to 'justice'.
