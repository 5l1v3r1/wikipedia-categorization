Part of the scheme, according to court papers, involved Leonard bribing officials and DCS spending millions on cameras from Leonard\u2019s company. An estimated 3,000 of the 7,000 cameras went unused or barely used. Many of them are stored in a warehouse at a bus service center in southeast Dallas.\n</p><p>As DCS hemorrhaged millions in taxpayer dollars, its superintendent, Dr. Rick Sorrells, agreed to a lease-buy back scheme involving four of its bus service centers. Sorrells sold the property for $25 million (USD), and agreed to lease it at a cost of $46 million (USD).\n</p><p>On November 2017, Dallas County voters chose to shut down DCS, ending the 170+ year service. The dissolution committee replaced the company's entire board.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Despite that, tax payers are still on the hook for DCS's debt.\n</p><p>On July 2018, the dissolution committee filed suit against Sorrells, Leonard, former Dallas County Schools Board chair Larry Duncan and others. According to that lawsuit, Duncan took campaign contributions totaling $240,000 from those connected to the bribery scheme. Some of those contributions were not initially reported, the lawsuit alleges.\n</p><p>It also alleged Dallas County Schools lost about $125 million through the various schemes. \u201cWe'd like to reduce that price tag for the taxpayers,\u201d said Stephanie Curtis, an attorney representing the DCS dissolution committee.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a
