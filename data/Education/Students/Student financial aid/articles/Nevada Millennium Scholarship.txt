The Nevada Millennium Scholarship, also known as the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship, offers Nevada high school graduates free or reduced tuition to in-state universities and colleges like the University of Nevada, Reno and University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In 1999, Governor Kenny Guinnâ€™s Millennium Scholarship initiative was enacted into law by the Nevada Legislature; the legislation (NRS 396.911) created the Millennium Scholarship trust fund to be administered by the State Treasurer. In October 1999, the Board of Regents adopted policy guidelines for the administration of the scholarship.   Although there are a number of pathways to the Millennium Scholarship, by far the most common will be the successful completion of a rigorous program of study at a Nevada high school. The scholarship was created using the money that Nevada received from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.
