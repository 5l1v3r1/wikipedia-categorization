Branded as Canada's way to marking the new millennium, the Foundation was endowed with CAD$2.5 billion and was given the mandate to 1) improve access to post-secondary education for all Canadians, especially those facing economic or social barriers, to 2) encourage a high level of student achievement and engagement in Canadian society; and to 3) build a national alliance of organizations and individuals around a shared post-secondary agenda.\n</p><p>Since 2000, the Foundation delivered more than half a million bursaries and scholarships worth more than $1.5 billion to students across Canada. Its two best-known scholarship programs were:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Millennium Bursary Program, which targeted students with the greatest financial need.</li>\n<li>The Millennium Excellence Award Program, which provided scholarships based on merit (including leadership, innovation, academic achievement and <a href=\"/wiki/Community_service\" title=\"Community service\">community service</a>). Separate sets of awards were provided to entrance and in-course post-secondary students.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Millennium_Bursary_Program\">Millennium Bursary Program</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Canada_Millennium_Scholarship_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Millennium Bursary Program\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Millennium Bursary Program represented 95% of the awards distributed by the Foundation. The value of the Foundation's millennium bursaries was approximately $3,000 on average, but ranged from $1,000 to $4,993.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Millennium_Excellence\">Millennium Excellence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Canada_Millennium_Scholarship_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Millennium Excellence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation also issued merit-based scholarships through its Millennium Excellence Awards Program to deserving youths entering post-secondary studies for the first time. Laureates of these awards all exhibited excellence in community involvement, innovation, leadership and academic achievement. The MEAP was unique because of its Canada-wide reach - whether a student lived in a major metropolitan area or in a remote village, anyone could apply and be evaluated based on their contribution to their community. Excellence Awards represented only 5% of the total scholarship sum awarded by the Foundation. More than 10,000 Excellence Awards were issued since 2000.\n</p><p>The MEAP provided laureates with more than a cheque. Laureates were invited to participate in regional or national conferences hosted by the Foundation. Laureates also had access to project seed money through the Millennium Grants Program.\n</p><p>The Excellence Awards were divided into two groups, the Entrance Awards geared towards students entering their first year of post-secondary education, and the In-Course Awards for those already enrolled in post-secondary studies.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Entrance_Awards\">Entrance Awards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Canada_Millennium_Scholarship_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Entrance Awards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As of 2008, there were three different levels of Entrance Awards:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Local awards: one-time awards of $4,500</li>\n<li>Provincial/territorial awards: $16,000 award, disbursed in annual allotments</li>\n<li>National awards: $20,000 award, disbursed in annual allotments</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In-Course_Awards\">In-Course Awards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Canada_Millennium_Scholarship_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: In-Course Awards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As of 2008, there were three different level of In-Course Awards\n</p>\n<ul><li>Up to 100 awards of $5,000, renewable for up to one additional year, for a total of $10,000</li>\n<li>Up to 200 awards of $4,000, renewable for up to one additional year, for a total of $8,000</li>\n<li>Up to 900 one-time awards of $4,500.</li></ul>\n<p>Exceptional laureates were also allowed to apply for an additional Millennium grant of $2,500 towards a community building project.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Millennium_Research_Program\">Millennium Research Program</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Canada_Millennium_Scholarship_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Millennium Research Program\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Millennium_Research_Program\" title=\"Millennium Research Program\">Millennium Research Program</a> was launched in 2001 to assist the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation in carrying out its mandate to improve access to post-secondary education in Canada and provide students with the educational opportunities they need to prepare themselves for the future. The Research Program advanced the study of barriers to post-secondary education and the impact of policies and programs designed to alleviate them. It ensured that policy-making and public discussion about opportunities in higher education in Canada were informed by rigorous analysis and empirical evidence.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dissolution_and_legacy\">Dissolution and legacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Canada_Millennium_Scholarship_Foundation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Dissolution and legacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In February 2008, the federal government decided not to renew the CMSF at the end of its 10-year mandate.  It was replaced with the Canada Student Grants Program, which will distribute $350 million per year to post-secondary education students.  Much controversy has come to light since the government has announced this program, in which 250,000 students will now benefit per year, as opposed to the approximately 100,000 that are receiving money from the CMSF.  Although the amount of money that the federal government will be putting towards post-secondary education has not changed dramatically, the average student award decreased from about $3000 per year to about $1250 per year.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
