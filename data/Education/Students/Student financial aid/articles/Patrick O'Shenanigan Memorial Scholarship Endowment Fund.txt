The renewable scholarship is awarded to a student selected by the university's financial aid office. The 11 founding members compose the Board of Trustees:   Donors to the endowment are members of the Patrick O'Shenanigan Society: The first recipient to be announced in the spring of 2016 will receive a $370 scholarship.  The scholarship was recognized by TU President Steadman Upham on April 1, 2015, at a donor reception at the Roxana Rózsa and Robert Eugene Lorton Performance Center. The reception was attended by founding member Tyler Pansa. The scholarship was featured in TU's College of Engineering and Natural Science's Vision magazine in the Summer of 2015. The back cover pictured donor Tyler Pansa during his notorious Glenn Dobbs prank on April 1, 2013. "Pansa borrowed a football helmet, painted his entire body gold and stood on the platform for over an hour.”  The donors are recognized with a stone on the Chapman Legacy Wall at McFarlin Library. The engraving is located beside Steadman and Peggy Upham's stone and reads, "Friends of Patrick O'Shenanigan." The stone was engraved in the summer of 2015 and will officially be dedicated at Homecoming in October 2015.
