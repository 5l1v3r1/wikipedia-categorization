The Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) is an organization of thirty-five private colleges and universities. Formed in the mid-1970s, COFHE is an unincorporated, voluntary, institutionally-supported organization of 35 highly selective, private liberal arts colleges and universities,  all of which are committed to meeting the full demonstrated financial need of admitted students.   The Consortiumâ€™s data collection, research, and policy analysis focus on matters pertaining to access, affordability, and assessment, particularly as they relate to undergraduate education, admissions, financial aid, and the financing of higher education. All data supplied to, compiled by, and shared among the Consortium are subject to strict confidentiality guidelines.   The organization's officially stated goals are as follows: COFHE's home office is located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a Washington office is housed at Johns Hopkins's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in the District of Columbia. The president of COFHE is Kristine Dillon.
