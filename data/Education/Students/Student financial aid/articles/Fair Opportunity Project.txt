Fair Opportunity Project  is a centralized platform of free college admissions and financial aid resources. The resources provided by Fair Opportunity Project have been downloaded in 36 countries and are featured on 52 other websites. Luke Heine and Cole Scanlon founded the non-profit organization to improve the likelihood that young people from any background have equal information on the college and financial aid application process. Fair Opportunity Project was founded in April 2016. It was a nation-wide effort to provide free college admissions resources building off of Luke Heineâ€™s Midwest Information Parity Project that was sent to 6,000 principals and superintendents  in nine states.  In 2016, Fair Opportunity Project worked with various college students, high school counselors, and advisors to write a free 70-page college admissions and financial aid guide including successful college essays, free online videos, scholarship websites, and much more. Since sending out the first batch of guide to 57,000 public schools, Fair Opportunity Project has launched video modules and translated the guide into Spanish and Mandarin. In Fall 2017, the guide was sent to 64,000 public schools, awarded Forbes 30 under 30,  and featured in Thrillest,  the Harvard Ed Magazine,  and the Harvard Gazette.
