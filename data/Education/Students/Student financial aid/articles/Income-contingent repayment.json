This type of repayment arrangement is mostly used for student loans where the ability of the new graduate borrower to repay is usually limited by his or her income.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_Kingdom\">United Kingdom</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Income-contingent_repayment&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: United Kingdom\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Income-Contingent Repayment is available for <a href=\"/wiki/Student_loans_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Student loans in the United Kingdom\">Student loans in the United Kingdom</a> since 1998. The Student Loans Company (SLC) that manages student loans for students living in the UK makes sure that the repayment of loans only begins after the student has left higher education and is earning over a certain threshold of:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a317,335 for Plan 1 loans: (Scotland and Northern Ireland) &amp; (England and Wales for loans take  before 1 September 2012)</li>\n<li>\u00a321,000 for Plan 2 loans: (England and Wales for loans taken after 1 September 2012)</li></ul>\n<p>These loans are collected via the PAYE tax system by employers deducting from the salary from their employees and hold the money until the end of the tax year (5 April) and then pass the deductions to HMRC along with tax, national insurance etc., who then break the payments up and pass them on to SLC between May and December.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This is different from the previous \"mortgage style\" loans (These have now been sold from SLC to other loan companies that include Erudio Student Loans, Theisis Servicing and Honours Student Loans) that set a fixed monthly payment irrespective of the graduate's income.\n</p>\n<h2><span
