In early December 2007, the D block of Mikontalo, while undergoing the reconstruction, was the scene of the Mikontalolights project. The object of Mikontalolights project was to create the world's physically largest colored graphics platform by using the windows of Mikontalo's D block as light pixels. The platform was used for playing Tetris and other games and present demos created by the students of Tampere University of Technology. The project climaxed on December 4 when the new lights of the building were lit. The goal was to gain global visibility for Tampere University of Technology and the rich student culture of city of Tampere. Mikontalolights was a part of the 42nd jubilee year of the Student Union of Tampere University of Technology. Mikontalolights was fully carried out by students who were willing to give their work contribution besides their studies.
