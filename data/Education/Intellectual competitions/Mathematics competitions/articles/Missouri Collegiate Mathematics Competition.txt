Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition is an annual undergraduate level mathematics competition in Missouri, United States since 1996. It is administered by the Missouri Section of the Mathematical Association of America.  Participating colleges and universities can send up to two teams, each with 1 to 3 undergraduates. Team members of the same team are allowed to collaborate during the competition but no calculators are allowed. Unofficial teams will be allowed to compete, depending on the number of available spaces, but will not be eligible for awards.  This competition has two sections. The first one on Thursday evening, the second one on Friday morning. The first place team receives a travelling trophy.
