The topics include Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Combinatorics and Inequality. After the camp, an exam is given in each of the preceding topics to evaluate the skills. A number of students, usually 50 or 100, are selected to join another camp in March, known in Thailand as \"POSN Camp 2\". The topics include Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory and Combinatorics in an advanced level, and Functional Equation.
