The Romanian Master of Mathematics and Sciences (formerly known as the Romanian Masters in Mathematics) is an annual competition for students in the preuniversitary level, held in Bucharest, Romania. The contestants compete individually, in four different sections: mathematics, physics, chemistry and computer science. The participating teams (national and local teams) can have up to six students for each section (plus two teachers: a leader and a deputy leader). The contest follows the same structure as IMO and IPhO and is usually held at the end of February. The first Romanian Master in Mathematics was held in 2008 and has been initiated by prof. Severius Moldoveanu and prof. Radu Gologan .  In 2010   Physics was also added as a section, therefore the name changed to RMMS. At the beginning, the competition structure had been 4 problems in 5 hours, but also in 2010, it was changed to 3 problems in 4 hours, two days format. The first country that won the competition was the United Kingdom. The 4th edition was held between 23â€“28 of February 2011 and included also Chemistry and Computer Science. The 5th edition, held in 2012 was only for Physics and Mathematics.  The current champions in Mathematics is South Korea. The contest is organised by the Tudor Vianu National College of Computer Science in collaboration with the Sector 1 town council. As a host, the college has the right to have its own team entering the contest in each section, thus participating against countries.
