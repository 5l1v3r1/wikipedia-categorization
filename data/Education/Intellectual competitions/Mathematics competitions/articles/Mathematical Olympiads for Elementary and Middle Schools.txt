Mathematical Olympiads for Elementary and Middle Schools (MOEMS) is a worldwide math competition, organized by a not for profit foundation with the same name. It is held yearly from November through March with one test administered each month. Tests are given at individual schools and results are sent to MOEMS for scoring. Schools, home schools and institutions may participate in the contest.    Two dozen other nations also participate in the competition. There are two divisions, Elementary and Middle School. Elementary level problems are for grades 4-6 and Middle School level problems are for grades 7-8, though 4-6 graders may participate in Middle School problems. Hundreds of thousands of students participate annually in MOEMS events. MOEMS plans soon to develop an online teacher training program. MOEMS founder George Lenchner, died after decades in service to the math education community.  Lenchner had written several books on elementary problem solving used by many MOEMS teachers and students. His obituary was featured in the Sunday New York Times on May 14, 2006.  The current MOEMS Director is Richard Kalman who also worked with the American Regions Mathematics League for many years.
