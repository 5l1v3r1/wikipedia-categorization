Around 7000 participants from Grade 8 to Grade 12 take part, writing a multiple-choice paper. Individual and pair entries are accepted, but all write the same paper for their grade. The current holder of the School Trophy is Rondebosch Boys High School, with Diocesan College achieving second place in the 2017 competition.
