The Championnat International des Jeux Mathématiques et Logiques (International competition for mathematical and logical games) is an international mathematics competition mainly for French-speaking countries, but participation is not limited by language.   This competition was created in 1987 and was called Championnat de France des jeux mathématiques et logiques (French competition for mathematical and logical games) at that time. Contestants could come from other countries, but the competition was entirely in French. It became Championnat International des Jeux Mathématiques et Logiques at its fourth edition (1990), but was still in French. Then it became more and more international, with the problems translated in more and more languages. Since its beginning, this competition is organized by the French federation Fédération Française des Jeux Mathématiques (FFJM). But as it became international, federations were created in other countries and they take part in the organization. The final of the first edition in 1987 took place in Parthenay. Since its second edition in 1988, the final has taken place in Paris or its suburb.
