This is a list of historical results in all areas of the National Mathcounts competition. The champions of the Countdown Round are considered the individual national champions of Mathcounts.  The written test determines who makes it into the Countdown round. Each year, the highest score on the written test (the Sprint and Target Rounds) determines the Written Champion. The Masters Round is a part of the competition in which Mathletes are asked to solve and present a solution to a complex problem. The Masters Round has been discontinued as of the 2012 National Competition due to the Reel Math Challenge, which has now been renamed to the Math Video Challenge. Each state team of four individuals is ranked by the sum of twice their Team Round score plus the average of their individual scores.
