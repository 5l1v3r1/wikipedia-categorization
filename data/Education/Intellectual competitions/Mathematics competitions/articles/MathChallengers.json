But, only the first person who buzzes will be called to provide an answer. Any answer without pressing the buzzer will be disqualified. Only ONE answer per participant per question is allowed and he/she must provide the answer in an acceptable format (i.e. simplified to lowest terms) and within 3 seconds after being called upon. The opponent may continue working while an answer is provided and if the answer of the first participant who buzzes is incorrect the opponent may use the remainder of the 45 seconds to buzz and be called to provide an answer. The participant who was called on and provides the correct answer will score one point in the round.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scoring_and_ranking\">Scoring and ranking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=MathChallengers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Scoring and ranking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Individual_Score\">Individual Score</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=MathChallengers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Individual Score\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The maximum possible individual score is 50.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Team_Score\">Team Score</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=MathChallengers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Team Score\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The maximum possible team score is 80.

All individual final standings are based on the performance in the Blitz and Bull's Eye stages.  All schools that were awarded trophies in any of the Regional pools will be invited to participate in the Provincial finals.\n</p><p>Additional awards or prizes will be awarded to the best performers of the Face-Off stage (Provincial only). The top 3 schools  participating in any of the Regional pools may be invited to participate in the Provincial finals subject to the rules. At the Provincial finals, the top schools and top individuals will be awarded trophies and/or medals.
