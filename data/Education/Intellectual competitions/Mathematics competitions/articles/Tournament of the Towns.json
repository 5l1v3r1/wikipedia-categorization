A contestant's final score is his/her highest score from the four exams. It is not necessary albeit recommended to write all four exams. \n</p><p>Different towns are given handicaps to account for differences in population. A town's score is the average of the scores of its N best students, where its population is N hundred thousand. It is also worth noting that the minimum value of N is 5.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philosophy\">Philosophy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tournament_of_the_Towns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Philosophy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Tournament of Towns differs from many other similar competitions by its philosophy relying much more upon ingenuity than the drill. First, problems are difficult (especially in A Level in the Senior division where they are comparable with those at <a href=\"/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad\" title=\"International Mathematical Olympiad\">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> but much more ingenious and less technical). Second, it allows the participants to choose problems they like as for each paper the participant's score is the sum of his/her 3 best answers.\n</p><p>The problems are mostly combinatorial, with the occasional geometry, number theory or algebra problem. They have a different flavour to problems seen in other mathematics competitions, and are usually quite challenging. Some of the problems have become classics, in particular two from the Autumn 1984 paper.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tournament_of_the_Towns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The first competition, held in the 1979\u20131980 academic year, was called the Olympiad of Three Towns. They were Moscow, Kiev and Riga. The reputation of the competition grew and the following year, it was called Tournament of the Towns. The Tournament of the Towns was almost closed down in its early years of development but in 1984 it gained recognition when it became a sub-committee of the USSR Academy of Sciences.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Awards\">Awards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tournament_of_the_Towns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Awards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Diplomas are awarded by the Central Committee to students who have achieved high scores (after their papers have been rechecked by the Central Jury).
