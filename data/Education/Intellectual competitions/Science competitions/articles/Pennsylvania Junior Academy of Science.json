Each PJAS region consists of two or more counties. Every PJAS region has one or more directors and a treasurer who oversee the operation of the region. PJAS also has a State Director, a State Secretary, and State Treasurer as well as committees for Judging, Safety, Technicians, and Awards.\n</p><p>In the early 1930s, the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science\" title=\"American Association for the Advancement of Science\">American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</a> appointed a national executive committee to coordinate the activities of the various state Junior Academies of Science (JAS).  Thus, the JAS movement became an integral part of the AAAS organization with the formation of the National Junior Academy of Science (NJAS). A paper presented at the Pennsylvania Academy of Science (PAS) at its West Chester meeting in 1932 resulted in the appointment of a committee to consider the development of a junior academy in Pennsylvania; the senior PAS became the parent organization of PJAS as a result of this committee. Two years later on March 31, 1934 in Reading, PA, delegates from 14 high school science clubs from all parts of the Commonwealth approved a constitution for the PJAS organization. The Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science had become a reality. Dr. Otis W. Caldwell from Columbia University served as an official delegate of the AAAS and welcomed the new group. Pennsylvania was added to the states of Indiana, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and others that already established junior academies of science. The first PJAS State Director was Dr. Karl F. Oerlein of the California State Teachers College in California, PA. He continued his office until 1941.\n</p><p>PJAS has grown through the efforts and dedication of many adult sponsors, students, and alumni. PJAS conducted the early state meetings at various resorts and convention centers throughout the Commonwealth. The last such convention was at Seven Springs Resort in 1990.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Because of the enormous growth in the number of students participating; the State Meeting was moved to Penn State University at University Park, PA, in 1991 where it has occurred since.\n</p><p>In 2010, 551 schools participated in PJAS (compared to 14 schools in 1934); over 6000 students presented their scientific research at the regional level in 2010. The 2016 state meeting hosted 2350 presenters in 231 units. Units are groups of students with projects in similar categories \u2013 for example, Unit 14 could be 10th grade Biochemistry, Unit 79 could be 9th and 10th grade Physics, etc. The number of units and the category of each unit varies each year based upon the number of student presenters and their projects. The total number at the State Meeting including student presenters, technicians, sponsors and chaperones was almost 4000 in 2016. Each year a different region hosts the State Meeting.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Projects\">Projects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Projects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>PJAS projects fall under four main groups: Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Engineering projects.

Each of these regions hold a private science competition between January and March where students present their research to a panel of judges. These judges score the student's project using PJAS rubrics for the specific category (see <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science#Projects\" title=\"Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science\">Projects</a>) - projects are not judged against each other, but against a set of criteria (see <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science#Scoring_Rubrics\" title=\"Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science\">Scoring Rubrics</a>). Each region has its own regional director(s) in charge of coordinating the regions for the regional and state meet, in addition to school sponsor(s) (teacher(s) hosting a school team). It is possible to have regional director(s) also acting as school sponsor(s).\n</p><p>After students present their research, the judges deliberate and determine the student's score based on the appropriate PJAS rubric. Some regions host an awards ceremony or an awards dinner. At these events, students receive a certificate and a bar with the color of their award (See <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science#Pin_.26_Bars\" title=\"Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science\">Pin &amp; Bars</a>). Some regions gain enough funding to also support special awards (like Director's awards or ones sponsored by societies or companies) for students who score the highest in their respective category or based on other criterion. For example, Region 1A had awards at their 2016 Regional Meet for students with exceptional analysis sections, exceptional research, or outstanding projects their judges nominate. Special awards at the regional meet aren't required for PJAS and thus, depend on each region.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"State_Meet\">State Meet</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: State Meet\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The PJAS State meet is a multi-day event similar to Regional Meets, always occurring from a Sunday to Tuesday in mid-May. Students who earned a first award at their respective regional meet are invited to travel to the <a href=\"/wiki/University_Park,_Pennsylvania\" title=\"University Park, Pennsylvania\">main campus (University Park)</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University\" title=\"Pennsylvania State University\">Pennsylvania State University</a> to present their projects; students who earned a 2nd or 3rd award at their Regional Meet could attend States as a technician, but will not present their projects. Students stay in the PSU dorms and eat in the dining halls while at the State Meet. Students present the same project they presented at the Regional Meet for the chance to win awards and scholarships.\n</p><p>Students who do not earn a 1st at their Regional Meet can attend States as a technician. Technicians serve a crucial role in PJAS by serving as the timers of projects and the judges\u2019 questions. If / when the presenter reaches the 5-minute mark, 8-minute mark, and 10-minute mark, the technician holds up a corresponding card to notify the presenter. For example, when the presentation reaches 5 minutes, the \u201c5 Minutes Remaining\u201d card is held in the air for the presenter to see. PJAS presenters have a time-limit of 10 minutes for their presentation to still earn a first award \u2013 going over 10 minutes is an automatic second award for the presenter, hence the crucial role of the technician. Technicians also time the judges when they ask questions following the presentation, with a maximum time of 5 minutes to ask questions.\n</p><p>For meals, students eat in the Findlay Dining Commons. The meals paid are paid for when paying for the State meet. Meals paid for by the State Meet fee are:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Sunday dinner</li>\n<li>Monday breakfast, lunch, and dinner</li>\n<li>Tuesday breakfast</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sunday\">Sunday</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Sunday\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Students travel to Main Campus with their region (sometimes in individual cars, sometimes on <a href=\"/wiki/Coach_(bus)\" title=\"Coach (bus)\">coach buses</a> if traveling for several hours). The exact date varies from year to year but is typically the same weekend of Penn State's graduation or the weekend directly after. Approximately 2,350 students presented their research at the 2015 State Meet.\n</p><p>Upon arriving at Main Campus, regional directors pick up dorm keys and meal cards from the Glass Lounge. Everyone attending the state meet receives a packet with a lanyard, name tag, a campus map, a big PJAS booklet with every presenting student\u2019s name / project title / school, in addition a Penn State magazine, PSU merchandise, and coupon to purchase discounted PSU items at the bookstore. Adults judging receive a second packet detailing their judging assignment. Because there may be a shortage of judges, some adults may get a second judging assignment \u2013 one for the AM session (senior high projects) and another for the PM session (junior high projects). Non-judging chaperones receive their chaperone duty in their packet, detailing when and where they are chaperoning; typical chaperone duties include helping to direct students at the awards ceremony or watching over the sports complex for no more than 2 hours. In previous years when the PJAS dance was held on the Monday night after the Special Awards Ceremony, many chaperones would be assigned to the dance.\n</p><p>After picking up and distributing packets and room keys, females head to their dorm building and males head to their different dorm building. Students and chaperones can also arrange to stay off campus. PJAS typically houses participants in the <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_State_University_residence_halls#East\" title=\"List of Pennsylvania State University residence halls\">East Halls</a>, but a few regions are housed in the <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_State_University_residence_halls#Pollock_Halls\" title=\"List of Pennsylvania State University residence halls\">Pollock Halls</a>. PSU meal cards double as their dorm building key and they are each tested upon first entering the building. Students are then able to head to their rooms. Two students are normally housed together in one room, but rarely three students will be assigned to one room.\n</p><p>After Monday\u2019s dinner, each region hosts its own information meeting for students presenting their projects the following day run by their regional director(s) in a large lecture hall. Students attending the State Meet as Technicians attend one big meeting to go over the process, rules, and requirements of their duties.\nOn Sunday night, it is common for student presenters to practice their presentations in their dorm or somewhere else on campus to prepare for Monday\u2019s presentation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Monday\">Monday</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Monday\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Monday a full day of presentations and awards.

Senior High students eat breakfast and head to their building to present their project dressed in business casual clothes. It is normal to see many students proudly displaying their PJAS <a href=\"/wiki/Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science#Pin_.26_Bars\" title=\"Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science\">Pin &amp; Bars</a> on their jacket, shirt, or blouse.\n</p><p>Presentations were conducted using <a href=\"/wiki/Overhead_projectors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Overhead projectors\">overhead projectors</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Transparency_(projection)\" title=\"Transparency (projection)\">transparency slides</a> to present projects through 2014. From 2013 to 2015, PJAS was phasing out these old technologies for modern <a href=\"/wiki/LCD_projectors\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"LCD projectors\">LCD projectors</a>; all presentations were presented digitally at the 2015 State Meet. All digital presentations are saved/exported as <a href=\"/wiki/PDF\" title=\"PDF\">PDF files</a> - no animations, videos, or sounds will appear during the presentation. Students upload their projects several days before arriving to Penn State with a special file uploader specifically made for PJAS. When students arrive in their unit Monday morning (or afternoon for junior high students), all of the projects to be presented are in the presenting program queued up. When all of the judges and technician(s) arrive, presentations can begin. Penn State students are available in each presenting building to help with any technological problems. Presentations at States are almost exactly the same as the presentations at regionals, but State presentation units can have students and judges from across PA rather than from the same region.\n</p><p>While senior high students are presenting, junior high students have the morning to practice, visit downtown\u2019s shops, visit the <a href=\"/wiki/Penn_State_University_Creamery\" title=\"Penn State University Creamery\">Penn State Creamery</a>, play outside if the weather is nice, or other things.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Afternoon\">Afternoon</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Afternoon\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>When all of the morning presentations are over, students can head back to their dorms right away to get changed into regular clothes before going to lunch or do what was instructed by their sponsor or regional director. Judges meet in the first floor of Findlay immediately following the unit\u2019s presentations to deliberate scores and come to a conclusion on each project\u2019s award. This is done immediately because the Senior High Awards Ceremony start right after students eat lunch, occurring in <a href=\"/wiki/University_Park,_Pennsylvania#Major_landmarks\" title=\"University Park, Pennsylvania\">Eisenhower Auditorium</a> at 1PM.\n</p><p>Junior high students get changed into their presenting clothes and go to lunch before their presentations begin at 1:15PM. They follow the same process as senior high presentations.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Morning_Awards_Ceremony_.28Senior_High_Students.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Morning_Awards_Ceremony_(Senior_High_Students)\">Morning Awards Ceremony (Senior High Students)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Morning Awards Ceremony (Senior High Students)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:506px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"PJAS AM Awards Ceremony Photo - 2018\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg/504px-PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"283\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg/756px-PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg/1008px-PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4192\" data-file-height=\"2356\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:PJAS_AMawardsCeremony.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>View of the 2018 PJAS Senior High Awards Ceremony from one of the two awards tables.

Each unit is called, alternating between odd units and even units. Each student\u2019s name is called one by one with their award announced. An example unit being called sounds like this:\n</p><p><i>\u201cUnit 17 please line up. Unit 34: John Doe, first award. Bob Doe, second award. Jane Doe, first award and perfect score (applause). James Doe, third award, Janet Doe, honorable mention, and Jack Doe, first award.\u201d</i>\n</p><p>For juniors interviewing for scholarships, they leave at 2PM (or immediately after receiving their award, if they have not yet). to interview. When the award ceremony is over, everyone leaves Eisenhower. Senior high students not interviewing have free time that can be spent back in the dorms, they can go off campus to visit stores and shops, eat ice cream from the renowned <a href=\"/wiki/Penn_State_University_Creamery\" title=\"Penn State University Creamery\">Penn State Creamery</a>, or their school or region could have other events planned.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Junior_High_Presentations\">Junior High Presentations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Junior High Presentations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>While the Senior High Award Ceremony is taking place, the junior high students are presenting their projects in their units just like the senior high students did hours prior, starting at 1:15PM. When these presentations conclude, students return to their dorms to get changed for dinner or do what was instructed by their sponsor or regional director.\nDuring this time, senior high students are free to visit downtown\u2019s shops, visit the <a href=\"/wiki/Penn_State_University_Creamery\" title=\"Penn State University Creamery\">Penn State Creamery</a>, play outside if the weather is nice, or other things.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Evening\">Evening</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: Evening\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The evening is filled with more award ceremonies and is one of the biggest parts of the PJAS State Meet.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Junior_High_Award_Ceremonies\">Junior High Award Ceremonies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Junior High Award Ceremonies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>After dinner is the Junior High Awards Ceremony. Since the 2013 State Meet onward, PJAS has stopped holding one massive Junior High Awards Ceremony in <a href=\"/wiki/University_Park,_Pennsylvania#Major_landmarks\" title=\"University Park, Pennsylvania\">Eisenhower Auditorium</a> due to time constraints with preparing for the Special Awards Ceremony. The large ceremony followed exactly the same process as the Senior High Awards Ceremony. Now, each region\u2019s Junior High Award Ceremony in held different lecture halls across campus at the same time. Depending on the number of middle school students, this awards ceremony could take a few minutes or could be over an hour long; it is less formal and much quicker than the senior high awards. Each middle school student\u2019s name is called along with his/her award just like the senior high awards ceremony. Students receive a corresponding pin for their award and a certificate.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_Awards_Ceremony\">Special Awards Ceremony</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Special Awards Ceremony\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Special Awards Ceremony is held in Eisenhower starting at 8PM. All 1st Award winners are strongly suggested to attend; failure to attend could mean forfeiting any award(s) won. This awards ceremony is the first and only time <b>all</b> PJAS students (senior high and junior high) are together. Dozens of awards are distributed to students across all grades paired with monetary prizes. Students can win awards ranging from $50 to $8,000, with scholarships awarding the most money.\n</p><p>Awards at the Special Awards Ceremony include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The PA Science Talent Search's <i>Outstanding Senior Award</i> (4 given each year)</li>\n<li>D.E. Zappa Award (4 given each year, two to senior high students and two to junior high students)</li>\n<li>Director's Award \u2013 one each category (13) in junior high and in senior high.</li>\n<li>Penn State Scholarships \u2013 $2,000 a year for a possible 4 years. Students may only interview for a maximum of two of these scholarships. To be used, Penn State requires students to be (1) in the top 5% of their class, (2) have a combined SAT score (critical reading + math) of at least 1300, and (3) the student must receive a 1st or 2nd award at the State Meet:\n<ul><li>College of Agriculture Scholarship</li>\n<li>College of Earth and Mineral Sciences Scholarship</li>\n<li>College of Engineering Scholarship</li>\n<li>Eberly College of Science Scholarship</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><b>Note:</b> There is no set limit on the number of scholarships awarded \u2013 for example, the Eberly College of Science awarded over 50 scholarships at the 2016 State Meet, and these numbers vary each year.\n</p>\n<ul><li>American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) National Convention - All-expenses paid, student will be reimbursed for air travel, 1 delegate and 1 alternate.</li>\n<li>Marine Science Camp (location varies each year) - 1 week, expenses paid, student is responsible for travel, 1 delegates and 1 alternate.</li>\n<li>The Commonwealth Medical College Fellowship Award - Two days spent with med students and researchers on the campus of TCMC in Scranton. All expenses paid. July 22 and 23, 2015.  1 delegate and 1 alternate.  Student responsible for travel.</li>\n<li>Several memorial awards, in honor of previous PJAS Directors or persons.</li></ul>\n<p><br />\nAfter the Special Award's Ceremony, students are free to take part in various activities, hang out in the dorms, or do things their region/sponsor has planned. PJAS offers movie(s) to view outside and often, the Penn State Astronomy Department has telescopes set up on the HUB lawn (weather permitting). Up until the 2014 State Meet, PJAS also had a student dance in the IM Building.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tuesday\">Tuesday</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Tuesday\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This is a very quick day. Each region\u2019s schedule varies depending on their departure time, but most regions wake up early, eat breakfast, clear out their rooms and return their keys before loading the busses. Buses cannot leave until key collection is finished and checked by the regional director(s) and Penn State key personnel.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pin_.26_Bars\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pin_&amp;_Bars\">Pin &amp; Bars</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Pin &amp; Bars\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:92px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_(2014).jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_%282014%29.jpg/90px-PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_%282014%29.jpg\" width=\"90\" height=\"365\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_%282014%29.jpg/135px-PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_%282014%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_%282014%29.jpg/180px-PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_%282014%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"707\" data-file-height=\"2868\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:PJAS_Bars_-_Liam_Chambers_(2014).jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>An example PJAS Pin and Bars from a senior in 2014. Photo taken by Liam Chambers</div></div></div>\n<p>The PJAS pin and bars are unique to the organization. Students earn bar(s) for each competition (except for honorable mention) that are colored to reflect performance. Students can earn bars at each regional meet and each state meet they present a project and connect them together to form a chain or history of their performance. The bar attached to the pin is the oldest project and the newest project is at the bottom. Returning members of PJAS like to wear their pins and bar while presenting during meets.\nDepending on the student and his/her projects, it is possible for students to earn more than the 10 bars that could be earned if the student participated for all five years. Students earning a First Award Perfect Score earn two pins - one for their first award and a second for their perfect score. Therefore, it is theoretically possible for a student who competes in all 12 competitions to earn a maximum of 24 bars if the student earns a perfect score at <b>every</b> meet for all six years.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Award</th>\n<th>Regional Meet</th>\n<th>State Meet</th>\n<th>Score (out of 5.00)\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perfect Score</td>\n<td>White</td>\n<td>White \"State\"</td>\n<td>5.00\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st Award</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>Blue \"State\"</td>\n<td>4.00 to 4.99\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd Award</td>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>Red \"State\"</td>\n<td>3.00 to 3.99\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd Award</td>\n<td>Yellow</td>\n<td>Yellow \"State\"</td>\n<td>2.00 to 2.99\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Honorable Mention</td>\n<td>No bar</td>\n<td>No bar</td>\n<td>1.00 to 1.99\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>In the example pin and bar on the right, it can be seen that the student's first project earned a 1st Award at his Regional Meet and a 2nd Award at the State Meet. In his second year, he earned a 1st at Regionals and 1st Award Perfect Score at States. Then, a 1st award at both the Regional and State Meets in his third year, followed by a 1st Award Perfect Score at his fourth Regional Meet and a 1st Award at the State Meet. In his fifth and final year as a presenter, he earned 1st Award Perfect Scores at both the Regional and State Meets for that particular project.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scoring_Rubric\">Scoring Rubric</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pennsylvania_Junior_Academy_of_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Scoring Rubric\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>PJAS participants and their projects are not judged against each other like other fairs. Instead, each project is independently judged based on a rubric. Each rubric for the four project types consists of five categories with a maximum score of 5.00 points in each category. Each judge's numbers influence the final score because it is their combined average that make up the point value. To proceed to the state meet, a participant must receive an average score of 4.00 or greater (or a perfect 5.00) to earn a 1st Award at the Regional Meet. Participants who receive 2nd awards (an average score between 3.00 and 3.99) may be eligible to go on the state trip as a technician possibly. Participants that go over 10 minutes in presentation length automatically earn a second award based on the criteria in each rubric and thus are ineligible to compete at the state meet.\n</p><p>For each category, on each rubric, 1-5 points may be awarded. The following table describes each point value.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Point value (out of 5)\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exceeds Characteristics</td>\n<td>5\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meets ALL of the Characteristics</td>\n<td>4\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meets MOST of the Characteristics</td>\n<td>3\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meets FEW of the Characteristics</td>\n<td>2\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meets NONE of the Characteristics</td>\n<td>1\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Scoring rubrics vary by category type but share two of the same sections between all rubric types <i>(italicized)</i>.
