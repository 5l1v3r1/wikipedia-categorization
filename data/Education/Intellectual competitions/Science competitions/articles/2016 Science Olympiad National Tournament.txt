The 2016 Science Olympiad National Tournament was the 32nd  annual edition of the National Science Olympiad tournament, a competition in which 120 teams (sixty middle school and sixty high school) from all fifty states compete in around twenty science-themed events, in various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, biology, and geology. Neither of the winners from last year's national competition at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln were able to defend their titles; the defending champions were Solon M.S (OH) and Troy H.S. (CA). Solon finished fifth  and Troy finished fourth  in their respective divisions. Both of 2016's winners won for the first time in their history; Daniel Wright Junior High School from Illinois and Mira Loma High School from California.
