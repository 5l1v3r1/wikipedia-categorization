The Mobile Ad hoc Networking Interoperability And Cooperation (MANIAC) Challenge  is a multi-institution team competition with participants forming a real-world mobile ad hoc network. The objective of the competition is to observe the trade-offs experienced by teams in focusing towards delivery of their own packets versus cooperating in forwarding other teams' packets, essential in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) to permit delivery across the network, at the expense of consuming their limited resources (battery life, bandwidth). The competition was held on two days, 25–26 November 2007 along with IEEE GLOBECOM in Washington,DC.
