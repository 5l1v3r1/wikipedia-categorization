 The 2018 Science Olympiad National Tournament was the 34th  annual edition of the National Science Olympiad tournament, a competition in which 120 teams  (sixty middle school and sixty high school) from all fifty states and the District of Columbia compete in twenty three science-related events, in various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, biology, and geology. The tournament was hosted for the first time by Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, with competitions being held around campus and the opening and closing ceremonies being held at the Moby Arena. Only one of the winners from last year's national competition at Wright State University were able to defend their titles; the defending champions were Daniel Wright Junior High School (IL) and Troy High School (CA). Troy finished first to successfully defend their title, and Daniel Wright finished second. Solon Middle School (OH) won the Division B tournament to win their eighth title, keeping them in second for most National championships.
