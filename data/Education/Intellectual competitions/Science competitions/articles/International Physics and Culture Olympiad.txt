The International Physics and Culture Olympiad (IPhCO) is a physics and culture competition for high school students. In June 2016, the IPhCO beta version was held in Curitiba, Brazil at the Federal Institute of Paraná (IFPR). The first IPhCO was held in April 2017. The problems are based on high school physics and mathematics, but indirectly works with other areas such as: Geography, History, Arts, Biology etc. The competition is online. There are 12 problems in total and the student has 24 hours to solve each problem. Always at midnight, a new problem is released. Enrolled students receive passwords that open the portals that give access to problems. The student can be awarded three times, according to the stages due. Each step is related to a number of problems solved successfully. The student can receive up to three postcards of Curitiba with the conquered key printed. An important goal of the Olympiad is to value culture, arousing young people's interest in the history of Brazil and other countries. To do so, the Olympics takes students on virtual walks in places where interesting events have occurred or are remembered, such as in museums, for example. With the objective of offering more visibility to the cultural spaces of Curitiba and the state of Paraná, the Olympiad began a mapping work of those spaces that were not yet in Street View. In collaboration with Google, which provided equipment for photographing, this work began in October 2017. The main venue of the Olympiad is in Curitiba, Parana, where the Olympiad began in 2017. Other cities in Brazil and the world will gradually incorporate the network of collaboration and culture.
