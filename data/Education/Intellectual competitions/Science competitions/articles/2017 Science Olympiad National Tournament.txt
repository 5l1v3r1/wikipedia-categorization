The 2017 Science Olympiad National Tournament was the 33rd  annual edition of the National Science Olympiad tournament, a competition in which 120 teams (sixty middle school and sixty high school) from all fifty states compete in twenty three science-related events, in various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, biology, and geology. The tournament was hosted for a second time by Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, with competitions being held around campus and the opening and closing ceremonies being held at the Nutter Center. Only one of the winners from last year's national competition at the University of Wisconsin, Stout were able to defend their titles; the defending champions were Daniel Wright Junior High School (IL) and Mira Loma H.S. (CA). Daniel Wright finished first to successfully defend their title, and Mira Loma finished fifth. Troy High School (CA) won the Division C tournament to win their eleventh title, extending their record as the team with the most National Championships.
