SensUs   is the yearly international student competition on molecular biosensors for healthcare applications.[a 1] Teams of students at international universities design and build biosensing systems, and demonstrate and present their prototypes to an audience during a public final contest event. The competition aims to stimulate education and innovation in the field of biosensing, with a worldwide scope. The long term aim is to improve the quality of life of patients.  Each year, SensUs defines a theme that represents a current healthcare problem in society. A biomarker is selected and the participating teams have 9 months to develop a biosensor that can measure the selected biomarker. The participating teams have the same functional end goal, but develop creative solutions and unique biosensor prototypes. The prototypes are shown, shared and discussed at the annual SensUs event.  SensUs is an international platform for learning and innovation in the field of molecular biosensors for healthcare applications.  SensUs 2016 was the first edition of the competition. The aim was to develop biosensors for the measurement of creatinine in blood plasma, which is a key biomarker for Kidney failure. The student teams originated from five universities: University of Leuven,  Imperial College London,  Uppsala University,  Technical University of Denmark,  and Eindhoven University of Technology.  The teams had worked during 9 months to develop biosensors in their own universities, and thereafter all came to the final contest event on the 9th and 10th of September 2016 at Eindhoven University of Technology. Here they could win four awards; the Analytical Performance award (AP), the Creativity Award (Cr), the Translational Potential award (TP) and the Public Inspiration award (PI). Photos and videos from SensUs 2016 can be found here. SensUs 2017 was the second edition of the yearly competition. The finals took place on the 8th and 9th of September 2017.  Ten student teams from three continents built a biosensor to detect NT-proBNP in blood plasma, which is an important biomarker for Heart failure.  During the event the teams showed their biosensors to the public, measured NT-proBNP live and presented pitches on technology and on translation into society.  The teams were judged by an international multidisciplinary jury, who conferred awards for Analytical Performance (AP), Creativity (Cr), and Translational Potential (TP).  About 500 people visited the event at Eindhoven University of Technology. The event was broadcast on the SensUs Digital platform , including livestreams, live data, Q&A, photos and videos and voting functionality. The cumulative visitor count on SensUs digital was 5000 from 74 countries, of which 1500 people casted their votes for the Public Inspiration award (PI). Photos of SensUs 2017 can be found here.  SensUs 2018 will be the third edition of the SensUs competition. The theme is antibiotic testing for improved healthcare. The biomarker that will be measured by the teams is vancomycin, an important antibiotic drug. Participants are the ten universities of SensUs 2017 and three new universities, from Canada (Université de Montréal), China (Zhejiang University) and Spain (UPC-BarcelonaTech / Univ. Vic).  The finals of SensUs 2018 will take place on the 7th and 8th of September 2018 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
