The Congressional Science Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic Competition (House App Contest) (Congressional App Challenge) allows high school students in participating congressional districts to compete in an application software ("app") development contest.  The challenge was established by the United States House of Representatives in 2013 with the "Academic Competition Resolution of 2013" to engage student creativity and participation in STEM education fields and the challenge is modeled after the Congressional Art Competition.  The Senate did not have to approve the resolution because the House administered the program. The Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee introduced the concept for the Congressional App Challenge in 2013 and the challenge was co-chaired by Congressional Internet Caucus co-chairs Rep. Bob Goodlatte and Rep. Anna Eshoo.  In its inaugural year, 84 congressional districts in 31 states and DC awarded 212 high school students for 109 apps.
