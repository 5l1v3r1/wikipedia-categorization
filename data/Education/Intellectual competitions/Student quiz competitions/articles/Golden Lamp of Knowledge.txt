The Golden Lamp of Knowledge is a trophy given to winners between quiz bowl matches between Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi.  Using the Golden Egg trophy for winners of football games between the universities as a model, the trophy is passed back and forth between the schools.  Since quiz bowl tournaments often have teams facing each other more than once, the trophy is only awarded once per tournament, with the team winning the most matches against the other in a tournament taking home the trophy. Ole Miss victories are shaded ██ blue. Mississippi State victories shaded in ██ red.
