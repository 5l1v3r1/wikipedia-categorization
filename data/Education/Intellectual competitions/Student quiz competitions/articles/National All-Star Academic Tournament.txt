The National All-Star Academic Tournament (NASAT) is a national quizbowl tournament for state-based high school all-star teams held every June by International Quiz Bowl Tournaments . The current reigning champion is Illinois. The tournament was founded in 2009 with an initial event date of June 12â€“13, 2010. Originally, it was designed as an alternative to other all-star academic competitions.  The first tournament was held at Vanderbilt University and the second at the University of Maryland before the event moved to the Ohio State University  and later to the University of Kentucky . In 2012, The National History Bee and Bowl began awarding the National Quizbowl Awards at NASAT.   All-star teams representing any U.S. state (or equivalents such as Washington, D.C., Guam and Canadian provinces, etc.) apply to HSAPQ for entry into the field and are selected based on team strength.   Teams typically play in a round-robin, with additional playoff rounds being held depending on the number of teams attending. Games are played in a tossup/bonus format.
