The KYVE Apple Bowl is a televised single elimination competition between high school students.  Over a period of one to three weeks, 20-30 high schools come from all over Central Washington to compete at the Apple Bowl studio, which is located on the Central Washington University  campus in Ellensburg, Washington. The first and second place team members receive checks from Washington Apple Education Foundation.  Many of the teams also participate in Knowledge Bowl and Quiz Bowl. The competition is co-produced by Central Washington University and airs on PBS station KYVE Yakima each spring. The program reaches an audience of over 200,000 families in the Central Washington area.  Apple Bowl is played between two teams of three members each, with all six individuals using a lockout buzzer system to answer questions. Each team has a captain who is required to answer the questions in some of the rounds. A host reads the questions and determines the correct responses, although off-camera judges are used when an answer is contentious. The competition consists of three rounds: Apple Bowl first began in 1980.  The program does not have a regular host. KNDO news anchor Dave Ettl was the longtime host for a stint ending with the 2003 tournament. The 2004 event also brought about other changes, including the relocation of tapings to Central Washington University (previously they were taped at a studio in Yakima, Washington) and had the team members play standing where previously they sat. The winning team for the 2012 season was from West Valley High School,  the winning school from 2011. Team members received $1500 in personal checks. The runner-up team of Prosser received $500 in checks. Before 2008, first and second place teams received savings bonds from the Washington Apple Education Foundation.
