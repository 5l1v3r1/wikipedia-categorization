The International Brain Bee (IBB) is a neuroscience competition for teenagers. The IBB was founded in 1999 by Dr. Norbert Myslinski, and consists of over 200 chapters in more than 50 regions on 6 continents.  Its purpose is to help treat and find cures for brain disorders by inspiring and motivating young men and women to pursue careers in basic and clinical neuroscience.  The IBB governing body is a consortium consisting of the American Psychological Association, Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives, Federation of European Neuroscience Societies, International Brain Research Organization, and Society for Neuroscience.  Winners of the chapter competitions are invited to compete in their respective region championships, where they vie for the right to compete in the world championship. Past venues for the world championship include Montreal, Canada; San Diego, USA; Vienna, Austria; Washington, DC, USA; Cape Town, South Africa; Florence, Italy; Cairns, Australia; Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada; and Copenhagen, Denmark.
