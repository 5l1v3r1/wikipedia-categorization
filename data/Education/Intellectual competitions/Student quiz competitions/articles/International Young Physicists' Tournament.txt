The International Young Physicistsâ€™ Tournament, IYPT, is one of the World's most respected and prestigious   annual physics competitions centered on 17 non-examination research problems that are published yearly in late July. During the tournament, discussion-based sessions called Physics Fights are conducted and the performances of the teams are judged by expert physicists. The IYPT is a week-long event in which currently around 150 international pre-university contestants participate. The participants present and discuss their research projects at the events that share common features with thesis defense or scientific conferences. The teams switch roles and take floor as Reporters, Opponents and Reviewers, thus learning about peer review early on in their school years. The concept was conceived in 1979 by Evgeny Yunosov and was run as the Russian Young Physicists' Tournament, an event localised to Russia.  He went on to initiate the first IYPT in 1988.
