The National Quiz Bee is currently the longest-running national academic quiz competition in the Philippines.  Starting out as a national spelling bee in 1977, the National Quiz Bee currently awards champions in mathematics, science, general information, and Philippine history. The show aired on IBC-13 and Studio 23 and are hosted by Eddie Lacsi, Bingbing Josue, Pettizou Tayag, Atom Araullo, Spanky Enriquez and Danny Fajardo. The National Quiz Bee is organized by the Quiz Bee Foundation. The program enjoys generous support from the private sector, which mostly provides for the prizes and TV coverage. The National Quiz Bee is also endorsed and assisted by various agencies of the Philippine government, including the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Senate of the Philippines, and the Office of the President.    In 1976, Rasty Tayag, together with the erstwhile DECS, launched a nationwide elementary spelling contest dubbed the "1976 Spelling Bee Contest." After the success of the Spelling Bee, Gay Tayag (educator and wife of Rasty?) proposed that the contest should not be limited to spelling and grammar (although covering these subjects were dropped altogether), but rather be extended to science, mathematics, and Philippine history and culture. It was also decided that an average of 10 questions will be asked per round (ranging from easy, average, difficult and clincher), making it a short test or quiz. Mr. Tayag then changed the word "spelling" in spelling bee to "quiz", thus coining the term "quiz bee", and the First National Quiz Bee was born. Rasty and Gay Tayag launched the Quiz Bee to promote academic excellence, love of country, brotherhood and unity among the country's elementary school children. Since its inception, it has had the support and cooperation of the Office of the President, DECS, and DILG. Since 1977, the Quiz Bee has been consistently organized as a yearly event. It was also in this year that Mr. Tayag registered the term "quiz bee" as a copyright and trademark with the Philippine Patent Office?. To institutionalize the Quiz Bee and its associated projects and programs, the Tayags, together with prominent educators in the Philippines, established the Quiz Bee Foundation in 1983. Carlos P. Romulo served as its first Chairman and Rasty Tayag as President. Other members of the Founding Trustees included: University of the Philippines President Edgardo Angara, Dr. Helena Benitez, Dr. Estefania Aldaba-Lim, Atty. Efrenilo Cayanga, and Metro Manila Governor Mel Mathay. In 1979, after 2 years of planning, the 1st ASEAN Quiz Bee was held in Manila. The national champions of the 2nd National Quiz Bee as the country's representatives, against competitors from Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. For this competition, the category of Philippine history and culture was expanded to include ASEAN history and culture. In 1988, the 1st World Quiz Bee was launched, with no less than William Randolph Hearst, Jr. serving as a member of the World Quiz Bee Advisory Board. For this competition, again the history and culture category was expanded to include world history & culture. Billed as the "Summit of the World's Young Geniuses", the 1st World Quiz Bee was held in Manila in 1990. The national champions of the 11th National Quiz Bee served as the Philippine's representatives against competitors fromÂ ?. In 1993, in consonance with the Philippines 2000 program of President Fidel V. Ramos, the competition now included high school and college students, and the name was changed to the National Super Quiz Bee. Quiz Bee has become a nationwide tilt for more than 16.5 million students in more than 40,000 private and public schools. The program now serves as a nerve center for educational and cultural exchange, thus allowing challenges and opportunities for the youth's realization of their vast potential - making Quiz Bee therefore, the youth's contribution to "global excellence"! In recent years, saw the staging of the Quiz Bee Grand Finals outside the confines of Manila. The 18th National Super Quiz Bee Grand Finals was held in Muntinlupa City in 1997 hosted by then Mayor Toting Bunye and the City Council. The 19th National Super Quiz Bee Grand Finals was staged at the Expo Pilipino, Pampanga, the 20th National Super Quiz Bee Grand Finals at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in Olongapo City. The 21st - 26th National Super Quiz Bee Grand Finals was at the Development Academy of the Philippines Conference Center & Hotel in Tagaytay City, dubbed as the Home of the Summit of the Super Quiz Bee. Year 2000 onwards presents a special feature for the succeeding National Quiz Bee. The National Capital Region Division and Regional Championships are held in the leading shopping malls in Metro Manila simultaneous with the staging of the Division and Regional competitions in the other regions throughout the country.

Private companies and brands which have acknowledged as sponsors of the National Quiz Bee are     IF SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED AT THE Ayala Museum on the evening of Dec. 5, the country's private sector would have gone into a tailspin. For on that balmy evening, captains of industry took time out of their tight schedules to witness the unveiling of the 20 Guyitos painted by the Philippines' top artists as part of the Inquirer's 20th anniversary celebration. In 2005, the Inquirer, in its continuing partnership with the Quiz Bee Foundation, awarded 20 life-size sculptures of the newspaper's carabao mascot, Guyito, painted by some of the country's foremost artists, to the public high schools around the country that topped last years National Quiz Bee. The Inquirer partnered with the Quiz Bee Foundation in choosing the schools, a process that took about six months. Made of fiberglass, the Guyitos were sculpted by artist Sajid Imao and then painted by the artists Malang, Ben Cabrera, Kidlat Tahimik, Jack Salud, Ernesto Patricio, Steve Santos, Lydia Velasco, Fernando Sena, Salvador Convocar, Soler, Caa, Bing Siochi, Roel Obemio, Tres Roman, Wilfredo Offemaria, Bin Samonte, Jef Samonte, Romeo Forbes, Rex Tatlonghari and Anton Balao. Each artist was free to interpret this year's theme, "The Power of Knowing." The result was as diverse as the opinions, news, features and photos carried by the Inquirer in every issue. Each of the top advertisers got a smaller version of Guyito in recognition of their invaluable contribution to the Inquirer. They also helped honor the 20 schools chosen to receive the life-sized Guyitos, symbols of a newspaper's gratitude to the Filipino people. In 2005, the Philippine Daily Inquirer led by its chair Marixi R. Prieto, in its continuous partnership with the Quiz Bee Foundation awarded twenty (20) priceless life - sized masterpiece Guyito (carabao) sculptures done by the country's foremost painters (Malang, Ben Cabrera, Soler, Kidlat Tahimik, Rex Tatlonghari, Steve Santos, and more) to public high schools around the country who ranked highest in the 26th National Super Quiz Bee. During the Award's night at the Ayala Museum, the student awardees, their teacher - coaches, school officials and parents also mingled with the country's top industry leaders (Fernando Zobel de Ayala, Teresita Sy, Robina Gocongwei, Manny Pangilinan, Rico Tantoco to name a few) and had front row seats to a concert with internationally acclaimed Lea Salonga (a former Quiz Bee host herself) and the Manila Philharmonic Orchestra.  Apart from the Guyito unveiling, the Knowledge Trip had an added bonus: A journalism lecture/workshop was given for the graduating high school class by Inquirer editors, reporters and executives. They discussed the importance of reading and shared their expertise on effective reading and writing, editing and lay-out. The participants were given a handbook on journalism styles, methods, ethics and best practices, as well as Guyito stuffed toys and school supplies. Kalagayan said the Knowledge Trip was part of the Inquirerâs advocacy for youth empowerment that emphasizes the role of media in nation building. It also sought to avert the declining trend in youth readership. The 20 high schools that ranked highest in the Inquirer round of the 26th National Super Quiz Bee were picked out of 40,000 schools in 17 regions. The Guyitos were given to the following schools:  From January to May 2006, Inquirer representatives will visit the 20 selected schools/cities to turn over the sculptures. In addition, an Inquirer Campus Journalism Workshop will be held in each school. The one-day lecture/workshop will feature Inquirer reporters, editors and columnists who will discuss specific journalism topics and share their expertise on effective writing, editing and layouting. The number of student participants will be determined by the schools available venue. Delegates will be given a handbook on journalism styles, methods, ethics and best practices.
