 Hard Spell Abbey was a five-part spelling bee game show produced for CBBC. It was shot entirely on location in Suffolk during 2004. The series was designed to accompany Hard Spell, a family spelling competition for BBC One. Each episode featured games as well as some reality-based filming. Short comedy cameos from spelling celebrities were included in a highly popular strand named "Spellebrity Squares". In this rehash of a popular classic, an impressive roll call of celebrities was asked to spell live on camera, including Dermot O'Leary, Dick 'n' Dom, Tracy Beaker, Jonathan Ross, and Dermot Murnaghan. In the show Trevor Hickson played Brother Brendan, a slightly mad but likeable monk who lived at the abbey and wanted to be involved with every game. Jaz Ampaw-Farr was the spelling expert who coached the contestants, aided by Brother Brendan to spelling success.
