  The Times Spelling Bee is a spelling bee contested throughout the United Kingdom. The contest, run by the British newspaper The Times, consists of local, regional, and national segments. The winner of each round continues to the next level. Each part consists of two rounds: a knockout round and a quick-fire round. The final was held in the Odeon Cinema, Leicester Square, in London's West End. One thousand schools took part in The Times' second Spelling Bee championship, competing in 106 local heats and 10 semi-finals across the country. The Times Spelling Bee received entries from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the Channel Islands. The top 10 school teams made it through to the Grand Final, held at the Institute of Education, London, on 24 June, where they went head-to-head for the winning title. The winner was Newport Girls' High School, from Shropshire. Culcheth High School from Cheshire followed closely in second place and The Royal Latin School from Buckingham placed third.
