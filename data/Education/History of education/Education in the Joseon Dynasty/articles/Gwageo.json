In fact, any member of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Yangin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yangin\">yangin</a></i> freeborn class was permitted to take the examination, although the descendants of monks, criminals and <a href=\"/wiki/Cheonmin\" title=\"Cheonmin\">cheonmin</a> were excluded.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> However, over time government-run educational institutions such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Hyanggyo\" title=\"Hyanggyo\">hyanggyo</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Gukjagam\" title=\"Gukjagam\">Gukjagam</a> lost ground to private institutions like the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Twelve_Assemblies&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Twelve Assemblies (page does not exist)\">Twelve Assemblies</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The major examinations were literary, and came in two forms:  a composition test (<i>jesul eop</i>), and a test of classical knowledge (<i>myeonggyeong eop</i>).

In the case of literary administration, children of remarried women, concubines, and officials who were dismissed for corruption were excluded from taking the exam.

The higher literary examination was restricted to those who either were already in a position of rank, or who had already passed the lower examination. The miscellaneous examinations were looked down upon by the yangban, and were generally restricted to the <a href=\"/wiki/Chungin\" title=\"Chungin\">chungin</a> class of hereditary technical workers.

In the late Joseon Dynasty, an increasing percentage of successful candidates came from the northern province of <a href=\"/wiki/Pyongan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pyongan\">Pyongan</a>, and the small county of <a href=\"/wiki/Ch%C5%8Fngju\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ch\u014fngju\">Ch\u014fngju</a> came to produce more successful candidates than any other county.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Administration\">Administration</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Gwageo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Administration\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The gwageo were originally administered every three years; these regular examinations were known as the <i>singnyeonsi</i> (\uc2dd\ub144\uc2dc). However, the <i>singnyeonsi</i> became less important over time, and an increasing percentage of candidates took the <i>gwageo</i> on special occasions. These included the <i>alseongsi</i> (visitation examinations), which were administered when the king visited the Shrine of Confucius at the <a href=\"/wiki/Seonggyungwan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seonggyungwan\">Seonggyungwan</a> royal academy, the <i>jeunggwangsi</i> (augmented examinations) held during national celebrations, and the <i>byeolsi</i> (special examinations) held on other special occasions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>  However, these special examinations were usually limited to the literary and military examinations.
