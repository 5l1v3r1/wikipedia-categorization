It was an association rather than a <a href=\"/wiki/Trade_union\" title=\"Trade union\">labor union</a>, and was opposed to <a href=\"/wiki/Collective_bargaining\" title=\"Collective bargaining\">collective bargaining</a> and strikes.\n</p><p>In 1963, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pat_Tornillo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pat Tornillo (page does not exist)\">Pat Tornillo</a>, a teacher in the <a href=\"/wiki/Dade_County,_Florida\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dade County, Florida\">Dade County</a> school system, ran for the presidency of the Dade County Classroom Teachers Association (DCCTA). He won by calling for greater organizational militancy and the desegregation of teaching staff.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tornillo_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tornillo-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tornillo's election was a sign of a wave of union-like militancy sweeping the NEA in Florida and nationally. Since its inception, the NEA had rejected collective bargaining and strikes as unprofessional. But after the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers\" title=\"American Federation of Teachers\">American Federation of Teachers</a> won collective bargaining rights for teachers in New York City and formed the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Federation_of_Teachers\" title=\"United Federation of Teachers\">United Federation of Teachers</a>, many NEA members began to push for the association to act more like a union. In 1961, about 200 of the NEA's largest urban locals formed the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Urban_Education_Associations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"National Council of Urban Education Associations (page does not exist)\">National Council of Urban Education Associations</a> to push the national organization toward collective bargaining. The caucus was successful: The same year, the NEA Representative Assembly (RA) passed a resolution establishing an \"Urban Project\", adopting a policy of \"professional negotiations\" akin to collective bargaining, and requiring the NEA to provide staff, research and financial assistance to locals involved in \"professional negotiations.\" By 1965, the NEA was providing nearly $885,000 a year to locals in support of \"professional negotiations\", up from a mere $28,000 in 1961.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In 1962, pro-unionization forces in the NEA pushed to remove the organization's prohibition against strikes. They were unsuccessful, but did win approval of a \"sanctions\" policy. \"Sanctions\" included waging a <a href=\"/wiki/Public_relations\" title=\"Public relations\">public relations</a> campaign against the school district, encouraging teachers to not accept teaching positions with the school system, refusing to provide unpaid services (such as tutoring or supervision of clubs), and political action to defeat anti-union politicians. \"Sanctions\" could be employed against any school district which, in the opinion of the local association, had engaged in \"unethical or arbitrary\" policies or which had refused \"sound professional practices.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The first time the NEA voted sanctions against an entire state was in Utah in 1963.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tornillo eagerly embraced professional negotiations and sanctions, and in 1966 he forced the Dade County school system to open negotiations with the DCCTA. Although the national NEA was obligated to provide assistance, the FEA was not and refused to become involved in Tornillo's professional negotiations. Nevertheless, the DCCTA won a contract. But FEA's reluctance to support the local association led Tornillo and other leaders to lobby the state association to become more militant.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tornillo_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tornillo-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"State_underfunding_of_education\">State underfunding of education</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Florida_statewide_teachers%27_strike_of_1968&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: State underfunding of education\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Florida, like many American states, strictly regulates the way in which local school districts may fund education. <a href=\"/wiki/Property_taxes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Property taxes\">Property taxes</a> are the largest source of income, and may be levied by each local school district under a formula controlled by the state legislature.

Kirk had campaigned heavily on a promise to improve funding for education, but he also made a pledge not to raise taxes.\n</p><p>During the 1967 legislature session, the FEA lobbied the state legislature hard for more funding for public schools. State legislative action had often been the only way for NEA locals to win better pay and working conditions prior to the enactment of the professional negotiations policy, so FEA was no newcomer to politics. FEA asked for a minimum teacher salary of $5,000 a year and a more equitable means of funding schools than property taxes. The <a href=\"/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)\" title=\"Democratic Party (United States)\">Democratic</a>-controlled state legislature approved a higher sales tax to provide for more school funding. But Kirk vetoed the budget, and Republican legislators upheld the <a href=\"/wiki/Veto#United_States\" title=\"Veto\">veto</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strike_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strike-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fall_1967_spot-strikes\">Fall 1967 spot-strikes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Florida_statewide_teachers%27_strike_of_1968&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Fall 1967 spot-strikes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many Florida teachers were angered by the Gov.

An August 1967 rally at the <a href=\"/wiki/Tangerine_Bowl_(1947%E2%80%9382)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tangerine Bowl (1947\u201382)\">Tangerine Bowl</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Orlando,_Florida\" title=\"Orlando, Florida\">Orlando</a> drew 30,000 teachers, who demanded state action.

Gov. Kirk called a special session of the legislature in January 1968. In a bipartisan effort, legislators raised taxes to expand state funding for school building and to pay for higher teacher salaries. Gov. Kirk signed the tax and funding package immediately.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strike_8-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strike-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>But most teachers felt the increases were not enough, and a statewide strike occurred. A special convention of the FEA voted to approve a resolution which condemned the increases as inadequate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Selden_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Selden-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> In February 1968, FEA president <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Jane_Arnold&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jane Arnold (page does not exist)\">Jane Arnold</a> said the state association would support local teachers if they walked off the job.

Since strikes were illegal, what actually happened were mass resignations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Schools closed in roughly two-thirds of Florida's counties. Many individual schools closed in those districts which managed to remain open and functioning. At the height of the strike, 25,712 educators\u2014about 40 percent of the state's teachers\u2014walked out.\n</p><p>The impact of the strike was not uniform, however. Strikes lasted only a few days in some districts, while in others teachers walked picket lines for weeks. In Pinellas County, the local education association stayed out for six weeks, and some small groups of teachers struck for as long as three months.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strike_8-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strike-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Gov. Kirk and the legislature stood firm, however, and refused to appropriate more money or raise taxes further.\n</p><p>Local school districts began taking action to break the strike. Arnold and other FEA leaders were threatened with arrest. Tornillo was fined $30,000 and given a two-year jail term (which, after appeal, he was not forced to serve). School districts hired substitute teachers as <a href=\"/wiki/Strike_action#&quot;Scab&quot;\" title=\"Strike action\">strikebreakers</a>, and local businesses paid their employees to teach classes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strike_8-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strike-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Most teachers went back after only a few weeks, when it became clear that public support for the teachers, weak at the beginning of the strike, had shrunk dramatically. \"'We thought they (the public) would be with us,' Arnold said. 'We thought it would unite the community and the teachers. It did a little bit of the opposite. ... A lot of teachers lost their innocence. They thought the community liked them.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Strike_8-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Strike-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Local education associations began to negotiate their own settlements, often agreeing to not challenge school districts for terminating the most militant teachers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Selden_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Selden-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> By the end of March, nearly all teachers were back at work, and the strike was over.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Assessment_of_the_strike\">Assessment of the strike</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Florida_statewide_teachers%27_strike_of_1968&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Assessment of the strike\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The strike was the nation's first statewide teachers' strike, keeping more than 40 percent of Florida teachers at home.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Education funding rose significantly, but the organization felt that it did not rise enough to meet the needs identified by the teachers. From this perspective, the strike was not a success. However, FEA did obtain much higher funding for education and convinced Gov. Kirk to break his no-new-taxes pledge.\n</p><p>The strike had a profound effect on the national NEA. Following the 1968 Florida strike, delegates to the NEA Representative Assembly (the organization's national governing body) approved a resolution which\u2014for the first time\u2014sanctioned teacher strikes (calling them \"withdrawal of services\") and denouncing state attempts to ban them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> The resolution was a direct outcome of the statewide Florida strike.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A longer-term effect of the strike was to dramatically improve the outlook for teachers' unions in Florida. FEA members were radicalized by the strike and the statewide federation later won significant court and legislative victories which legalized and promoted the formation of teacher and education unions in the state. Although the 1968 strike would lead to the fragmentation of the FEA in 1974, education unions merged back into one organization in 2000, and as of 2006 unions were recognized in school districts covering 90 percent of the state's education workers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> FEA is now one of Florida's largest unions, and the second-largest in the <a href=\"/wiki/Florida_AFL-CIO\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Florida AFL-CIO\">Florida AFL-CIO</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Florida_statewide_teachers%27_strike_of_1968&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Notes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"It was the nation's first statewide walkout of public-school teachers.\" \"Walkout in Florida\", <i>Time</i>, March 1, 1968.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The claim of 'first statewide teachers' strike in U.
