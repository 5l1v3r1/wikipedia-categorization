The Education Museum (Malay: Muzium Pendidikan) is a museum in Melaka City, Melaka, Malaysia.    The museum building was built in 1884 during British Malaya. In 1931, it housed the Melaka High School. Due to the growing number of student intake, the school had to be relocated to Chan Koon Cheng Street. The building then housed the Melaka Labour and Audit Department until 1978. After that, the department relocated to the Federal Building at Hang Tuah Street and the building was left vacant. In 2003, the building underwent renovation and the Melaka Museum Corporation proposed to the Melaka State Government to convert the building into the Museum of Education due to its historical past of housing the Melaka High School.  The building design is a mix of British, Dutch, Moorish and Anglo-Chinese architecture styles. The windows are of Dutch design with no wind holes, using British materials and bricks and Indian double-layered roof and roof tiles The museum exhibits the historical development of the Melaka education system since Melaka Sultanate, British Malaya, Japanese occupation up to present time.
