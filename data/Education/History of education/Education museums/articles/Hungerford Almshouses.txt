The Hungerford Almshouses in Corsham, Wiltshire, England, were built in 1668 for Lady Margaret Hungerford of Corsham Court. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.  It was founded to provide homes for six (later eight) poor people and education for ten children. In 1802, Edward Hasted was given the Mastership of The Hungerford Almshouses by his friend William Bouverie, who had become Earl of Radnor in 1765. Hasted remained Master of the Almshouse from 1807 until his death in 1812. The site is also known as Lady Margaret Hungerford Almshouses & Schoolroom and Corsham Almshouses & 17th Century Schoolroom.  The complex includes the 17th-century almshouses, the schoolroom with original 17th-century furnishings and an exhibit room, the warden's house and stables.   Margaret Hungerford was the daughter of William Holliday, a wealthy London merchant and alderman, and the widow of Sir Edward Hungerford.
