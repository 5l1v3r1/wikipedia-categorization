  openSAP is an Enterprise MOOC platform for massive open online courses, or MOOCs. It is provided by SAP and hosted at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany. Everyone can enroll in openSAP courses, which are provided free of charge. While the MOOC concept is already quite popular in academia, SAP is one of the first companies to build a platform dedicated to MOOCs and adopt it for business-related training purposes. Compared to traditional e-learning formats, openSAP courses return to tried and trusted classroom concepts and transfer them to an online medium in the following way: The average duration of the video lectures is 90 minutes per week. Combined with additional self-study and homework, the average effort required to complete an openSAP course successfully is four to six hours per week. This makes it easy for students to combine courses with their other responsibilities. The first openSAP course, Introduction to Software Development on SAP HANA, was held from May 27 through July 15, 2013. Peer assessment features as an element in many openSAP courses around design and development.
