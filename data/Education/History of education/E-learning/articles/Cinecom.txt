www.cinecom.net Cinecom is a video production company founded in 2012 by Jordy Vandeput. Started as a local business producing commercials and corporate films, it took a new turn in 2014 by focusing on the international market with educational videos. As video content creators, Jordy and his team are active on the YouTube and Udemy platform. What started out as a hobby, making online tutorials became part of the Cinecom business. Like most Youtubers, Jordy saw an exponential increase of subscribers and viewers without having a goal. But as the channel grew, so did the company and its revenue. These new incomes made it possible for Yannick Teunissen joining the team in 2016 as editor and cameraman for the YouTube series. In the beginning of Jordy's career, in 2012, he was an instructor at Envato Tuts+, which is an online e-learning website. Making over 24 courses about video editing and film making techniques, he quit to start his own project under the name Cinecom.net in 2014. The website was first a gateway to sell the course Getting Started with Adobe Premiere Pro, which is hosted on e-learning platform Udemy. Later also came Learn color correction with Premiere Pro Lumetri, which is the bestseller under color correction courses. In 2017, together with the launch of 5 Day Deal, Cinecom introduced a new course to help beginners to start filmmaking with DSLR's. Today Cinecom is an active organisation making courses on Udemy, weekly tutorials on YouTube and writing articles on the website and trading name Cinecom.net.
