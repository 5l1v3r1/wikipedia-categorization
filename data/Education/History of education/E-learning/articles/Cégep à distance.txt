 Cégep à distance is a distance-education CEGEP that offers services which are complementary to those offered by the CEGEP network. It welcomes a diverse student body, many of whom come from the CEGEP network. Cégep à distance was created in 1991 by the Collège de Rosemont which had been mandated by the Ministère de l'Éducation to develop a distance education CEGEP.
