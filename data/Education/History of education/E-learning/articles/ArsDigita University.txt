ArsDigita University (ADU) was a one-year, intensive post-baccalaureate program in Computer Science based on the undergraduate course of study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was financed and supported by the ArsDigita Foundation, a non-profit organization begun by ArsDigita Corporation.  The majority of the instructors were professors from MIT and the program was tuition free. After running from September 2000 through July 2001, seeing the first class to graduation, the dissolution of the ArsDigita Foundation forced the program to shut down. Most of the course lectures were videotaped.  The tapes and other course materials are available free under the Open Content License from aduni.org, a website maintained by the alumni of the university. That site exists to carry on the school's mission of supplying free education, and streams ~150GB/month of lectures to thousands of people around the world.  A 4-DVD set containing the videos and course materials (problem sets, exams, solution sets, and course notes) is also available for a fee.  The tapes were made available on Google Video in 2008 allowing easier and more flexible access.
