Coeducation in Kuwait has been a contentious issue since the Islamists gained slight power in parliament in the 1996. However, the government has opposed the ban and does not adopt the ban thus certain universities are still co-ed.  In 2008, MP Ali Al-Rashid proposed a bill that would reverse the 12-year-old ban on coeducation.  On the topic, Al-Rashid said: "Kuwait University was established in the 1960s as a co-ed university. Segregating students only came in 1996. If we are to go back to the origin of things, Kuwait University then is originally a co-ed facility. Religion is clear about this subject."  According to Al-Rashid, university teachers and officials have complained it has been difficult and costly to teach male and female students separately.  In 2013, the  legal and legislative committee of the Kuwaiti parliament endorsed a proposal that reverses the ban at all public and private universities in the country.  In 2015, Laws regarding segregation in universities were overturned on the basis of wrongful implementation. The original law only stated “Student attire, behavior and activities shall be according to Islamic values”.
