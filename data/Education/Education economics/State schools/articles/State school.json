education is inclusive, both in its treatment of students and in that enfranchisement for the government of public education is as broad as for government generally. It is often organised and operated to be a deliberate model of the civil community in which it functions. Although typically provided to groups of students in classrooms in a central school, it may be provided in-home, employing visiting teachers, and/or supervising teachers. It can also be provided in non-school, non-home settings, such as shopping mall space.\n</p><p>State education is generally available to all. In most countries, it is compulsory for children to attend school up to a certain age, but the option of attending private school is open to many. In the case of <a href=\"/wiki/Private_school\" title=\"Private school\">private schooling</a>, schools operate independently of the state and generally defray their costs (or even make a profit) by charging parents <a href=\"/wiki/Tuition_payments\" title=\"Tuition payments\">tuition fees</a>. The funding for state schools, on the other hand, is provided by tax revenues, so that even individuals who do not attend school (or whose dependents do not attend school) help to ensure that society is educated. In poverty stricken societies, authorities are often lax on compulsory school attendance because <a href=\"/wiki/Child_labour\" title=\"Child labour\">child labour</a> is exploited. It is these same children whose income-securing labour cannot be forfeited to allow for school attendance.\n</p><p>The term \"public education\" when applied to state schools is not synonymous with the term \"publicly funded education\". Government may make a public policy decision that it wants to have some financial resources distributed in support of, and it may want to have some control over, the provision of private education. Grants-in-aid of private schools and vouchers systems provide examples of publicly funded private education. Conversely, a state school (including one run by a school district) may rely heavily on private funding such as high fees or private donations and still be considered state by virtue of governmental ownership and control.\n</p><p>State primary and secondary education often involves the following:\n</p>\n<ol><li><a href=\"/wiki/Compulsory_education\" title=\"Compulsory education\">compulsory student attendance</a> (until a certain age or standard is achieved);</li>\n<li>certification of teachers and curricula, either by the government or by a teachers' organisation;</li>\n<li>testing and standards provided by government.</li></ol>\n<p>In some countries (such as Germany), private associations or churches can operate schools according to their own principles, as long as they comply with certain state requirements. When these specific requirements are met, especially in the area of the school curriculum, the schools will qualify to receive state funding. They are then treated financially and for accreditation purposes as part of the state education system, even though they make decisions about hiring and school policy (not hiring atheists, for example), which the state might not make itself.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_country_and_region\">By country and region</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=State_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: By country and region\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_education_articles_by_country\" title=\"List of education articles by country\">List of education articles by country</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Australia\">Australia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=State_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Australia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Australia\" title=\"Education in Australia\">Education in Australia</a></div>\n<p>Government schools (also known as public schools) are free to attend for Australian citizens and permanent residents, whereas independent schools usually charge attendance fees.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> They can be divided into two categories: open and <a href=\"/wiki/Selective_school\" title=\"Selective school\">selective schools</a>.

In larger cities such as <a href=\"/wiki/Dhaka\" title=\"Dhaka\">Dhaka</a>, however, this is fairly uncommon.

Junior kindergarten (or equivalent) exists as an official program in only Ontario and Quebec while kindergarten (or equivalent) is available in every province, but provincial funding and the level of hours provided varies widely. Starting at grade one, at about age six, there is universal Crown-funded access up to grade twelve (or equivalent). Schools are generally divided into elementary schools (kindergarten to Grade 6), junior high schools (Grades 7 to 9), and high schools (Grades 10 to 12). However, in many areas <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_school#Canada\" title=\"Middle school\">middle schools</a> are also provided and in some schools, particularly in rural areas, the elementary and middle levels can be combined into one school. In 2003, Grade 13 (also known as the Ontario Academic Credit or \"OAC\" year) was eliminated in Ontario; it had previously been required only for students who intended to go on to university. Children are required to attend school until the age of sixteen in most provinces, while students in Ontario and New Brunswick must attend schools until the age of eighteen.\n</p><p>Some Canadian provinces offer segregated-by-religious-choice, but nonetheless Crown-funded and Crown-regulated, religiously based education. In <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a>, for example, Roman Catholic schools are known as \"Catholic school\" or \"Separate school\", not \"Public school\", although these are, by definition, no less \"public\" than their secular counterparts.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"People.27s_Republic_of_China\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"People's_Republic_of_China\">People's Republic of China</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=State_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: People&#039;s Republic of China\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Education in the People&#39;s Republic of China\">Education in the People's Republic of China</a></div>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/China\" title=\"China\">the PRC</a>, state schools are funded and administered by the education sector within the government. Although some, especially high schools, have started to charge a fair portion of parents of students an additional tuition fee, due to the increased places offered by the schools in recent years. Top state schools are often very selective, however. Students who miss their entrance requirement may still gain places if they meet a relatively lower requirement and their parents are willing to pay for the additional fees. Some parents appreciate the idea as they may send their children to good schools even though they may not be academically qualified, while others believe that it is not fair for someone who has a background of poverty.\n</p><p>The public spending on schools in China has been uneven due to insufficient investment in education.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> This condition is in favor of urban schools and it is promoted by past policies such as the mandate for rural public schools to have a higher student-to-teacher ratio.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-6\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The inequality of resources is exacerbated by the way public schools in urban areas enjoy more support since local governments have more developed economies. Aside from the disparity between urban and rural public schools, there was also the dichotomized system adopted since 1978, which divided schools into two groups: <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_China#Key_schools\" title=\"Education in China\">key schools</a> (<i>zhongdianxiao</i>) and non-key schools (<i>putongxiao</i>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-6\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Key schools receive more funding due to the goal of developing first-class education in a limited number of schools in a short period of time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-6\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The key school system was canceled by the 2006 amendment to the Compulsory Education Law, along with the introduction of reforms that address education inequality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Denmark\">Denmark</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=State_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Denmark\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Denmark\" title=\"Education in Denmark\">Education in Denmark</a></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Denmark\" title=\"Denmark\">Danish</a> School system is supported today by tax-based <a href=\"/wiki/Government\" title=\"Government\">governmental</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Municipalities_of_Denmark\" title=\"Municipalities of Denmark\">municipal</a> funding from <a href=\"/wiki/Danish_pre-school_education\" title=\"Danish pre-school education\">day care</a> through primary and <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_education_in_Denmark\" title=\"Secondary education in Denmark\">secondary education</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Denmark#Post-secondary_education\" title=\"Education in Denmark\">higher education</a> and there are no <a href=\"/wiki/Tuition_payments\" title=\"Tuition payments\">tuition fees</a> for regular students in public schools and <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Denmark\" title=\"List of universities and colleges in Denmark\">universities</a>.\n</p><p>The Danish public <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_school\" title=\"Primary school\">primary schools</a>, covering the entire period of compulsory education, are called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Danish_Folkeskole_Education\" title=\"Danish Folkeskole Education\">folkeskoler</a></i> (literally 'people's schools' or 'public schools').

Students who graduate from Hauptschule or Realschule continue their schooling at a vocational school until they have full job qualifications.\nThis type of German school, the <i>Berufsschule</i>, is generally an upper-secondary public vocational school, controlled by the German federal government.

The school leaving exam of this type of school, the <i>Fachhochschulreife</i>, enables the graduate to start studying at a <a href=\"/wiki/Fachhochschule\" title=\"Fachhochschule\">Fachhochschule</a> (polytechnic), and in <a href=\"/wiki/Hesse\" title=\"Hesse\">Hesse</a> also at a university within the state.

These schools are usually free of charge.\n</p><p>In Germany, most institutions of higher education are subsidised by German states and are therefore also referred to as <i>staatliche Hochschulen.</i> (public universities) In most German states, admission to public universities is still cheap, about two hundred Euro per semester. In 2005, many states introduced additional fees of 500 Euro per semester to achieve a better teaching-quality; however, all of these states (except Lower Saxony, which will follow in 2014/15) have abolished tuition fees as of autumn 2013.

Instead, the term \"public school\" is used for elementary, middle, and high schools funded and/or run by a governmental entity. \"Private school\" generally refers to primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions that are not government-owned; in practice the term is generally used to refer to non-sectarian schools.\n</p><p>Elementary, middle, and high schools that are operated by a religious organisation are commonly called \"<a href=\"/wiki/Parochial_school\" title=\"Parochial school\">parochial schools</a>\" (though, in practice, the term is generally used to refer only to schools operated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Catholic Church in the United States\">Catholic Church</a> or some other mainline denomination; the term \"Christian school\" is generally used to refer to schools operated by Evangelical, Pentecostal/Charismatic, or Fundamentalist Christian churches).\n</p><p>The role of the federal government in education is limited and indirect. Direct control of education is a power reserved to the states under the <a href=\"/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\">Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> because the Constitution does not explicitly or implicitly give the federal government authority to regulate education. However, any public or private school that accepts educational funding from the federal government, including participation in collegiate federal financial aid programs (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Pell_Grant\" title=\"Pell Grant\">Pell Grants</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Stafford_Loan\" title=\"Stafford Loan\">Stafford Loans</a>), by accepting the funds or participating in a particular federal program, subjects itself to federal jurisdiction to the extent of that participation.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education\" title=\"United States Department of Education\">United States Department of Education</a> supervises the role of the federal government in education. Direct regulation of public, private and parochial schools is done by state and territorial governments, in <a href=\"/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\" title=\"Washington, D.C.\">Washington, D.C.</a>, by the District Government. Broad regulation of public schools is typically accomplished through a <a href=\"/wiki/State_education_agency\" title=\"State education agency\">state education agency</a> and a state department of education. There is usually a Superintendent (education)|state superintendent of schools, who is appointed or elected to co-ordinate the state department of education, the state <i>board</i> of education, and the state legislature itself. Statewide education policies are disseminated to school \"districts\" or their equivalents. They are associated with counties, or with groups of counties, but their boundaries are not necessarily coterminous with county boundaries.  The intermediate school districts encompass many local school districts.  The local school districts operate with their own local boards, which oversee operations of the individual schools within their jurisdiction.\n</p><p>In most states, the county or regional \"intermediate\" school districts merely implement state education policy and provide the channels through which a local district communicates with a state board of education, state superintendent, and department of education. They do not establish county or regional policies of their own.\n</p><p>Local <a href=\"/wiki/School_district\" title=\"School district\">school districts</a> are administered by local <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_education\" title=\"Board of education\">school boards</a>, which operate public <a href=\"/wiki/Elementary_school\" title=\"Elementary school\">elementary</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_school\" title=\"Secondary school\">high schools</a> within their boundaries. Public schools are often funded by local taxpayers, and most school boards are elected. However, some states have adopted new funding models that are not dependent upon the local economy.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg/220px-Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg/330px-Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg/440px-Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2592\" data-file-height=\"1944\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Seattle_-_Seward_School_01.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Seward School, <a href=\"/wiki/Seattle,_Washington\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seattle, Washington\">Seattle, Washington</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Public schools are provided mainly by local governments. Curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards by jurisdiction over school districts. The school districts are <a href=\"/wiki/Special_district_(United_States)\" title=\"Special district (United States)\">special-purpose districts</a> authorised by provisions of state law. Generally, state governments set minimum standards relating to almost all activities of elementary and high schools, as well as funding and authorisation to enact local school taxes to support the schools, primarily through real property taxes. The federal government funds aid to states and school districts that meet minimum federal standards. School accreditation decisions are made by voluntary regional associations. The first free public school in America was the <a href=\"/wiki/Syms-Eaton_Academy\" title=\"Syms-Eaton Academy\">Syms-Eaton Academy</a> (1634) in <a href=\"/wiki/Hampton,_Virginia\" title=\"Hampton, Virginia\">Hampton, Virginia</a>, and the first tax-supported public school in America was in <a href=\"/wiki/Dedham,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Dedham, Massachusetts\">Dedham, Massachusetts</a>, founded by <a href=\"/wiki/Ralph_Wheelock\" title=\"Ralph Wheelock\">Rev.

In addition, some elementary schools are splitting into two levels, sometimes in separate buildings: <a href=\"/wiki/Elementary_school\" title=\"Elementary school\">elementary school</a> (usually K-2) and intermediate (3-5).\n</p><p>The K-8 format is also an emerging popular concept in which students may attend only two schools for all of their K-12 education. Many <a href=\"/wiki/Charter_school\" title=\"Charter school\">charter schools</a> feature the K-8 format in which all elementary grades are housed in one section of the school, and the traditional junior high school students are housed in another section of the school. Some very small school districts, primarily in rural areas, still maintain a K-12 system in which all students are housed in a single school.  A few 7-12 schools also exist.\n</p><p>In the United States, institutions of <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">higher education</a> that are operated and subsidised by the <a href=\"/wiki/U.S._state\" title=\"U.S. state\">states</a> are also referred to as \"public.\" However, unlike public high schools, <a href=\"/wiki/Public_university\" title=\"Public university\">public universities</a> charge tuition, but fees are usually much lower than those charged by <a href=\"/wiki/Private_university\" title=\"Private university\">private universities</a>, particularly for students who meet in-state residency criteria. <a href=\"/wiki/Community_college\" title=\"Community college\">Community colleges</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/State_university_system\" title=\"State university system\">state colleges</a>, and state universities are examples of public institutions of higher education. In particular, many state universities are regarded as among the best institutions of higher education in the US but usually are surpassed in ranking by certain private universities and colleges, such as those of the <a href=\"/wiki/Ivy_League\" title=\"Ivy League\">Ivy League</a>, which are often very expensive and extremely selective in the students they accept.
