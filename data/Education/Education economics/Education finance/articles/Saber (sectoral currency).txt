The Saber (Portuguese for to know) currency is a proposal  of an educational sectoral currency initially presented in Brazil. It would be handed out by the ministry of education. The currency is given for free to pupils, who can use it to buy education from older pupils. The currency propagates from lower grades to higher grades in schools and finally propagates to universities where it is used to buy education from the state. At this point it is collected and returned to the ministry. The duration the currency remains valid is limited in order to encourage fast propagation of the currency, and ensure that the number of students arriving in any university doesn't exceed the capacity to handle them.
