Student loan deferment is an agreement between the student and lender that the student may reduce or postpone repayment of a student loan for a designated period.   Deferment or forbearance  will prevent the loan from going into default, but may increase the overall cost of the loan.  If the student is experiencing financial hardship or is unemployed, he or she may be eligible for deferment.  The lender may require valid proof of financial hardship and other financial information when the student applies.
