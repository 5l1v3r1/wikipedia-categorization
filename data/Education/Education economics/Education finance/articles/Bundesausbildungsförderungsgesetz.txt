The Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz (mostly known by its abbreviation BAföG) is Germany's Federal Training Assistance Act for students at secondary schools and universities in Germany. Since its introduction in 1971, it has regulated federal student grants and loans. Students who receive loans and grants under this law refer to it by saying they "receive BAföG". In 2012, 24% of all students in Germany received financial support via BAföG.
