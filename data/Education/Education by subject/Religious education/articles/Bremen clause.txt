The Bremen clause (German: Bremer Klausel) is Article 141 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which states: The first sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 7 shall not apply in any state in which, on January 1, 1949, state law provides otherwise. The sentence there cited says: Religious instruction shall form part of the regular curriculum in state schools, with the exception of non-denominational schools. It limits the range of application of the constitutional (Basic Law) rule over religious education, making it possible to have other types of instruction in some areas of Germany. A well-known example is the "instruction in Biblical history" in Bremen. It is not religious education in the sense of the Basic Law, because its content is not accountable to a religious community; therefore it is not a "common affair" (res mixta).
