of industrial and commercial activity in the United Kingdom and other countries in the course of the nineteenth century. This, and the impact on the working and living conditions of the populations affected, had been making demands for the building of factories, warehouses, offices, educational establishments, hospitals, housing, places of recreation and entertainment and places for religious and other purposes. With that came demands upon architectural practitioners for designs for buildings of all kinds, qualities and standards, for the supervision of the construction of works, and in some cases for making planning schemes for area development or redevelopment, of greater or lesser extent; sometimes collaborating with other branches of the construction professions, notably <a href=\"/wiki/Surveying\" title=\"Surveying\">surveyors</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_engineers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil engineers\">civil engineers</a> and, as the period progressed, <a href=\"/wiki/Structural_engineering\" title=\"Structural engineering\">structural engineers</a>, and those engaged in\n<a href=\"/wiki/Mechanical_engineering\" title=\"Mechanical engineering\">mechanical engineering</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Electrical_engineering\" title=\"Electrical engineering\">electrical engineering</a>.

The abolition of this system was announced in 1906, and, as a partial substitute, it was decided to hold an annual examination in Peking of Chinese educated abroad.</i></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><i>The majority of examinations in western countries are derived from the university examinations of the middle ages. The first universities of Europe consisted of corporations of teachers and of students analogous to the trade gilds and merchant gilds of the time.

No one was admitted to mastership until he had served his apprenticeship, nor, as a rule, until he had shown that he could accomplish a piece of work to the satisfaction of the gild.</i></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><i>The object of the universities was to teach; and to the three classes established by the gild correspond roughly to the scholar, the bachelor or pupil-teacher, and the master or doctor (two terms at first equivalent) who, having first served his apprenticeship and passed a definite technical test, had received permission to teach...</i></dd></dl>\n<p>After a survey of the development of examination practice in the universities of western Europe up to the early 20c., the next section of professional examinations began with the remark \"University examinations for degrees having ceased to be used as technical tests of teaching capacity, new examinations have been devised for this purpose\". For examinations in Medicine, the article referred the reader to the article on Medical Education, and this section concluded with a single paragraph headed Other Professions, stating that a system of professional examinations carried on by other professional bodies, in some cases with legal sanction, was developed in England during the nineteenth century; and, in a list of subjects described as \"the most important\" mentioned \"architecture (Royal Institute of British Architects )\", along with: <a href=\"/wiki/Accountancy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Accountancy\">accountancy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Actuary\" title=\"Actuary\">actuarial work</a>, music, <a href=\"/wiki/Pharmacy\" title=\"Pharmacy\">pharmacy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Plumbing\" title=\"Plumbing\">plumbing</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Surveying\" title=\"Surveying\">surveying</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Veterinary_medicine\" title=\"Veterinary medicine\">veterinary medicine</a>, technical subjects, e.g. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cotton-spinning&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Cotton-spinning (page does not exist)\">cotton-spinning</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Dyeing\" title=\"Dyeing\">dyeing</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Motor_manufacturing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Motor manufacturing (page does not exist)\">motor manufacturing</a>, commercial subjects, <a href=\"/wiki/Shorthand\" title=\"Shorthand\">shorthand</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Engineering\" title=\"Engineering\">engineering</a> (civil, mechanical and electrical).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"As_at_1929\">As at 1929</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Architectural_education_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: As at 1929\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Publication of the fourteenth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica in 1929 happened shortly before the Board of Architectural Education was constituted under the Act of 1931.

The opening sentence was:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>Underlying the system of architectural education at present established in most Western countries is the assumption that architecture is one of the fine arts, and that the prime object of the training which the architect should receive is to equip him as a creative artist in building.</i></dd></dl>\n<p>That could be compared with the words of the charter which had been granted to the RIBA in 1837, in which the purpose of the Institute was described as:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>... for the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith; it being an art esteemed and encouraged in all enlightened nations, as tending greatly to promote the domestic convenience of citizens, and the public improvement and embellishment of towns and cities...</i></dd></dl>\n<p>When the present supplemental charter was granted in 1971, part of the first charter was revoked but the words quoted were retained.\n</p><p>In the meantime Professor Budden's article of 1929 included the following:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>... it is generally agreed that the study of architecture should be preceded by a <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_education\" title=\"Liberal education\">liberal education</a>.

It mentioned that the largest school of architecture in England was that of the <a href=\"/wiki/Architectural_Association\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Architectural Association\">Architectural Association</a> (London) and the next that of Liverpool University, and explained the part played by the RIBA:\n</p>\n<dl><dd><i>From its foundation in 1835 the Royal Institute of British Architects has been the supreme controlling authority of the profession throughout the empire. At no time, however, has the RIBA itself undertaken the teaching of architecture. But by setting up, in the latter half of the last century [19c.], a centralized system of examinations when no professional tests existed in the country, it performed a notable service in raising the general level of professional knowledge.
