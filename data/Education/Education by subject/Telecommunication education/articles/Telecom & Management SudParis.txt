Telecom refers to: A short name for any telecommunications world company with "Telecom" or "Telekom" specifically in the name, where context allows media or people to commonly exclude the rest of its name without confusion, often resulting from a monopoly or previous monopoly. The term is now trademarked by various companies in their local jurisdiction, although usually with a qualifier of locality (e.g. 'Deutsche' Telekom ), since 1985. In some countries, (e.g. New Zealand) the word TELECOM on its own is a registered trade mark.
