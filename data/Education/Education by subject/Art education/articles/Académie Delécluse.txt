The Académie Delécluse was an atelier-style art school in Paris, France, founded in the late 19th century by the painter Auguste Joseph Delécluse. It was exceptionally supportive of women artists, with more space being given to women students than to men. The academy was founded by the French painter Auguste Joseph Delécluse (1855-1928) and seems to have been in business by 1884.  It moved several times before establishing a permanent location in Montparnasse on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs.   Like the Académie Julian, Académie Colarossi, and Académie Vitti, it accepted women students. Men and women were trained separately, and it had two studios for women and only one for men.  It proved to be particularly popular among English  and American  women artists. During its heyday, it was one of the four best-known ateliers in Paris,  but its influence and ability to attract good students waned in the early 20th century. Among its faculty were Edward Frederick Ertz, Svend Rasmussen Svendsen, Georges Callot, Paul Delance, and Delécluse himself. Notable students included Gertrude Partington Albright, Nathaniel Choate, Colin Campbell Cooper, Emma Lampert Cooper, Jenny Eakin Delony, Simon Elwes, Agnes Goodsir, Harold Harvey, Sarah Noble Ives, Andrew Law, Blanche Lazzell, Harry Leith-Ross, Anna Lownes, Cedric Morris, Hilda Rix Nicholas,  Roland Hinton Perry, and Edith Somerville.
