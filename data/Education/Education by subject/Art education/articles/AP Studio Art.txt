AP Studio Art is a series of Advanced Placement Courses divided into three different categories: AP Studio Art Drawing, AP Studio Art 2D Design, and AP Studio Art 3D Design. Unlike traditional AP Exams that utilize a multiple-choice section, free response section, and occasionally an audio section, the AP Studio Art Exam is a portfolio that encompasses 3 different categories: Quality, Concentration, and Breadth.  Depending on the AP Studio Art exam the person is taking, the components for each of the 3 categories will vary.  Regardless of the exam, all AP Studio Art portfolios have to be turned in by a set date and time, for example, 12:00pm on May 11, 2007 for the 2007 exam.
