Teaching artists, also known as art teachers or artist educators or community artists, are professional artists who supplement their incomes by teaching and integrating their art form, perspectives, and skills into a wide range of settings, such as by showing kids how to make clay mugs with faces in local libraries and elementary schools. Teaching artists work with schools, after school programs, community agencies, prisons, jails, and social service agencies. The Arts In Education movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.  Arts learning consultant Eric Booth has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as "a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about the arts.‚Äù  This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields.  Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.    On April 16, 2011 the Association of Teaching Artists convened the First National Teaching Artists Forum. The forum was held at The Center for Arts Education in New York City with nearly fifty participants.
