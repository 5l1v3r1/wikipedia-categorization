Peacebuilding is both the theory and practice of identifying the conditions that can lead to a sustainable peace between those who have previously been adversaries, and assisting adversaries to move towards a sustainable peace. In the Middle East, common environmental challenges have been identified as a basis for regional cooperation and peacebuilding.  A small Middle Eastern civil society network reaches across adversarial boundaries to promote and practice environmental cooperation.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Peacebuilding\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Peacebuilding</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Environmental_peacebuilding\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Environmental peacebuilding</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Environmental_peacebuilding_in_the_Middle_East\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Organizations_involved_in_environmental_peacebuilding_in_the_Middle_East\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Israel-Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#EcoPeace_/_Friends_of_the_Earth_Middle_East\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Arava_Institute_for_Environmental_Studies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arava Institute for Environmental Studies</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Peacebuilding\">Peacebuilding</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Environmental_peacebuilding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Peacebuilding\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The study of <a href=\"/wiki/Peacebuilding\" title=\"Peacebuilding\">peacebuilding</a> (a term coined by Galtung, 1975)<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> develops from interest in identifying the conditions that lead beyond a temporary cessation of violence to sustainable processes of conflict management and mutual cooperation between those who have previously been adversaries.

At the most basic level, warfare devastates ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on natural resources, and the anarchy of conflict situations leads to the uncontrolled, destructive exploitation of natural resources.  Preventing these impacts allows for an easier movement to a sustainable peace.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  From a more positive perspective, environmental cooperation can be one of the places where hostile parties can sustain a dialogue, and sustainable development is a prerequisite for a sustainable peace.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Conca and Wallace<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> note the relationship between environmental peacebuilding projects and studies of environment and conflict.  They observe that environmental challenges may be opportunities for peacebuilding, but they may also harden differences and reinforce conflict.  Environmental challenges are also usually complexly interconnected to economic and governance challenges.  Environmental issues are now routinely acknowledged as aspects of conflicts, and are necessarily part of the movement towards conflict management and the transformation of conflictual relations into peaceful ones.  \n</p><p>The United Nations Environment Programme has placed environmental conflict and cooperation on its agenda,<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> conducted environmental assessments of conflict zones and has recommended<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> a stronger integration of environmental issues into the work of the UN Peacebuilding Commission.   \"Land and Environment\" is one of the ten themes of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.peacebuildingportal.org/index.asp?pgid=3&amp;undb_orgfocus=6\">United Nations Peacebuilding Portal.</a> The University for Peace, sponsored by the United Nations, includes <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.upeace.org/academic/masters/ESP.cfm\">\u201cEnvironmental Security and Peace\u201d</a> as one of its eight graduate programs. \n</p><p>Governmental and civil society organizations have also explored the role of environmental issues in peacebuilding.

The conference established working groups on refugees, regional security, economic development, water, and environment.  The working groups on water and environment, and to some extent the one on economic development as well, had the agenda of bringing environmental cooperation and sustainable development into the formulation of a path to a sustainable \nMiddle East peace.    \n</p><p>The subsequent Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Peace treaty between Jordan and Israel each had sections that envisioned joint committees on water, environmental cooperation and economic development.  When negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority stalled and relations again became strongly adversarial, progress towards cooperation on water, the environment and sustainable development also stalled.  At the formal level there are contacts across adversarial lines between government officials and experts, water infrastructure was kept out of the violence of the Second Intifadah, and there is some degree of cooperation \u2013 not widely publicized - on urgent water and environmental concerns.  Cooperative relations between Jordan and Israel have been maintained but progress is limited by the effects of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  \n</p><p>Diplomatic work on environmental peacebuilding in the region has been supplemented by the development of a small network of civil society organizations that promote and practice regional environmental cooperation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Organizations_involved_in_environmental_peacebuilding_in_the_Middle_East\">Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Environmental_peacebuilding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Israel-Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information\">Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Environmental_peacebuilding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Israel/Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information\">IPCRI</a> opened in 1989 during the first Intifada under joint Israeli and Palestinian directors.

The IPCRI Water and Environment division took the lead in organizing a 2004 Israeli-Palestinian International \"Water for Life\" Conference, co-chaired by Israeli and Palestinian professors, held in Turkey, where over five days about 130 participants from the region were joined by about 50 international water experts. \n</p><p>Subsequently, working with Israeli and Palestinian experts, IPCRI undertook a study of the management of the <a href=\"/wiki/Trans-boundary_river\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trans-boundary river\">trans-boundary</a> Nahal Alexander / Wadi Zomer basin.

These projects have included developing a center for sustainable agriculture, developing policy options for the Dead Sea, transboundary stream restoration, and a study of health effects from exposure to airborne particles.  These projects involve links to international networks of research funding, and have brought regional conferences to the institute on a regular basis.   The institute has co-sponsored a conference on alternative energy and the supported the development of the solar power oriented Arava Power Corporation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Environmental_peacebuilding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Arava_Institute_for_Environmental_Studies\" title=\"Arava Institute for Environmental Studies\">Arava Institute for Environmental Studies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth_Middle_East\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friends of the Earth Middle East\">Friends of the Earth Middle East</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Human_security\" title=\"Human security\">Human security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Madrid_Conference_of_1991\" title=\"Madrid Conference of 1991\">Madrid Conference of 1991</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Oslo_Accords\" title=\"Oslo Accords\">Oslo Declaration of Principles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Peace\" title=\"Peace\">Peace</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Peacebuilding\" title=\"Peacebuilding\">Peacebuilding</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/UNEP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UNEP\">UNEP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/University_for_Peace\" title=\"University for Peace\">University for Peace</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_International_Center_for_Scholars\" title=\"Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\">Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Environmental_peacebuilding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Galtung, Johan. 1975.  \"Three approaches to peace: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding.\" In Peace, War and Defence - Essays in Peace Research Vol. 2, 282-304.
