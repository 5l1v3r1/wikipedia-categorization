The International Summer School Marktoberdorf is an annual two-week summer school for international computer science and mathematics postgraduate students and other young researchers, held annually since 1970 in Marktoberdorf, near Munich in southern Germany.   Students are accommodated in the boarding house of a local high school, Gymnasium Marktoberdorf.  Proceedings are published when appropriate.  This is a summer school for theoretical computer science researchers,  with some directors/co-directors who are ACM Turing Award winners (the nearest equivalent to the Nobel Prize in computer science).  The summer school is supported as an Advanced Study Institute of the NATO Science for Peace and Security Program.  It is administered by the Faculty of Informatics at the Technical University of Munich.  Past academic directors and co-directors include: * ACM Turing Award winners.
