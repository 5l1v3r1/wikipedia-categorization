CS50 (Computer Science 50) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science from Harvard and, as of 2015, Yale Universities. And, as of 2016, available in high schools as an AP course. The course material is available for free with a range of certificates available for a fee. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular hackathons.   CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including iTunes U, edX (where it is known as CS50x), Coursera, and YouTube. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the cloud. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in virtual reality.  Professor David Malan has been called one of the world's better-known computer science educators.  Both Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and former Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer have given guest lectures.
