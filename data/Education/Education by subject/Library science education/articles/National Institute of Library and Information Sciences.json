Up to the year 2000 only <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Kelaniya\" title=\"University of Kelaniya\">University of Kelaniya</a> provided degree and postgraduate courses at university level in the field. With the establishment of NILIS, the postgraduate and general training facilities in the field has been expanded. The primary objective of the institute is to train the human resources required for the huge <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=School_library_sector&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"School library sector (page does not exist)\">school library sector</a> in the country. In addition it has been empowered by the NILIS Ordinance of 1999 to conduct other postgraduate programmes in the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_and_information_science\" title=\"Library and information science\">Library and Information Science</a> (LIS) field and produce the necessary high quality human resources for universities, research institutes, government departments, local government authorities and other library and information sectors in the country. Another major objective is to develop a <a href=\"/wiki/Continuing_professional_development\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Continuing professional development\">continuing professional development</a> (CPD) programmes for LIS professionals to update and upgrade their skills and knowledge.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_of_Library_and_Information_Sciences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The National Institute of Library and Information Sciences (NILIS), University of Colombo was established in 1999. The purpose of the institute is to provide postgraduate and general training facilities in the Library and Information Science field with special attention to the school/teacher librarianship.The establishment of the institute was a result of the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a> funded General Education Project 2, (GEP 2). The purpose of the GEP 2 was to improve the different education sectors in Sri Lanka including the School Library sector. Under the project 4,000 school libraries were developed. When the World Bank mission was working in close cooperation with the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Library_and_Documentation_Services_Board\" title=\"National Library and Documentation Services Board\">National Library and Documentation Services Board</a> (NLDSB) which was the local counterpart of the School Library sub sector, the NLDSB proposed to establish a training institute to support the school library development programme at the latter part of the project. The proposal was accepted and the World Bank advisory team of the project invited the NLDSB to submit a suitable proposal for consideration.Then NLDSB developed the NILIS project proposal with the help of a local consultant (Prof. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=W_B_Dorakumbura&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"W B Dorakumbura (page does not exist)\">W B Dorakumbura</a>) who prepared the proposal with the assistance of the professional staff of NLDSB. They used the initial <a href=\"/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(Sri_Lanka)\" title=\"University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)\">University Grants Commission</a> (UGC) Inter University Committee of Librarians (IUCL) proposal to establish a Postgraduate Institute in Library and Information Science.However, they developed a new proposal to meet the special requirements of the school library sector and LIS sector in general with special attention to the objectives of the GEP 2 project. This proposal was accepted by the authorities with minor modifications and became the foundation of the NILIS.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_of_Library_and_Information_Sciences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2275\nCached time: 20180920003508\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.052 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.079 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 141/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 4542/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 129/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.023/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 842 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   62.773      1 -total\n 84.11%   52.798      1 Template:Refimprove\n 56.27%   35.321      1 Template:Ambox\n 15.62%    9.805      1 Template:Reflist\n  4.02%    2.526      1 Template:Main_other\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:40211245-0!canonical and timestamp 20180920003508 and revision id 761346503\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2013"},{"sortkey":"","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_needing_additional_references"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Institutes_of_the_University_of_Colombo"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Library_science_education"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles needing additional references from August 2013"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Continuing professional development"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Information Management"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Library Science"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Library and information science"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Library and Documentation Services Board"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"University of Colombo"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"University of Kelaniya"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World Bank"},{"ns":0,"*":"School library sector"},{"ns":0,"*":"W B Dorakumbura"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Refimprove"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:More citations needed"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Reflist"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Main other"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Check for unknown parameters"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Objectives","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"National_Institute_of_Library_and_Information_Sciences","byteoffset":342,"anchor":"Objectives"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"National_Institute_of_Library_and_Information_Sciences","byteoffset":1518,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"National_Institute_of_Library_and_Information_Sciences","byteoffset":3337,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"National Institute of Library and Information Sciences","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q17072310"}]}}
