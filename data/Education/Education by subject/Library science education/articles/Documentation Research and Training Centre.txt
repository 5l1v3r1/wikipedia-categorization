Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC) is a research centre for library and information science and allied disciplines at the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. The Centre was established in April 1962, under the auspices of Prof. S. R. Ranganathan (considered to be the father of modern library and information science in India) with the encouragement of Prof. P. C. Mahalanobis at the Indian Statistical Institute. DRTC runs a graduate program leading to the award of a 'Master of Science in Library and Information Science' (MS-LIS) from the Indian Statistical Institute  as well as serving as an academic and research center for Research Fellows registered for a PhD in Information Science. DRTC is perhaps India's only "proper" ischool with a very strong research program.  Research at DRTC generally focuses on the application of information technology to library and information science. DRTC has a PhD collaboration with the University of Trento, Italy. 2012 marked the Golden Jubilee of DRTC, which was celebrated with the 'International Conference on Trends in Knowledge and Information Dynamics' (ICTK-2012).
