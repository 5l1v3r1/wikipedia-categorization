The Mortenson Center for International Library Programs was created in 1991 with a gift from C. Walter and Gerda B. Mortenson to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The Center promotes international peace through library training programs.   The Mortenson Center has worked with several grant agencies, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop training programs for librarians in developing countries.  They have also worked with the Carnegie Corporation and Mellon Foundation to support education efforts in African libraries.
