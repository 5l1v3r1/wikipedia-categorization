A Master of Fine Arts (MFA or M.F.A.)       is a creative degree in fine arts, including visual arts, creative writing, graphic design, photography, filmmaking, dance, theatre, other performing arts; or in some cases, theatre management     or arts administration.   It is a graduate degree that  typically requires two to three years of postgraduate study after a bachelor's degree, though the term of study varies by country or university. The MFA is a terminal degree.  Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature with the program often culminating in a major work or performance. Entry to an MFA program generally requires a bachelor's degree prior to admission, but many institutions do not require that an undergraduate major be exactly the same as the MFA field of study. The most important admissions requirement has often been a sample portfolio of artworks or a performance audition.  The Master of Fine Arts differs from the Master of Arts in that the MFA, while still an academic program, centers around professional artistic practice in the particular field, whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly, academic, or critical study of the field. Additionally, in the United States, an MFA is typically recognized as a terminal degree for practitioners of visual art, design, dance, photography, theatre, film/video, new media, and creative writingâ€”meaning that it is considered the highest degree in its field, and is the qualification to become a professor at the university level in these disciplines.
