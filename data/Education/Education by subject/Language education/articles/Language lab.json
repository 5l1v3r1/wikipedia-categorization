Common problems stem from the limitations and relative complexity of the <a href=\"/wiki/Reel_to_reel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Reel to reel\">reel to reel</a> tape system in use at that time. Design played a part too; the simplest language laboratories had no electronic systems in place for the teacher to remotely control the tape decks, relying on the students to operate the decks correctly. Many had no way to stop the tape running off the reel in fast rewind or forward wind, which meant time wasting and greater chances of failure through misuse.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Tape_recorders\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tape recorders\">tape recorders</a> in use after the early 1970s in the language laboratory were more complex than those in the home, being capable of multitracking and electronic remote control. As a result, they often had several motors and <a href=\"/wiki/Relays\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Relays\">relays</a>, complex <a href=\"/wiki/Transistor\" title=\"Transistor\">transistorised</a> circuitry and needed a variety of voltages to run. They had lots of <a href=\"/wiki/Rubber\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rubber\">rubber</a> parts such as idlers and drive belts which would perish and wear out. <a href=\"/wiki/Bulbs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bulbs\">Bulbs</a> in the control panels were also in continual need of replacement. Since the student booth tapes were not normally changed from one class to the next but were recorded over each time, these would eventually wear, and shed their oxide on the tape heads leading to poor sound and tangling.\n</p><p>The installations were usually maintained under contract by service engineers, but these often served a county or similar wide area, and would only call at 3-monthly intervals. This meant that if several booths malfunctioned, then for much of that time the laboratory was out of action.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Change_of_media\">Change of media</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Change of media\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"A large desk curved round in a semicircle housing five computer monitors and audio equipment.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG/220px-Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG\" width=\"220\" height=\"124\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG/330px-Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG/440px-Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3648\" data-file-height=\"2048\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Japanese_High_school_Language_Lab3.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A modern language laboratory control center</div></div></div>\n<p>The demise of the traditional language laboratory came in the 1980s, with the falling out of favour of the <a href=\"/wiki/Audio-lingual_method\" title=\"Audio-lingual method\">audio-lingual method</a> commonly in place in 1960s teaching methodology, and the expensive repairs needed to the open reel tape machines due to student misuse, neglect, or wear and tear.

However, in many cases they still rely on proprietary networks or expensive sound cards to successfully deliver their media. There are very few truly software only solutions that just rely on installing designated language lab software onto a network and then directing just the original network to manage the media between teacher and student, student and student or student back to teacher. In the past the quality of school, or university networks may have meant that the speed that the media could be delivered on \u2018software only\u2019 labs would have meant a \u2018lag\u2019 in the audio feed. These days all professionally run networks are able to work with these \u2018software only\u2019 language lab solutions and deliver media synchronously.\n</p><p>Software only systems can be easily installed onto an existing PC based network, making them both multi locational in their access and much more feature rich in how and what media they manage.\n</p><p>The content that is now used in the new language labs is much richer and self authored or free: now not just audio, but video, flash based games, internet etc. and the speed and variety of the delivery of media from teacher to student, student to teacher, is much quicker and therefore much more engaging for both teacher and student.\n</p><p>Further developments in language labs are now apparent as access moves from a fixed network and related Microsoft operating systems to online and browsers. Students can now access and work from these new 'cloud' labs from their own devices at any time and anywhere. Students can interrogate and record audio and video files and be marked and assessed by their teachers remotely.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Digital_language_labs\">Digital language labs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Digital language labs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The principle of a language lab essentially has not changed. They are still a teacher-controlled system connected to a number of student booths, containing a student's control mechanism and a headset with a microphone. Digital language labs have the same principle. A software-only language lab changes the concept of where and what a language lab is. Software can be installed and accessed on any networked PC anywhere on a school, college, or university campus. Software-only systems can be located in one room, from room-to-room or campus-to-campus.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Functionality\">Functionality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Functionality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The levels of functionality of current language labs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. All labs will have a level of teacher control to manage student licenses / desktops. The more sophisticated \u2018software only\u2019 labs have a higher level of teacher management and control over the student desktop. One of the key differences with the \u2018high end\u2019 \u2018software only\u2019 products is their ability to work \u2018live\u2019 with the students as they record and work with media. So instead of waiting to correct student recordings after they have been recorded and collected back it is now possible for a teacher to work synchronously and \u2018live\u2019 with students on their own, in pairs and in groups, thus enhancing the immediacy of the teaching and learning experience.\n</p><p>The next generation digital language labs allow teachers to monitor, control, deliver, group, display, review and collect, audio, video and web based multimedia content. The student player is linked to the teacher console and can play audio, video and web based formats. Students can rewind, stop, start, go back to last silence, record, fast forward, repeat phrase and bookmark.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advantages\">Advantages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Advantages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are different features of language lab, which make the students to have interactive session.  It provides equal opportunity to all the students to hear the instructor irrespective of place where they are seated. There will be less miscommunication because of direct nature of the sound transmission. It also provides the privacy that encourages the shy students to speak without any hesitation. In addition instructor can speak to individual or group of students in privacy without interrupting rest of class. Language labs motivate students to talk freely and lose the shyness when talking in front of their friends. Attention on subject is increased resulting in better retention of the concepts. Furthermore, it develops the listening and communication skills, since they hear correct pronunciation through their headphones. Learner will show more enthusiasm and excitement in learning lesson because of learning lab system.\nTeacher can look after each student, which is not possible in case of the regular classroom. In a lab instructor can communicate with many students by pressing a mouse key in order to talk with students. Efficient use of time and learning efficiency is much more than usual classroom learning. This set up fosters more interactive session between students and teacher. The language lab brings variety in teaching learning process instead of boring verbal centered teaching. The student\u2019s progress can also be monitored regularly so that teacher can provide feedback based on individual pace and ability. Finally, the students can learn the lesson at their own pace thus allowing the classroom as student-centered approach.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Disadvantages\">Disadvantages</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Disadvantages\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is very expensive to set up the language lab in country like India.Because There is no lab syllabus and usually language classes are conducted as theory. Moreover, the lab can engage maximum of 60 students hence space is also difficult for school.  These days student does not have enough patience to listen to pronunciation and practice them so the recording of pronunciation is useless. As the teacher listens to students randomly the response can be unorganized and ineffective as there are many students to attend to.  The teacher should be well trained in executing the language lab effectively. Given the nature of teaching, a language teacher may need an assistant in taking care of the technological part while teacher attends to the instructional components. As technology changes rapidly, there should be a provision for an upgrade in the medium of instructions, which can be burden for school in terms of finances. The ministry of education should consider allocating funds to set up as well as maintenance of language lab. If all these basic problems can be solved only then we can think of implementing language lab in our curriculum.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Significance_of_language\">Significance of language</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Significance of language\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the current digital age, we are all connected regardless of the geographic distance. Advancement in technology has metaphorically brought the world into our living room in the form of TV or internet which allow us to watch events happening in other countries or talk to friends and family living in another continents via internet. As a result, we are exposed to different languages, cultures and traditions of people from all over the world. As we live in multilingual and multicultural world, language lab can greatly help students to learn language of their choice, as it will allow students to learn at their own pace. They can record and assess their performance to make sure that they are paying attention to all aspects of phonetics such as pronunciation, accents and stress etc.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The language lab provides access to native-speakers via audio-video aids so that they learn correctly. Given large number of students pursue higher studies outside their home country; language lab would help them in studying the language of the country where they are planning to pursue their higher education. For example, non-native English speaking students are required to give TOEFL/IELTS if they plan to study in North America. While there are several benefits to language resource center, there should be proper safeguard in place to regulate and monitor the use of technologies employed in the teaching learning process so that students do not misuse them. It is also important that the lay out of the lab is conducive for effective communication and monitoring of the students. As strong communication skills are essential in almost all of the professional careers, language lab can help in acquiring this important skill.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Self_access_language_learning_centers\" title=\"Self access language learning centers\">Self access language learning centers</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Language_lab&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-prl-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-prl_1-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation journal\">L\u00e9on, P.R.
