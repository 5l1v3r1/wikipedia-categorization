In December 2015, Voxy received a patent for its customized keyword extraction process for second language learning.  Voxy is built on the principles of task-based language learning, and tailors every single course based on learners’ daily performance, proficiency levels, personal goals, and interests.   The Voxy curriculum uses authentic content that is relevant to learners, including up-to-date news articles from leading publishers, English songs, videos of people accomplishing daily tasks, and audio recordings of real-life situations.   Voxy delivers a fully integrated web and mobile platform that syncs across all of a user’s devices.    The platform includes live in-product instruction through one-on-one tutoring sessions and group classes with certified teachers who provide real-time feedback.  Voxy also offers advanced reporting, dashboard visualization, and performance analytics to keep track of how learners are doing. To assess proficiency level at the beginning of the program, Voxy uses its own proprietary test, the Voxy Proficiency Assessment™ (VPA™). Learners can retake the VPA™ every three months to measure their improvement, and courses will automatically adapt to updated proficiency levels. Voxy has pioneered numerous innovations in contextual learning, including the use of natural language processing tools and geo-location.
