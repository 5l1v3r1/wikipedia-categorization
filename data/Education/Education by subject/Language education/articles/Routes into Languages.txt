The England-wide Routes into Languages project is a consortium of universities working together with schools and colleges, to enthuse and encourage people to study languages. It is funded by HEFCE, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (£4.5 million) and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (£3.5 million).  Routes into Languages aims to increase the take-up for modern foreign languages in English primary and secondary schools, and promote careers in translating and interpreting.   The phase 2 ( from August 2013 to July 2016) aims at promoting take up in learning languages while strengthening and widening an efficient network of universities, schools and key stakeholders throughout the UK. The theme of international mobility gives rise to a variety of projects and activities, from cultural events and revision days to e-mentoring and tutoring. These collaborations also aim at encouraging students to spend a year abroad during their studies, at widening access to language study and at promoting greater national capacity in the areas of employment that require proficiency in languages and enhance intercultural competence while helping to encourage a broader social profile of these areas.  The new Routes into Languages Programme in England is funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and hosted by the Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies (LLAS)
