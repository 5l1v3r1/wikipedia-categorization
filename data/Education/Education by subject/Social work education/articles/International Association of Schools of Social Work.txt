The International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) is the worldwide association of schools of social work, other tertiary level social work educational programs, and social work educators. The IASSW promotes the development of social work education throughout the world, develops standards to enhance quality of social work education, encourages international exchange, provides forums for sharing social work research and scholarship, and promotes human rights and social development through policy and advocacy activities.   The IASSW was founded in 1928 at the First International Conference of Social Work, held in Paris. It initially comprised 51 schools, mostly in Europe, and was known as the International Committee. Revitalized after World War II, the organization expanded its membership to include a wider range of countries and was renamed the International Association of Schools of Social Work.  Membership in the IASSW comprises social work educational programs at the post-secondary or tertiary level and interested individuals, mostly social work educators. The association has member schools in all parts of the world. Five 5 regional organizations in Africa; Asia and the Pacific; Europe; Latin America; and North America and the Caribbean are affiliated with the IASSW. IASSW is governed by the Board of Directors under a Constitution approved by the biennial General Assembly. IASSW holds consultative status with the United Nations and participates as an NGO in UN activities in Geneva, Vienna and New York. Through its work at the UN and with other international organizations, IASSW represents social work education at the international level.  According to the current IASSW Constitution, the organization is governed by the Board of Directors, made up of both elected and appointed members. Starting from 1928 the IASSW had 12 Presidents.
