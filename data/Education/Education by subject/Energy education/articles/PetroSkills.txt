PetroSkills was founded in 1963 and is based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.  In 2001 PetroSkills began the PetroSkills Alliance by partnering with BP and Shell to involve large oil and gas companies directly into the design of course material, instructor review, and competency analysis. In 2008 PetroSkills expanded their number of courses through the acquisition of PetrEX International, Inc.  In 2010 PetroSkills was acquired by BV Investment Partners. Previous owners, Ford Brett and Dennis Wing retained a minority ownership position during the acquisition. BV partner Justin Harrison was quoted as saying, "We share management's view that long-term demand drivers for oil and gas resources, the increasing technological complexity of finding and extracting oil and gas, and a demographic shift in the industry's workforce composition will drive a growing and sustainable need for quality technical training and competency-based solutions."  Also in 2010 PetroSkills partnered with the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and began providing training to operations and maintenance technicians.  This partnership was a "response to the bigger crew change that will be occurring across operator ranks over the next decade. The demographic changes impacting the engineering ranks within E&P represent a small percentage of the numbers that will be impacted in the operations and maintenance ranks.‚Äù With the introduction of PetroSkills O&M, a specific focus was placed on both operations and maintenance (O&M) technicians employed in upstream, midstream and downstream roles, PetroSkills O&M offers companies training through both instructor-led training and e-learning content. In 2011 PetroSkills opened its own 325,000 square foot Conference Center on January 14.  The center is located in Katy, Texas.
