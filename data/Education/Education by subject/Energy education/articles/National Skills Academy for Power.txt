The National Skills Academy for Power is a skills academy for the energy and power industry in the UK. The National Skills Academy for Power was first announced in October 2008 by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Steve Davies was made the Chief Executive in September 2009. It was given formal government approval on 18 March 2010. It was the 15th National Skills Academy. Â£2.9 million of funding for the project was allocated from the government. It held its first Annual Conference and Awards Dinner on 9 March 2011 at Twickenham Stadium. This also included the People in Power Awards. It is based near Monkspath on the A34, next to the Corus Hotel Solihull  and the Monkspath business park close to junction 4 of the M42. It is a partnership between the Sector Skills Council, Energy and Utility Skills, and several energy companies: It also works in conjunction with the IET Power Academy, which was set up in 2004, an industry group that was formed by seven universities (Bath, Cardiff, Imperial College London, Manchester, Queen's University Belfast, Southampton and Strathclyde) and eighteen power companies. It seeks to focus and coordinate UK-wide training in the power sector by standardising training materials. It also promotes the industry sector, specifically its career choices, in a way similar to a trade association. Similar work, on a much broader focus, is carried out by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).
