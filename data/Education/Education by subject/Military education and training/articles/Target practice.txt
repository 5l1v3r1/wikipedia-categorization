Target practice refers to any exercise in which projectiles are fired at a specified target, usually to improve the aim of the person or persons firing the weapon. The abbreviation TP is commonly used for "target practice" rounds. TP-T is a target practice round with tracer. The United States Navy previously used decommissioned ships for practice. Currently they use remote control watercraft such as the QST-35, FACT, HSMST and SDST to practice on moving targets at variable speeds.  The video game character Lyris Titanborn from the video game 'Elder Scrolls Online' refers to your character as "Target Practice" while playing through the games tutorial. However this will only occur if the players name is Alexander McDowell.
