It is both a common military exercise and a civilian activity.\n</p><p>A loaded march is known as a <b>forced foot march</b> in the <a href=\"/wiki/US_Army\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US Army\">US Army</a>.

Loaded marching is particularly important in Britain, where all soldiers must complete annual loaded march tests.\n</p><p>In certain climates, the use of loaded marches is limited, since they would result in high casualty rates through <a href=\"/wiki/Heat_exhaustion\" title=\"Heat exhaustion\">heat exhaustion</a>.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#In_the_Roman_Army\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the Roman Army</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#In_the_British_Armed_Forces\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the British Armed Forces</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#In_the_French_Foreign_Legion\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the French Foreign Legion</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#In_the_United_States_Armed_Forces\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the United States Armed Forces</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_Roman_Army\">In the Roman Army</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Loaded_march&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: In the Roman Army\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"/wiki/Vegetius\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vegetius\">Vegetius</a>, during the four-month initial training of a <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_legionary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman legionary\">Roman legionary</a>, loaded marches were taught before recruits ever handled a weapon; since any formation would be split up by stragglers at the back or soldiers trundling along at differing speeds.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Standards varied over time, but normally recruits were first required to complete 20 Roman miles (29.62&#160;km or 18.405 modern miles) with 20.5&#160;kg in five summer hours,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> which was known as \"the regular step\" or \"military pace\". (The Romans divided daylight time into twelve equal hours. Depending on the exact day of the year and the latitude, the length of a \"summer hour\" would vary. Five summer hours is therefore not exact, but could indicate a time of approximately six modern hours.) They then progressed to the \"faster step\" or \"full pace\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and were required to complete 24 Roman miles (35.544&#160;km or 22.086 modern miles) in five summer hours loaded with 20.5 kilograms (45&#160;lb). Training also included some forced marches of 20\u201330 miles, often followed by the construction of basic defences for an overnight position.\n</p><p>In some cases, each member of a Roman unit marched with a <a href=\"/wiki/Sudis_(stake)\" title=\"Sudis (stake)\">sudis</a>, to aid the construction of defences.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_British_Armed_Forces\">In the British Armed Forces</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Loaded_march&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: In the British Armed Forces\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Army\" title=\"British Army\">British Army</a>, loaded marching is considered a core skill and is tested annually in a 12.9 kilometers (8&#160;mi) <a href=\"/wiki/Annual_Fitness_Test\" title=\"Annual Fitness Test\">Annual Fitness Test</a> (formerly known as a <a href=\"/wiki/Combat_Fitness_Test\" title=\"Combat Fitness Test\">Combat Fitness Test</a>) carrying 15\u201325&#160;kg depending on the arm (25&#160;kg for infantry, 20&#160;kg for artillery, armour/cavalry, and engineers/sappers; 15&#160;kg for other arms and services). However, infantry soldiers are additionally expected to complete advanced tests, typically a first day of 20&#160;km (12.43 miles) with 30 kilograms (66&#160;lb) in three and a half hours, followed by a similar march with 20 kilograms (44&#160;lb) the next day. Within each arm, more demanding units exist (such as close support, commandos and parachutists) and have their own internal standards and tests. Special forces also use their own tests.\n</p><p>During the current selection process, Army recruits are usually made to tab 3 kilometers (2&#160;mi)  as an introduction. This is because injuries to the legs are common during basic training tabbing.\n</p><p>The British Army slang term <i>tab</i> has its roots in an <a href=\"/wiki/Acronym\" title=\"Acronym\">acronym</a>, being an abbreviation of Tactical Advance to Battle.\n</p><p>Loaded marches have been particularly important in the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Army\" title=\"British Army\">British Army</a> since the 1982 <a href=\"/wiki/Falklands_War\" title=\"Falklands War\">Falklands War</a>. Many British commanders felt that British success in the war was linked to the British soldiers' ability to march across the difficult Falklands terrain with their kit. British infantry soldiers in Afghanistan conducted four-hour patrols carrying an average of 50 kilograms (110&#160;lb) of equipment, going into battle with that weight if they encountered enemy fighters. There is some debate as to whether this makes them better equipped for battle or weighs them down too much.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_French_Foreign_Legion\">In the French Foreign Legion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Loaded_march&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: In the French Foreign Legion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To complete training, <a href=\"/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion\" title=\"French Foreign Legion\">legionnaire</a> trainees must complete the <i>parcours du combattant</i> (\"Combatant's Course\") of 8 kilometers (5&#160;mi) loaded with rifle, helmet and 12 kilograms (26&#160;lb)  in 40 minutes, and a night march of 25 kilometers (16&#160;mi) in three hours with a load of 18 kilograms (40&#160;lb). Various marches of much longer distances are also a part of training such as the \"Kepi\" march of 50&#160;km in full combat gear carrying a rifle, helmet and 30&#160;kg load and the \"Raid march\" of 120&#160;km in full combat gear carrying a rifle, helmet and 30&#160;kg load simulating the navigation to and raiding of different checkpoints in 3 days. Troublemakers are made to place extra rocks in their backpacks for the duration of the marches.
