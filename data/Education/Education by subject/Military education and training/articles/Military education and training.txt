Military education and training is a process which intends to establish and improve the capabilities of military personnel in their respective roles. It begins with recruit training, proceeds to education and training specific to military roles, and may also include additional training during a military career. Military training may be voluntary or compulsory duty.  The primary form of military training is recruit training, which makes use of various conditioning techniques to resocialize trainees into the military system, ensure that they will obey all orders without hesitation, and teach basic military skills.      The drill instructor has the task of making the service members fit for military use. (Resocialization is a sociological concept referring to the process of mentally and emotionally "re-training" a person so they can operate in a new environment, and involves changes to an individual's attitudes and behaviours.)   After their recruit training, personnel may undergo further training specific to their military role, including the use of any specialist equipment. After this point, they are normally deemed fit for military service. Military personnel may continue to receive training during their career. Larger countries may have military academies, which combine military training with formal qualifications.
