The Zen of Screaming is an instructional DVD by Melissa Cross, a vocal coach whose speciality is "unclean" vocal techniques such as growled or screamed found in extreme metal and other styles of music. In contrast, "clean" vocals are relatively more conventional singing techniques.  The DVD is intended to help vocalists learn how to strengthen their bodies so they can perform vocals without damaging their vocal cords. On the DVD many guest musicians, such as Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, appear to demonstrate the exercises. Other pupils of Melissa Cross have been the lead vocalists for famous heavy metal bands such as Slipknot, Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, Shadows Fall, Underoath, Arch Enemy, Madball, God Forbid, and Andrew W.K.
