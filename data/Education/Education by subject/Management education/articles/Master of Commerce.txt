Master of Commerce (MCom or M Comm; sometimes Magister Commercii) is a postgraduate master's degree focusing on  commerce-, accounting-, management- and economics-related subjects. Like the undergraduate Bachelor of Commerce, the degree is offered in Commonwealth nations. The Master of Commerce typically requires two years of full-time study.  The curriculum is generally concentrated on one subject area, see aside, and emphasizes underlying theory. Relatedly, programs usually include a thesis component,  and may be exclusively research based.    Given this structure, the MCom differs from other business and management degrees:  Admission to the MCom usually requires completion of a Bachelor of Commerce, or similar compatible degree; often, an "Honours degree" will be required.  Depending on the degree focus, a related undergraduate major and / or a fairly strong quantitative background may also be a prerequisite.  Some MCom programs admit students from science or engineering backgrounds - these programs usually require that students complete a bridging course,   or undertake an extended program.  Based on specialisation, MCom graduates are typically employed in fields related to their degree foci, such as financial services, marketing and project management; graduates also often work in general management and business consulting   Programs are sometimes structured such that graduates are eligible for membership of various professional bodies or institutes.    In some cases, the institutional qualification program itself, may, in fact, be offered as an MCom degree (e.g. the Australian Institute of Public Accountants formerly offered its IPA program as an MCom in Public Accounting  prior to July, 2017.) The MCom includes a research component and thus provides access to a doctorate; progressing from the MCom, a student can pursue a Doctor of Commerce (DCom), Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) degree program.
