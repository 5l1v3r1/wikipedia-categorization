A Fachwirt is a higher professional qualification in Germany allocated to level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework, where it was translated to Business Management Specialist.  To facilitate appreciation of the Fachwirt internationally, the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag, DIHK) proposed Bachelor Professional as the English translation.   However, due to the danger of confusion with academic degrees, this motion was rejected by the German state ministers of education.  The Fachwirt provides a form of continuing professional development, which is usually pursued following an apprenticeship and at least one year of professional experience in a recognized occupation. The final examinations, regulated by the German Vocational Training Act, are carried out by specialized committees of the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK). Learning objectives, defined by DIHK created frameworks, require knowledge in business administration as well as practical and theoretical skills in a particular industrial sector (e.g. Handelsfachwirt for Trade and Commerce, Verkehrsfachwirt for Transport Management, Fachwirt im Sozial- und Gesundheitswesen for Social and Health Services).  Although not a prerequisite for admission to the final exams, training courses are offered by several, primarily private educational institutions. Depending on the specialization, the curricula suggest coursework of 400 to 800 hours, which is taught in 6 to 24 month of full-time or part-time study, respectively, comparable to almost a full term at university which carries 30  ECTS representative of 900 hours of course work.
