Urban Agricultural Architecture (UAA) is the practice of integrating organic, hydroponic, aeroponic or aquaponic farming technologies into buildings of all types.  An example can be as small as building a lean-to-greenhouse on a single-family home and using it as a kitchen garden.  Examples of large-scale projects are the hydroponic greenhouses of Lufa Farms, the rooftop farms of Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Farm,  and the vertical farms of Sky Greens.   Building types that can incorporate food growing technologies include: single-family home, multi-family housing, mixed-use buildings, schools,  restaurants,  institutional buildings,  vertical farms, hoop houses and greenhouses that are designed to urban conditions.   Existing urban buildings and structures can also be adaptively reused incorporating agricultural technologies to produce food for urban populations.
