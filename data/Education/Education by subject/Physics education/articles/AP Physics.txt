In the United States, Advanced Placement (AP) Physics collectively refers to the College Board Advanced Placement Program courses and exams covering various areas of physics. These are intended to be equivalent to university courses that use best practices of physics teaching pedagogy. Each AP Physics course culminates in an optional exam for which high-performing students may receive some credit towards their college coursework, depending on which college or university they attend.  AP Physics B – discontinued in 2014 – was supposed to be equivalent to an introductory algebra-based college course in physics, with a laboratory component.  The course was non-calculus-based, utilizing algebra and basic trigonometry to solve various physics problems.  AP Physics B was divided into five different sections: Newtonian Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Physics, Electricity and Magnetism, Waves and Optics, and Atomic and Nuclear Physics.  AP Physics B was replaced by AP Physics 1 and 2. AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 were introduced for the 2015 exam administration.  The courses were designed to emphasize critical thinking and reasoning as well as learning through inquiry.  They remain as algebra-based courses that do not require students to have taken calculus.  AP Physics 1 covers the same Newtonian mechanics as AP Physics B plus rotational mechanics, as well as an introduction to electricity (Coulomb's Law and simple DC circuits), and mechanical waves and sound.  AP Physics 2 covers the remaining subjects from AP Physics B: thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity and magnetism, and modern physics.  The College Board offers two courses in the AP Physics C suite, each equivalent to a semester-length calculus-based college course for majors in physical science or engineering:   The two AP Physics C courses can be combined to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams.
