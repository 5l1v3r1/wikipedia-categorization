Thermal science is the combined study of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and combustion. Introductory subjects studied in thermal science generally are focused on thermodynamics.  These include studies of properties of pure substances, pressure-volume-temperature diagrams, the ideal gas law, heat and its relationship to work, heat transfer, the laws of thermodynamics, engine and refrigeration cycles, and combustion. Another area of concern in thermal science is fluid mechanics. These include fluid statics, fluid flows, e.g. laminar flow vs. turbulent flow, the Bernoulli equation. The applicability of this area is piping networks, turbo-machineries, airfoils. Heat transfer has applications for heat exchangers, heat engines, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning, and cooling of microelectronics. Combustion involves both thermal effects and chemical reaction. Intensive study of thermal sciences requires additional knowledge and experience in other areas such as experimental techniques and numerical or computational methods. Potter, M. & Scott, E. (2003).
