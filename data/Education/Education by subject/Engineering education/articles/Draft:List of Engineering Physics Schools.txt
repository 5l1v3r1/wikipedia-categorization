Engineering physics (or engineering science)  can be studied at the bachelors, masters and Ph.D. levels at many universities, typically offered in a partnership between engineering faculties and the departments of physics. In Canada, the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board is responsible for accrediting undergraduate engineering physics programs,    graduate study in aerospace engineering is also available at several Canadian post-secondary institutions, though Canadian post-graduate engineering programs do not require accreditation. Only undergraduate engineering programs in Canada are accredited,  and this is done by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.
