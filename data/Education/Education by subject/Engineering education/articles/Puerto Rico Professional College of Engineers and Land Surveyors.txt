The Professional College of Engineers and Land Surveyors of Puerto Rico —Spanish: Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico (CIAPR)— is the professional association mandated by law that groups all engineers and land surveyors that call, present, or represent themselves as 'engineers' or 'land surveyors' in Puerto Rico.[a] As with many other countries, the profession of engineering and land surveying is both regulated and licensed in Puerto Rico; while another entity, namely the Puerto Rico Examining Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors, regulates the profession and emits its corresponding licenses, the Puerto Rico Annotated Codes and Act 173 of 1988 requires that all licensed engineers and land surveyors in Puerto Rico must be members of the College. The quasi-public nonprofit corporation was established on May 15, 1938, through Act 319 of 1938 in order to bring together professionals with the right to practice engineering, architecture and surveying in Puerto Rico.  The primary mission of the Professional College is to promote the protection and development of engineering and surveying to promote ethics and excellence in professional practice for the benefit of referees and the people of Puerto Rico. The Professional College is composed primarily of its governing board, which in turn is composed of the presidents and delegates elected by the enrollment of the schools in their respective annual meetings, and delegates elected by their chapters are registered for their assemblies year. Also part of the governing board are the president, a vice-president for engineering and a vice-president for surveyors, elected at the annual meeting. The professional college institutes are semi-autonomous bodies, which represent the various professional bodies board of government or publicly.ico. In addition to these agencies, the Professional College has about twenty permanent committees and ad hoc committees designated for specific projects.
