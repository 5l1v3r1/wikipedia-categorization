The Dublin Accord is an agreement for the international recognition of Engineering Technician qualifications. In May 2002, the national engineering organisations of Ireland, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Canada signed an agreement mutually recognising the qualifications which underpin the granting of Engineering Technician titles in the four countries. Operation of the Dublin Accord is similar as for the Washington Accord and Sydney Accord.  Each signatory has full rights of participation in the Accord.
