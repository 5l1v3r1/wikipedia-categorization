The demand arises from the current state of industry, where both the products manufactured and the plants which make the products are progressing towards greater diversity and sophistication. Recent studies had shown concern in both <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a> and in the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> that engineering graduates were not well-prepared for many of today's multi-disciplinary and project-based workplaces. Several committees have been formed to study this and  have published some material. One Canadian study was done by the <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_Academy_of_Engineering\" title=\"Canadian Academy of Engineering\">Canadian Academy of Engineering</a> and two of its main conclusions were:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Engineering faculties should ensure that breadth of learning, beyond the technical aspects of the specialist engineering discipline, is a major thrust in engineering education.</li>\n<li>The engineering curriculum should emphasize problem-solving, design, and the development of the learning skills of their students.</li></ul>\n<p>Integrated Engineers acquire

the Engineering Council UK, identified the need for routes to qualification for Chartered (Professional) Engineers that:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>meet the identified needs of industry,\nincrease access to engineering education by more students,\nprovide a balanced curriculum combining the subjects that engineers use most often and directed towards the needs of the majority of engineers.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the fundamental definition for Integrated Engineering.\n</p><p>The qualities looked for by industry when recruiting graduates were identified as:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>flexibility and broad education,\nability to understand non engineering functions,\nability to solve problems,\nknowledge of the principles of engineering and ability to apply them in practical situations,\ninformation skills,\nexperience of project work, especially cross linked projects,\nability to work as a member of a team,\npresentation and communication skills.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Engineering Council UK, 1988, An Integrated Engineering Degree Programme.</i>\nEngineering Council UK, 1988, Admissions to Universities - Action to increase the supply of engineers.<i></i>\n</p><p>Following open competition for additional funding provided by the UK Department for Technology and Industry, and industrial supporters including British Petroleum, six universities were selected from thirty three applicants.  Four \"Pilot Programmes\" were launched at Cardiff University, Nottingham Trent University, Portsmouth University and Sheffield Hallam University.\n</p><p>In 1989, The Nottingham Trent University (UK) admitted students to first of the Engineering Council's new Integrated Engineering Degree Programme courses.  The course was accredited, at the CEng and European Engineer level, by the Institutions of Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers and Manufacturing Engineers.\n</p><p>Generic engineering programmes are common.  Integrated Engineering is distinct through emphasizing the development of personal competencies, especially the ability of students to work within groups.  It is design led, and integration of all the subjects of study is a defining characteristic, achieved partly through the medium of project based learning.\n</p><p>Following the successful experience at The Nottingham Trent University, Integrated Engineering programmes were established in 1993, at selected universities in Bulgaria and Hungary, with the aid of European Union funding granted under the Tempus Programme.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Liverpool\" title=\"University of Liverpool\">University of Liverpool</a>, the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the <a href=\"/wiki/Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers\" title=\"Institution of Mechanical Engineers\">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Institution_of_Electrical_Engineers\" title=\"Institution of Electrical Engineers\">Institution of Electrical Engineers</a>, and can lead to <a href=\"/wiki/Chartered_Engineer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chartered Engineer\">Chartered Engineer</a> status.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Anglia_Ruskin_University\" title=\"Anglia Ruskin University\">Anglia Ruskin University</a>, the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the <a href=\"/wiki/Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology\" title=\"Institution of Engineering and Technology\">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>, and can lead to <a href=\"/wiki/Incorporated_Engineer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Incorporated Engineer\">Incorporated Engineer</a> status.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Integrated_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the U.S. there are several Integrated engineering education programs.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Utah_University\" title=\"Southern Utah University\">Southern Utah University</a> requires its students to pass the <a href=\"/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Engineering_exam\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fundamentals of Engineering exam\">Fundamentals of Engineering exam</a> (FE) before they graduate; and received ABET accreditation in 2004 that extended retroactively through October 2003.
