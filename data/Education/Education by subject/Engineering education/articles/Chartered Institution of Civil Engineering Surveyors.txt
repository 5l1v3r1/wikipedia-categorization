The Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors or ICES is a  professional association in the field of civil engineering surveying. ICES is now recognised as the leading chartered professional body for civil engineering surveyors. ICES members consist mainly of commercial managers and geospatial engineers working and studying within civil engineering surveying. The institution began in 1969 as the Association of Surveyors in Civil Engineering and became a registered educational charity in 1992. In 1992, ICES became the first associated institution of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and together formed two joint boards to provide and disseminate surveying knowledge and expertise; the Geospatial Engineering Board and Commercial Management Board. ICES also has reciprocal membership agreements in place with the ICE. ICES is an internationally recognised qualifying body established to regulate, educate and train surveyors working within civil engineering. The headquarters are in the United Kingdom, with 11 regions consisting of volunteer-led committee members. ICES regions include  the UK, Ireland, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. ICES also has memoranda of understandings agreements with many international surveying institutions and is a member of the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG). Applicants for membership must demonstrate that they have fulfilled the institution's competency requirements and the general competencies plus at least one specialism must be met with and signed off by a sponsor.
