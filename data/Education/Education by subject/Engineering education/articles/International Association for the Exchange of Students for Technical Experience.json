Students gain relevant technical <a href=\"/wiki/Training\" title=\"Training\">training</a> lasting from 4 weeks to 18 months. IAESTE includes committees representing more than 80 countries, with the potential of accepting new countries into the organization every year. At the general conference 2005 held in <a href=\"/wiki/Cartagena,_Colombia\" title=\"Cartagena, Colombia\">Cartagena, Colombia</a>, the statute and by-laws of IAESTE a.s.b.l. were established, making IAESTE a registered \"associacion sans but lucratif\" (<a href=\"/wiki/Non-profit_organization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Non-profit organization\">non-profit organization</a>), with the centre in <a href=\"/wiki/Luxembourg\" title=\"Luxembourg\">Luxembourg</a>. The current President is prof. Bernard Baeyens from <a href=\"/wiki/Colombia\" title=\"Colombia\">Colombia</a>. IAESTE's motto is \"Work, Experience, Discover\".

The Imperial College Vacation Work Committee headed by Mr. James Newby initiated a meeting with national organizations from 10 European countries in a <a href=\"/wiki/Effects_of_World_War_II#A_New_Europe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Effects of World War II\">post war</a> effort to promote better understanding between countries and cultures.\n</p><p>Since 1948, the association has grown to include more than 80 countries worldwide and has exchanged in excess of 300,000 students.

Coordinating the daily administration of the association is the responsibility of the President. The President is elected for two years and is responsible for the General Conference or the GC as it is called in IAESTE. The GC makes the formal decisions in IAESTE and is composed of one delegate (National Secretary) from each country. The GC meets every year in January and is a forum for discussion.\n</p><p>The Board is an elected body which prepares the work of the General Conference and advises the President. It is composed of four elected members and the President.\n</p><p>The GC is the most important event of IAESTE each year. Here every country brings job offers they have obtained in their own country. Every job is written on a standardized form stating where and when the job is, who is eligible for the job and which qualifications (language, skills, etc.) are required. The jobs are traded during the <i>Exchange Sessions</i>. During these sessions, countries meet and try to get the best possible jobs to bring back home. This is very hectic as countries try to get the best jobs. These jobs either have to fit pre-selected students or are open for applications from students back home.\n</p><p>One other notable event at the GC is the \"International Party\". At this party, every member country brings a national dish, drinks and clothes.\n</p><p>The international work is funded by member fees based on <a href=\"/wiki/GDP_per_capita\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GDP per capita\">GDP per capita</a> and the number of students sent abroad and is paid by the National Committees.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"National_organization_structure\">National organization structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Association_for_the_Exchange_of_Students_for_Technical_Experience&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: National organization structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The National Committees represent the member countries and are composed of persons representing academic, industrial and student interests.  Every full member of the IAESTE has one vote at the GC. The National Secretary is normally the person with the formal vote, even though the decisions are often made by the whole National Committee.\n</p><p>Each National Committee is responsible for the administration of the exchange in its own country. Membership is given after the establishment of a National Committee in accordance with the statutes of IAESTE, together with a responsible permanent secretariat. The type of secretariat which administers the exchange varies according to each country's national structure, educational system, and funding policies. The essential requirement is that the national secretariat, whatever its organization and status, should have competent permanent staff.\n</p><p>Every country has their own way of organizing the work of IAESTE, but the National Committee can mainly be classified into four categories:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Student driven - The National Secretary is a student, normally serving for one to two years. Often there is one employed administrative staff for paperwork and keeping contact with other national committees, but the students are making decisions, organizing trainees and even raising funds. Examples are Norway, Denmark, Austria, and Croatia (see <a href=\"#CEC\">CEC</a>).</li>\n<li>Academically - The National Secretary is a professor or employed by a university to front IAESTE on the behalf of the university or the country. Usually, they have students to welcome trainees, but students are not involved in the decision-making. Examples are Turkey, Portugal.</li>\n<li>Governmental - An employee of a governmental international work exchange organization is the National Secretary. Usually the organization is responsible for several exchange programs and is quite professional. They also often employ students to welcome incoming students. Examples are Finland, Switzerland and UK.</li>\n<li>Other - Non-profit organizations funded by various sources (students, companies, government) but not affiliated with a single institution. Examples are China, USA.</li></ul>\n<p>IAESTE varies a lot from country to country and even within countries there can be a big difference from one city to another. Traineeships also vary a lot: some countries have extended programmes with students employed to help and organize events,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> while in other places arriving trainees organize events themselves.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_IAESTE_Alumni_Network_.28IAN.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_IAESTE_Alumni_Network_(IAN)\">The IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Association_for_the_Exchange_of_Students_for_Technical_Experience&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: The IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Friends of IAESTE Network (FoIN) was founded 1996 in Denmark as the official Alumni branch of IAESTE, with the goal of helping former IAESTE trainees and members keep in touch.\n</p><p>In 2010, FoIN was re-branded as the IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN) and an Alumni Relations Manager was appointed to oversee all activities.

Martin became co-ordinator of JUMP, later this role was taken over by Adrian Keller from IAESTE Switzerland, and in 2009 by Tomasz (Tomek) Pawliszyn from IAESTE Poland.\nJUMP is aimed to young members of IAESTE who want to explore more the organisation and meet other members of IAESTE.\n</p><p>Primarily new members of IAESTE meet in a different European city each year during four days in September or October for training sessions and discussion groups. An important component is cultural exchange with corporate tours, cultural events and tours and social events incorporating local cuisine and customs.  The theme song for the seminar is <a href=\"/wiki/Jump_(For_My_Love)\" title=\"Jump (For My Love)\">Jump (For My Love)</a> by the <a href=\"/wiki/Pointer_Sisters\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pointer Sisters\">Pointer Sisters</a>.\n</p><p>Usually 40 - 70 participants take part in the event.
