Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub fields of electrical engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub fields towards the end of the degree.\nIn most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States and Canada), Chartered Engineer (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Post_graduate_studies\">Post graduate studies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Education_and_training_of_electrical_and_electronics_engineers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Post graduate studies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Electrical engineers can also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a <a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_Engineering\" title=\"Master of Engineering\">Master of Engineering</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy\" title=\"Doctor of Philosophy\">Doctor of Philosophy</a> in Engineering or an <a href=\"/wiki/Engineer%27s_degree\" title=\"Engineer&#39;s degree\">Engineer's degree</a>.

For example, in the United States and Canada \"only a licensed engineer may...seal engineering work for public and private clients\". [4] This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. [5] In other countries, such as Australia, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. [6] In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. [7] An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.\n</p><p>Significant professional bodies for electrical engineers include the <a href=\"/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers\" title=\"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) and the <a href=\"/wiki/Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology\" title=\"Institution of Engineering and Technology\">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>(IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature on electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 300 conferences annually. [8] The IET publishes 14 journals, has a worldwide membership of 120,000, certifies Chartered Engineers in the United Kingdom and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.
