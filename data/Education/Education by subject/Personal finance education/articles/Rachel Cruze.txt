Rachel Cruze (n√©e Ramsey; born April 25, 1988) is an American author who writes about finances.   She is acknowledged as an authority on the subject of personal finance.     Her book Smart Money Smart Kids, co-authored with her father, Dave Ramsey, achieved number one on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2014.  Her second book Love Your Life, Not Theirs: 7 Money Habits for Living the Life You Want was published in 2016. Cruze has spoken in public on numerous subjects related to personal finance, such as how to avoid debt and how to save for purchasing a home.  She has spoken at conferences, student forums, businesses, and churches around the United States, and advocates using debit cards instead of credit cards as a way to control spending, and to never spend beyond one's means, which "requires a discipline and a mindset that often goes against the grain of our instantly gratified society," she said in an interview in the Kansas City Star.  In 2014 her video blog was launched. With her father, she presented The Legacy Journey, a media event using cinemas nationwide to disseminate their message of financial discipline.   Cruze has appeared on various TV shows, talking about her books and what she learned as a child, and include Good Morning America, The Today Show, The Meredith Vieira Show, Katie, Good Day L.A.,  and Fox and Friends. Together with her father, Cruze's book Smart Money Smart Kids was published by Thomas Nelson in 2014 and became a New York Times best seller, and achieved similar recognition from The Wall Street Journal and Publishers Weekly. Her other books include The Graduate's Survival Guide and Safeguarding Your Legacy. She has also contributed to the publication Woman's Day.
