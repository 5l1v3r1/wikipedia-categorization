 Money Moron is a Canadian television series hosted by Gail Vaz-Oxlade. Similar to her first two shows, Til Debt Do Us Part and Prince$$, Vaz-Oxlade helps people with money and debt problems. In Money Moron, a "moron" is nominated by someone to get help to be more financially responsible. If they follow through and do all of the challenges Vaz-Oxlade gives them, they will receive up to $10,000.  The purpose is not just to solve their money problems but to heal the relationship between the person nominated and the one who nominated them.  Season 1: Season 2:
