The Global Studies Consortium (GSC) is an international academic association of over 20 institutions of higher learning. It seeks to "promote and facilitate graduate teaching programs in global studies and to foster cooperation among them."   That cooperation includes exchange of materials and development of methods to survey outcomes,  annual meetings, and a student exchange program. GSC deals only with graduate level programs, and there is no comparable association for undergraduate degree programs in global studies.  The GSC was founded at a meeting of representatives of university global studies programs held in February 2007 at the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies of the University of California at Santa Barbara.  It has been influential in defining the new field of global studies.  GSC is linked to global-e: A Global Studies Journal.  The member programs of the GSC  are listed by continent below: In 2014, GSC started an exchange program called Student Mobility Scheme.  As of 2016, four of the member institutions participate: American University in Cairo; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Shanghai University; and Sophia University. The GSC has held meetings every year following the 2007 workshop at UCSB where it was founded:
