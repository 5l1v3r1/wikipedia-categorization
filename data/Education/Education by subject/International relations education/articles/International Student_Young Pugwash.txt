International Student/Young Pugwash (ISYP) is an international organization that promotes awareness and action among students and young professionals in relation to ethical implications of science and technology policy, particularly matters of international security and weapons of mass destruction. It developed from the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. Students have been invited as participants in Pugwash Conferences since the early 1970s. Following interest to create a forum specifically for students, student/young Pugwash groups started to form in the late 70s, Student Pugwash USA doing so in 1979. International collaboration among the groups began in 1988 in the Netherlands for the first jointly organized IS/YP conference. Student pre-conferences to the annual Pugwash Conferences began at the 1997 Pugwash Conference held in Norway. ISYP's members comprise national groups, which themselves may comprise loose or formal collections of school or university chapters. National entities include Student Pugwash USA (SPUSA), the largest, and Student Pugwash UK (SPUK) among others.
