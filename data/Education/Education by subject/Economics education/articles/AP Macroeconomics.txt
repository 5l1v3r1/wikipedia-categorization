Advanced Placement Macroeconomics (also known as AP Macroeconomics, AP Macro, APMa, or simply Macro) is an Advanced Placement macroeconomics course and exam offered by the College Board. Study begins with fundamental economic concepts such as scarcity, opportunity costs, production possibilities, specialization, comparative advantage, demand, supply, and price determination. Major topics include measurement of economic performance, national income and price determination, fiscal and monetary policy, and international economics and growth. AP Macroeconomics is frequently taught in conjunction with (and, in some cases, in the same year as) AP Microeconomics, although more students take the former.
