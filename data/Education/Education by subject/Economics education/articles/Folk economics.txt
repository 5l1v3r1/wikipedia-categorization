Folk economics is the intuitive economics of untrained people.   It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human intelligence.  In the evolutionary environment, life was static; there was essentially no economic growth and no innovation.  Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple.  Thus, our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy.  While there were many implications of such an economy,one of the most important is that we evolved to be zero-sum thinkers.  that is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms.  This leads to fallacies such as dislike of international trade and immigration.  Indeed, zero-sum thinking is probably the most important source of inefficient economic policies.
