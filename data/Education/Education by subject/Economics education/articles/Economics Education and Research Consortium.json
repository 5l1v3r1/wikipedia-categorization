Established in <a href=\"/wiki/Kiev\" title=\"Kiev\">Kiev</a> in 1995, the organization supports policy-research, training, workshops and research infrastructure as part of the wider <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Development_Network\" title=\"Global Development Network\">Global Development Network</a>'s operations in post-Soviet states. The work of the EERC is supported by a panel of international donor organizations that joined forces in 1995 to modernize <a href=\"/wiki/Economics_education\" title=\"Economics education\">economics education</a> and research in the CIS. The members of the Consortium are: the <a href=\"/wiki/Eurasia_Foundation\" title=\"Eurasia Foundation\">Eurasia Foundation</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Carnegie_Corporation_of_New_York\" title=\"Carnegie Corporation of New York\">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_Finland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Government of Finland\">Government of Finland</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Global_Development_Network\" title=\"Global Development Network\">Global Development Network</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Interpipe_Group\" title=\"Interpipe Group\">Interpipe Group</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Open_Society_Institute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Open Society Institute\">Open Society Institute</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_Sweden\" title=\"Government of Sweden\">Government of Sweden</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Bank\" title=\"World Bank\">World Bank</a>. Support for EERC has also been provided by the <a href=\"/wiki/Citigroup\" title=\"Citigroup\">Citigroup</a> Foundation, <a href=\"/wiki/ING_Bank\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ING Bank\">ING Bank</a> Ukraine, Industrial Union of Donbas, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, Kraft Foods Ukraina, the Kytasty Foundation, National Bank of Ukraine, <a href=\"/wiki/Tetra_Pak\" title=\"Tetra Pak\">Tetra Pak</a> Ukraine, the Pew Charitable Trusts, Slavutich, Soyuz-Victan, and Swedbank (previously TAS-Kommerzbank). The EERC's mission is also supported by a range of corporate sponsors, such as  AcadEx Ltd., <a href=\"/wiki/Coca-Cola\" title=\"Coca-Cola\">Coca-Cola</a> Beverages Ukraine, Eastern Economist, <a href=\"/wiki/Kraft_Foods\" title=\"Kraft Foods\">Kraft Foods</a> Ukraina, JSC Obolon, Orfey Publications, <a href=\"/wiki/Oriflame\" title=\"Oriflame\">Oriflame</a> Ukraine, Robert <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Bosch_GmbH\" title=\"Robert Bosch GmbH\">Bosch</a> Ukraine, Sun Interbrew, System Integration (SI) <a href=\"/wiki/IBM\" title=\"IBM\">IBM</a> partner, <a href=\"/wiki/US_Embassy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"US Embassy\">US Embassy</a> to Ukraine.\n</p><p>The Consortium has two distinct programs - one in <a href=\"/wiki/Ukraine\" title=\"Ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and the other in <a href=\"/wiki/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a>. In Ukraine at the <a href=\"/wiki/National_University_of_Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy\" title=\"National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy\">National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy</a>, the EERC has established the two-year English-language master\u2019s program in <a href=\"/wiki/Economics\" title=\"Economics\">economics</a> that produces Ukrainian economist trained in modern market economics. The intent is to position these economists as future leaders in Ukraine\u2019s economic policy circles through post-<a href=\"/wiki/Master_of_Arts\" title=\"Master of Arts\">MA</a> careers in public service, research institute, or private sector positions, or through completing <a href=\"/wiki/PhD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PhD\">PhDs</a> abroad and returning to Ukraine to teach. Having achieved initial success in its teaching program, the longer-term aim of the EERC is to create a local centre for academic excellence in economics. By enabling graduates with Western training to return to Ukraine to teach and conduct research, EERC hopes to encourage the development of a dynamic economics community in Ukraine.\n</p><p>In Russia, the mission has been established to encourage the application of modern economics theory to policy analysis and to facilitate the creation of an economic policy community in Russia and elsewhere in the CIS, EERC operates a Moscow-based Economics Research Network which provides individual economists in the region with research funding, advanced training, and professional networking opportunities at home and abroad. Since 2000, EERC-Russia has been serving as the regional representative of the Global Development Network (GDN) in CIS countries. The EERC also holds semi-annual grant competitions and other tenders for research on specific topics, and hosts workshops and produces working papers on relevant economic policy questions in the CIS. Researchers and projects supported reach right across the CIS, and the EERC facilitates networking and resource sharing between researchers and institutions to foster a policy community and network of exchange on economic questions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Economics_Education_and_Research_Consortium&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.eerc.ru\">http://www.eerc.ru</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kse.org.ua\">http://www.kse.org.ua</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Kyiv_School_of_Economics\" title=\"Kyiv School of Economics\">Kyiv School of Economics</a>)</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2275\nCached time: 20180918024438\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.014 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 30/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:8325037-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918024438 and revision id 660470039\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"uk","url":"https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/EERC","langname":"Ukrainian","autonym":"\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430","*":"EERC"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Economics_education"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Carnegie Corporation of New York"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Citigroup"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Coca-Cola"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Economics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Economics education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Eurasia Foundation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Global Development Network"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Government of Finland"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Government of Sweden"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"IBM"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"ING Bank"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Interpipe Group"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kiev"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kraft Foods"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Kyiv School of Economics"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Master of Arts"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Open Society Institute"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Oriflame"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"PhD"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Robert Bosch GmbH"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Russia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Tetra Pak"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"US Embassy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ukraine"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"World Bank"}],"templates":[],"images":["Logo_of_Economics_Education_and_Research_Consortium.png"],"externallinks":["http://www.eerc.ru","http://www.kse.org.ua"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Economics_Education_and_Research_Consortium","byteoffset":3540,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Economics Education and Research Consortium","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q5333565"}]}}
