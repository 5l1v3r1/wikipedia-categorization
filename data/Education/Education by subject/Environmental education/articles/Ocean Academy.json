The students, referred to as \u201cBioNauts,\u201d explore the marine world in an interactive, hands-on way. The BioNauts participate in PADI <a href=\"/wiki/Scuba_diving\" title=\"Scuba diving\">SCUBA</a> certification courses by a BIOS dive instructor as well as participate in research based field trips, team building exercises, and lab work.  During the 2011 summer, the Waterstart students worked with Texas A&amp;M marine archeologists as they excavated a shipwreck.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"BIOS_Explorer_Program\">BIOS Explorer Program</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ocean_Academy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: BIOS Explorer Program\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The BIOS Explorer Program is an interactive, year-round science program based on the internationally successful <a href=\"/wiki/JASON_Project\" title=\"JASON Project\">JASON Project</a>.

They work side-by-side with BIOS scientists during their eight-week stay on the BIOS station. Students must be at least 16 years old and from Bermuda.  They spend their eight weeks working with a faculty mentor on a research project and are required to give presentations about their project throughout the summer.\n</p><p>Past projects include: \n</p>\n<ul><li>The ecology of reef zones</li>\n<li>Investigation in the aging of the sea urchin, Lytechinus variegatus</li>\n<li>The biological pump</li>\n<li>Coral health near areas of human impact</li>\n<li>Educational outreach with BIOS summer programs.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Marine_Science_Internship\">The Marine Science Internship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ocean_Academy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: The Marine Science Internship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Similar to the Bermuda Program, the Marine Science Internship (MSI) at BIOS focuses on life and work on a scientific station.  MSI students focus on science diving and experimental techniques, while working on small projects and logging science dives. Students participate in lectures, labs, field trips, dive training and science dives over the course of their three-week session.  To be eligible for the MSI, students must have an Advanced Open Water Diving certification card and be CPR certified.  Two slots from each session are reserved for Bermudian students.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2225\nCached time: 20180921091819\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 16/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:32380243-0!canonical and timestamp 20180921091819 and revision id 678509677\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Environmental_education"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bermuda"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"JASON Project"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Scuba diving"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Waterstart","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Ocean_Academy","byteoffset":223,"anchor":"Waterstart"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"BIOS Explorer Program","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Ocean_Academy","byteoffset":740,"anchor":"BIOS_Explorer_Program"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The Bermuda Program","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Ocean_Academy","byteoffset":1021,"anchor":"The_Bermuda_Program"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"The Marine Science Internship","number":"4","index":"4","fromtitle":"Ocean_Academy","byteoffset":1689,"anchor":"The_Marine_Science_Internship"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Ocean Academy","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7075927"}]}}
