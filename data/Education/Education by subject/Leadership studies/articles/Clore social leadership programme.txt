The Clore Social Leadership Programme (Clore Social) was established in 2008 to develop and strengthen leadership skills and capacity across the social sector. Clore Social was initiated by the Clore Duffield Foundation and inspired by its sister programme, the Clore Leadership Programme for the creative and cultural sectors. Its founding director was Dame Mary Marsh. Clore Social identifies, connects and develops leaders through its fully funded fellowship programme and works with people, partners and funders across all sectors to offer a holistic approach to developing leaders for social impact. So far 101 fellows have joined its network. It is run by a small staff team from its office in Kings Cross, London.
