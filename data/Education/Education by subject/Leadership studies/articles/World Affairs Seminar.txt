World Affairs Seminar (WAS) is an annual week-long international student leadership conference. The program, whose theme changes each year, discusses the ways in which young leaders can promote change and become involved in finding solutions to current world issues.  This event's audience mainly consists of students aged 16â€“18 within the United States, Canada, and other countries around the world. These students are considered delegates of their area. The conference has given students exposure to people who have worked in government, international organizations, media, and business. The World Affairs Seminar was founded in 1977 by professors Gaylon Greenhill and Dale Brock.[where?] Brock became the first WAS General Manager. In 2017, its fortieth year, students from 35 countries attended. WAS has covered topics including human rights, nuclear arms control and disarmament, economics, environmental issues, global health, globalization, security, and global leadership, with an emphasis on ways that students can make a difference in their communities and beyond.   Rotary District 6270 economically assists students who have shown leadership in their community, exceptional work in their school studies, and dedication in helping their communities.   Other organizations that sponsor students include: Lion's Club, local school districts, Kiwanis, and Optimist Clubs
