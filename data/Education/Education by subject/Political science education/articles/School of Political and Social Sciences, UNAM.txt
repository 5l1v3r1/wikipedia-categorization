The Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales (FCPyS, Faculty of Political and Social Sciences) is a faculty within Mexico's Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), responsible for directing research and teaching programs in the fields of political science and social science. It was first established in 1951 as the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales (ENCPyS, National School of Political and Social Sciences), before its conversion to full faculty status from 26 January 1968. FCPyS offers five academic degrees at the Licenciatura (undergraduate) level, in public administration, Communication studies, political science, international relations, sociology and anthropology. At a postgraduate level FCPyS offers Maestrías (Master's degrees) in five areas of study, and a Doctorado (doctorate) in political and social science that is oriented to one of five specialities. FCPyS also operates and has responsibility for a number of specialised semi-autonomous research institutions, such as the Centro de Relaciones Internacionales (CRI).
