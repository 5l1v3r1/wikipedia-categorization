The Tehran School of Political Science (Persian: مدرسه علوم سياسی تهران‎ Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi), was one of the first modern institutions of higher education in Iran at the turn of the twentieth century. Most of the nation's political elite graduated from the school.  The School of Political Science was founded in 1899 by Hassan Pirnia. It was run by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It later merged with the School of Law (Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq), which had been established in 1918, to form the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the University of Tehran in 1933. Many of the school's faculty and alumni later became ministers and political figures in Iran. Notable examples are:
