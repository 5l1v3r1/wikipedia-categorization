Cand.scient.pol. (i.e. Latin candidatus/candidata scientiarum politicarum, also translated into Danish as kandidat i statskundskab,  "candidate of political science") is a candidate's degree, viz. an advanced degree, in political science, awarded by several Danish universities. The degree currently requires 5 years of studies, historically 6 years. The current 5-year degree is, since 2009, translated into English as "Master of Science in Political Science". The equivalent degree used in Norway (until 2008) was called cand.polit. In Denmark, cand.polit. is a degree in economics. 20% of all members of parliament hold a cand.scient.pol. degree.
