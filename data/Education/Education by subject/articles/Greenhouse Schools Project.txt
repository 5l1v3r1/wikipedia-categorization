Greenhouse Sports aims to develop social, thinking, emotional and physical skills for young people in Londonâ€™s communities through sports programmes delivered by coaches. Greenhouse Sports (originally Greenhouse Schools Project and then later Greenhouse Charity) was founded in 2002 when Chief Executive and founder, Michael de Giorgio, set up a multisports pilot to give young people on a local housing estate something positive to do in the school holidays. In 2004 the organisation then moved their programmes full-time into schools.
