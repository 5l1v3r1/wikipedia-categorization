Business Technology Management (BTM) is an emerging trans-disciplinary research area and professional discipline in Business Administration. Building upon other business disciplines, such as Management Information Systems (MIS) and Technology and Innovation Management (TIM), it seeks to provide an integrated framework for the strategic use of technology and the digital transformation of organizations. BTM is evolving similarly to other research areas in business, e.g., professional disciplines of Change Management (CM) and Management Consulting, developed from foundations in Organizational Behavior (OB), Strategic Management (SM), and Operations Management (OM). A new BTM program accreditation standard has been developed by ITAC Talent, a division of the IT Association of Canada.  It was mandated by the Government of Canada to develop and update the educational standards of BTM programs in the country.
