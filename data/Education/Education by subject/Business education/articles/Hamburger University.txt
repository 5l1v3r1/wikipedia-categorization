Hamburger University is a 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) training facility of McDonald's, located in Oak Brook, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago. This corporate university was designed to instruct personnel employed by McDonald's in the various aspects of restaurant management. More than 80,000 restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators have "graduated" from this facility.  Since its establishment, Hamburger University has been situated on an 80 acres (32 ha) campus. Restaurant employees receive approximately 32 hours of training in their first month with McDonald's and more than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year. Founder Ray Kroc oversaw lessons at its beginning. In 2016 McDonald's Corporation announced it would move its U.S. and world headquarters including Hamburger University from its long time home in Oak Brook to a newly built complex on property which formerly housed Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios in Chicago.    Starting in 2017 McDonald's put up for sale or sold most of its Oak Brook campus. Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy, Hamburger... The Motion Picture.  It was also spoofed by McDonald's itself in a commercial with Ronald McDonald in which several animatronic hamburgers were shown graduating from school.
