Edward L Susantha Silva  The Institute of Business Studies formerly (IBS) now IBSUniversity is a tertiary education provider in Papua New Guinea, offering academic and professional courses in the fields of Accounting, Business and Information Technology. IBSU offers a combination of locally developed and International courses ranging from Certificates, Diploma’s and Degrees. IBS was originally set up in 1989 by entrepreneur Mick Nades. It provided revision classes for the Papua New Guinea Institute of Accountants (PNGIA) professional exams, at which time none existed. At its inception, there were only nine qualified Papua New Guinean Accountants amongst the cohort of 300+ Commerce/Accounting graduates from the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) and the University of Technology (UNITECH). IBS produced the first two female Accountants of Papua New Guinea. The Institute’s objective was to enhance the prospects for Papua New Guineans to study and further their careers in Accounting, Business and Computing. • School of Accounting • School of Business • School of Information Technology  • School of Economics The IBS Journal of Business and Research focuses on the current business and development issues and their effect in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and South Pacific Region.  http://www.ibs.ac.pg  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Financial_Mgt/PNG/chap_05.pdf
