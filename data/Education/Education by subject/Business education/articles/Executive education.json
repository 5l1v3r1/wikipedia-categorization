Sloan\">Alfred P. Sloan</a> School of Management, which in 1914 began offering Course XV, Engineering Administration, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. At that time, the concept of providing business training in the academic environment was gaining popularity, thus MIT created a program \u201cspecially designed to train men to be competent managers of businesses that have much to do with engineering problems.\u201d Harvard also began offering short five-week selections of standard MBA material in the late 1920s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-t_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-t-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1930 Course XV at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php\">MIT</a> became an independent department and was named the Department of Business and Engineering Administration. In 1931 an innovative program for executive development was initiated with the backing of several industrialists. This one-year program \u2014 offering graduate study in the fundamentals of management and decision-making \u2014 was aimed at young managers who were nominated by their employers and was highly competitive. In 1938 the program received full funding by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was formally named the MIT Sloan Fellowship Program for Executive Development at MIT.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Executive Education in the United States developed critical mass after World War II. The Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944 \u2014 commonly known as the <a href=\"/wiki/GI_Bill_of_Rights\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GI Bill of Rights\">GI Bill of Rights</a> \u2014 allowed veterans to take advantage of education benefits.  Many studied business in college, a privilege previously only enjoyed by the wealthy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-gibill_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gibill-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Subsequent executive education programs, including the 13-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard University and the four-week Institute for Management at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Commerce (now the Kellogg School of Management), developed in response to the need to rapidly train line executives for general management in the post World War II era.\n</p><p>By the late 1970s nearly 20 business schools in the United States were offering some form of executive education. The science of business also was developing at a rapid pace as faculty, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Porter\" title=\"Michael Porter\">Michael Porter</a> (Harvard ) and <a href=\"/wiki/C._K._Prahalad\" title=\"C. K. Prahalad\">C. K.

These and other respected academic business thinkers \u2014 Don Hambrick, Ram Charan, David Ulrich, Michael Hammer, Gary Hamel and many others \u2014 are the true pioneers of executive education and the ongoing effort to facilitate wealth creation and other new concepts aimed at making stronger businesses while improving the welfare of the world.\n</p><p>Throughout the 1970s university-based executive education continued to evolve as an industry. Several on-campus residential facilities were constructed at several universities, demonstrating the value of a standalone facility dedicated to executive education programs. This spurred the development of such facilities at schools nationwide and the subsequent expansion of short open enrollment programs. The industry\u2019s exclusive professional association, The International University Consortium for Executive Education,<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> also came into existence during this period. UNICON began sponsoring a tradeshow in the 1970s for companies interested in learning about university-based executive education and an annual conference for members. UNICON has since grown into a consortium of nearly 100 universities with executive education programs around the globe. It sponsors three annual conferences that allow members to share best practices, conducts research into topics of concern and provides benchmarking data for members.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Executive education further developed in the 1980s and 1990s as the increasing pace and scope of global business demanded higher levels of education among employees. The <a href=\"/wiki/Dot-com_bubble\" title=\"Dot-com bubble\">dot-com</a> boom further changed the scope of the business landscape by favoring employees and organizations that were quick to adapt to change.
