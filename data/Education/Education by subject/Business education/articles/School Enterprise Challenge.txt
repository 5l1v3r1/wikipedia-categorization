The School Enterprise Challenge is an international competition for schools to establish profitable student-led businesses.  It aims to develop young peopleâ€™s business and soft skills to better prepare them for the world of work and to develop their capacities as socially responsible entrepreneurs. The income generated from these businesses moreover can provide a useful additional source of funds for less well-resourced schools in developing countries, or can be used to support social projects in the community by better resourced schools. The competition since its launch in 2011 has benefited over 80,000 young people directly from over 90 countries and has been recognized internationally for its positive social impact, including as one of the WISE Awards 2014 finalists.
