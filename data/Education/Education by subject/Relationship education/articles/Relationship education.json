It\u2019s Your Ship, You\u2019re the Captain</b>: Relationship education is about helping people find strategies and solutions that fit for their unique circumstances, values and relationship goals. That includes respecting their own personal responsibility for their success and the decisions they make for their lives. Evidence-based skills training provides techniques that are easy to understand and use to surface greater awareness of what lies beneath the tip of the iceberg, navigate typical relationship challenges, and overcome differences that are a natural part of any close relationship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>2. One Mouth, Two Ears</b>: Relationship education provides safe, time-limited structures for conversations that matter, which are often much more about listening than talking. Learning to actively listen with empathy and respect to another person\u2019s perspective and experience \u2013without judgment, defensiveness, blame, or an effort to quickly try to \u201cfix\u201d the issue or the person \u2014 makes it safer for intimates to develop greater awareness of themselves and each other.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>3. Riding the Waves</b>: Relationship education teaches practical, usable skills for better understanding and safely expressing the full range of emotions, including anger, sadness and fear. Upsetting feelings held in eventually either implode or explode. Confiding painful feelings to a significant other leaves more room to experience feelings of love, pleasure and happiness. Just as the most powerful waves lose their energy when they break against the shore, the same is generally true of emotions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>4. It\u2019s Rarely the Problem that\u2019s the Problem</b>: Relationship education enables distressed couples \u2014 with good will towards each other, openness to learning, and a desire for the relationship to succeed \u2014 to deal with differences and problems in ways that often lead to greater closeness, understanding, acceptance and commitment. The issues that surface are typically symptoms of communication breakdowns, hidden assumptions and expectations, behaviors that come from holding in upsetting feelings, or lack of skills for constructive conflict resolution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>5. Love is a Feeling</b>: Relationship education helps people develop their emotional intelligence, including understanding that feelings of love come from the anticipation of pleasure in our interactions with others. If instead of anticipating pleasure, we expect pain, feelings of love are unlikely to survive, let alone thrive. What\u2019s a pleasure changes during different stages and passages of life. Sustaining feelings of love requires learning what it takes in today\u2019s circumstances to stay a pleasure in each other\u2019s lives. And doing it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>6. Marriage is a Contract</b>: Relationship education recognizes that although nearly all traditional marriage vows include the promise to \u201clove \u2018till death do us part,\u201d the marriage contract itself cannot be dependent on \u201cfeelings\u201d of love, which naturally wax and wane. That doesn\u2019t mean commitment or obligations wax and wane. Emotions are affected by many factors, often unrelated to issues inside our closest relationships. Marriage is the glue that\u2019s meant to hold couples and families together during periods of growth, change and challenge that are natural part of life.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>7. Relationships are Work</b>: Relationship education is built on the understanding that what happens in our closest relationships impacts quality of life, fulfillment, happiness, and the ability to pursue cherished dreams and aspirations. Relationships take regular attention. Without intentionally nurturing relationships, it\u2019s easy to become strangers, for relationships to wither and become vulnerable. Beyond staying a pleasure in each other\u2019s lives, the work of an intimate relationship is to consistently meet each other\u2019s needs for bonding (emotional and physical closeness). Relationship education provides a road map and usable skills for sustaining healthy relationships that are an ongoing source of love, pleasure, happiness, and fulfillment for both partners.<sup id=\"cite_ref-principles_13-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-principles-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-reform_14-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-reform-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Qualities_of_effective_relationship_educators\">Qualities of effective relationship educators</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Qualities of effective relationship educators\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/PAIRS_Foundation\" title=\"PAIRS Foundation\">PAIRS Foundation</a> defines the qualities of effective relationship educators to include:<sup id=\"cite_ref-peluso_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-peluso-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>Personal Qualities</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Warmth, optimism, authenticity, poise, and maturity</li>\n<li>Emotionally stable and comfortable with emotional intensity</li>\n<li>Appropriate professional appearance and grooming</li>\n<li>At ease with groups</li>\n<li>Asks for help when needed</li></ul>\n<p><b>Presentation Qualities</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fully prepared for each class with clear, organized presentations</li>\n<li>Speaks clearly with appropriate pacing, expression, and is easily understood</li>\n<li>Relevant and appropriate self-disclosure</li>\n<li>Avoids wordiness, professional jargon, terminology</li>\n<li>Use of appropriate humor</li>\n<li>Establishes group rapport</li>\n<li>Avoids inappropriate comments or offensive behavior</li>\n<li>Knowledge of the curriculum and its intended purpose</li>\n<li>Provides clear and accurate direction</li>\n<li>Stays within boundaries and topics of each class</li>\n<li>Effectively teaches evidence-based curriculum content as it is written</li>\n<li>Covers all required material and exercises within time allowed</li>\n<li>Handles transitions effectively</li>\n<li>Appropriately evaluates and reads participant responses</li>\n<li>Receives positive evaluations from class participants</li></ul>\n<p><b>Presenting as a Couple or Team</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Works cooperatively with staff and team members</li>\n<li>Authentically models curriculum tools and values</li></ul>\n<p><b>Ethical Practices</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Knowledge, understanding, and adherence to Ethical practices<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Understands and respects the vulnerabilities of class participants</li>\n<li>Ability to maintain a safe educational environment, including appropriate boundaries</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Relationship_education_for_U.S._Veterans\">Relationship education for U.S. Veterans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Relationship_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Relationship education for U.S. Veterans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Veterans Health Administration announced a nationwide relationship education initiative for Veterans in October 2012.

Using meta-analytic methods of current best practices to look across the entire body of published and unpublished evaluation research on premarital education, we found a more complex pattern of results. We coded 47 studies and found that premarital education programs do not improve relationship quality/satisfaction when unpublished studies are included in the analysis, although studies that follow couples past the honeymoon stage to detect prevention effects are rare. In contrast, premarital education programs appear to be effective at improving couple communication, with studies that employed observational measures rather than self-report measures producing large effects.
