When instructing students use shorter sentences, use gestures or demonstrations as supplement to verbal cues, repeat directions and have students repeat directions back to you, provide praise often, and give more feedback.\n</p><p>The next set of modifications deal with practice. Give students extra practice trials, build in more time for a student to master skills, make sure activities are perceived as fun, promote active participation, shorten activities to reduce problems with attention span, and allow choices in what activity will be done, when it will be done, where it will take place, and with whom the child will participate in the activity with. One method to structure activities is known as level teaching. To accommodate for students with varying levels of intellectual disabilities a game will be designed with different levels. For example, if the specific sport is volleyball the instructor will set up 3 courts with different modifications at each court to accommodate for these varying levels of disability. Court 1 may have a set of cones designating opposing sides while Court 3 has a net set in place. Different rules may be applied to different courts as well, allowing every student to be challenged in a constructive way.\n</p><p>The third set of modifications deal with curriculum. Adjust the general education curriculum to meet the needs of a student. For example, reduce the number of objectives that need to be mastered. If a student is severely delayed, an entirely new curriculum may need to be made. Activities may also need to provide early success which will encourage adherence.\n</p><p>The final set of modifications deal with the environment. It should be structured and visually appealing. It is essential to reduce playing areas in order to eliminate distractions. Plan to structure the environment in a way that will allow you to deal with behavioral problems. <sup id=\"cite_ref-:03_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learning_disabilities\">Learning disabilities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adapted_physical_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Learning disabilities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>1 in 5 students with learning disabilities will also have motor impairments. There are a number of ways to accommodate these students.\n</p><p>Reduce class size: This allows teacher extra one on one time with students. Often a class of 20-30 students proves to be more effective than double or triple that in general physical education classes.\n</p><p>Use peer tutors: Peers can be rained in how to provide specific skill feedback as well as modify activities so the student has higher success. This can be effective when class size cannot be reduced.\n</p><p>Offer learning strategies: Both teachers and peer tutors can provide strategies to help disorganized learners focus. This includes provided picture cues, video cues, and additional cues such as footprints on the floor to help a student understand what and how to perform an activity.\n</p><p>Provide structured practice: Allow the student to get many practice opportunities. This will help them learn how to listen to and observe visual feedback for performance.\n</p><p>Identify success: Reframe success for students in a way that does not focus on the end result. For example, using correct form in shooting should be a measure of success rather than making the basket.\n</p><p>Use a variety of senses when giving instructions: Some students do better listening to instruction while others do better watching a demonstration. Others may do best when physically guided into the pattern. By incorporating many types of learning styles, students will be more likely to succeed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:03_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ADHD\">ADHD</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adapted_physical_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: ADHD\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Students with <a href=\"/wiki/Attention-deficit/hyperactivity_disorder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</a> may experience motor learning delays.

Task sheets can be turned in at the end of class. This allows students to assess their performance while acknowledging their need to improve their skills.\n</p><p>Token economy or point system: This is a structured agreement between the student and teacher in which the student earns rewards by meeting a minimum expectation. At the end of class both the student and teacher initial the points earned.

It is also important to prepare the student. The physical education environment may be anxiety inducing for them. Because of this, educators can slowly introduce the student to the environment. They may also preview the class using visual organizers to describe the setting the student will be a part of. They may also make visual schedules prior to class. It is also important to prepare the peers by teaching them what autism is and behaviors associated with it.\n</p><p>Instructing the student: There are a variety of methods for instructing students with autism. The first, environmental prompts. This involves the intentional use of equipment to encourage specific behaviors. The next is verbal prompts. This includes avoiding negative sentences. For example, instruction such as \"step with your right leg\" as opposed to \"don't step with your left leg\". Verbal prompts also include keeping phrases literal as well as provided concise instruction. It is also important to be consistent with language use. Peer tutors may also provide a lot of benefits for students in the physical education setting.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:03_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Deafness\">Deafness</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adapted_physical_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Deafness\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Being deaf or hard of hearing typically has little impact on the development of motor skills, fitness levels, and participation in sports. However, it is still important to accommodate students who are deaf or hard of hearing in the physical education setting.\n</p><p>Communicate using his or her preferred means of communication. When giving verbal instructions, make sure the student can see the instructors face clearly. Make sure you speak clearly and at a normal rate. Incorporate visual aids that have images or descriptive words. Repeat comments or questions made by the student's classmates. This helps all students alike. Check for understanding by asking students to repeat directions or demonstrate a skill. If an interpreter is involved, make sure to speak directly to the student, rather than the interpreter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:03_13-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Visual_impairments\">Visual impairments</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adapted_physical_education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Visual impairments\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Children with visual impairments can play all of the same sports as their sighted peers, with some modifications.

Children with visual impairments and blindness may need more instruction and practice time to learn new concepts and movements. It is suggested that students receive pre-teaching before the start of a new unit. This can be done before school, after school, during orientation, or at home.
