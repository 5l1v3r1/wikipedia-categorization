If the person hits the wall and the ball bounces out of play the person next in line loses a life. People first decide who serves. This procedure varies, but is usually the winner of the previous game or the person who got the ball (if that would be the first game), or the new person coming in. The server first hits the ball forward and down so that it hits the ground and bounces up to hit the wall. (If the server is a good sport, an easy ball is started with to get the game going.) If it bounces on the ground more than once or if it doesn't bounce on the ground before it hits the wall, it is considered out. Then, after hitting the ball, the ball would bounce back, and the next person would do the same thing. If the ball bounces more than once before the second player hits it the second person is out, but hitting the ball before it bounces is allowed after the first person hits the ball. If the ball bounces out of bounds (the boundaries are usually determined by the orange lines surrounding the field) at any time, it is considered out, and if it hits the orange line, it is sometimes considered in, sometimes considered out, and sometimes considered a \"liney\" or \"liner\" in which the game stops and the person who made the liney serves again. The goal is to get the person behind you out by hitting it with the right force and in the right direction. There are sometimes rules called \"first serves\", in which the server doesn't get out until the third time the server gets out.\n</p><p>There are many variations to the rules, but the rules above are the classic ones. Babies, in which the ball on the second bounce is smaller than the closest interior orange line to the wall (there are two orange lines; one is about three-four feet from the wall, and the other one is about two-thirds of the court away from the wall) and sliceys (or skimmers), where the ball goes at an extremely high speed and extremely low height, are very common varying things (in or out).\n</p><p>There are four main types of wallball: regular, teams, line-up, and random.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Regular is where the players line up outside of the court on a bench (which is usually present) or standing if there is no bench, and two players enter the court. They play, and the losing player goes to the end of the line, and the next person comes up.</li>\n<li>Teams is the same as regular, except that there are four (or more, but even) players that come up (grouped in equal teams).</li>\n<li>Line-up is where all the players line up in a line that is either determined by the winning person or in \"random order\", where the players pick the order, and they play in order (the server goes after the last person).</li>\n<li>Random is where all the players are scattered around the court, the server serves, and a random person (whoever wants to hit the ball) comes up and hits the ball. In random, when nobody hits the ball, players determine who is out by either considering it a re-do (the server or another person serves again), \"flinching\" (the person who reacts to the ball in a fashion that looks like the player is going to hit the ball), nearest person (the closest person to the ball is out), or a combination of nearest person and flinching (if somebody flinches, the flinching person is out; if nobody flinches, the nearest person is out).</li></ul>\n<p>In line-up or random, the winner of each game usually decides the rules and game style of the next game (usually with the classic rules, but the winner usually has the right to change them, though if enough people disagree, the idea is usually not used), and in regular or teams, the first person to beat the whole line gets to determine the rules and game style of the next game. If playing with a soccer ball/football, they have to hit it wherever it lies, if against\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alternative_Rules\">Alternative Rules</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wallball&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Alternative Rules\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Players stand a few feet away from the wall. They may only get three outs (no outs if you want the game to be endless). A player serves the ball by throwing directly at the wall. The ball then should return to another player. It is not an out if you get the ball again but is considered unfair if you intended to get the ball back (however, if the ball returns to you three times, it is formally known as a \"tea party\", and you are out). If the ball bounces first, it is an out. If you drop the ball or the ball hits you, you will have to get to the wall before someone else throws the ball and hits the wall or you will get an out. If you get the ball that is out-of-bounds, players are permitted to shout \"challenge!\" During challenges, you have to throw the ball from the same place where you picked up the ball. You may only take tiny steps then throw or move backwards. If you move anywhere else, you will get an out. These alternative rules are more common in the Midwest and <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>. In Australia however the rules are slightly different where there are rules for spiking. Spiking is when the ball hits another player on the full without bouncing and the player which is hit goes on the wall. Some versions are played using two walls adjacent to each other, called \"cube ball\" where the same rules apply except two walls are used instead of one. Another, called \"Aceball\", is similar to wallball except that the ball is hit on the wall without a bounce, then allowed to bounce once before a returning hit is required from the other player. Aceball can be played by kicking it as well, though it is no where near as prominent.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wallball_language\">Wallball language</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wallball&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Wallball language\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><b>Airplane</b>: Someone hits the ball onto the center of the wall but does not bounce before - aka Rocket.</li>\n<li><b>Angle</b>: Someone hits the ball in such a way that leads the ball out of the playing area.
