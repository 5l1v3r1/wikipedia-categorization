Kids Run Free is a British charity based in Warwickshire. It was founded by Martine Verweij and Catherine O'Carroll in December 2010. Kids Run Free organises monthly races for children aged between 0 and 16 years. Races take place on every first Saturday of the month. Organisers are committed to involving children regardless of their ability or socio economic background. Entrants are provided with individual  wristbands containing barcodes which collect finishing times. The first Kids Run Free event was held in Solihull in May 2011.  Other locations were launched in Leamington Spa in July 2011, Coventry in April 2012, and Birmingham in May 2012.  Since March 2012 former Olympic athlete and world record holder David Moorcroft has served as a patron for Kids Run Free. Moorcroft is actively involved with Kids Run Free events and was present at the launch of the charityâ€™s Coventry race location.  The Kids Run Free mascot was named following a competition held by the charity in February 2012. The competition winners chose to name the mascot 'Dash'.  Kids Run Free works in partnership with its sister organisation Raceways. Raceways is a Multisport Event Management company committed to organising races for adults.   The proceeds of Raceways events are donated to Kids Run Free.
