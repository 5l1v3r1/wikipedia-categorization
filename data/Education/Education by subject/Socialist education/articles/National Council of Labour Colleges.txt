The National Council of Labour Colleges (NCLC) was an organisation set up in the United Kingdom to foster working class self-education. The organisation was founded in 1921 as a co-ordinating body for the movement of labour colleges,  including the Central Labour College. The National Council of Labour Colleges absorbed the Plebs League the year after the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, and continued to publish the Plebs' Magazine.  In 1964, the NCLC merged with the Workers' Educational Trade Union Committee to form the Trades Union Congress Education Department.
