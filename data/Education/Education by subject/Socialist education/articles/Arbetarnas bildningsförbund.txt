Arbetarnas bildningsförbund (ABF) (the Workers' Educational Association) is the educational section of the Swedish labour movement. ABF conducts seminars, classes and study circles on a variety of subjects, including workshops, languages and music.  ABF was founded on 16 November 1912, by the Swedish Social Democratic Party and some of the trade unions.   Today, the main members of ABF are the Social Democrats and the Left Party. There are ABF locations in almost every Swedish town and several in the major cities. Its headquarters are on Olof Palmes gata, near Sveavägen street in Stockholm.  In Gothenburg, the ABF building is on Olof Palmes Gata, near Järntorget square.  The Moa Award (Swedish: Moa-priset) is an annual literary prize awarded jointly by ABF and the Moa Martinson Society to a person who writes in the spirit of Moa Martinson.  The prize has been awarded since 1989.
