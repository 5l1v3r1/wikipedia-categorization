The Surana and Surana Moots known for its transparency and ethical conduct of conducting moot courts and other allied competitions for law students in India is among the oldest, largest, and most prestigious moot court project in India  which has  students from India & SAARC countries (for international moots)  regularly participating. Since the mid-90's every year the law firm Surana and Surana International Attorneys have hosted, administered & sponsored over a  hundred  moot court competitions (the count is till 2013 and continuing) in partnership with India's  leading law schools. This project is one of the largest of its kind in the world by any law firm. In the academic initiatives taken by corporates, Surana & Surana stands as a benchmark in the whole legal fraternity. Probably this is what it means to be called as the "Pioneers of moot court competitions in India". The Surana and Surana Moots project was initiated by the founder of Surana and Surana International Attorneys, P.S.Surana.  One day in the late 80's, Honb'le Justice Krishna Iyer during his stay with the Surana family, spoke at length about the need to nurture young advocates with good advocacy skills. He was also concerned about the fact that bright young law graduates were joining the corporate sector, thereby depriving the Bar of a steady flow of good talent. This prompted  Mr. Surana  to plan  a well structured  & transparent moot court competition platform for  law students  to develop skills in oral and  written  advocacy  as well as legal research. The cases prepared for the competitions are based on either emerging or unsettled areas of law. This requires participants to come up with innovative arguments which in turn helps develop new jurisprudence. Members of the higher & lower judiciary have participated  in these moots  and have greatly  appreciated  the efforts  of Surana & Surana in developing legal skills among  generations of  budding lawyers. There are several new and exciting moots coming up in the year 2018. The details of some of these have been released on moot.in which is the official website for Surana & Surana Moots.
