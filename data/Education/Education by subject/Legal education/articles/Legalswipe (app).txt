Legalswipe is a free app that offers general legal advice and protection to people randomly stopped and questioned by police.   Christien Levien, a Canadian lawyer, conceived Legalswipe to educate civilians about their legal rights during their interaction with police. The idea of the app was born from Levien's encounter with police and his difficulty in navigating the legal system.     The free app, available for Apple and Android devices, informs its users about their rights and provides several key features through a series of simple contextual menus and cues:   When user feedback indicated that the navigation was challenging, the app was redesigned by a group of Humber College students in 2017.  Legalswipe has been favorably received and the object of a lot of attention from Canada and the United States.   Legalswipe was launched in June 2015 and has been downloaded over 15,000 times in its first two months.  The app has been endorsed by former Queenâ€™s Park speaker Alvin Curling and journalist Desmond Cole.
