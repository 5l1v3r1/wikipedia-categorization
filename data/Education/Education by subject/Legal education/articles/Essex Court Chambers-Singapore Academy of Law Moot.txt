The Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law Moot is an international moot competition for young practicing lawyers organised by Essex Court Chambers and Singapore Academy of Law. Whereas most moot competitions are only for students still in law school or who have not been called to the bar, the ECC-SAL Moot is only open to lawyers who have been qualified for practice for no more than three years. The first edition of the moot was held in 2012. The moot is open to lawyers from Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea, and is mainly judged by lawyers (including Queen's Counsel and Senior Counsel), academics, and judges in the region. It typically involves a commercial dispute between parties before the Singapore International Commercial Court. The top eight teams that qualify from the preliminary phase (two rounds) proceed to the knockout stages.
