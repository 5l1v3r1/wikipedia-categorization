The book collection was growing systematically as well as TBSP\u2019s activities \u2013 as early as in 1890s scientific and oratorical competitions, congresses and lectures were orgranised. The association was actively participating in patriotic initiatives in <a href=\"/wiki/Galicia_(Central_Europe)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Galicia (Central Europe)\">Galicia</a>.\n</p><p>During the years 1914-1915, when <a href=\"/wiki/Jagiellonian_University\" title=\"Jagiellonian University\">Jagiellonian University</a> was closed, TBSP moved to <a href=\"/wiki/Vienna\" title=\"Vienna\">Vienna</a> to continue its activities there and came back to <a href=\"/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w\" title=\"Krak\u00f3w\">Krak\u00f3w</a> after re-opening of the university. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Second_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second World War\">Second World War</a>, the association joined <a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_Poland_during_World_War_II\" title=\"Education in Poland during World War II\">underground education</a> and made its library (the part which has not been requisitioned yet) fully available to students. \nIn 1950, when <a href=\"/wiki/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a> found itself in the <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_Communism#Communism_in_Eastern_Europe_during_the_post-war_era\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"History of Communism\">Soviet zone of influence</a>, the association was formally liquidated, its headquarters taken over by university and its book collection \u2013 by the <a href=\"/wiki/Jagiellonian_Library\" title=\"Jagiellonian Library\">Jagiellonian Library</a>; scripts duplicating centre was suppressed. However TBSP\u2019s traditions were continued by informal circles of penal law students and historians of law.\nIn 1957 TBSP was officially reactivated, efforts have been made to recover the book collection. Since that time, the association has not been an independent entity but a unit of <a href=\"/wiki/Jagiellonian_University\" title=\"Jagiellonian University\">Jagiellonian University</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Activities\">Activities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Law_Students%27_Library_of_the_Jagiellonian_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Activities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>At present, TBSP unites about 1500 students and runs various educational and cultural activities. In the framework of 23 sections, additional classes are organised for younger students to help them prepare for participation in faculty competitions and final examinations. More advanced students participate in discussions and specialist workshops organised in cooperation with partner institutions and law firms. The association runs intensive publishing activities, just to mention regular Scientific Books of the TBSP UJ or repetitory courses for students. Traditionally, respective sections organise study trips to the <a href=\"/wiki/Constitutional_Tribunal_of_the_Republic_of_Poland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland\">Constitutional Tribunal</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Republic_of_Poland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland\">Supreme Court</a> etc., to help students to get to know most important <a href=\"/wiki/Politics_of_Poland\" title=\"Politics of Poland\">Polish institutions</a>. Each year various scientific congresses are organized, many of them of international dimension, while permanent evening meetings with the most prominent professors and law practitioners allow students to get some less formal contact with legal profession.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_ancient_members\">Notable ancient members</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Law_Students%27_Library_of_the_Jagiellonian_University&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Notable ancient members\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Prof. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fryderyk_Zoll&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Fryderyk Zoll (page does not exist)\">Fryderyk Zoll</a> (senior) (1834-1917) -
