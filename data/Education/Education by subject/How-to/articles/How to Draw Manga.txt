How to Draw Manga is a series of instructional books on drawing manga published by Graphic-sha, by a variety of authors. Originally in Japanese for the Japanese market, many volumes have been translated into English and published in the United States. Of the wide range of manga-how-tos available for westerners, the series is seen as one of the more useful, both for its provenance and wide range of practical tips.  The English-language volumes in the series were co-produced by Graphic-sha and two other Japanese companies, Japanime Co. Ltd. and Japan Publications Trading Co. This is a list of books in the main HTDM set and other sets that relate to the main series. Originally there were no volume numbers on the English versions, because the original Japanese version did not have them. Only volumes 1 - 8 were given numbers. With continued reprints and more books being released, all volumes gained a number. The dates given are the first printing. Several of these books have been discontinued, and are considered hard to find.  This set was printed in a smaller format of 15 cm x 21 cm.  Each volume in this set includes a CD-ROM for use with Windows only. These books are no longer in print and the series has been canceled. This set was printed in an over-sized format of 21 cm x 29.6 cm. This set is another Graphic-Sha publication that is shown alongside the main HTDM series on the dustjacks and in ads. Another set of manga-know-how with only four volumes, based in character creation. Note: Only three of the first printings for this series are below. These are volumes that were going to be released in English and even advertised for ordering, but they have been cancelled. A special edition of the series titled How to Draw Manga Special: Colored Original Drawing was produced detailing how to use Copic markers. It explains how to avoid blotches, use colorless blenders, select paper, refill markers, changing nibs and the airbrush system.
