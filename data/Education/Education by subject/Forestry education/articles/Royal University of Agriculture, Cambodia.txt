The Royal University of Agriculture (RUA) (Khmer: សាកលវិទ្យាល័យភូមិន្ទកសិកម្ម) is a leading public agricultural university in Cambodia. It is located in southwest Phnom Penh. The university is operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. In 1964, the Royal University of Agronomy Science was found by King Norodom Sihanouk. It was one of the nine royal universities established to improve Cambodian higher education development. Unfortunately, it was entirely closed during the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979. In 1980, it was reopened with the new name of Institute of Agricultural Education to educate government staff to work in fields such as forestry, animal production, veterinary medicine, crop production and agricultural machinery. In 1984, it became known as Institute of Agricultural Technology. It offered bachelor's degrees in Agronomy, Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Agricultural Engineering, Forestry and Fishery. Obtaining assistance from abroad, professors were from Soviet Union so all lectures were taught in Russian. In 1990, the support from Soviet Union ended so the curriculum was converted to Khmer language. In 1994, it officially changed the name to Royal University of Agriculture (RUA). After that, other bachelor's degree programs were introduced. In 2002, graduate degree programs in agricultural science-related majors were launched. RUA is accredited by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. RUA offers bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees. It is a leading contributor to Cambodia's human resources in the fields of agriculture and rural development.
