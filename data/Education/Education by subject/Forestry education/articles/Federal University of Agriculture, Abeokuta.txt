  The Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Ogun State, or FUNAAB, (FUNAAB) was established on 1 January 1988 by the Federal Government when four universities of technology, earlier merged in 1984, were demerged. This led to the creation of the first two universities of agriculture in Abeokuta and Makurdi. On the same date, Professor Nurudeen Olorun-Nimbe Adedipe was appointed the pioneer Vice-Chancellor of the university.  Professor Adedipe officially assumed duty on 28 January 1988. For many years the date which Professor Adedipe assumed duty was wrongly adopted as the foundation day.  Following a revisit to the instrument setting up the university, a council decision at its 53rd statutory meeting in June 2010 reverted the foundation date to 1 January 1988 as prescribed by the law which established the university. Prior to the emergence of FUNAAB, the Federal Government had established Federal University of Technology, Abeokuta (FUTAB) in 1983. Then, in 1984, it was merged with the University of Lagos and had its name changed to the College of Science and Technology, Abeokuta (COSTAB), before the demerger of January, 1988. The university started off from the old campus of Abeokuta Grammar School, Isale-Igbein near the city centre. It completed its movement to its permanent site along Alabata Road in 1997. At the initial stage, five colleges were introduced in the university in October 1988 as follows: Two additional Colleges, College of Engineering (COLENG) and College of Veterinary Medicine (COLVET) were introduced in March, 2002. During the 2008/2009 session, the College of Agricultural Management, Rural Development and Communication Studies was split into two, with two new colleges emerging as follows: The newest college is College of Management Sciences (COLMAS) The university is one of the three universities of agriculture in Nigeria, the other being in Makurdi (Benue State) and Umudike (Abia State). The university started at its mini-campus in Isale-Igbein in the heart of Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State. In December 1997 it moved to its permanent site on a 10,000-hectare campus which is located next to the Ogun-Oshun River Basin Development Authority on the Abeokuta-Ibadan road in the North Eastern end of the city, 15 km from Abeokuta City Centre. The first council was constituted on 18 May 1989 under the chairmanship of Alhaji Muhammadu Jega, former Head of Service and Secretary to the Sokoto State Government. On 1 September 1990, the council was reconstituted with some changes for five years with Alhaji Muhammadu Jega retained as Chairman. The second governing council was constituted in 2000 for five years, with Alhaji Sanni Bagiwa Idris as Chairman. The third council came on board in 2005 and was dissolved in November, 2007 by the Federal Government. Elder Brigadier General (Rtd.) Bassey Asuquo, a one-time Military Administrator of Kogi, Edo and Delta States respectively, was the Chairman. The fourth council was constituted in January 2009 with Mr. Raphael Oluwole Osayameh as Chairman and immediate past Pro-Chancellor.  Chief Lawrence Ayinde Osayemi was Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council. Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe Kingsley, a one time Minister of works and Service of the Federation, a former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the immediate Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council. Presently, Dr. (Barr.) Aboki Zhawa, an astute administrator, a legal luminary, educationalist and politician is the Pro-Chancellor and the Chairman of the Governing Council. Since inception, FUNAAB has had three Chancellors:  While the first five were the only Deputy Vice-Chancellors during their respective tenures, Professors Eromosele and Ariyo were appointed simultaneously as the first set of two Deputy Vice-Chancellors for the University, an initiative of the then Vice-Chancellor, Professor O.O. Balogun. Registrar  Bursar Librarian The university was awarded the best university in the country by the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC) consecutively in the year 2002 and 2003.

It is at the centre of all planning activities of the University. The unit is headed by a Director, Professor M.A. Waheed, a Principal Planning Officer, Mr. O.O. Bamgbose and other Planning Officers (Mrs. A.A. Akintunde, Mr. A.O. Kuforiji and Mr. S.A.

The total collection of books at present is 54,000 titles. The library started its automation programme in 1994 when it acquired through a World Bank Project, an IBM personal computer and the TINLIB library software designed for four work stations. This was later upgraded to ten work stations. The library has since migrated from the DOS based TINLIB software to a more versatile windows based GLAS (Graphical Library Automated System) software with the capability to operate 50 work stations within the library. OPAC is fully functional making it possible to catalogue books on line and for library clients to access such books immediately. The establishment of centres helps to enhance research and development in the university. The centres include: The University has collaborative partnerships with institutions and establishments, including: Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) have been signed with the institutions and collaboration activities are in progress. At the international level, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), has entered into collaboration with the university in the areas of training and seminars. The British Council has established an academic link programme between FUNAAB and the University of Reading, and the University of Edinburgh, primarily, though not exclusively, in the areas of Plant and Animal Breeding and Seed Technology and Genetics, respectively. Others include Maclary Land Use Research Institute, Aberdeen, Scotland, in the area of Sustainabe Development, and the West African Rice Development Association in Rice Science. Amongst the alumni of the Federal University Of Agriculture, Abeokuta and other institutions that fall under that banner are:
