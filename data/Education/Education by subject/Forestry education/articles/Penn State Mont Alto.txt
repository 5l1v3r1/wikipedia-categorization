Penn State Mont Alto is a Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth Campus. It is located in Mont Alto, in south central Pennsylvania, between Chambersburg and Gettysburg. It incorporates the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy, founded in 1903 by Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker. Approximately 1,200 students attend the school with more than 30% being over the age of 24. The majority of the student population at Penn State Mont Alto commute to classes, rather than live in the provided residence halls. The campus is well known for its forestry and nursing majors. While many students elect to continue their education at University Park, Penn State Mont Alto does offer four-year degrees in business as well as English. Today, Mont Alto offers four baccalaureate degrees and eight associate degrees, and serves nearly 1,300 students annually. The campus serves an additional 2,500 annually through its Continuing Education unit, with courses on campus, at the Chambersburg Mall and other sites. Joseph Rothrock, an explorer, botanist and medical doctor founded the academy to train men for service in the state forests. In May 1903, Samuel W. Pennypacker, governor of Pennsylvania, established the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy in Mont Alto. With the precipitous closure of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell in the same month, the new Pennsylvania school became one of three forestry schools in the nation, along with Yale and Biltmore. George Wirt, the academy's first administrator, patterned the curriculum after curricula in Germany. All first year students were required to bring a horse with them to the academy until the late 1920s. The horses were used to fight forest fires in the Michaux State Forest.   The yearbook of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy was called "The Oak Leaf". It was published in 1914, 1920, 1923 and 1927, and may now be viewed online through the Pennsylvania State University Libraries along with other items documenting the history of this campus.  In 1929 the Forest Academy merged with Pennsylvania State University, establishing Penn State Mont Alto. Students were adamantly opposed to the merger, and they protested by hanging two state officials in effigy.  The campus closed from 1943 to 1946 because the students and faculty were fighting in WWII.  In 1963, Penn State Mont Alto became a Commonwealth Campus. In 1997, Mont Alto joined the Commonwealth College, and began to offer baccalaureate degrees. Penn State Mont Alto offers three residence halls to students: Mont Alto Hall, Penn Gate I, and Penn Gate II. The Mont Alto Arboretum is an arboretum located on the campus (40°48′36″N 77°52′39″W﻿ / ﻿40.81004°N 77.87744°W﻿ / 40.81004; -77.87744). It was established on Arbor Day in 1905, just two years after the founding of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy in Mont Alto. According to the college, on that day students searched for native tree species not present on campus, and brought back more than 400 specimens (30 species). These original plantings were then augmented by seeds from other trees native to the United States. This arboretum continues to provide a training ground for students, as well as a research site for the development of new hybrids. Penn State–Mont Alto teams participate as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). The Nittany Lions are a member of the Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference (PSUAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball.
