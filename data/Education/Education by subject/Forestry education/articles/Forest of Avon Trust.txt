The Forest of Avon Trust is the local charity for trees in the former county of Avon, which now comprises Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset. The Trust's objectives are to plant trees in gardens, streets, green spaces and schools to benefit people and wildlife. It also provides support to communities and individuals to plant and manage trees, including woodland and orchard creation. The Forest of Avon Trust also provides accredited  OCN level 3 training for Forest School leaders and runs woodland activity and outdoor learning sessions for schools, nurseries and families.  Since 2011 the trust has also run projects with adults with learning difficulties to increase skills, independence and wellbeing.  The Forest of Avon Trust currently manages a community woodland near Upton Cheney, South Gloucestershire.  The Forest of Avon Trust was established in 2008 to carry on the work of the Forest of Avon Community Forest, which planted over 1 million trees.  Since then the charity has campaigned for strategic woodland creation, in support of the principles of the Community Forest. In their first three years work included: creating mini-orchards in school grounds, donating thousands of locally grown, native trees and shrubs to school and communities, providing advice and support to local groups to enable them to plant trees, delivering environmental awareness and play activities for local schools and nurseries, delivering tailored woodland activities for adults with learning disabilities, advising landowners on woodland management and Forestry Commission grants and taking on the lease of The Retreat community woodland.
