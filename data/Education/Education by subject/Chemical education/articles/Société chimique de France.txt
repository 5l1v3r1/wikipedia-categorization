The Société Chimique de France (SCF) is a learned society and professional association founded in 1857 to represent the interests of French chemists in a variety of ways in local, national and international contexts.   Until 2009 the organization was known as the Société Française de Chimie. The Society traces its origins back to an organization of young Parisian chemists who began meeting in May 1857 under the name Société Chimique, with the goal of self-study and mutual education.  In 1858 the established chemist Adolphe Wurtz joined the society, and immediately transformed it into a learned society modeled after the Chemical Society of London, which was the precursor of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Like its British counterpart, the French association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout France and across international borders.  Support for the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de Paris began in 1858.    In the 21st century, the society has become a member of ChemPubSoc Europe, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.  In 2010 they started ChemistryViews.org, their news and information service for chemists and other scientists worldwide. The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including:
