The School of Chemistry is a constituent body of the Faculty of Science at the University of Sydney, Australia. Two Nobel Laureates are associated with the School: John Cornforth completed his undergraduate degree in the School, graduating in 1938 with First Class Honours and the University Medal; and Robert Robinson was appointed as the first Professor of Pure and Applied Organic Chemistry at the University in 1912.  The Chemistry Building, which is the School's main building, is notable in architectural history as one of the first structures in Australia with a curtain wall. The building was completed in 1956.
