The Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research in Dresden (German: Leibniz-Institut für Polymerforschung) – in short IPF Dresden – is a non-university research institute and a member of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community. The IPF is carrying out fundamental as well as application-oriented research in all areas of polymer science and investigates polymer materials with new or improved characteristics. In the material development, emphasis is given to nanotechnological aspects as well as to biosystem interfaces.  The IPF’s research program is jointly set up and implemented by scientists of the different IPF institutes. It comprises the following four research areas: The IPF consists of five research institutes Close ties exists to the TU Dresden, one of eleven universities distinguished as a "University of Excellence" by the German Universities Excellence Initiative. Common projects include the Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials,  and two so-called Clusters of Excellence, the "Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden" (CRTD)  and the "Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden" (CfAED).  The IPF Dresden was founded on January 1, 1992 emerging from the largest polymer research center of the former GDR,  which was at the time already internationally acknowledged. Since then the IPF Dresden developed into a leading institute in selected topics of polymer science. At present the IPF employs about 480 people, and about 100 guest scientists from all over the world come every year for some weeks or months to work at the IPF. The annual budget of 25 Million Euro is supplied in equal parts by the Federal Republic of Germany and the German federal states. In addition to institutional funding the IPF Dresden raises project resources of about 8 Million Euro per year.
