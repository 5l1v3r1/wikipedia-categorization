The Chemical Society of Japan (CSJ) is a learned society and professional association founded in 1878 in order to advance research in chemistry.  The mission of the CSJ is to promote chemistry for science and industry in collaboration with other domestic and global societies.   The organization was modeled after the British Chemical Society.  This learned society in London was the precursor of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Like its British counterpart, the Japanese association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Japan and across international borders.      Membership was expanded in 1948 in a merger with the Society of Chemical Industry.  In 2018 the first woman was announced as president, the distinguished chemist Maki Kawai.  Support for the Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan (BCSJ) began in 1926.   Other publications of the society include:
