 The University of East Anglia's Creative Writing Course was founded by Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson in 1970. The M.A. is widely regarded as the most prestigious and successful in the country  and competition for places is notoriously tough.  The course is split into four strands: Prose, Creative Non-Fiction, Poetry and Scriptwriting (which is Skillset accredited). All four result in an M.A. qualification upon successful completion of the course. The Course Directors are currently Andrew Cowan, Kathryn Hughes, Lavinia Greenlaw and Val Taylor respectively. Course tutors include Amit Chaudhuri, Trezza Azzopardi, Giles Foden, Tobias Jones, James Lasdun, Jean McNeil, Margaret Atwood and George Szirtes. Writers such as Angela Carter, Rose Tremain, Andrew Motion, W. G. Sebald, Mich√®le Roberts and Patricia Duncker have also taught on the course. Writers-in-residence have included Alan Burns  and Margaret Attwood. Nobel Prize Winners
