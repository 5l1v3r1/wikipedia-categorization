The term “Macondistas” refers to authors and members of the writing community who are alumni of the Macondo Writers Workshop, which was founded by Sandra Cisneros in 1995.  The workshop is for writers whose work is socially engaged and who have addressed the needs of underrepresented communities via their writing.  For years, the workshop was made possible by the philanthropic endeavors of Cisneros and the Macondo Foundation, though currently the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center in San Antonio, Texas, administers and hosts the annual workshop.  The term "Macondo" was first used in Gabriel García Márquez' 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude.
