Clinical professor, also known as professor of practice, is an academic appointment made to a member of a profession who is associated with a university and engages in practical instruction of professional students.  Titles in this category may include Clinical Instructor, Assistant Clinical Professor, Associate Clinical Professor, and Clinical Professor.  Clinical professorship generally does not offer a "tenure track", but can be either full or part-time, and is typically noted for its emphasis on practical skills training as opposed to theoretical matters. Thus, most members of such faculty are expected to have considerable practical experience in their respective fields of expertise; unlike with most other faculty, this is deemed at least as important as educational credentials.  For administrative purposes, some universities classify such a designation as equivalent to "adjunct professor".  Clinical professors may be salaried or may teach as a volunteer.  In the field of medicine, full clinical professors generally work full time at the medical college and its affiliated hospitals, while assistant clinical professors are part time with their full practice elsewhere, with little involvement in medical education; the assistant clinical professor position may be almost entirely honorary.    In Canada, doctors who teach are called "preceptors".
