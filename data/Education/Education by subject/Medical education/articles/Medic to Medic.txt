Medic to Medic (also known as M2M, Medic 2 Medic) is a programme of the International Medical Education Trust 2000 (IMET 2000), a UK charity that provides medical education worldwide.   Founded by Dr. Kate Mandeville, it became affiliated with IMET 2000 to address the shortage of in-country health care workers, as well as a way of helping students who risked dropping out of medical school because of extreme poverty. Since its inception in 2007, it has projects in Malawi and in Uganda.  Medic to Medic aims to alleviate students from financial hardship so as to allow them to complete their studies. Given the number of professionals who migrate in search of better career prospects,  Medic to Medic also aims to boost numbers of in-country health workers. The programme links students to private donors, akin to other well-known child sponsor models. E-mentoring from UK professionals is also part of the programme.  In Malawi, the programme supports students training to be doctors and allied health professionals at Malawi College of Medicine and Malawi College of Health Sciences. In Uganda, it works with Makerere University and Gulu University to support the most needy students, especially those from Northern Uganda. Medical students at some UK universities are involved in fundraising activities, sponsorship and mentoring support in the field over the summer.
