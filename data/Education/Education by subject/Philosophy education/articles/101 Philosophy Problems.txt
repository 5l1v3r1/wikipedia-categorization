101 Philosophy Problems (1999) is a philosophy book for a general audiences by Martin Cohen published by Routledge. The format of the book was unique and later copied by other authors. For example, in Julian Baggini's The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten it was observed that the books "format is essentially the same as that first successfully introduced by Martin Cohen's 101 Philosophy Problems."  In a review for the Times Higher Education Supplement (London),  Harry Gensler, Professor of philosophy, at John Carroll University, Cleveland, describes the book: Other stories deal with paradoxes, ethics, aesthetics, perception, time, God, physics, and knowledge and include  problems from Zeno, Descartes, Russell, Nelson Goodman, Edmund Gettier and others. The  problems are  followed by a discussion section  and a glossary. In a review for The Philosopher, Dr. Zenon Stavrinides says that: 101 Philosophy Problems has been reviewed in The Philosophers Magazine by Julian Baggini (Summer 1999);  the Ilkley Gazette (May 29, 1999 );  The Guardian  (5.11.1999);  and Der Spiegel (2001).  It has had three English editions and been translated into German, Dutch, Greek, Estonian, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and other languages. The German translation has alone run to three editions, one by Campus and two by Piper, including a massmarket hardback edition. There also an edition in Persian.
