SciShow is a series of science-related videos on YouTube. The program is mainly  hosted by Hank Green of the VlogBrothers and Michael Aranda.  SciShow was launched as an original channel.  Though Green hosts the majority of episodes, the show has alternate hosts; Michael Aranda has been with the show since its inception, and Olivia Gordon  of the Missoula Insectarium joined in June 2016.   Prior to her move to Chicago, Emily Graslie of The Brain Scoop, also occasionally hosted on the channel. There have also been guest appearances by Lindsey Doe, who hosts Sexplanations, another channel launched by Green; and by longtime SciShow staffer Stefan Chin, who since 2018 has been a regular host. SciShow has grown since its 2012 launch; since then it has employed a full editorial, production, and operations staff.  SciShow Space has three rotating hosts: Hank Green, Reid Reimers, and Caitlin Hofmeister. SciShow Kids is primarily hosted by Jessi Knudsen Casta√±eda.  SciShow  Psych is co-hosted by Hank Green and Brit Garner.  The channel was launched as an "original channel", which meant that YouTube funded the channel.   The show's initial grant was projected to expire in 2014, and in response, on September 12, 2013 SciShow joined the viewer-funding site Subbable, created in part by Green.   In 2014, the channel landed a national advertisement deal with YouTube. The educational program was featured on platforms such as billboards and television commercials, as a result.  Green details that the advertisements had a positive effect on SciShow, stating, "My Twitter exploded, our followers and subscribers exploded."  After Patreon acquired Subbable, the channel switched over to Patreon where it continues to receive support in exchange for various perks. SciShow currently has over five thousand patrons.  Several different scientific fields are covered by SciShow, including  chemistry, physics, biology, zoology, entomology, botany, meteorology, astronomy, medicine, psychology, anthropology, and computer science.  The videos on SciShow have a vast variety of different topics, such as nutrition,  and "science superlatives".  As of February 2016, SciShow has released 820 videos.  A spin-off channel, SciShow Space, launched in April 2014 to specialize in space topics.  A second spin-off, SciShow Kids, launched in March 2015 to specialize in delivering science topics to children.  A third spinoff channel was announced in February 2017, SciShow Psych, which debuted in March 2017, specializing in psychology and neuroscience.  As SciShow has amassed a large following, the channel has been featured on several media outlets.       As for the channel's success on YouTube, it was documented that by October 2014, the channel amassed over two million subscribers and earned over 210 million video views.  As of May 2017, the channel has over four million subscribers and has over 662 million views.   SciShow has been criticized by fellow science YouTuber Myles Power for presenting biased and incorrect information about genetic modification.   Criticisms were later responded to in a separate response video.  In 2017, SciShow won Complexly's People's Voice award.
