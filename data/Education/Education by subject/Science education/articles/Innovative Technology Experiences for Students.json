ITEST engages students and teachers in authentic, hands-on learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly referred to as '<a href=\"/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Math\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math\">STEM</a>' or 'SET' [more common in the U.K.]).\n</p><p>As of early 2012, the program is in its ninth year. Over 195 individual projects across 43 states have been funded. It has impacted:\n</p>\n<ul><li>over 225,800 students, grades 6-12</li>\n<li>over 8,000 teachers</li>\n<li>over 3,000 parents and caregivers</li></ul>\n<p>The ITEST Learning Resource Center (ITEST LRC) at <a href=\"/wiki/Education_Development_Center\" title=\"Education Development Center\">Education Development Center</a> assists the projects in building bridges between formal and informal learning by facilitating an inclusive community of practice. Findings and lessons learned are shared nationally to improve policy and practice.
