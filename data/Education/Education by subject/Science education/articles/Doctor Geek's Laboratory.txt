Doctor Geek's Laboratory is an audio show created by Dr. Scott Vigui√©   that operates as STEM outreach (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and is used by some homeschooling parents as part of their science curriculum.  The show portrays a fictional laboratory populated by humorous characters who are trying to bring about the world of tomorrow today. Most of the episodes include a non-fiction element by interviewing scientists, corporate leaders, and others who are actively working on bleeding edge technology and trying to bring it to the consumer.  The first season of the show is available as a box set from Blackstone Audio.  Doctor Geek's Laboratory has done live episodes and presentations at many libraries   and conventions.   The lab hosted its first annual science fair in September 2014 at the South Florida Museum.
