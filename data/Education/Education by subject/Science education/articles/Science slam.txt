A science slam is a scientific talk where scientists present their own scientific research work in a given time frame - usually 10 minutes - in front of a non-expert audience. The focus lies on teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way. The presentation is judged by the audience.  A science slam is a form of science communication. Science slams are open to all fields of science. However, events specializing on particular topics exist as well. Examples include: technical science slams,  health science slams,  sociological science slams,   junior science slams,  kid's science slams,  and binational science slams.
