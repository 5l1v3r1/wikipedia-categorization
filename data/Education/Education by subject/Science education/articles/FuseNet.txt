FuseNet is an organization that unites, coordinates and sponsors European educational efforts in the field of nuclear fusion in order to increase, enhance, and broaden fusion training and education activities in Europe. The FuseNet project exists of the establishment of a European Fusion Education Network (FuseNet) for education in fusion science and technology. The purpose of FuseNet is to coordinate and facilitate fusion education, to share best practices, to jointly develop educational tools, to organize educational events. The members of FuseNet have jointly established academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master Certificates. These criteria are set to stimulate a high level of fusion education throughout Europe.

The project consists of eleven focused work packages, with a total budget of 2 Million Euro. The project runs until October 1, 2013 and is bringing together a broad representation from the European fusion community with 36 participants from 18 countries, of which 22 Universities and 14 Euratom Associations. The project consists of four groups of coordination actions: the establishment and running of the FuseNet network; development of individual learning opportunities and common educational goals; development of educational materials and hands-on experiments; and funding of joint educational activities. The FuseNet Association is an independent legal entity that was founded in December 2010 to form the sustainable continuation of the activities started by the equally named FuseNet project. The association provides a platform for the coordination of European fusion education activities, the initiation, development and implementation of new EU-wide actions, and for the exchange and dissemination of fusion education information. All European organizations that are active in the field of fusion education and research are welcome to join the association. FuseNet is the umbrella organization and single voice for the training and education of the next generation fusion engineers and scientists. FuseNet is recognized as such by the European Commission.
