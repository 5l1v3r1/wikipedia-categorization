STEAM fields are science, technology, engineering, art,  and mathematics, or applied mathematics.   STEAM is designed to integrate STEM subjects into various relevant education disciplines. These programs aim to teach students innovation, to think critically and use engineering or technology in imaginative designs or creative approaches to real-world problems while building on students' mathematics and science base.  STEAM programs add art to STEM curriculum by drawing on design principles and encouraging creative solutions.     One early founder of the STEAM initiative is Georgette Yakman,  who in addition to raising the idea of adding the arts to the STEM acronym, claims to have found a formal way to link the subjects together and correspond them to the global socioeconomic world: "Science and Technology, interpreted through Engineering and the Arts, all based in elements of Mathematics."  She provides professional development training to individual educators and programs on how to use the STEAM framework.  In 2009, Senator Mark Warner announced Yakman's nomination as NCTCâ€™s STEAM Teacher of the Year 2009.   The international founder of the STEAM acronym,  American Lisa La Bonte, CEO of the Arab Youth Venture Foundation based in the United Arab Emirates, created high profile public STEAM programs in 2006/2007 having added an A for 'inspired STEM', with the A standing for Aeronautics,  Aviation,  Astronomy,  Aerospace,  Ad Astra!  and using all things "air and space"  as a hook for youth to embark on greater experimentation, studies, and careers in the region's burgeoning space related industries. One of AYVF's best-known programs,  "STEAM@TheMall" served over 200,000[ambiguous] its first two years at the most popular shopping malls,  provided free weekend activity stations such as Mars robotics, science experiments, SkyLab portable planetarium, art/design, and creative writing.  In 2008, Sharjah Sheikha Maisa kicked off the "Design booth for youth for Al Ain Summer S.T.E.A.M. funded by the Foundation created by the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi".[not in citation given]  In 2010, the American Association of Arts & Sciences (AAAS) included a chapter on AYVF's most popular STEAM program in its book, "Building Mathematical and Scientific Talent in the Broader Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) Region".[not in citation given]
