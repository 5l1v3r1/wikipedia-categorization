The academy was formed by presidential decree in August 24, 1992 on the foundation of the Higher School of the KGB, and is located in Michurinsky Prospekt, Moscow, Russia. It consists of the Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science (Институт криптографии, связи и информатики, ИКСИ) and the Institute for Operational Training (Институт подготовки оперативного состава, ИПОС ) in various facilities.   General-Colonel Victor Ostroukhov has been Head of the Academy since 2007.  The Presidium of the VChK (The first security service of the Soviet Russia) decided in January 25, 1921 to establish a special institute for operational training. The first course began April 26, 1921, and the first Head of the course was M. Romanovsky.  In 1922 the course was renamed the Higher Courses of the State Political Directorate (GPU). In May 1930 Moscow created higher schools for basic and advanced training of secret agents; in June 4, 1930 the school was known as the Central School of OGPU. July 14, 1934, after the formation of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the former OGPU Central School was renamed the Central School of General Directorate for State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD. On March 21, 1939 the Central School of GUGB NKVD was reorganized as the Graduate School of the NKVD. By the early 1940s, every third head of the Soviet security organs was a graduate of the course.  During the Great Patriotic War, the school trained more than seven thousand security officers who organized the fight against the Nazis.  Six graduates of the Higher School became Heroes of the Soviet Union: Dmitry N. Medvedev, V.A. Molodtsov (posthumously), A. M. Rabtsevich, V.A. Lyagin (posthumously), P.A Zhidkov and E.I. Mirkovsky. On August 30, 1945 the Graduate School of the NKVD was awarded the Red Banner and the Diploma by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. By resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on July 15, 1952, the Graduate School of the MGB (Ministry for State Security) was established as a special institution of higher education with a three-year apprenticeship program for students of law schools. By Resolution of the Council of Ministers on August 2, 1962 the KGB Higher School was named after Dzerzhinsky. During the 1960s to 1980s, graduates took part in countering foreign intelligence services and conducting operational and combat activities. In 1995 the Higher School of the KGB was renamed the FSB Academy.
