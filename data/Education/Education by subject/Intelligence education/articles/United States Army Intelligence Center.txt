 The United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE) is the United States Army's school for professional training of military intelligence personnel.  It is a component of United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. The center was relocated from Ft. Holabird, Maryland to Fort Huachuca, Arizona in 1971. The move involved more than 120 moving vans, a unit train and several aircraft.  The initial intelligence training facilities were a World War II hospital complex that had not been occupied in several years. The school conducts resident courses for enlisted, warrant officer, and commissioned officer personnel, as well as for international military students in military exchange programs.  United States Army personnel who train at the school become members of the Military Intelligence Corps. AIT students training to become Systems Maintainers (42 weeks), Intelligence Analysts (16 weeks), Human Intelligence Collectors (19 weeks), Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analyst (22 weeks), UAS Operators (23 weeks), and Special Agents with United States Army Counterintelligence, all receive training here. The school also administers the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.  Coordinates: 31°33′19″N 110°20′59″W﻿ / ﻿31.5553°N 110.3497°W﻿ / 31.5553; -110.3497
