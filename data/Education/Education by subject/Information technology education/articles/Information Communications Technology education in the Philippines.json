Companies would review the portfolio and select the projects that they would want to fund. One of the projects, entitled \"Computer Laboratories Program for Secondary Schools\", sought to provide computer laboratories in at least 50 public and private high schools.

The Restructured Basic Education Curriculum which aimed to implement an interactive curriculum was launched in 2002. It aimed to integrate technology in instruction and in education, with great emphasis on computer literacy. To engage the private sector, The Act of 1998 (R.A. 8525) was passed to generate participation of companies. This was done in order to upgrade and modernize public schools, especially in the <a href=\"/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Philippines\" title=\"Provinces of the Philippines\">provinces</a>. The program led to 110 public high schools receiving computers in 1996 under the DOST Engineering Science Education Project (ESEP). An additional 68 public high schools were recipients under the DOST Computer Literacy Program. Annually, DOST continues to allocate <a href=\"/wiki/Philippine_peso\" title=\"Philippine peso\">PHP</a> 20,000,000 (US$ 400,000) to support buying computers in school. In 2002 and 2003, 125 public high schools were to be provided with 10 to 15 computers along with the corresponding teacher training programs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-policies1_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-policies1-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Technology centres in each <a href=\"/wiki/Regions_of_the_Philippines\" title=\"Regions of the Philippines\">regions</a> were set up as centres of excellence in information technology, crossing traditional boundaries, were established in order to focus on the needs of a greater number of learners.
