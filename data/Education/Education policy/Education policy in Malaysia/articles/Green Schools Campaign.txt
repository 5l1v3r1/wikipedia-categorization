  The Green Schools Campaign (GSC) is a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by PenjanaBebas, the Association of Independent Power Producers in Malaysia in partnership with the Malaysia Building Integrated Photovoltaic (MBIPV) Project Team that began in 2009. Through the installation of 5kWp Photovoltaic (PV) systems in selected schools across the country, the Campaign aims to equip young Malaysians and teachers with information on the science and benefits of renewable energy. The Campaign also provides learning materials, organises programmes and established a Green Schools Campaign Project Club for the participating schools to encourage students, parents and teachers to be advocates of renewable energy.  The initiative is supported by the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water, Malaysia (KeTTHA), and Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission of Malaysia), and responds to the Malaysian Government’s call to encourage the generation of power from renewable sources.
