With the IEP that is in effect the year the student turns 16, the IEPs often make a subtle change from overcoming deficits and approaching developmental norms to post secondary goals, transition plan activities and transition services that capitalize on the students\u2019 strengths, needs, preferences, and interests.\n</p><p>The special education professional community is working hard to catch up with this change in emphasis, and certainly many believe that it has a long way to go. At this point, nearly 6\u00bd million children receive special education services. However, few college programs, like those at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.uww.edu/gradstudies/\">[3]</a>) are preparing the next generation of professional educators to become effective in the transition planning and preparation process.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"An_electronic_checklist_simplifies_transition_planning\">An electronic checklist simplifies transition planning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Post_Secondary_Transition_for_High_School_Students_with_Disabilities&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: An electronic checklist simplifies transition planning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Department of Education is working hard to clarify the content of IDEA 2004 to the state directors of special education, the state transition specialists, and the national secondary transition technical support staff (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.nsttac.org\">[4]</a>).  Meanwhile, LEA directors of special education and special education teachers across the country are working and periodically struggling to get their arms around post secondary transition, what it means, and how it affects the education of their students.\n</p><p>One of the promising means of guiding students and teachers through the maze of transition involves deploying corporate research-based technologies used for decades in private industry.\nIn 1999, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services provided two grants to fund research into the feasibility of adapting existing technology (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060621101915/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/SBIR/FY00/phase2/phii00wizdom.html\">[5]</a>).
