Under political stranglehold, due to the 1920s-era <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Railroad_monopoly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Railroad monopoly (page does not exist)\">railroad monopoly</a>, new, self-proclaimed reformers attempted to overthrow the economic and political corruption existing in the state at the time. They wanted to create new institutions with a public morality to give California a new form of purpose.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> However, in the early years of California's emergence the population remained largely mobile, moving from opportunity to opportunity, making it almost impossible for the state to create permanent public schools. Furthermore, California progressives encountered obstacles in the form of people who thought that education should remain the work of local and religious groups, as well as being opposed to paying taxes for social purposes. Another wall towards progress that they needed to circumvent was the issue of appropriating land and money for universities. The 1st and 2nd Organic Acts (of 1866 and 1868, respectively) helped by first introducing the possibility of a state secular institution and second, actually allowing for the creation of a state university controlled by a Board of Regents (which would become the University of California).<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the 1950s, the state's legislators and academic administrators foresaw an approaching surge in University enrollment, due to the <a href=\"/wiki/Baby_boom\" title=\"Baby boom\">baby boom</a> children coming of age. They needed a plan to be able to maintain educational quality in the face of growing demand.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The underlying principles that they sought were:\n</p>\n<ul><li>That some form of higher education ought to be available to all regardless of their economic means, and that academic progress should be limited only by individual proficiency; and</li>\n<li>differentiation of function so that each of the three systems would strive for excellence in different areas, so as to not waste public resources on duplicate efforts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-UCOP_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-UCOP-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<p>The original Master Plan was approved by the Regents and the State Board of Education and submitted to the Legislature in February 1960. In April of that year, the California Legislature passed the <i>Donahoe Act</i> placing into statute a number of components of the Master Plan.<sup id=\"cite_ref-UCOP_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-UCOP-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> However, California's Master Plan is more than a single statute.

No actual ranking of students in high schools is used as many schools do not rank students.\n</p><p>Graduates of the community colleges would then be guaranteed transfer to the Cal State or UC systems in order to complete bachelor's degrees. This practice was carried over from previous years before the Plan was enacted, with graduates from the CCC being accepted as third-year students at the Universities by virtue of their prior coursework. Finally, the Plan established that the University of California would be the sole portion of the system charged with performing academic research, and would award master's and doctoral degrees in support of that mission. The Cal State system, in addition to awarding master's degrees, would be able to award joint doctorates with the UC.<sup id=\"cite_ref-UCOP_5-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-UCOP-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The \"California Idea\" - California's tripartite system of public research universities, comprehensive 4-year undergraduate campuses, and open-access community colleges \u2013 has been highly influential, and many other states and even nations have imitated this structure. California higher education has had a poor record of college completion and 4-year Baccalaureate degree attainment. Subgroups such as Latinos and African Americans, who are a large and growing demographic, show even worsening statistics of degree attainment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects\">Effects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Effects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Original_research\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/60px-Ambox_important.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/80px-Ambox_important.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"40\" data-file-height=\"40\" /></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This section  <b>possibly contains <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\" title=\"Wikipedia:No original research\">original research</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit\">improve it</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">verifying</a> the claims made and adding <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\">inline citations</a>.

This was accomplished by clearly specifying the missions of each system segment, in addition to clarifying what \"territory\" belonged to each institution. It established a \"rational\" planning process for the growth of the university systems, setting aside a past practice in which the Legislature would introduce bills establishing new four-year universities in a member's home district, a kind of <a href=\"/wiki/Pork_barrel\" title=\"Pork barrel\">political pork</a>.\n</p><p>The Plan was the basis for a substantial surge in development in California higher education.

According to a study by the Regents of California, the UC system is directly responsible for adding about $32.8 billion to the gross state product, which is about 1.8 percent of the total GSP, a key indicator of economic performance <sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subsequent_changes\">Subsequent changes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Subsequent changes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1972, a review of the Plan found that the basic structure was good, but that it should be changed slightly to accommodate the ideas of the time. For example, the review board suggested that weekend and evening programs be expanded to serve \u201cnon-traditional\u201d students, and incorporating technology such as T.V.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1978, <a href=\"/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)\" title=\"California Proposition 13 (1978)\">Proposition 13</a>, the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, was enacted, causing the free public education to be eliminated. (Since tuition was still banned under the act, the word was replaced with per-unit enrollment fees.) Though the costs were low, many taxpayers were very angered by it, though this might have been because of the direct effects of the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation.\n</p><p>The 1987 revision specifically recognized the contributions of the independent sector and made explicit provision to include the independent sector in the planning functions of the state's higher education system. It also established a policy to set the maximum award for Cal Grants in state law.\n</p><p>In 2005, the demand for high school and community college administrators brought about a widely debated exception to the existing differentiation of function between the CSU and UC systems. The awarding of doctoral degrees had originally been exclusive to the UC system, with the provision that the California State Universities could offer PhD degrees as \"joint\" degrees in combination with the University of California or an accredited private university. Under the provisions of SB&#160;724, signed into law September 22, 2005, the campuses of the California State University were then able to directly offer a <a href=\"/wiki/Doctor_of_Education\" title=\"Doctor of Education\">Doctor of Education</a> degree (Ed.D) \"focused on preparing administrative leaders\". It was argued that this fulfilled the original purpose of many of the CSUs, which were set up as <a href=\"/wiki/Normal_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Normal schools\">normal schools</a> to train teachers.\n</p><p>In 2010, the CSU was also given the authority to exclusively offer two more <a href=\"/wiki/Doctoral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Doctoral\">Doctoral</a> degrees - <a href=\"/wiki/Doctorate_in_Nursing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Doctorate in Nursing\">Doctorate in Nursing</a> (DNP) and <a href=\"/wiki/Doctor_of_Physical_Therapy\" title=\"Doctor of Physical Therapy\">Doctor of Physical Therapy</a> (DPT).\n</p><p>When the Master Plan was first founded in 1960, post-secondary education enrollments were equally divided among 2-year and 4-year institutions. However, in 2010, due to a lack of funding, the framers of the Master Plan limited eligibility admission to UC and CSU. The cost-cutting move diverted a large number of students to 2-year institutions, which would still allow them to finish their lower division work and then transfer to a 4-year institution.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/California_postsecondary_education_commission\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"California postsecondary education commission\">California Postsecondary Education Commission</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/California_State_University\" title=\"California State University\">California State University</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California\" title=\"University of California\">University of California</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/California_Community_Colleges_system\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"California Community Colleges system\">California Community Colleges system</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_California\" title=\"List of colleges and universities in California\">List of colleges and universities in California</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://politics.berkeley.edu/rarick.htm\">Rarick, Ethan</a> (2005) <i>The Life and Times of Pat Brown&#160;\u2014 California Rising</i> (Ch. 7) Berkeley, CA: University of California Press</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Endnotes\">Endnotes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Endnotes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">California Education Code Section 66000 states that \"[t]his part shall be known and may be cited as the Donahoe\nHigher Education Act.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">John Douglass, \"The California Idea and American Higher Education\" (Stanford, VA: Stanford University Press, 2000), p. 81.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">John Douglass, \"The California Idea and American Higher Education\" (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">California State Department of Education (1960). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ucop.edu/acadinit/mastplan/MasterPlan1960.pdf\">A Master Plan for Higher Education in California: 1960-1975</a>.
