The Act provides resources to states and communities to ensure that all students reach their full potential.\n</p><p>It is based on the premise of <a href=\"/wiki/Outcomes-based_education\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Outcomes-based education\">outcomes-based education</a> that students will reach higher levels of achievement when more is expected of them. Congress appropriated $105 million for fiscal year 1994. States submitted applications to develop school improvement plans, and make subgrants to local schools, and awards for pre-service and professional development.\n</p><p>In 1996, President Clinton introduced a competitive grant entitled the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF). The president allocated 2 million dollars to ensure that every child in every school utilize technology to achieve high standards by the dawn of the 21st century. The president urged a variety of stakeholders from the private sector, schools, teachers, students, community groups, state and local governors and the federal government to work in a partnership toward achieving high levels of technology in schools.\n</p><p>In a 1996 letter to school Chief Operating Officers, President Clinton urged states and local school districts to work together in achieving the following four goals:\n</p>\n<ol><li>All teachers will have the training and support they need to help all students learn through computers the <a href=\"/wiki/Information_superhighway\" title=\"Information superhighway\">information superhighway</a></li>\n<li>All teachers and students will have modern computers in their classrooms</li>\n<li>Every classroom will be connected to the information superhighway</li>\n<li>Effective and engaging software and on-line resources will be an integral part of every school curriculum</li></ol>\n<p>The overarching problem behind ensuring that every child in every school utilize an equal level of technology is the TLCF was a competitive grant.

There are content standards for dance, theater, music, and the visual arts. Every content standard is followed by several achievement standards describing how students are to demonstrate mastery of the content standards. The goals are not intended to be a curriculum. Instead, curriculum is to be developed locally on the basis of the goals. Standards are grouped in four divisions\u2014creation and performance; cultural and historical context; perception and analysis; and the nature and value of the arts.\n</p><p>The Music Content Standards for each level are as follows:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music</li>\n<li>Playing instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music</li>\n<li>Improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments</li>\n<li>Composing and arranging music within specified guidelines</li>\n<li>Reading and notating music</li>\n<li>Listening to, analyzing, and describing music</li>\n<li>Evaluating music and music performance</li>\n<li>Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts</li>\n<li>Understanding music in relation to history and culture</li></ol>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"End_of_Goals_2000\">End of Goals 2000</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Goals_2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: End of Goals 2000\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>With the final language of President George Bush's 2001 <a href=\"/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act\" title=\"No Child Left Behind Act\">No Child Left Behind Act</a> (H.R. 1) came the withdrawal of all authorization for Goals 2000. However, even though Congress had withdrawn its authorization for Goals 2000, if funding was not also withdrawn, the crippled, but alive Goals 2000 program would stagger on. Then, just before leaving town on December 21, 2001, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2002 Education Appropriations Conference Committee report which eliminated spending on Goals 2000. Goals 2000 was no longer authorized or funded.\n</p><p>Additionally, in an article by Kenneth J. Cooper from <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Washington_Post\" title=\"The Washington Post\">The Washington Post</a></i> dated December 3, 1999, he stated the following:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"The nation has not met any of the eight educational goals for the year 2000 set a decade ago by President Bush and the governors of all 50 states, although measurable progress has been made toward the goals pertaining to preschoolers and student achievement in math and reading, a national panel announced yesterday.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>The National Education Goals Panel\u2019s final report before the 2000 deadline showed that more children were 'ready to learn'\u2014healthier and better prepared through preschool or parental reading\u2014when they entered kindergarten.

The percentage of teachers holding a college degree in the main subject they teach dropped from 66 percent to 63 percent, and there was a significant increase in student use of illicit drugs, from 24 percent to 37 percent in 10th grade.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Goals_2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/National_Education_Goals_Panel\" title=\"National Education Goals Panel\">National Education Goals Panel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Ready_schools\" title=\"Ready schools\">Ready schools</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Goals_2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=&amp;req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title20-section5812&amp;f=&amp;fq=&amp;num=0&amp;hl=false&amp;edition=prelim\">\"20 USC 5812: National Education Goals\"</a>.</cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.btitle=20+USC+5812%3A+National+Education+Goals&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fuscode.house.gov%2Fview.xhtml%3Fpath%3D%26req%3Dgranuleid%253AUSC-prelim-title20-section5812%26f%3D%26fq%3D%26num%3D0%26hl%3Dfalse%26edition%3Dprelim&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AGoals+2000\" class=\"Z3988\"><span style=\"display:none;\">&#160;</span></span></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u201c\u201989 Education Summit's Goals Still Unmet.\u201d <i>The Washington Post</i>.
