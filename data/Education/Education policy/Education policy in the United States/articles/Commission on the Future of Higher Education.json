The nineteen-member commission was charged with recommending a national strategy for reforming <a href=\"/wiki/Post-secondary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Post-secondary\">post-secondary education</a>, with a particular focus on how well colleges and universities are preparing students for the 21st-century workplace, as well as a secondary focus on how well high schools are preparing the students for post-secondary education. In the report, released on September 26, 2006, the Commission focuses on four key areas: access, affordability (particularly for <a href=\"/wiki/Non-traditional_students\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Non-traditional students\">non-traditional students</a>), the standards of quality in instruction, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Accountability\" title=\"Accountability\">accountability</a> of institutions of higher learning to their constituencies (students, families, taxpayers, and other investors in higher education). After the report's publication, implementation of its recommendations was the responsibility of U.S. Under Secretary of Education, <a href=\"/wiki/Sara_Tucker\" title=\"Sara Tucker\">Sara Martinez Tucker</a> (appointed August 2006).\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Formation_and_motivation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Formation and motivation</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Membership\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Membership</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_Published_Report\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Published Report</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Access\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Access</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Affordability\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Affordability</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Quality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Quality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Accountability\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Accountability</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Innovation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Innovation</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Criticism_and_controversy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Criticism and controversy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Response_to_commission_recommendations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Response to commission recommendations</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Implementation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Implementation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Related_acts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Related acts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Formation_and_motivation\">Formation and motivation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Formation and motivation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A significant motivation behind the Spellings Commission's formation was the fear that the American higher education system is deteriorating and failing to prepare the American <a href=\"/wiki/Workforce\" title=\"Workforce\">workforce</a> for the rigors and competitiveness of the globalized marketplace.

It proposed several solutions to the problems facing higher education today, corresponding to the primary concerns of the commission: access, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Affordability&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Affordability (page does not exist)\">affordability</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Quality_(business)\" title=\"Quality (business)\">quality</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Accountability\" title=\"Accountability\">accountability</a>, and innovation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Access\">Access</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Access\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>According to the commission, access to higher education \"is unduly limited by the complex interplay of inadequate preparation, lack of information about college opportunities, and persistent financial barriers\" (Commission Report 5). The commission blames the lack of communication between colleges and high schools as one source of the problem. The report states that \"forty-four percent of university faculty members say students aren't well prepared for <a href=\"/wiki/Composition_studies\" title=\"Composition studies\">college-level writing</a>, in contrast to the 90 percent of high school teachers who think they are prepared\" and \"only 17 percent of seniors are considered proficient in mathematics, and just 36 percent are proficient in reading.\" In response to this, the Commission proposed linking the expectations of college professors for incoming freshman to the criteria required for students to graduate from <a href=\"/wiki/High_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> by increasing communication between the two groups. In order to accomplish this, the Report \"strongly encourages early assessment initiatives that determine whether students are on track for college\".  Another proposal of the Report is an increase in the use of <a href=\"/wiki/Open_content\" title=\"Open content\">open content</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Open_source\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Open source\">open source</a> at the collegiate level to increase access to more people.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Affordability\">Affordability</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Affordability\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another dilemma that the commission faces regarding the access to higher education is the availability for low-income families and, to a lesser extent, students of minority groups. The report states that \"there is ample evidence that qualified young people from families of modest means are far less likely to go to college than their affluent peers with similar qualifications.\" In an effort to lessen the stress of paying for college, the commission's report recommended shortening the <a href=\"/wiki/FAFSA\" title=\"FAFSA\">FAFSA</a> form to encourage more people to apply for financial aid. The report also calls for greater productivity and efficiency of the <a href=\"/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)\" title=\"Student financial aid (United States)\">financial aid</a> system. State funding for higher education has fallen to the lowest levels the nation has seen in two decades, and the report proposes that Universities be held accountable for their \"spending decisions... based on their own limited resources.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quality\">Quality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Quality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The report urges colleges and universities to embrace innovative ideas for new methods of teaching, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Distance_learning\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Distance learning\">distance learning</a>, to improve the quality of higher education.  The report also addresses the idea that organization and nationwide reform are key parts in repairing the problems of higher education. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://chronicle.com/\">[1]</a> Modifying the curricula and assessments on a nationwide level would help distinguish students in the academic world.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Accountability\">Accountability</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Accountability\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The commission proposes creating a public <a href=\"/wiki/Database\" title=\"Database\">database</a>, where statistics and other information about colleges and universities could be viewed by all in order to clarify the haziness of accountability.  The information that would be made available in the proposed database would include the cost, price, admissions data, and college completion rates of colleges.  The database could eventually even contain data such as the \"learning outcomes of students\".  The Commission argues that colleges might have a more vested interest in the success of their students if this information were made public to prospective students and their parents.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Innovation\">Innovation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Innovation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>American universities have not adequately prioritized innovation and creativity as an important learning outcome. The commission advocates that \"policymakers and educators need to do more\nto build America\u2019s capacity to compete and innovate by investing in critical skill sets and basic research. Institutions as well as government agencies have failed to sustain and nurture innovation in our colleges and universities. The commission finds that the results of scholarly research on teaching and learning are rarely translated into practice, especially for those working at the grassroots level in fields such as teacher preparation and math and science education\" (15). Although the report does not point this out, the accepted practice of research in higher education requires scholars to fit their research in with pre-existing scholarly conversations, which can limit the development of new ideas and risky experimentation. Additionally, universities and government officials enacting policy and controlling monetary resources have been slow to adapt to the future and reluctant to provide the resources necessary for creative ventures: \"with the exception of several promising practices, many of our postsecondary institutions have not embraced opportunities for innovation, from new methods of teaching and content delivery to technological advances to meeting the increasing demand for lifelong learning. We also find that for their part, both state and federal policymakers have failed to make supporting innovation a priority by adequately providing incentives for individuals, employers, and institutions to pursue more opportunities for innovative, effective, and efficient practice\" (16). If universities were re-structured according to interdisciplinary emphases and topics, we would foster innovation more efficiently: \"At a time when innovation occurs increasingly at the intersection of multiple\ndisciplines (including business and social sciences), curricula and research funding remain largely contained in individual departments\" (16).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criticism_and_controversy\">Criticism and controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Criticism and controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Commission member David Ward refused to sign the final version, citing \"several issues of serious concern\" including the report's tendency to attribute problems with multiple causes entirely to the state of higher education.\n</p><p>After the publication of the report, it has been the target of criticism from prominent individuals in higher education, including Robert Berdahl, president of the <a href=\"/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities\" title=\"Association of American Universities\">Association of American Universities</a> (and not a commission member), who stated that the report lacked a \"nuanced understanding\" of the realities of higher education.\n</p><p>Privacy advocates have criticized the call for a national student database, which Spellings and the commission have argued should include information on individual students' performance.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft\" title=\"Microsoft\">Microsoft</a>'s Gerri Elliot, a commission member, sparred with other commission members over the inclusion of a discussion of the benefits of <a href=\"/wiki/Open_source\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Open source\">open source</a> software and open content.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Response_to_commission_recommendations\">Response to commission recommendations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_the_Future_of_Higher_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Response to commission recommendations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Higher Education Consumers Resource (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.highereducationconsumersresource.org/\">http://www.highereducationconsumersresource.org/</a>) took exception to the report, citing inadequate research on root cause of the problems.  With over 80% of all Americans having successfully completed 12 years of school, the fact that fewer than 25% go on to successfully complete a college degree is meaningful.  In Ohio alone, there are 8 colleges that graduate less than 35% of the full-time freshman class within 6 years.  This indicates serious institutional barriers to success within those institutions. Higher Education Consumers Resource believes academic and career advising from independent sources not beholding to the college or university is one step towards reducing dismal successful college completion rates.\n</p><p>But the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Center_for_Public_Policy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"National Center for Public Policy (page does not exist)\">National Center for Public Policy</a> and Higher Education's <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://measuringup.highereducation.org/\">\"Measuring Up 2006: The National Report Card on Higher Education\"</a> focuses on most of the same areas as Spellings Commission report. The \"report card\" looks at individual states and assesses the status of their higher education since 2000. Although the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education is not directly affiliated with the commission, there is significant overlap in not only the areas of concern, but in some of the membership (notably <a href=\"/wiki/Jim_Hunt\" title=\"Jim Hunt\">James B. Hunt, Jr.</a> and Arturo Madrid). Spellings is quoted as saying that she is proud her report has similarities to the National Center's report.\n</p><p>One of the most controversial proposed implementations of the report's recommendations is the proposal for a federally managed system to record the progress of individual college students. The Department of Education has proposed revamp or expand the current <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/\">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System</a>, arguing that a database is necessary to sufficiently assess the status of universities and college students nationwide. University and pro-privacy advocates fear that such a plan would require universities to submit much more information causing vast increases in cost and time commitment to the universities and could be regarded as an invasion of students' privacy. The Department of Education addresses some of these anxieties on a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/hiedfuture/actionplan-myths.html\">\"Myth vs. Fact\" page</a> posted to the DOE web site on September 29, 2006.\n</p><p>Some <a href=\"/wiki/Universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universities\">universities</a> are beginning to use and modify Learning Management Systems to create information systems that provide for a means of articulating institutional, classroom and personal learning outcomes at all levels as well as means to consistently rate performance toward those objectives.
