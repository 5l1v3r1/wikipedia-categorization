The BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT) is an aptitude test used as part of the admissions process for Medicine, Biomedical Sciences and Dentistry in some universities in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Spain, Malaysia, Thailand, Hungary, Croatia and the Netherlands. BMAT was developed by Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing in response to requests from academics at medical and veterinary schools for an assessment that would enable them to differentiate between applicants who appear equally well qualified and suited to the course, and provide a way of assessing the potential of students who have a range of different qualifications.  Initially, it was taken up by Oxford University for Medicine and Physiology (replacing the OMAT); the University of Cambridge for Medicine and Veterinary Science (replacing the MVAT) and University College London, for Medicine. From 2011, the new Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKC Medicine) in Singapore, a partnership between Imperial College London and Nanyang University, started using BMAT as part of its entry process for Medicine. Over the past few years, universities introducing BMAT as part of their entry requirements for Medicine courses have included Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) (2013), Leiden University in the Netherlands (2014), the University of Leeds (2015), the University of Navarra in Spain (2015), Lancaster University (2016), the University of Malaya (2016). In 2017, a number of institutions in Thailand started using BMAT as entry requirements for Medicine courses, initially starting with the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University and Chulabhorn International College of Medicine of Thammasat University. This was followed by the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University (Joint Program with University of Nottingham), Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University and Faculty of Medicine, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang as part of the first round (entrance by portfolio) of the Thai University Central Admissions System (TCAS) for the 2018 intake, after educational reforms in 2017. Most recently, for the 2018 intake, CEU Cardenal Herrara University in Spain, the University of Pécs in Hungary, the University of Rijeka and the University of Zagreb, both in Croatia, have started using BMAT as an entry requirement to courses such as Medicine and Dentistry BMAT is a 2-hour, pen-and-paper test, which consists of three sections.  The first two sections are both multiple choice questions and the third section is a writing task. This section is designed to test generic skills in problem-solving, understanding arguments, and data analysis and inference. It is made up of 35 questions, with 60 minutes to complete. This section tests the ability to apply scientific knowledge typically covered in school Science and Mathematics by the age of 16 (for example, GCSE in the UK and IGCSE internationally). It is made up of 27 questions, with 30 minutes to complete. This section tests the ability to select, develop and organise ideas, and to communicate them in writing, concisely and effectively. Applicants must complete one writing task from a choice of three questions, with 30 minutes to complete. Calculators and dictionaries, including bilingual dictionaries, cannot be used in the exam.  For Sections 1 and 2 the total raw marks for each section are converted onto the BMAT 9-point scale. The scores are given to one decimal place. Most candidates typically score around 5.0 (roughly half marks). Some candidates will score around 6.0 and a few exceptional candidates will score higher than 7.0. For Section 3, candidates get two scores – one for quality of content (on a scale of 0–5, with 5 being the highest) and one for quality of written English (on the scale A, C, E, with A being the highest).  Each BMAT essay is marked by two examiners and the two marks are combined to give an overall score ranging from 1E to 5A. An image of the candidate’s Writing Task is supplied to each institution to which the candidate has applied. BMAT is normally taken at authorised ‘open centres’ which are located around the world. For the test session that takes place in late October/early November, UK applicants can often take the test in their school or college. The timing of the test is designed to fit in with the timescales for Medicine applications for the institutions across the world using the test. Each year, the following test sessions take place:  Typically, for each test session, students must register themselves or be registered for the test, by their school, at least a month in advance.  BMAT results are generally issued 3–4 weeks after the test has taken place, either by a Statement of Results or via the Metritests system. BMAT results are only valid in the year that the test is taken.  BMAT results are used in a variety of ways by the different institutions using it: for example, Oxford University combines the results with GCSE grades to decide who is called for interview.  Often it is seen as just part of the application process – previous examination results, a teacher’s reference, the applicant’s personal statement and predicted grades are also important. BMAT does not require a lot of extra study as it is designed to test skills and knowledge that candidates are expected to already have.  Practice materials, including the test specification, practice questions, past papers, and an Assumed Subject Knowledge guide for Section 2 are available to candidates for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing website. There are some companies that help with coaching for the BMAT, however these companies are not endorsed by Cambridge Assessment who administer the test.
