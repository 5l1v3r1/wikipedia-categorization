The first CollegeWeekLive online college fair was in November 2007.  The company expanded the number and type of college admissions events offered each subsequent year. Each online college fair has featured 20â€“60 hours of live presentations from admissions experts. CollegeWeekLive makes this content available to audiences on demand if they are unable to attend the live show.  In October 2012 the company announced the CollegeWeekLive Advisor Center,  an online resource designed for high school guidance counselors that features lesson plans and videos tailored to aiding students in the college search process. In January 2013 the company expanded its executive team.  In April 2013 the company released the College Chat mobile application to the Google Play store, to lukewarm reviews, and an average rating of 2.9 stars out of 5.  In fall 2013, CollegeWeekLive becomes an approved credit provider through the National Board for Certified Counselors.  Counselors can now earn free credit contact hours toward their national certification on CollegeWeekLive for watching videos live or on demand. In January 2014, CollegeWeekLive updated their website from a flash-based environment to an HTML5 environment. September 2014, the Advisor center is replaced by High School Connect. CollegeWeekLive has been featured in the media including ABC News, The Washington Post, Fox 25 News, the San Francisco Chronicle, Business Week, USA Today and The New York Times.
