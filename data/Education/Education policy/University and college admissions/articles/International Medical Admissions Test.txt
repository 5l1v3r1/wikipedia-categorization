The International Medical Admissions Test (IMAT), is an aptitude test used as part of the admissions process for some Italian universities. These universities, with the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), offer undergraduate courses that are taught in English and open to applicants outside of Italy.  The test has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as the 'Italian Medical Admissions Test'. The following universities offer a number of places for both home and overseas students to study medicine as part of this initiative:  Applicants for the existing courses taught in Italian currently take an Italian admissions test (developed by the Italian Commission), with the available places awarded to those scoring highest on the test. In 2011, MIUR asked Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing to develop and deliver the English language equivalent of this Italian admissions test. The English-language version is called the International Medical Admissions Test (IMAT). Humanitas University in Italy also uses IMAT for its Medicine and Surgery degree course. Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (RNRMU) uses the test for admission to its bachelor's degree in Biomedicine (English taught, with the University of Turin) and Medicine and Surgery degree (English taught, with the University of Milan). Recently the format of the test has consisted of the following four sections: Recently candidates have been allowed a total of 100 minutes to complete the test (60 questions). All questions had five options, of which one was correct. A correct answer was awarded 1.5 points, a blank answer 0 points and a wrong answer subtracted 0.4 points from the final score. The format of the test is confirmed when the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) publish the IMAT decree.  IMAT takes place in April or September. The IMAT test date and registration process for Humanitas University and Russian National Research Medical University are different to the main IMAT test session and candidates should visit the Humanitas and Pirogov websites for information.
