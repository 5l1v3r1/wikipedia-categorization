Yield protection (commonly referred to as Tufts syndrome) is an admissions practice where a university or academic institution rejects or wait-lists highly qualified students on the grounds that such students are bound to be accepted by more prestigious universities or programs.  However, alternate theories regard the yield protection as a myth propagated by college students who failed to gain admission to elite universities.  Yield rate refers to the proportion of students who matriculate (i.e. accept an admissions offer and attend the college) after acceptance to a college.
