The Australian government operates the <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_Education_Contribution_Scheme\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Higher Education Contribution Scheme\">Higher Education Contribution Scheme</a> (This has been replaced by the very similar HECS-HELP - Higher Education Loan Program) for undergraduate students, so admission is rarely limited by prospective students' ability to pay up-front.

Some universities may run Vestibular twice a year, for two yearly intakes instead of only one. This option is popular with private universities, while public universities usually run Vestibular only once every year (in November, December or January). Universities offer a limited number of places, and the best ranked candidates according to their overall Vestibular grade are selected for admission. Although the Vestibular format changes from university to university, it typically consists of a week-long examination on compulsory high school subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Portuguese language and literature, and a foreign language (usually English). Private universities usually \"condense\" this week-long examinations into a couple of days, but some public universities still require a week-long marathon.\n</p><p>Since public universities are completely tuition-free, competition at the Vestibular is usually fierce for a place in a public university. Due to high number of applicants, the Vestibular at some public universities may include a preliminary elimination phase (known as \"<i>Primeira Fase</i>\"), typically consisting of multiple-choice questions and held between one and two months before the subject exams. A minimum cutoff score is normally required at the elimination phase to advance to the second part of the Vestibular.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"National_Unified_Admissions_System\">National Unified Admissions System</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: National Unified Admissions System\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In recent years, university admission criteria have been considerably changed by the introduction by the federal government of a new national secondary school exam known as <a href=\"/wiki/ENEM\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ENEM\">ENEM</a> (<i>Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio</i>) and the creation of a unified, national university application system known as SISU (<i>Sistema de Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Unificada</i>). Candidates in any Brazilian state can now apply for admission into courses available in the SISU system, even if the course of interest is offered by an out-of-state university. Places in any given course within the system are then filled based on the ranking of the applicants in descending order according to their overall grade in the ENEM. The application process is divided into three stages and candidates who fail to get a place in their course/university of interest in a given stage may re-apply either to the same or to a different course/university in subsequent stages.\n</p><p>In theory, any Brazilian university, either public or private, is free to join the SISU system and select their incoming freshman class based on ENEM marks. As of today, most public universities have joined SISU, but a few of them, most notably some of the most prestigious federal universities (e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo\" title=\"Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo\">UNIFESP</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_University_of_Rio_de_Janeiro\" title=\"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro\">UFRJ</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_University_of_Minas_Gerais\" title=\"Federal University of Minas Gerais\">UFMG</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_University_of_Rio_Grande_do_Sul\" title=\"Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul\">UFRGS</a>) have retained their own independent Vestibular exams, on top of the national ENEM, either for admission into all or part of their undergraduate courses.\n</p><p>Sometimes the ENEM replaces the old  elimination Part I (\"<i>primeira fase</i>\") of the Vestibular. Alternatively, ENEM results may be used as part of the final overall grade in the Vestibular. More rarely, a few public universities have decided not to use ENEM grades at all and continue to base their admission criteria on the Vestibular only. Notable examples in the latter group include the highly prestigious federal military schools like <a href=\"/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica\" title=\"Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica\">ITA</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Instituto_Militar_de_Engenharia\" title=\"Instituto Militar de Engenharia\">IME</a> and, as of 2010, the prestigious state research universities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (<a href=\"/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo\" title=\"University of S\u00e3o Paulo\">USP</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/UNICAMP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UNICAMP\">UNICAMP</a>). Resistance to the ENEM among some top public universities comes mostly from the perception that the national federal exam is less selective/rigorous than the older independent Vestibular.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Admission_Quotas\">Admission Quotas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Admission Quotas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another important recent development in university admissions in Brazil has been the introduction in most federal universities of a quota system where a certain number of places are reserved a priori to applicants of a certain racial/ethnic background who have completed their pre-university studies in a public (i.e. state-funded) school. Candidates who qualify may apply to a course of interest under the quota system either through the national SISU system or directly at their university of choice ( in case that university uses both its independent Vestibular and the national ENEM exam to select applicants). Again as a notable exception, the selective federal military schools and the state universities in S\u00e3o Paulo have so far refused to use any quota system based on race or schooling background. USP and UNICAMP, however, have instituted a race-blind \"social inclusion program\" that gives a bonus in the final Vestibular mgrade to candidates who come from the public secondary schools, thus boosting their chances of securing a place in certain university courses of interest without necessarily using a pre-determined quota.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Canada\">Canada</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Canada\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Undergraduate_entry\">Undergraduate entry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Undergraduate entry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>, students applying from high school generally hear word back from a college or university between late March and late May, though offers of admission may be extended to high achievers (through GPA or other submissions) as early as November\u2013January.

Students generally rank their chosen institutions in order of preference and submit their transcript to the institution or provincial application service for evaluation. In the majority of cases, acceptance is based entirely on marks, with potential for elevation depending on what province an applicant may be from. Applicants in-province may have less stringent grade requirements than out-of-province applicants. For instance, a student applying from an <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a> high school to a university in <a href=\"/wiki/Alberta\" title=\"Alberta\">Alberta</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Quebec\" title=\"Quebec\">Quebec</a> is likely to require marginally elevated grades as opposed to applying to any school in <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a> itself, where universities and colleges may have lower requirements for their own province's high school graduates.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2010)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>\n</p><p>In most cases, Canadian universities require students' high school transcript along with an application for admission. Applications for admission outline additional academic and extra curricular achievements that cannot be expressed through a students' transcript. Generally, universities require that students have taken a university-prep grade 12 <a href=\"/wiki/English_studies\" title=\"English studies\">English</a> course. Additionally, programs involving mathematics and/or natural science often require students to take a university-prep grade 12 <a href=\"/wiki/Calculus\" title=\"Calculus\">calculus</a> course, as well as university-prep grade 12 <a href=\"/wiki/Biology\" title=\"Biology\">biology</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Chemistry\" title=\"Chemistry\">chemistry</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Physics\" title=\"Physics\">physics</a>. Overall, universities base admission around a pupil's academic performance in university/advanced level courses in their grade 11 and 12 years. Also, most universities establish GPA cut offs for admission. This cut off is established based on the competitiveness of individual programs at specific universities. A more competitive program could have a cut off average of 90 percent or higher, while most prestigious programs maintain cut offs around 80 percent. Universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 percent. Students must take university/advanced level courses in grades 11 and 12 in order to apply for university.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"College\">College</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: College\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>College requirements vary more significantly, though none have entrance requirements above 85 percent from a Canadian high school. In general though, many colleges (such as <a href=\"/wiki/George_Brown_College\" title=\"George Brown College\">George Brown College</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Mohawk_College\" title=\"Mohawk College\">Mohawk College</a>) accept a very high proportion of students with averages above 70 percent, although they may place no limiting minimum for acceptance, and consequently take students with averages below 60 percent. Unlike universities, colleges do not have admission cut offs and as long as students have a passing average and the necessary courses, they can gain admission to most colleges. Incidentally, even the newest Canadian universities have larger endowments than any Canadian college, with no Canadian college having an endowment above $10 million. See <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_Canadian_universities_by_endowment\" title=\"List of Canadian universities by endowment\">List of Canadian universities by endowment</a>.\n</p><p>In addition, many education systems in <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a> have established different courses with varying intensity in order to curtail to a pupil's desired future. <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a> has gone the furthest with this idea, establishing two different streams in their secondary education system. The university stream includes courses that will prepare students for future studies at university, while the college stream is more applied and less intense, preparing individuals for the future pursuit of a college degree. Universities require these advanced courses for admission, while colleges will admit pupils from either stream.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_cases\">Special cases</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Special cases\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Students with an <a href=\"/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme\" title=\"IB Diploma Programme\">IB Diploma</a> can generally enter either college or university more easily than other Canadian high schoolers, due to the material covered in the program.

Generally, Public Universities conduct their admission in unified system of two as of 2017. Public Nationwide admissions to Public universities are subsidied by the government and students who succeed to enter university from one of the two schemes will enjoy lower to free university program fees. The first alternative is SNMPTN (Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified National Public Universities Admission). SNMPTN is a university admission scheme based on academic performances during the years of Senior High School. This selection system is designed only for students graduating during that respective year only. SNMPTN selection considers a few criteria such as student's academic grades and performances, achievements, stream or type of class (sciene or social, AP or Regular) and originating high school. However, not all senior students can apply, usually only 50% of the graduating class may apply for an 'A' accredited school and lower quotas for other accreditations. According to the law of the Ministry of Higher Education, the total holding admission into a public university  should at least be 30% from SNMPTN; each university may allocate more. The second alternative is SBMPTN (Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified Public Universities Admission Examination). SBMPTN is a university admission where you take two or three tests (aptitude test, natural science test, and/or social science test), applicants will also be required to submit into a practical session if the chosen major is art, music, or physical education. You also choose 3 different majors and/or universities. This examination is held nationwide once a year and unlike SNMPTN, is open to high school graduates of the last 3 years. Many students repeat or take gap years to retake the SBMPTN to get into their wanted university. According to the Ministry of Higher Education, minimum 30% of the entire public university quota should admit from SBMPTN. However, most public universities allocate 60% and above for SBMPTN due to the constantly high success rate of students who were accepted from this scheme. SBMPTN is known for its very difficult questions and challenging time-management difficulties. The exam is also held CBT (Computer-Based) starting of last year. Most universities are conducting independent selection mechanism on their own beside SNMPTN and SBMPTN such as SIMAK or PPKB from Universitas Indonesia or UTUL from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). These are called special programs as they tend to be more expensive due to the incentive that these programs are not under government subsidies. Meanwhile, Private Universities usually do their admission before and after Public Universities Admission. They sometimes do several admissions. Governmental Agency Institutions does their admission independently (not included in Unified National Public Universities Admission) and will usually have their own scheme for selection.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ireland\">Ireland</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: Ireland\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland\" title=\"Republic of Ireland\">Ireland</a>, students in their final year of secondary education apply to the <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Applications_Office\" title=\"Central Applications Office\">Central Applications Office</a>, listing several courses at any of the third-level institutions in order of preference.

A combination of methods may also be used. For public universities, the Center Test is often used as an initial filtering stage to determine eligibility to take the more difficult examinations set by each individual university. Public national universities usually require candidates to sit examinations across a wide range of subjects, whilst private ones allow a focus on arts and humanities or sciences, reducing the burden of preparation. However, public national universities are popular due to prestige and lower fees, although some private universities are more prestigious than certain public national universities. There is usually no limit on the number of colleges to which a student may apply but public national universities tend to hold their examinations on one of two days, which means that students must in practice choose two preferred public national universities and also correctly estimate their own ability to avoid picking a university examination that is too difficult or that is too easy. To assist with this, private companies run a number of mock examinations throughout the year, enabling candidates to gauge where they rank in comparison to other candidates nationwide. Based on this they will decide which examinations they should realistically be able to attempt. Reforms are to be inplemented to the Center examination in future, with extended answer questions being introduced in addition to multiple choice questions, and with official internationally recognised standardised tests in English being used to replace individual university exams in English.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Korea\">Korea</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Korea\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Korea\" title=\"Korea\">Korea</a> there is national center for test which happens every year around November called su-neung.

In general, students are not admitted to universities and colleges as a whole, but to particular <a href=\"/wiki/Course_of_study\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Course of study\">courses of study</a>.\n</p><p>During the first few months (September to December) of the final year of school or sixth form college (age 17/18) or after having left school, applicants register on the UCAS website and select five courses at higher education institutes (fewer choices are permitted for the more competitive subjects such as medicine and veterinary medicine). If the applicant is still at school, his or her teachers will give him or her predicted grades for their A-level, Highers or IB subjects, which are then used for the application. If the applicant has already left school, he or she applies with results already obtained.  The applicant must provide a personal statement describing in their own words why they want to study that particular subject and why they would be a committed student,<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> and their school must provide an academic reference.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>  Some universities (e.g. <a href=\"/wiki/Oxford\" title=\"Oxford\">Oxford</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge\" title=\"Cambridge\">Cambridge</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Manchester\" title=\"Manchester\">Manchester</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_College\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imperial College\">Imperial College</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_College_London\" title=\"King&#39;s College London\">King's College London</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/University_College_London\" title=\"University College London\">University College London</a>) and some disciplines (e.g. medicine) routinely require shortlisted candidates to attend an interview and/or complete special admissions tests<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> before deciding whether to make an offer.  In the absence of tests and interviews, the personal statement and reference can be decisive, as many students are likely to apply to competitive courses with similar predicted and actual grades.\n</p><p>In general, applications must be received mid-January for courses that start the following Autumn.  However the deadline is three months earlier, in mid-October, where the application includes a medical, dentistry or veterinary course, or any course at <a href=\"/wiki/Oxbridge\" title=\"Oxbridge\">Oxbridge</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For each course applied for, the applicant receives a response from the institution: rejection, conditional offer or unconditional offer. If a conditional offer is received, the student can only take up the place on the course if they later fulfil the stated conditions: normally the achievement of specific grades in their forthcoming exams. If no offers are received following the initial application, or the applicant does not wish to take up any of their offers,<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2009)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> UCAS+ can be used. Applicants can then apply to one course at a time in order to try to find a suitable offer.\n</p><p>Following the receipt of offers, whether after the initial application, or through UCAS+, the applicant chooses two courses for which offers have been made: a first choice and a second choice. If the conditions of the first choice offer are later met, the applicant may attend this course. If the applicant does not fulfil the conditions of their first choice, but does fulfil the conditions of their second \"insurance\" choice, they can attend their second choice course. If they fail to meet the conditions of both offers, they may choose to go through \"clearing\". This involves ringing up or sending their application to different universities in the hope of finding a place on another course. Many students do successfully find places through this route.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Factors_affecting_admission\">Factors affecting admission</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=53\" title=\"Edit section: Factors affecting admission\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Whether to admit an applicant to a course is entirely the decision of each individual university. They will base their decision on a variety of factors, but primarily the grades predicted or already received in school leaver examinations. As more and more applicants are attaining higher and higher grades in the A level examinations, most universities also use secondary admissions criteria. These may include results at GCSE or Standard grade examinations (or equivalent), the references provided on the application and the information provided on the personal statement. The personal statement can often be the deciding factor between two similar candidates so a small industry has sprung up offering false personal statements for a fee. UCAS uses \"similarity detection\" software to detect personal statements that have been written by third parties or <a href=\"/wiki/Plagiarism\" title=\"Plagiarism\">copied from other sources</a>, and universities can reject applications for this reason.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The personal statements generally describe why the applicant wants to study the subject they have applied for, what makes them suitable to study that subject, what makes them suitable to study at degree level generally, any work experience they have gained, their extracurricular activities and any other factors. This is the only way admissions tutors can normally get an impression of what a candidate is really like and assess the applicant's commitment to the subject.\n</p><p>In addition to the information provided on the UCAS form, some universities ask candidates to attend an interview. Oxford and Cambridge almost always interview applicants, unless, based on the UCAS form and/or admissions tests, they do not believe the applicant has any chance of admission. Other universities may choose to interview, though only in some subjects and on a much smaller scale, having already filtered out the majority of candidates. The interview gives the admissions tutors another chance to assess the candidate's suitability for the course.\n</p><p>Universities are increasingly being put under pressure from central Government to admit people from a wider range of social backgrounds. Social background can only be assessed by the type of school attended, as no information about income or background is otherwise required on the UCAS form.\n</p><p>Another important determinant of whether an offer is to be made is the amount of competition for admission to that course. The more competitive the course, the less likely an offer will be made and, therefore, the stronger the application must be. Applicants for medicine are often expected to have undertaken extensive work experience in a relevant field in order to show their commitment to the course. For the most competitive courses, less than 10% of applications may result in admission, whereas at the less competitive universities, practically all applicants may receive an offer of admission.\n</p><p>Ultimately, however, no matter how many extra-curricular activities and work experience have been undertaken, if the admissions tutor does not believe, based on the submitted exam results, the candidate is academically capable of completing the course, he or she will not be admitted.\n</p><p>A well qualified candidate applying under UCAS for five competitive courses to each of which only 10% of well qualified candidates could be accepted would have only a 40% chance of receiving at least one offer of acceptance.\nAlternatively, if five less competitive courses each having a 33% acceptance rate are chosen, the chance of receiving at least one offer is more than 85%.\nThis implies that a strategy for improving the chance of receiving at least one offer, to perhaps 70%, is indicated even to well qualified candidates.\nIt is right to know that in order to get admitted in a university in the United Kingdom, admission tests are not identified as the most important as the main factors that determine a college admission. Surveys show that strong grades in college-prep classes are important factors that can help you get in universities in easier way.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Postgraduate_entry\">Postgraduate entry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54\" title=\"Edit section: Postgraduate entry\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>All applications are made directly to the university or college, with no limit on the number of courses that can be applied for.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/College_admissions_in_the_United_States\" title=\"College admissions in the United States\">College admissions in the United States</a></div>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_of_America\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States of America\">United States of America</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/High_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> students apply to four-year <a href=\"/wiki/College\" title=\"College\">colleges</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Universities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Universities\">universities</a>, where <a href=\"/wiki/Undergraduate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Undergraduate\">undergraduate</a> students may earn a <a href=\"/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree\" title=\"Bachelor&#39;s degree\">Bachelor's degree</a>.

Fees are generally charged for each admissions application, but can be waived based on financial need. \n</p><p>Students apply to one or more colleges or universities by submitting an application which each college evaluates using its own criteria. The college then decides whether or not to extend an offer of admission (and possibly <a href=\"/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)\" title=\"Student financial aid (United States)\">financial aid</a>) to the student. The majority of colleges admit students to the college as a whole, and not to a particular <a href=\"/wiki/Academic_major\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Academic major\">academic major</a>, although this may not be the case in some specialized programs such as <a href=\"/wiki/Engineering\" title=\"Engineering\">engineering</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Architecture\" title=\"Architecture\">architecture</a> and maybe more impacted in certain majors. The system is decentralized: each college has its own criteria for admission, even when using a common application form. \n</p><p>Common criteria include <a href=\"/wiki/ACT_(test)\" title=\"ACT (test)\">ACT</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/SAT\" title=\"SAT\">SAT</a> scores, extracurricular activities, <a href=\"/wiki/Grade_point_average\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grade point average\">GPA</a>, demonstrated integrity, and a general college <a href=\"/wiki/Admissions_essay\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Admissions essay\">admissions essay</a>. Further criteria, used to varying degrees, include athletic ability, interest the student demonstrates in the college, <a href=\"/wiki/Legacy_preferences\" title=\"Legacy preferences\">legacy preferences</a> (family members having attended the school), race, ability to pay full tuition, potential to donate money to the school (<a href=\"/wiki/Development_case\" title=\"Development case\">development case</a>), desired class composition (especially diversity, which includes racial diversity, geographical and national diversity, and diversity of interests in the class), perceived fit, subjective evaluation of student character (based on essays or interviews), and general discretion by the admissions office. The importance of the various factors varies between universities, and selectiveness varies significantly, as measured by admissions rate (which depends both on selectiveness and number and type of applicants). The admissions rate can range from 100% (schools that accept everyone with a high school diploma) to under 10%.\n</p>\n<dl><dd><div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: <a href=\"/wiki/Transfer_admissions_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Transfer admissions in the United States\">Transfer admissions in the United States</a></div></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also_2\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=56\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Admissions_essay\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Admissions essay\">Admissions essay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/College_admissions_in_the_United_States\" title=\"College admissions in the United States\">College admissions in the United States</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/College_application\" title=\"College application\">College application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Educational_consultant\" title=\"Educational consultant\">Educational consultant</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Need-blind_admission\" title=\"Need-blind admission\">Need-blind admission</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Open_admissions\" title=\"Open admissions\">Open admissions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Open-door_academic_policy\" title=\"Open-door academic policy\">Open-door academic policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Statement_of_purpose\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Statement of purpose\">Statement of purpose</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Transfer_admissions_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Transfer admissions in the United States\">Transfer admissions in the United States</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit&amp;section=57\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"plainlinks metadata ambox ambox-content ambox-Refimprove\" role=\"presentation\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-image\"><div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png\" width=\"50\" height=\"39\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/75px-Question_book-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/100px-Question_book-new.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a></div></td><td class=\"mbox-text\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">This article <b>needs additional citations for <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">verification</a></b>.<span class=\"hide-when-compact\"> Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_and_college_admission&amp;action=edit\">improve this article</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.
