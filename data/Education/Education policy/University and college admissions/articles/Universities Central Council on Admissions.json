This concern led to the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals (<a href=\"/wiki/CVCP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CVCP\">CVCP</a>) setting up an ad hoc committee in 1957 to review the matter; this committee in its Third Report of January 1961 recommended the setting up of a central agency, which subsequently became known as UCCA. Its First and Second Reports had already made a number of recommendations aimed at harmonising admissions procedures across different universities.\n</p><p>The name UCCA referred originally to the management board (the Central Council) overseeing the new process, but soon came to refer to the organisation responsible for its day-to-day operation. This was based initially in London, and moved to <a href=\"/wiki/Cheltenham\" title=\"Cheltenham\">Cheltenham</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Gloucestershire\" title=\"Gloucestershire\">Gloucestershire</a> in 1968  . The new scheme had a pilot year handling a subset of applications for entry in 1963, and its first full year of operation handled admissions for 1964.\n</p><p>The scheme was essentially a collaborative venture between independent universities, and membership was voluntary. Most English universities joined from the start. Oxford and Cambridge joined (with slightly modified procedures) for the 1966 entry; the London medical and dental schools, as well as Belfast and Stirling for 1967. By 1968 the office was handling 592,000 applications from 110,400 candidates to 80 institutions.\n</p><p>Initially, processing of applications was carried out using <a href=\"/wiki/Punched_card\" title=\"Punched card\">punched card</a> technology. In 1964, UCCA started using the services of a <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_bureau\" title=\"Computer bureau\">computer bureau</a> with a <a href=\"/wiki/Univac\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Univac\">Univac</a> machine; in 1967 it installed its own <a href=\"/wiki/Univac\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Univac\">Univac</a> computer.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Applications_process\">Applications process</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Universities_Central_Council_on_Admissions&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Applications process\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The actual application process remained largely unchanged during the life of the organisation, except for minor details. Candidates submitted a single application listing six (later five) universities. Copies of the application were sent to these universities (unlike UCCA's modern counterpart, <a href=\"/wiki/UCAS\" title=\"UCAS\">UCAS</a>), which could make various kinds of offer: unconditional, or conditional on grades achieved in the subsequent <a href=\"/wiki/Advanced_Level_(UK)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Advanced Level (UK)\">A-level</a> examinations. Students could hold a maximum of two of these offers, a first choice, plus a reserve choice held in case they failed to achieve the grades asked by their first choice (if they received an unconditional or a pass-level offer from the university listed first on their application, no reserve could be held). In August, when the exam results were published, students who achieved their required grades (or who fell short of them, if the University had enough places available) would receive confirmation of their offer. Those who failed to receive a confirmed offer could apply for <i>Clearing</i>, a process that matched the remaining unplaced candidates to the remaining unfilled places.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Universities_Central_Council_on_Admissions&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Universities%27_Statistical_Record\" title=\"Universities&#39; Statistical Record\">Universities' Statistical Record</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Universities_Central_Council_on_Admissions&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n</div>\n<ol><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Kay, Ronald (June 1985). <i>UCCA: Its Origins And Development 1950-1985</i>.
