It ran in parallel to the university admissions system, <a href=\"/wiki/Universities_Central_Council_on_Admissions\" title=\"Universities Central Council on Admissions\">UCCA</a>, as well as the <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Register_and_Clearing_House\" title=\"Central Register and Clearing House\">Central Register and Clearing House</a>, which dealt with teacher-training applications to both polytechnics and specialist teacher training colleges, and <a href=\"/wiki/Art_and_Design_Admissions_Registry\" title=\"Art and Design Admissions Registry\">ADAR</a> which originally handled art and design course admissions to both polytechnics and specialist art and design colleges. All these admissions systems are now united within the <a href=\"/wiki/UCAS\" title=\"UCAS\">UCAS</a> admissions system.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Polytechnics_Central_Admissions_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The establishment of the teacher training admission system, the Central Register and Clearing House, in 1933, and the central admissions system for British universities, called UCCA, in 1961 had shown the benefits of a single admission system for higher education applicants. Although the polytechnics were degree-teaching institutions, through the <a href=\"/wiki/CNAA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CNAA\">CNAA</a> awards system, they were not eligible for admission to UCCA as it was reserved only for universities with degree awarding powers. Despite this the Polytechnics (see <a href=\"/wiki/Polytechnic_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Polytechnic (United Kingdom)\">Polytechnic (United Kingdom)</a> were involved as early as 1972 in discussions with <a href=\"/wiki/Universities_Central_Council_on_Admissions\" title=\"Universities Central Council on Admissions\">UCCA</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Central_Register_and_Clearing_House\" title=\"Central Register and Clearing House\">Central Register and Clearing House</a> about the possible future shape of one or more admissions systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RKU_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RKU-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  At this stage applicants dealt directly with each polytechnic and the polytechnics themselves were strongly regional or local in their appeal. A study in 1977 found that between sixty and seventy per cent of those admitted to a polytechnic had applied to that institution only, and that forty per cent of admissions to polytechnics resulted from applications made in August or September of the year of entry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RKU_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RKU-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1983 the Committee of Directors of Polytechnics began negotiations with UCCA to share its computing, technical and office facilities in <a href=\"/wiki/Cheltenham\" title=\"Cheltenham\">Cheltenham</a> to establish a course entrance system, based on the existing model used by UCCA.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> A grant of \u00a3210,000, from the British <a href=\"/wiki/Department_for_Education_and_Science\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department for Education and Science\">Department for Education and Science</a>, was awarded to set up a new unified admissions system, provisionally called PUCCA.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> However, instead of a unified system for both the universities and polytechnics a separate system for polytechnics emerged from the negotiations, modelled on UCCA, but known as PCAS. \nThe PCAS name was chosen as the <a href=\"/wiki/Department_for_Education_and_Science\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Department for Education and Science\">Department for Education and Science</a> grant was conditional upon the new scheme being made available for applications to Colleges of Higher Education later on. It was thought that the PCAS acronym could remain if the organization's name needed to be changed to Polytechnics' &amp; Colleges' Admissions Service.\n</p><p>Applicants to courses were given the option to apply separately for universities or polytechnics, or for both.\n</p><p>The PCAS system came into effect in 1985.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Polytechnic_Central_Admissions_System_1985,_p.11_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Polytechnic_Central_Admissions_System_1985,_p.11-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> It was led by its first Chief Executive, Tony Higgins,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> and in the first year it handled around 140,000 applications to polytechnic courses, of whom 40,000 a year went on to study at polytechnics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although many polytechnics offered art and design programmes, and some also offered teacher training courses, these admissions systems remained outside PCAS.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Polytechnic_Central_Admissions_System_1985,_p.11_4-1\"
