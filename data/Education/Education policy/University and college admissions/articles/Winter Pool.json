On average one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of a place.\n</p><p>Statistics released by the University show that some of the more popular and oversubscribed colleges such as <a href=\"/wiki/Clare_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Clare College, Cambridge\">Clare College</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Pembroke_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Pembroke College,
