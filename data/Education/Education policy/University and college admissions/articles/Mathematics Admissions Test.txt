The Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT) is a 2-hour 30-minute subject-specific admissions test for applicants to the University of Oxford and, as of 2013, Imperial College London  for undergraduate degree courses in Mathematics, Computer Science and their joint degrees. It is set with the aim of being approachable by all students, including those without Further Mathematics A Level.  The MAT is held pre-interview stage at the beginning of November. Test results are not published automatically, but for the University of Oxford, candidates may request their test score as part of the usual University of Oxford feedback process.
