Higher education policy refers to how higher education institutions like universities are organised, funded and operated in a society. According to Ansell (2006) there are "three different institutional forms of higher education provision: the Anglo-Saxon, Continental and the Scandinavian education system."  According to Ansell (2006), "[t]he Anglo-Saxon education system leads to a mass, partially private and publicly inexpensive system". The Anglo-Saxon system is sometimes described as an Anglo-American education system.  According to Ansell (2006), "[t]he Continental educational system leads to an elite, fully public and inexpensive system". According to Ansell (2006), "[t]he Scandinavian education system leads to a mass, fully public, but highly expensive system".
