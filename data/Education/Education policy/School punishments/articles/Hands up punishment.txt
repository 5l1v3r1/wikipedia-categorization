The hands up punishment is a form of punishment given in schools of the Indian subcontinent, especially in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In this punishment, one is made to raise his or her hands above their head—a stress position—and remain in this state for a period of time. [unreliable source] The recipient of the punishment is not permitted to join their hands above their head. The hands up position becomes painful within ten or fifteen minutes. This is generally done to correct mischievous students in schools.
