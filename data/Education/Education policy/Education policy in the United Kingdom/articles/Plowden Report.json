The administration also made clear its intention to <a href=\"/wiki/Raising_Of_School_Leaving_Age\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Raising Of School Leaving Age\">raise school-leaving age</a> to 16 (from the then 15).\n</p><p>In the years leading up to, and during the collation of the report, prevalent thinking in educational psychology was highly influenced by the work of such people as <a href=\"/wiki/Jean_Piaget\" title=\"Jean Piaget\">Jean Piaget</a> who published a seminal work on the matter in 1962.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Main_findings\">Main findings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plowden_Report&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Main findings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The report was widely known for its praising of <a href=\"/wiki/Child-centred\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Child-centred\">child-centred</a> approaches to education, stressing that \"at the heart of the educational process lies the child\".\n</p><p>Recommendations in the report included those listed below:\n</p>\n<ul><li>All schools should have a programme for contact with children's homes (Ch. 4)</li>\n<li>Primary schools should be used as fully as possible out of ordinary hours (Ch. 5)</li>\n<li>A national policy of 'positive discrimination' should favour schools in deprived neighbourhoods (Ch. 5)</li>\n<li>Training college should expand opportunities for teachers to train in teaching English to immigrants (Ch. 6)</li>\n<li>Surveys of primary education should be undertaken every 10 years (Ch. 8)</li>\n<li>Nursery education should be available to children at any time after they reach the age of three (Ch. 9)</li>\n<li>A three-tier system of <a href=\"/wiki/First_school\" title=\"First school\">first</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_school\" title=\"Middle school\">middle</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Secondary_school\" title=\"Secondary school\">Secondary schools</a>, with transfer at ages 8 and 12.

He received the report in 1967, but implementation of the recommendations was piecemeal.\n</p><p>In some areas, local education authorities implemented changes themselves, such as the introduction of three-tier education systems in many places. Similarly, over the 40 years, many of the recommendations which first appeared in the report, have evolved and appeared in legislation under other guises, such as the widespread  introduction of state-funded <a href=\"/wiki/Nursery_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nursery school\">nursery provision</a>, Extended Schools, requirement for a Home School Agreement to be presented (but not signed), the ban on corporal punishment, ESOL programmes,  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Educational_Action_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Educational Action Zone (page does not exist)\">Educational Action Zones</a> and most of all the comprehensive system. However the three-tier system is now uncommon in Britain with a two-tier system of primary school followed by a transition aged 11 to secondary school being normal. The system of children transferring to secondary school at the age of 12 has now been almost completely abandoned.\n</p><p>Male teachers remain a small minority in primaries.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Primary_Review\">New Primary Review</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plowden_Report&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: New Primary Review\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A new review of primary education in England began on 2 October 2006 under the leadership of Professor Robin Alexander under the title <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_Review\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Primary Review\">The Primary Review</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Primary_sources\">Primary sources</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Plowden_Report&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Primary sources\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The official records of the Plowden committee are held in the records created or inherited by the Department of Education and Science, and of related bodies <a href=\"/wiki/The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"The National Archives (United Kingdom)\">The National Archives</a>.
