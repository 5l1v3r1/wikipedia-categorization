A Teaching school is an Ofsted-graded outstanding school that work with other partners to provide high-quality training and development to school staff. They are part of the UK government's plan to give schools in England a central role in raising standards by developing a self-improving and sustainable school-led system.  They were first introduced by the coalition government in 2010, in a white paper  entitled "The Importance of Teaching".  The intention was to replace the university-based teacher training programmes with a workplace-based school-centred and led approach which devolves responsibility for development and management of education to the schools.   This article incorporates text published under the British Open Government Licence:
