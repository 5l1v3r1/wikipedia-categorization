 The Jean Monnet Programme, also known as the Jean Monnet Project, is a European Union initiative to encourage teaching, research and reflection in the field of European integration studies in higher education institutions. It is named for Jean Monnet (1888â€“1979), regarded by many as a chief architect of European Unity. The programme includes the network of Jean Monnet European Centres of Excellence, university-level institutions recognised by the European Commission for high quality research into, and teaching of, topics relating to European integration. The Commission also funds Jean Monnet Chairs and Jean Monnet teaching modules. The program was originally launched in 1989 and helped to set up 162 Jean Monnet European Centres of Excellence, 875 Jean Monnet Chairs and 1001 Jean Monnet Teaching Modules worldwide in 72 countries in five continents. These projects bring together 1,500 professors, and reach approximatively 500,000 students every year. Jean Monnet Projects are selected on the basis of their academic merits and following a process of rigorous and independent peer review. The projects will be implemented in strict compliance with the principle of academic autonomy and freedom.
