The Magna Charta Universitatum is a document to celebrate university traditions and encourage bonds among European universities,  but it also serves as a universal inspiration and is open to universities throughout the world.  It was founded by the University of Bologna and the European Rectors' Conference (now EUA) in 1988  and has been signed by 805 universities from 85 countries.  The Magna Charta Universitatum Europaeum was formally signed by 430 university rectors on September 18, 1988 at Piazza Maggiore in Bologna, to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the founding of the University of Bologna.  The final text of the document was drafted in January 1988 in Barcelona.
