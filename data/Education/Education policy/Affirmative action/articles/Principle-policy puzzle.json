The seeming <a href=\"/wiki/Paradox\" title=\"Paradox\">paradox</a> is explained by noting that lack of support for <a href=\"/wiki/Affirmative_action\" title=\"Affirmative action\">affirmative action</a> comes from conservative <a href=\"/wiki/Ideology\" title=\"Ideology\">ideology</a>, such that opponents of government policies intended to realize racial equality are not necessarily hypocrites. Individuals may also agree with the principle but feel that the policies do not actually help to achieve the stated principle.\n</p><p>A more global example is the strong international desire for a clean and health environment compared to the lack of enthusiasm for the type of regulations and taxes that would be needed to achieve this.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Principle-policy_puzzle&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The principle-policy puzzle was described in <i>Reasoning and Choice</i> (1991) by Paul M.
