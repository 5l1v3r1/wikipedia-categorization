In 1989, NCTM developed the <i>Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics,</i> followed by the <i>Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics</i> (1991) and the <i>Assessment Standards for School Mathematics</i> (1995). Education officials lauded these math standards, and the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Science_Foundation\" title=\"National Science Foundation\">National Science Foundation</a> funded several projects to develop curricula consistent with recommendations of the standards. The <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education\" title=\"United States Department of Education\">Department of Education</a> cited several of these programs as \"exemplary\". However, implementation of the reform has run into strong criticism and opposition, including parental revolts and the creation of antireform organizations such as <a href=\"/wiki/Mathematically_Correct\" title=\"Mathematically Correct\">Mathematically Correct</a> and HOLD. These organizations object especially to reform curricula that greatly decrease attention to the practice and memorization of basic skills and facts. Critics of the reform include a contingent of vocal mathematicians, and some other mathematicians have expressed at least some serious criticism of the reformers in the past.\n</p><p>In 2000, NCTM released the updated <i><a href=\"/wiki/Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics\" title=\"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics\">Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</a></i>.\n<i>Principles and Standards</i> is widely considered to be a more balanced and less controversial vision of reform than its predecessor.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Post.E2.80.93World_War_II_plan\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Post\u2013World_War_II_plan\">Post\u2013World War II plan</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Post\u2013World War II plan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1944, NCTM created a postwar plan to help World War II have a lasting effect on math education. Grades 1-6 were considered crucial years to build the foundations of math concepts with the main focus on algebra. In the war years, algebra had one understood purpose: to help the military and industries with the war effort. Math educators hoped to help their students see the need for algebra in the life of an everyday citizen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arithmetic1941_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arithmetic1941-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The report outlined three strategies that helped math educators emphasize the everyday usage of algebra.  First, teachers focused on the meanings behind concepts.  Before, teachers were expected to use either the Drill or the Meaning Theory.  Now, teachers gave students purpose behind every concept while providing an ample number of problems.  Second, teachers abandoned the informal technique of teaching.  This technique was popular during the 1930s and continued during the war, and in essence depended on what the students wanted to learn, based on their interests and needs.  Instead, math teachers approached the material in an organized manner.  The thinking was that Math itself had a very distinct organization that could not be compromised simply because the student was uninterested in the matter.  Third, teachers learned to adapt to the students by offering the proper practice students needed in order to be successful.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arithmetic1941_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arithmetic1941-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\nAfter the sixth year, seventh and eighth grades were considered key in ensuring students learned concepts, and were increasingly standardized for all pupils.  During these years, teachers verified all key concepts learned in the previous years were mastered, while preparing students for the sequential math courses offered in high school.  The army credited poor performance of males during the war to the men forgetting math concepts; it was recommended that reinforcing past concepts learned would solve this problem.  The report lists the organization of the topics that should be taught in these years.  \"(1) number and computation; (2) the geometry of everyday life; (3) graphic representation; (4) an introduction to the essentials of elementary algebra (formula and equation).\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arithmetic1941_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arithmetic1941-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> At the same time, these years were meant to help students gain critical thinking skills applicable to every aspect of life.  In middle school, students should gain maturity in math, and confidence in past material.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arithmetic1941_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arithmetic1941-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\nIn ninth grade, NCTM expressed the need for a two track curriculum for students in large schools.  Those who have a greater desire to study math would go on one track, studying algebra.  Those who did not have a large interest in math would go another route, studying general mathematics, which eliminated the problem of students being held back.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Arithmetic1941_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Arithmetic1941-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\nFinally, grades 10-12 built math maturity.  In the tenth year, courses focused on geometry through algebraic uses.  The eleventh year focused on a continuation of more advanced algebra topics.  These topics were more advanced than those discussed in the ninth grade.  However, if the student took an advanced algebra class during the ninth year, then he took two of the semester classes offered the twelfth year.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1961_The_Revolution_in_School_Mathematics\">1961 <i>The Revolution in School Mathematics</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: 1961 The Revolution in School Mathematics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>NCTM participated in promoting the adoption of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/New_Math\" title=\"New Math\">New Mathematics</a></i> also known at that time as <i>Modern Mathematics</i>. In 1960, NCTM with the financial support of the National Science Foundation, conducted eight Regional Orientation Conferences in Mathematics in various parts of the United States, pushing to \"make a concerted effort toward rapid improvement of school mathematics\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-nctm-1961_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nctm-1961-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>.

Ultimately, \"many principals and superintendents urged the modern curricula on their teachers just to show parents and school boards that they were alert and active\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-kline-1973_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kline-1973-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p><p>Kline critiqued the <i>Modern Mathematics</i> approach to mathematics education and disparaged the adoption of the term \"Modern Mathematics\" as \"pure propaganda\".

The increased emphasis on concepts required decreased emphasis on direct instruction of facts and algorithms. This decrease of traditional rote learning was sometimes understood by both critics and proponents of the standards to mean elimination of basic skills and precise answers, but NCTM has refuted this interpretation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Reform_mathematics\" title=\"Reform mathematics\">reform mathematics</a>, students are exposed to algebraic concepts such as patterns and the commutative property as early as first grade. Standard arithmetic methods are not taught until children have had an opportunity to explore and understand how mathematical principles work, usually by first inventing their own methods for solving problems and sometimes ending with children's guided discovery of traditional methods. The Standards called for a de-emphasis of complex calculation drills.\n</p><p>The standards set forth a democratic vision that for the first time set out to promote equity and mathematical power as a goal for all students, including women and underrepresented minorities. The use of calculators and manipulatives was encouraged and rote memorization were de-emphasized. The 1989 standards encouraged writing in order to learn expression of mathematical ideas. All students were expected to master enough mathematics to succeed in college, and rather than defining success by rank order, uniform, high standards were set for all students. Explicit goals of <a href=\"/wiki/Standards_based_education_reform\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Standards based education reform\">standards based education reform</a> were to require all students to pass high standards of performance, to improve international competitiveness, eliminate the <a href=\"/wiki/Achievement_gap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Achievement gap\">achievement gap</a> and produce a productive labor force.

The U.S. Department of Education named several standards-based curricula as \"exemplary\", though a group of academics responded in protest with an ad taken out in the Washington Post, noting selection was made largely on which curricula implemented the standards most extensively rather than on demonstrated improvements in test scores.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Although the standards were the <a href=\"/wiki/Consensus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Consensus\">consensus</a> of those teaching mathematics in the context of real life, they also became a lightning rod of criticism as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Math_wars\" title=\"Math wars\">math wars</a>\" erupted in some communities that were opposed to some of the more radical changes to mathematics instruction such as <a href=\"/wiki/Mathland\" title=\"Mathland\">Mathland</a>'s Fantasy Lunch and what some dubbed \"rainforest algebra\".

The California State Board of Education <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/mthmain.asp\">[1]</a> was one of the first to embrace the 1989 standards, and also among the first to move back towards <a href=\"/wiki/Traditional_mathematics\" title=\"Traditional mathematics\">traditional standards</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2000_Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics\">2000 <i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: 2000 Principles and Standards for School Mathematics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics\" title=\"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics\">Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</a></div>\n<p>The controversy surrounding the 1989 standards paved the way for revised standards which sought more clarity and balance. In 2000, NCTM used a consensus process involving mathematicians, teachers, and educational researchers to revise its standards with the release of the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, which replaced all preceding publications. The new standards were organized around six principles (Equity, Curriculum, Teaching, Learning, Assessment, and Technology) and ten strands, which included five content areas (Number and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis and Probability) and five processes (Problem Solving, Reasoning and Proof, Communication, Connections, and Representation). <i>Principles and Standards</i> was not perceived to be as radical as the 1989 standards and did not engender significant criticism. The new standards have been widely used to inform textbook creation, state and local curricula, and current trends in teaching.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2006_Curriculum_Focal_Points\">2006 <i>Curriculum Focal Points</i></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: 2006 Curriculum Focal Points\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In September 2006, NCTM released <a href=\"/wiki/Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics#Curriculum_Focal_Points\" title=\"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics\"><i>Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence</i></a>. In the Focal Points, NCTM identifies what it believes to be the most important mathematical topics for each grade level, including the related ideas, concepts, skills, and procedures that form the foundation for understanding and lasting learning. In the Focal Points, NCTM made it clear that the standard algorithms were to be included in arithmetic instruction.\n</p><p>Mathematics curricula in the United States are often described as \u201ca mile wide and an inch deep\u201d when compared with curricula from other countries. State content expectations per grade level range anywhere between 26 and 89 topics. At just three per grade (plus a few additional \"connection\" topics), the focal points offer more than headings for long lists, providing instead descriptions of the most significant mathematical concepts and skills at each grade level and identifying important connections to other topics. NCTM believes that organizing a curriculum around these described focal points, with a clear emphasis on the processes that Principles and Standards addresses in the Process Standards\u2014communication, reasoning, representation, connections, and, particularly, problem solving\u2014can provide students with a connected, coherent, ever expanding body of mathematical knowledge and ways of thinking.\n</p><p>The Focal Points were one of the documents used in creating the 2010 <a href=\"/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Common Core State Standards\">Common Core State Standards</a>, which have been adopted by most states as the basis for new math curricula.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/American_Mathematical_Association_of_Two-Year_Colleges\" title=\"American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges\">American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America\" title=\"Mathematical Association of America\">Mathematical Association of America</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.nctm.org/About/\">http://www.nctm.org/About/</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.journal-ranking.com/ranking/listCommonRanking.html?selfCitationWeight=1&amp;externalCitationWeight=1&amp;citingStartYear=1901&amp;journalListId=295\">\"Journal Ranking: Education and Educational Research\"</a><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
