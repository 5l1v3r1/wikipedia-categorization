The ministry for Sport, Arts and Recreation is a department in the Zimbabwean government which is responsible for the operation of sports and development of the arts within the country. The position was created by President Emmerson Mnangagwa following his cabinet formation in December 2017 when he split Higher Education and Primary and Secondary Eucation into two separate government agencies, the latter being responsible for sports and the arts prior to this move.  The minister is former Olympic swimmer and record holder Kirsty Coventry.
