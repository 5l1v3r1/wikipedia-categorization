The Ministry or Board of Rites was one of the Six Ministries of government in late imperial China. It existed from the Tang (7th century) until the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. Along with religious rituals and court ceremonial, the Ministry of Rites also oversaw the imperial examination and China's foreign relations. Under the Han, similar functions were performed by the Ministry of Ceremonies. In early medieval China, its functions were performed by other officials including the Grand Herald. Under the Song (10th-13th centuries), its functions were temporarily transferred to the Zhongshu Sheng. Its administration of China's foreign relations was ended by the establishment of the Zongli Yamen in 1861.
