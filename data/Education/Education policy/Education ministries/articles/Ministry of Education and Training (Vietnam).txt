  The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET, Vietnamese: Bộ Giáo dục và Đào tạo) is the government ministry responsible for the governance of general/academic education and higher education (training) in Vietnam.  Vocational Education is controlled by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MoLISA).   Ministry offices are located in central Ha Noi, on Co Dai Viet street. In the Vietnamese system, MoET is responsible for the 'professional' performance and regulation of educational institutions under it, but not for ownership or finance, except for the major public universities (VNU, Vietnam National University, in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, fall directly under the Prime Minister's office, not MoET).  Ownership and administrative/financial responsibility for the bulk of educational institutions, including all school-level general education, falls under Provinces or Districts, which have substantial autonomy on many budgetary decisions under the Vietnamese constitution. Some institutions are also controlled by other central ministries, although mainly at higher education levels (senior secondary and colleges). The Ministry maintains provincial-level departments (DoETs, Departments of E&T), under which there are also district offices (BoETs, for Bureau of E&T), and central departments.  Central departments of note include:  Colleges and universities under the maintenance of the Ministry of Education and Training include:
