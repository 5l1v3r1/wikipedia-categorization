The Ministry of Education (Thai: กระทรวงศึกษาธิการ; RTGS: Krasuang Sueksathikan; Abrv: MOE) is a Thai governmental body responsible for the oversight of education in Thailand. It was established by King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) in 1892 as the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Thai: กระทรวงธรรมการ; RTGS: krasuang thamma kan) which controlled religion, education, healthcare, and museums. In 1941, the ministry changed its Thai name to the present one.  Its headquarters have been in the Chan Kasem Palace since 1937.  "Quality student-centred education is provided for everyone with distribution of equitable education opportunities, in cities, rural and outreached areas. Education leads to people's vigour building. Vigorous and knowledgeable people are powerful capital to fight poverty."  The National Identity Office, which defines and promotes "Thainess" is somewhere within the MOE.
