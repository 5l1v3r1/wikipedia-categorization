The library started its operations on June 18, 2003 from a temporary site in Tanglin Road. It relocated to the Woodlands campus site in February 2006. The current library was opened on the April 10, 2006, with 9,400 square metres (101,000 sq ft) of space. The library was designed jointly by Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki and DP Architects. The library is situated at the heart of the Agora, a public space for the interaction and the exchange of information and ideas. In support of Republic Polytechnic’s pedagogical approach based on problem-based learning, the library spaces are flexible, adaptable, and less structured so that spontaneous activities can occur throughout.  The library started out in the Tanglin Campus, opening on the June 18, 2003, and was an actively used library for 3 years. It provided 1,300 square metres (14,000 sq ft) of space and was designed by the National Library Board with an aim of being trendy and inviting to teenagers. During these 3 years between 2003 and 2006, the library hosted more than 30 local music groups in a local music awareness programme created by Bob Tan of the Centre of Culture and Communication. It relocated to the Woodlands campus site in April 2006.  The current library was opened on the April 10, 2006 with 9,400 square metres (101,000 sq ft) of space.
