In 1871, the province of <a href=\"/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a> set up two parallel secondary education systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Then, <a href=\"/wiki/Galt_Collegiate_Institute\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Galt Collegiate Institute\">Galt Collegiate Institute</a> was the first and one of only six schools in Ontario to have the name and privileges of being called a <i>Collegiate Institute</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Collegiate institutes offered arts and humanities education, including Greek and Latin, for <a href=\"/wiki/University\" title=\"University\">university</a>-bound students. <a href=\"/wiki/High_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school\">High schools</a> offered vocational and science programs for those planning to enter the workforce upon graduation. The system was later adopted by other provinces, including <a href=\"/wiki/Alberta\" title=\"Alberta\">Alberta</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Manitoba\" title=\"Manitoba\">Manitoba</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Saskatchewan\" title=\"Saskatchewan\">Saskatchewan</a>.\n</p><p>It was quite quickly realized that the division did not work very well. Over time, high schools responded to students' needs and increasingly offered the arts courses that were essential for the workforce. At the same time, as universities began teaching science and engineering, so did the collegiate institutes. Within a decade, the distinctions between the two systems were greatly blurred, and eventually, the two systems were merged in to a single secondary school system. In Ontario, after the merger of the two systems, the terms <i>Collegiate Institute</i>, <i>High School</i>, and <i>Secondary School</i> were all used in conjunction to refer to secondary educational institutions.\n</p><p>The term is most commonly found in Ontario, but its prominence varies throughout the province. In some <a href=\"/wiki/School_board\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School board\">school boards</a>, including <a href=\"/wiki/Lakehead_District_School_Board\" title=\"Lakehead District School Board\">Lakehead District School Board</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Toronto_District_School_Board\" title=\"Toronto District School Board\">Toronto District School Board</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Waterloo_Region_District_School_Board\" title=\"Waterloo Region District School Board\">Waterloo Region District School Board</a>, almost all secondary schools are named <i>Collegiate Institute</i>. Conversely, some school boards, like the <a href=\"/wiki/Hamilton-Wentworth_District_School_Board\" title=\"Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board\">Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board</a>, have no secondary school with the term in its name. Most school boards in Ontario, however, continue to use all three terms (<i>Collegiate Institute</i>, <i>High School</i>, and <i>Secondary School</i>) in the names of their schools.\n</p><p>Although several Western Canadian provinces adopted Ontario's parallel school system (Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan), there are far fewer schools in <a href=\"/wiki/Western_Canada\" title=\"Western Canada\">Western Canada</a> that are known as collegiate institutes, with most having been closed or renamed over the decades. However, several secondary schools retain the term in their name, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Lethbridge_Collegiate_Institute\" title=\"Lethbridge Collegiate Institute\">Lethbridge Collegiate Institute</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Lethbridge\" title=\"Lethbridge\">Lethbridge</a>, Alberta, and <a href=\"/wiki/Mennonite_Brethren_Collegiate_Institute\" title=\"Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute\">Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Winnipeg\" title=\"Winnipeg\">Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba. In the cities of <a href=\"/wiki/Saskatoon\" title=\"Saskatoon\">Saskatoon</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan\" title=\"Regina, Saskatchewan\">Regina</a>, the term survives as <i>Collegiate</i>, which is found in the names of all public secondary schools and some <a href=\"/wiki/Catholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Catholic\">Catholic</a> secondary schools in those two cities. That contrasts the rest of Saskatchewan, where the most common name for secondary school is <i>High School</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"United_States\">United States</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Collegiate_institute&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: United States\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute,_North_Scituate,_R.I._(1905).jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute%2C_North_Scituate%2C_R.I._%281905%29.jpg/220px-Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute%2C_North_Scituate%2C_R.I._%281905%29.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"146\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute%2C_North_Scituate%2C_R.I._%281905%29.jpg/330px-Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute%2C_North_Scituate%2C_R.I._%281905%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute%2C_North_Scituate%2C_R.I._%281905%29.jpg/440px-Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute%2C_North_Scituate%2C_R.I._%281905%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"600\" data-file-height=\"399\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Pentecostal_Collegiate_Institute,_North_Scituate,_R.I._(1905).jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Pentecostal Collegiate Institute at the Rhode Island campus, c. 1905</div></div></div>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>, the term has largely fallen into disuse. Collegiate institutes in the United States were, for the most part, <a href=\"/wiki/College\" title=\"College\">colleges</a>, and even the first name of <a href=\"/wiki/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale University</a> when founded in 1701 was a similar-sounding <i>Collegiate School</i>. But the definition of a college in the U.S. also differs from that of other countries, and has been <a href=\"/wiki/College#United_States\" title=\"College\">primarily</a> based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Liberal_arts_college\" title=\"Liberal arts college\">liberal arts college</a> model of <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">higher education</a>. Two examples of collegiate institutes in the United States before the term fell out of use are the Oberlin Collegiate Institute of <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio\" title=\"Ohio\">Ohio</a>, now <a href=\"/wiki/Oberlin_College\" title=\"Oberlin College\">Oberlin College</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and the Pentecostal Collegiate Institute of <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_(state)\" title=\"New York (state)\">New York</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rhode_Island\" title=\"Rhode Island\">Rhode Island</a>, now the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Nazarene_College\" title=\"Eastern Nazarene College\">Eastern Nazarene College</a> of <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts\" title=\"Massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Both were founded as <a href=\"/wiki/Postsecondary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Postsecondary\">postsecondary</a> institutions (in 1833 and 1900, respectively), but the latter would drop its college curriculum and exist as a college preparatory school from 1902 until 1918, demonstrating the flexibility of the term <i>collegiate institute</i>. Partly because the term <a href=\"/wiki/Institute\" title=\"Institute\">institute</a> holds some ambiguity, many such schools would later change their names to use <i>college</i> instead of <i>collegiate institute</i> to more accurately represent their nature and mission, and the term \"collegiate institute\" would see little use beyond the early 20th century.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Collegiate_institute&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=B7MAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA668&amp;lpg=PA668&amp;dq=definition+encyclopedia+%22collegiate+institute%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kTiakJzpF4&amp;sig=EgjbrBeot8z03w3WvwDnnE3OeJQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pSh8SsPPNam_twesvvDhAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=collegiate%20institute&amp;f=false\"><i>The Cyclop\u00e6dia of education</i> by </a><a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Kiddle\" title=\"Henry Kiddle\">Henry Kiddle</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Jacob_Schem\" title=\"Alexander Jacob Schem\">Alexander Jacob Schem</a>.
