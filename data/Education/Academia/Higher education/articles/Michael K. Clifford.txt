Dr. Michael K. Clifford is an American education investor and advisor, and a proponent of higher education globally. Initially following his father's trade as a musician, Clifford converted to Christianity and decided to follow Jesus in his mid-twenties. Contacts made through faith-based non-profit organizations introduced him to John Sperling and Brian Mueller, and he moved into the field of online higher education.  Working as a fundraiser for faith-based organizations brought Clifford to the notice of Pat Robertson, and he co-managed Robertson's 1988 bid for the U.S. Presidency.  Clifford's early business practices involved identifying and purchasing nonprofit colleges and converting them to a new model.   In 2004 he bought Grand Canyon University on behalf of Dream Center Education Holdings, and in 2009 he set up Victory University.  He was also involved in the creation of the Jack Welch Management Institute, and helped found the company that would later become Bridgepoint Education.  In 2010 Clifford was profiled in the PBS documentary College, which examined the effects of and issues surrounding the for-profit college industry.  In 2013 Clifford created DreamDegree, an unaccredited online learning portal.  He founded Significant Systems, a consultancy firm for higher education institutions,  which later rebranded as SignificantFederation.
