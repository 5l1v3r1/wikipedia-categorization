Reed College, based in Portland, Oregon, was the first institution to offer a course for credit when, in 1911, they offered a course that was divided into men-only and women-only sections that met for 2 hours per week for the year. <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In May 1970, <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina\" title=\"University of South Carolina\">University of South Carolina</a> President Thomas Jones faced campus unrest and violence.

In 1983, Carolina's University 101 faculty director, John N. Gardner, organized the first Annual Conference on the Freshman Year Experience. \n</p><p>In 1986, Carolina partnered with the <a href=\"/wiki/Newcastle-upon-Tyne_Polytechnic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic\">Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic</a> to produce the first International Conference on the First-Year Experience. Also in 1986, Carolina established the National Resource Center; as it broadened its focus it underwent a number of name changes, settling on the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition in 1998.

Through its work with conferences and continuing education, a full complement of publications, the pursuit of a research agenda, and the creation and dissemination of online resources, the Center has grown to become the trusted expert, internationally recognized leader, and clearinghouse for scholarship, policy, and best practice for the first-year experience and all post-secondary student transitions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FYE-history_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FYE-history-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Typical_structure\">Typical structure</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_First_Year_Experience_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Typical structure\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many of the colleges and universities that use the program require that all incoming freshmen take the freshman seminar; other schools have the program as optional, but recommended. Most first-year seminars are a semester long and start at <a href=\"/wiki/Student_orientation\" title=\"Student orientation\">student orientation</a>. From orientation, students enroll in the course, which gives them a variety of college experiences, from tours of the campus to a breakdown of how to study for tests.

The program aims to assist students in discovering their purpose, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with a plan for their future.  The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six <a href=\"/wiki/Appreciative_advising\" title=\"Appreciative advising\">appreciative advising</a> stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first-semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first-semester GPA of 2.72.\n</p><p>J.N. Gardner, member of The Journal of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers and author of The freshman-year experience, emphasized the importance of having courses that focus on the first few weeks of college. During this time is most likely when students will make the decision to drop-out, due to the increase of feeling personal independence and habit forming, as well as forming relationships that they will continue throughout their college careers.  Gardner also suggested that things such as curriculum modifications, academic advisement, faculty led freshmen level courses instead of graduate student led, living/learning environments, peer counseling, and special freshmen administrative units improve the student\u2019s freshman year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_First_Year_Experience_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Appreciative_advising\" title=\"Appreciative advising\">Appreciative advising</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Purpose-guided_education\" title=\"Purpose-guided education\">Purpose-guided education</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Purpose_network\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Purpose network\">Purpose network</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Student_affairs\" title=\"Student affairs\">Student affairs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Supplemental_instruction\" title=\"Supplemental instruction\">Supplemental instruction</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_First_Year_Experience_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Further reading\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Association of College Research Libraries (2007). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080705142433/http://www.ala.org/ala/acrlbucket/is/publicationsacrl/tmcfyebib.cfm\"><i>The First-Year Experience and Academic Libraries: A Select, Annotated Bibliography.</i></a> Retrieved April 20, 2008.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=The_First_Year_Experience_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.albany.edu/projren/info/info.htm\">\"Project Renaissance Program,\"</a> SUNY Albany website.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20061222220622/http://www.albany.edu/projren/info/info.htm\">Archived</a> December 22, 2006, at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web\">Bigger, Jessica. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Advising-first-year-students.aspx\">\"Improving the Odds for Freshman Success\"</a>. <i>Nacada Clearinghouse</i><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
