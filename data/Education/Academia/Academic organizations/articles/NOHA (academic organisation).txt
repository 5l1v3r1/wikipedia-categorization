NOHA, in full Network on Humanitarian Action, is an international association of universities offering post-graduate level degree courses for humanitarian agencies and relief workers.  The association was founded by five European universities in 1993; namely Aix-Marseille Université, University of Bochum, University of Deusto, Université catholique de Louvain and Oxford University. The NOHA Masters programme initiative was launched in 1993 under the auspices of the Erasmus-Socrates Programme with additional financial support from the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).   In 2015 the network had expanded to include twelve European and five global partner universities.
