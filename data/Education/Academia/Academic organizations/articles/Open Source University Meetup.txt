The Open Source University Meet-Up is a student developer organization sponsored by Sun Microsystems that educates its members about open-source technologies through technical demonstrations, access to web courses, and discounts on Sun Certification.  Sun started the Open Source University Meet-Up as part of its program to help connect students in computer science to its technologies. Typically led by a campus ambassador or on-campus volunteer, Open Source University Meet-Ups exist in many countries.  The Open Source University Meet-Up is a place for Sun to connect student developers to Sun’s wide array of open source software platforms, following Sun’s initiatives to open-source all of its software technologies. As a whole it also helps give software developers, students, and other interested people an opportunity to learn more about open source software.  MSDN Academic Alliance
