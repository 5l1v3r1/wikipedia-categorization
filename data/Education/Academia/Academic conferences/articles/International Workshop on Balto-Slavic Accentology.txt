The International Workshop on Balto-Slavic Accentology (abbreviated IWoBA) is an annual international conference on comparative and historical Balto-Slavic accentology, including the prehistory and history of the separate Baltic and Slavic languages, as well as synchronic and dialectal issues that have to do with accentology. The first conference was held in Zagreb 1–3 July 2005 with contributions by some of the world's foremost Balto-Slavists, Baltologists and Slavists, organized by the Croatian linguists Ranko Matasović and Mate Kapović. It proved to be an immense success and was thus followed by annually held IWoBA conferences.
