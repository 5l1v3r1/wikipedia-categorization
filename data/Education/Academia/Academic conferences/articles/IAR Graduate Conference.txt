 The Institute of Asian Research (IAR) Graduate Conference at the University of British Columbia is an annual graduate conference organized by the IAR Conference Committee, and co-hosted by the University's Institute of Asian Research. The symposium is a forum for interdisciplinary discussion on Asia Pacific policy-relevant issues, where students in all fields are encouraged to demonstrate the policy significance of their work. The IAR Conference Committee, under its collaboration with the College for Interdisciplinary Studies (CFIS) at UBC, publishes the proceedings of the conference in the Journal of the College for Interdisciplinary Studies, as well as the possibility of publication in the Asia Pacific Memo. The mandate of the symposium, as stated by its organizer (IAR Conference Committee), is "to promote academic awareness towards the salience of policy-relevant issues in the Asia Pacific and its surrounding regions. The IAR Conference Committee, backed by its belief of academic research as a necessary precursor to sound policy-making and the interdisciplinary nature of such, strives to create a community of understanding between students of Asia Pacific policy and makers of Asia Pacific policy by providing a dynamic forum for the exchange of ideas".
