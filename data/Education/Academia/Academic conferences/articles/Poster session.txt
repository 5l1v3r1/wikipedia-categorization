A poster presentation, at a congress or conference with an academic or professional focus, is the presentation of research information, usually peer-reviewed work,[contradictory] in the form of a paper poster that conference participants may view. A poster session is an event at which many such posters are presented.  Poster sessions are particularly prominent at scientific conferences such as medical congresses.    Typically a separate room or area of a trade show floor is reserved for the poster session where researchers accompany a paper poster, illustrating their research methods and outcomes.   Each research project is usually presented on a conference schedule for a period ranging from 10 minutes to several hours.  Very large events may feature a few thousand poster presentations over a matter of a few days.  Presentations usually consist of affixing the research poster to a portable wall with the researcher in attendance answering questions posed by passing colleagues.   The poster itself varies in size according to conference guidelines from 2x3 feet to 4x8 feet in dimensions.   Posters are often created using a presentation program such as PowerPoint and may be printed on a large format printer. Posters are often printed on a glossy base and laminated with plastic to improve durability.
