The Global Scholars Group are a group of scholarships in the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth and the United States, which come together to hold an annual Global Scholars Symposium. The project was initiated in 2008 by the Gates Scholars at the University of Cambridge and expanded due to funding from the McCall MacBain Foundation (initiated by Canadian, John MacBain of the Rhodes Trust). Since that time it has expanded to include scholars from 51 different countries across 9 different scholarship programs.
