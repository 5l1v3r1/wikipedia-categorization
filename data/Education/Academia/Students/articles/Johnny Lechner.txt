John A "Johnny" Lechner  is an American film and television actor best known for his role as Alan Reese on the television series Girls of Sunset Place (Showtime - 2012), as well as his role as Greg "Fossil" Karanowski in the movie Fraternity House (2008). Lechner was born in Fort Hood, Texas, but grew up in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.  He is also known as being a perpetual student at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Whitewater, having studied there since 1994. Lechner's academic claim to fame (or infamy) is that he has been attending college since graduating from Waukesha North High School in 1994. Lechner did not graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater in 2006,  2007,  2008,  or 2009,  despite having enough credits to graduate with nine majors and five minors.  As of October 10, 2011, Lechner is not listed in the UW-Whitewater student directory  and it is unclear whether his student status continues.  His directory entry was last verified on April 16, 2010.  At Whitewater he has won a campus "Big Man on Campus" beauty pageant,  studied abroad in, "Paris, London, Amsterdam, Rome, Florence, Venice and Switzerland," and South Africa,   appeared on Late Show with David Letterman and Good Morning America,  been named one of People's "Hot Bachelors",  run for  student body president,  and appeared in two films, including Minor League: A Football Story   and a starring role in Fraternity House.   Lechner has been dubbed the "real-life Van Wilder."  The Wisconsin Board of Regents instituted a "Johnny Lechner rule"    on long-term students, so Lechner pays double the standard in-state tuition.
