According to another version, she was a girl who inherited a fortune when orphaned.

According to a possibly later addition to the story,\nshe was offered work as a <a href=\"/wiki/Domestic_worker\" title=\"Domestic worker\">domestic</a> assistant to one of the professors, but declined: at the time servants were expected to accompany their masters to the public bath.\n</p><p>One day, she was exposed as a woman. The versions differ here again: according to one, two soldiers wagered that the student walking by was in fact a woman, and exposed her; according to the second, she was found by a son of <a href=\"/wiki/W%C3%B3jt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"W\u00f3jt\">w\u00f3jt</a> from Gniezno who joined the school; according to the third one, she fell ill and a doctor examining her found out the truth.\n</p><p>When she was brought before the authorities to explain why she had disguised her gender, she simply answered: \"For the will of learning\". When they interrogated her fellow-students and professors they could find no one to accuse her of immoral conduct. Her record as a student was excellent. She was not convicted of any crime, but the judges did not want to acquit her entirely. According to Martin of Leibitz, she asked to be taken to a convent. She took her vows there, became a teacher and a leader of the convent school, and eventually the <a href=\"/wiki/Abbess\" title=\"Abbess\">abbess</a>.\n</p><p>This story may or may not be true. Some historians say that if it is true, her time at the university was about 1407-1409.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legacy\">Legacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nawojka&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Legacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Jagiellonian University did not allow women to study until 1897<sup id=\"cite_ref-uj_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-uj-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n, and to hold academic positions until 1906.
