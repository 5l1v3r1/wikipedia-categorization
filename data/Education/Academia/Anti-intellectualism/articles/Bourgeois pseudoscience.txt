Bourgeois pseudoscience (Russian: Буржуазная лженаука) was a term of condemnation in the Soviet Union for certain scientific disciplines that were deemed unacceptable from an ideological point of view.   At various times pronounced "bourgeois pseudosciences" were: genetics,[notes 1] cybernetics, sociology, semiotics, and comparative linguistics.[notes 2] This attitude was most prevalent during the rule of Joseph Stalin.
