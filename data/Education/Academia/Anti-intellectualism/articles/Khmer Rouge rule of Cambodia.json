Sihanouk remained under insecure house arrest in Phnom Penh, until late in the war with Vietnam when he departed for the United States where he made Democratic Kampuchea's case before the Security Council. He eventually relocated to China.\n</p><p>The \"rights and duties of the individual\" were briefly defined in Article 12.

An assertion that \"there is absolutely no unemployment in Democratic Kampuchea\" rings true in light of the regime's massive use of force.\n</p><p>The Constitution defined Democratic Kampuchea's <a href=\"/wiki/Foreign_policy\" title=\"Foreign policy\">foreign policy</a> principles in Article 21, the document's longest, in terms of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Independence\" title=\"Independence\">independence</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Peace\" title=\"Peace\">peace</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Neutral_country\" title=\"Neutral country\">neutrality</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement\" title=\"Non-Aligned Movement\">nonalignment</a>.\" It pledged the country's support to anti-<a href=\"/wiki/Imperialist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imperialist\">imperialist</a> struggles in the <a href=\"/wiki/Third_World\" title=\"Third World\">Third World</a>.

The legislature, the <a href=\"/wiki/Kampuchean_People%27s_Representative_Assembly\" title=\"Kampuchean People&#39;s Representative Assembly\">Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly</a> (KPRA), contained 250 members \"representing workers, peasants, and other working people and the Kampuchean Revolutionary army.\" One hundred and fifty KPRA seats were allocated for peasant representatives; fifty, for the armed forces; and fifty, for worker and other representatives. The legislature was to be popularly elected for a five-year term. Its <a href=\"/wiki/Cambodian_parliamentary_election,_1976\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cambodian parliamentary election, 1976\">first and only election</a> was held on March 20, 1976. \"<a href=\"/wiki/New_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New people\">New people</a>\" apparently were not allowed to participate.\n</p><p>The executive branch of government also was chosen by the KPRA.[Citation Needed] It consisted of a state presidium \"responsible for representing the state of Democratic Kampuchea inside and outside the country.\" It served for a five-year term, and its president was head of state. Khieu Samphan was the only person to serve in this office, which he assumed after Sihanouk's resignation. The judicial system was composed of \"people's courts,\" the judges for which were appointed by the KPRA, as was the executive branch.\n</p><p>The Constitution did not mention regional or local government institutions. After assuming power, the Khmer Rouge abolished the old provinces (<i>khet</i>) and replaced them with seven zones; the Northern Zone, Northeastern Zone, Northwestern Zone, Central Zone, Eastern Zone, Western Zone, and Southwestern Zone. There were also two other regional-level units: the Kracheh Special Region Number 505 and, until 1977, the Siemreab Special Region Number 106.\n</p><p>The zones were divided into <i>damban</i> (regions) that were given numbers. Number One, appropriately, encompassed the Samlot region of the Northwestern Zone (including Battambang Province), where the insurrection against Sihanouk had erupted in early 1967. With this exception, the damban appear to have been numbered arbitrarily.\n</p><p>The damban were divided into <i>srok</i> (districts), <i>khum</i> (subdistricts), and <i>phum</i> (villages), the latter usually containing several hundred people. This pattern was roughly similar to that which existed under Sihanouk and the Khmer Republic, but inhabitants of the villages were organized into <i>krom</i> (groups) composed of ten to fifteen families. On each level, administration was directed by a three-person committee (<i>kanak</i>, or <i>kena</i>).\n</p><p>CPK members occupied committee posts at the higher levels. Subdistrict and village committees were often staffed by local poor peasants, and, very rarely, by \"new people.\" Cooperatives (<i>sahakor</i>), similar in jurisdictional area to the khum, assumed local government responsibilities in some areas.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Societal_transformation\">Societal transformation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Societal transformation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>According to Pol Pot, Cambodia was made up of four <a href=\"/wiki/Social_class\" title=\"Social class\">classes</a>: <a href=\"/wiki/Peasants\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Peasants\">peasants</a> and workers, <a href=\"/wiki/Bourgeoisie\" title=\"Bourgeoisie\">bourgeoisie</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Capitalists\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Capitalists\">capitalists</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Feudalists\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feudalists\">feudalists</a>.

They were constantly moved, were forced to do the hardest physical labour, and worked in the most inhospitable, fever-ridden parts of the country, such as forests, upland areas, and swamps. \"New people\" were segregated from \"old people,\" enjoyed little or no privacy, and received the smallest rice rations. When the country experienced <a href=\"/wiki/Famine\" title=\"Famine\">food shortages</a> in 1977, the \"new people\" suffered the most.\n</p><p>The medical care available to them was primitive or nonexistent. Families often were separated because people were divided into work brigades according to age and sex and sent to different parts of the country. \"New people\" were subjected to unending political indoctrination and could be executed without trial.\n</p><p>The situation of the \"old people\" under Khmer Rouge rule was more ambiguous. Refugee interviews reveal cases in which villagers were treated as harshly as the \"new people,\" enduring forced labour, indoctrination, the separation of children from parents, and executions; however, they were generally allowed to remain in their native villages.\n</p><p>Because of their age-old resentment of the urban and rural elites, many of the poorest peasants probably were sympathetic to Khmer Rouge goals. In the early 1980s, visiting Western journalists found that the issue of peasant support for the Khmer Rouge was an extremely sensitive subject that officials of the People's Republic of Kampuchea were not inclined to discuss.\n</p><p>Although the Southwestern Zone was one original centre of power of the Khmer Rouge, and cadres administered it with strict discipline, random executions were relatively rare, and \"new people\" were not persecuted if they had a cooperative attitude.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Khmer_language\" title=\"Khmer language\">Khmer language</a>, like many in Southeast Asia, has a complex system of usages to define speakers' rank and social status. These usages were abandoned. People were encouraged to call each other \"friend\", or \"comrade\" (in Khmer, \u1798\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u178a mitt), and to avoid traditional signs of deference such as bowing or folding the hands in salutation.\n</p><p>Language was transformed in other ways. The Khmer Rouge invented new terms. People were told they must \"forge\" (<i>lot dam</i>) a new revolutionary character, that they were the \"instruments\" (<i>opokar</i>) of the Angkar, and that nostalgia for pre-revolutionary times (<i>chheu satek arom</i>, or \"memory sickness\") could result in their receiving Angkar's \"invitation\" to be deindustrialised and to live in a concentration camp.\n</p><p>Members and candidate members of the CPK, local-level leaders of poor peasant background who collaborated with the Angkar, and members of the armed forces had a higher standard of living than the rest of the population. Refugees agree that, even during times of severe food shortage, members of the grass-roots elite had adequate, if not luxurious, supplies of food. One refugee wrote that \"pretty new bamboo houses\" were built for Khmer Rouge cadres along the river in Phnom Penh.\n</p><p>According to <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Craig_Etcheson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Craig Etcheson (page does not exist)\">Craig Etcheson</a>, an authority on Democratic Kampuchea, members of the revolutionary army lived in self-contained colonies, and they had a \"distinctive warrior-caste ethos.\" Armed forces units personally loyal to Pol Pot, known as the \"<a href=\"/wiki/Unconditional_Divisions\" title=\"Unconditional Divisions\">Unconditional Divisions</a>,\" were a privileged group within the military.\n</p><p>Although their revolutionary ideology was extreme, the highest ranks of the Khmer Rouge leadership had a tendency to <a href=\"/wiki/Nepotism\" title=\"Nepotism\">nepotism</a> similar of the Sihanouk-era elite. Pol Pot's wife, <a href=\"/wiki/Khieu_Ponnary\" title=\"Khieu Ponnary\">Khieu Ponnary</a>, was head of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Democratic_Khmer_Women&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Association of Democratic Khmer Women (page does not exist)\">Association of Democratic Khmer Women</a> and her younger sister, <a href=\"/wiki/Khieu_Thirith\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Khieu Thirith\">Khieu Thirith</a>, served as minister of social action. These two women were considered among the half-dozen most powerful personalities in Democratic Kampuchea. Son Sen's wife, <a href=\"/wiki/Yun_Yat\" title=\"Yun Yat\">Yun Yat</a>, served as minister for culture, education and learning.\n</p><p>Several of Pol Pot's nephews and nieces were given jobs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of <a href=\"/wiki/Ieng_Sary\" title=\"Ieng Sary\">Ieng Sary</a>'s daughters was appointed head of the <a href=\"/wiki/Calmette_Hospital\" title=\"Calmette Hospital\">Calmette Hospital</a> although she had not graduated from secondary school.

Different ministries, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, were controlled and exploited by powerful Khmer Rouge families. Administering the diplomatic corps was regarded as an especially profitable fiefdom.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Economy\">Economy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Economy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Democratic Kampuchea's economic policy was similar to, and possibly inspired by, <a href=\"/wiki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>'s radical <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward\" title=\"Great Leap Forward\">Great Leap Forward</a> that carried out immediate collectivisation of the Chinese countryside in 1958. During the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge established \"mutual assistance groups\" in the areas they occupied.\n</p><p>After 1973, these were organised into \"low-level cooperatives\" in which land and agricultural implements were lent by peasants to the community but remained their private property. \"High-level cooperatives,\" in which private property was abolished and the harvest became the collective property of the peasants, appeared in 1974. \"Communities,\" introduced in early 1976, were a more advanced form of high-level cooperative in which communal dining was instituted. State-owned farms also were established.\n</p><p>Far more than the Chinese communists, the Khmer Rouge pursued the ideal of economic self-sufficiency, specifically the version that <a href=\"/wiki/Khieu_Samphan\" title=\"Khieu Samphan\">Khieu Samphan</a> had outlined in his 1959 doctoral dissertation. Currency was abolished, and domestic trade or commerce could be conducted only through barter. Rice, measured in tins, became the most important medium of exchange, although people also bartered gold, jewelry, and other personal possessions.\n</p><p>Foreign trade was almost completely halted, though there was a limited revival in late 1976 and early 1977. China was the most important trading partner, but commerce amounting to a few million dollars was also conducted with <a href=\"/wiki/France\" title=\"France\">France</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a>, and with the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> through a <a href=\"/wiki/Hong_Kong\" title=\"Hong Kong\">Hong Kong</a> intermediary.\n</p><p>From the Khmer Rouge perspective, the country was free of foreign economic domination for the first time in its 2,000-year history. By mobilising the people into work brigades organised in a military fashion, the Khmer Rouge hoped to unleash the masses' productive forces.\n</p><p>There was an \"<a href=\"/wiki/Angkor\" title=\"Angkor\">Angkorian</a>\" component to economic policy. That ancient kingdom had grown rich and powerful because it controlled extensive irrigation systems that produced surpluses of rice. Agriculture in modern Cambodia depended, for the most part, on seasonal rains.\n</p><p>By building a nationwide system of irrigation canals, dams, and reservoirs, the leadership believed it would be possible to produce rice on a year-round basis. It was the \"new people\" who suffered and sacrificed the most to complete these ambitious projects.\n</p><p>Although the Khmer Rouge implemented an \"agriculture first\" policy in order to achieve self-sufficiency, they were not, as some observers have argued, \"back-to-nature\" primitivists. Although the 1970\u201375 war and the evacuation of the cities had destroyed or idled most industry, small contingents of workers were allowed to return to the urban areas to reopen some plants.\n</p><p>Like their Chinese counterparts, the Cambodian communists had great faith in the inventive power and the technical aptitude of the masses, and they constantly published reports of peasants' adapting old mechanical parts to new uses. Similarly to Mao's regime, which had attempted unsuccessfully to build a new steel industry based on backyard furnaces during the Great Leap Forward, the Khmer Rouge sought to move industry to the countryside. Significantly, the seal of Democratic Kampuchea displayed not only sheaves of rice and irrigation sluices, but also a factory with smokestacks.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Education_and_health\">Education and health</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Education and health\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Khmer Rouge regarded traditional education with undiluted hostility.

Pol Pot considered Youth League alumni as his most loyal and reliable supporters, and used them to gain control of the central and of the regional CPK apparatus. The powerful Khieu Thirith, minister of social action, was responsible for directing the youth movement.\n</p><p>Hardened young cadres, many little more than twelve years of age, were enthusiastic accomplices in some of the regime's worst atrocities. Sihanouk, who was kept under virtual house arrest in Phnom Penh between 1976 and 1978, wrote in <i>War and Hope</i> that his youthful guards, having been separated from their families and given a thorough indoctrination, were encouraged to play cruel games involving the torture of animals. Having lost parents, siblings, and friends in the war and lacking the <a href=\"/wiki/Buddhist_values\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Buddhist values\">Buddhist values</a> of their elders, the Khmer Rouge youth also lacked the inhibitions that would have dampened their zeal for <a href=\"/wiki/Revolutionary_terror\" title=\"Revolutionary terror\">revolutionary terror</a>.\n</p><p>Health facilities in the years 1975 to 1978 were abysmally poor. Many physicians either were executed or were prohibited from practicing. It appears that the party and the armed forces elite had access to Western medicine and to a system of hospitals that offered reasonable treatment, but ordinary people, especially \"new people,\" were expected to use traditional plant and herbal remedies that were of debatable usefulness.

Even seriously injured hospital patients, many without any means of conveyance, were summarily forced to leave regardless of their condition.\n</p><p>The foreign community, about 800 people, was quarantined in the French embassy compound, and by the end of the month the foreigners were taken by truck to the Thai border. <a href=\"/wiki/Khmer_people\" title=\"Khmer people\">Khmer</a> women who were married to foreigners were allowed to accompany their husbands, but Khmer men were not permitted to leave with their foreign wives.\n</p><p>Western historians claim that the motives were political, based on deep-rooted resentment of the cities.

In late September, however, a few days before Pol Pot was forced to resign as prime minister, air links were established between Phnom Penh and Hanoi.\n</p><p>With Pol Pot back in the forefront of the regime in 1977, the situation rapidly deteriorated. Incidents escalated along all of Cambodia's borders. Khmer Rouge forces attacked villages in the border areas of <a href=\"/wiki/Thailand\" title=\"Thailand\">Thailand</a> near <a href=\"/wiki/Aranyaprathet\" title=\"Aranyaprathet\">Aranyaprathet</a>. Brutal murders of Thai villagers, including women and children, were the first widely reported concrete evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities. There were also incidents along the <a href=\"/wiki/Laos\" title=\"Laos\">Laos</a> border.\n</p><p>At approximately the same time, villages in Vietnam's border areas underwent renewed attacks. In turn, Vietnam launched air strikes against Cambodia. From April 18 to 30, 1975, Cambodian troops, after invading Vietnamese province of <a href=\"/wiki/An_Giang\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"An Giang\">An Giang</a>, carried out the <a href=\"/wiki/Ba_Ch%C3%BAc_massacre\" title=\"Ba Ch\u00fac massacre\">Ba Ch\u00fac massacre</a> causing 3,157 civilian death in province of <a href=\"/wiki/Tay_Ninh\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tay Ninh\">Tay Ninh</a>, Vietnam. In September, border fighting resulted in as many as 1,000 Vietnamese civilian casualties. The following month, the Vietnamese counter-attacked in a campaign involving a force of 20,000 personnel.\n</p><p>Vietnamese defense minister General <a href=\"/wiki/Vo_Nguyen_Giap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vo Nguyen Giap\">Vo Nguyen Giap</a> underestimated the tenacity of the Khmer Rouge, however, and was obliged to commit an additional 58,000 reinforcements in December. On January 6, 1978, Giap's forces began an orderly withdrawal from Cambodian territory. The Vietnamese apparently believed they had \"taught a lesson\" to the Cambodians, but Pol Pot proclaimed this a \"victory\" even greater than that of April 17, 1975. For several years, the Vietnamese government sought in vain to establish peaceful relations with the KR regime. But the KR leaders were intent on war. Behind this seeming insanity clearly lay the assumption that China would support the KR militarily in such a conflict.\n</p><p>Faced with growing Khmer Rouge belligerence, the Vietnamese leadership decided in early 1978 to support internal resistance to the Pol Pot regime, with the result that the Eastern Zone became a focus of insurrection. War hysteria reached bizarre levels within Democratic Kampuchea. In May 1978, on the eve of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=So_Phim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"So Phim (page does not exist)\">So Phim</a>'s Eastern Zone uprising, Radio Phnom Penh declared that if each Cambodian soldier killed thirty Vietnamese, only 2 million troops would be needed to eliminate the entire Vietnamese population of 50&#160;million. It appears that the leadership in Phnom Penh was seized with immense territorial ambitions, i.e., to recover <a href=\"/wiki/Kampuchea_Krom\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kampuchea Krom\">Kampuchea Krom</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Mekong\" title=\"Mekong\">Mekong Delta</a> region, which they regarded as Khmer territory.\n</p><p>Massacres of ethnic Vietnamese and of their sympathizers by the Khmer Rouge intensified in the Eastern Zone after the May revolt. In November, <a href=\"/wiki/Vorn_Vet\" title=\"Vorn Vet\">Vorn Vet</a> led an unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat. There were now tens of thousands of Cambodian and Vietnamese exiles on Vietnamese territory.\n</p><p>On December 3, 1978, <a href=\"/wiki/Radio_Hanoi\" title=\"Radio Hanoi\">Radio Hanoi</a> announced the formation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Kampuchean_United_Front_for_National_Salvation\" title=\"Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation\">Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation</a> (KNUFNS). This was a heterogeneous group of communist and noncommunist exiles who shared an antipathy to the Pol Pot regime and a virtually total dependence on Vietnamese backing and protection. The KNUFNS provided the semblance, if not the reality, of legitimacy for Vietnam's invasion of Democratic Kampuchea and for its subsequent establishment of a satellite regime in Phnom Penh.\n</p><p>In the meantime, as 1978 wore on, Cambodian bellicosity in the border areas surpassed Hanoi's threshold of tolerance. Vietnamese policy makers opted for a military solution and, on December 22, Vietnam launched its offensive with the intent of overthrowing Democratic Kampuchea. A force of 120,000, consisting of combined armor and infantry units with strong artillery support, drove west into the level countryside of Cambodia's southeastern provinces. Together, the Vietnamese army and the National Salvation Front struck at the KR on December 25.\n</p><p>After a seventeen-day campaign, Phnom Penh fell to the advancing Vietnamese on January 7, 1979. Pol Pot and the main leaders initially took refuge near the border with Thailand. After making deals with several governments, they were able to use Thailand as a safe staging area for the construction and operation of new redoubts in the mountain and jungle fastness of Cambodia's periphery, Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders regrouped their units, issued a new call to arms, and reignited a stubborn insurgency against the regime in power as they had done in the late 1960s.\n</p><p>For the moment, however, the Vietnamese invasion had accomplished its purpose of deposing an unlamented and particularly violent dictatorship. A new administration of ex-Khmer Rouge fighters under the control of Hanoi was quickly established (who are ruling till present), and it set about competing, both domestically and internationally, with the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate government of Cambodia.\n</p><p>Peace still eluded the war-ravaged nation, however, and although the insurgency set in motion by the Khmer Rouge proved unable to topple the new Vietnamese-controlled regime in Phnom Penh, it did nonetheless keep the country in a permanent state of insecurity. The new administration was propped up by a substantial Vietnamese military force and civilian advisory effort.\n</p><p>As events in the 1980s progressed, the main preoccupations of the new regime were survival, restoring the economy, and combating the Khmer Rouge insurgency by military and by political means. The fostering of activity to meet these imperatives and the building of institutions are described in subsequent articles in the <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_Cambodia\" title=\"History of Cambodia\">History of Cambodia</a> series.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aftermath\">Aftermath</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Aftermath\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Coalition_Government_of_Democratic_Kampuchea\">The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The UN General Assembly voted by a margin of 71 to 35 for the KR to retain their seat at the UN, with 34 abstentions and 12 absentees.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> The seat was occupied by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thiounn_Prasith&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Thiounn Prasith (page does not exist)\">Thiounn Prasith</a>, an old cadre of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary from their student days in Paris and one of the 21 attendees at the 1960 KPRP Second Congress.

As part of their systematic attack upon Buddhism, the Khmer Rouge desecrated or destroyed most of Cambodia's 3,369 temples, inflicting irreparable damage on statues, sacred literature, and other religious items.  Similar damage was inflicted on the mosques of the Cham, some 130 of which were destroyed.
