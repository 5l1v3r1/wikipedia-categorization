Veruscript is a London-based publisher of open access journals across the sciences, humanities and social sciences. It publishes both its own journals and journals on behalf of learned societies and universities. All of Veruscript's journals are peer reviewed and it operates a reviewer reward scheme.  In exchange for constructive, timely peer reviews, reviewers are given a choice of GBP100 or credits towards future article processing charges (APCs). In March 2017 Veruscript launched its partner journals and presses programme, which enables learned societies and universities to publish their own journals in a cost-effective manner.  Veruscript provides an end-to-end publishing service to the partner and takes care of all backend systems from submission to publication. The partner is responsible for managing the editorial and peer review aspects of publication. Veruscript charges GBP300 per article for this service. In December 2016, Veruscript was the subject of allegations that it was involved in Russian attempts to influence the UK intelligence community via the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar.    Veruscript had sponsored these seminars as a marketing activity for the sum of GBP700. The Financial Times, which published the initial article, stated that they had no evidence to support the claim. Veruscript denied the allegations, but felt that the negative publicity generated had seriously affected its Journal of Intelligence and Terrorism Studies's chance to become sustainable  through the platinum open access model of publication. The company has since closed the journal.
