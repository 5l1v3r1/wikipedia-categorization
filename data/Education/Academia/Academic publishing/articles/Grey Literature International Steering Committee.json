These requirements also took into consideration the basic principles of <a href=\"/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization\" title=\"International Organization for Standardization\">ISO</a> Standard Documentation entitled \u201cPresentation of scientific and technical reports\u201d (ISO 5966/1982) withdrawn in 2000. The ISO 5966 no longer met the requirements of ITC (Information Technology Communication), however, it still provides useful tips in the preparation of reports.\n</p><p>The Guidelines are created primarily to help authors and GL producers in their mutual task of creating and distributing accurate, clear, easily accessible reports in different fields. The goal of the Guidelines is, in fact, to permit an independent and correct production of institutional reports in accordance with basic editorial principles.\n</p><p>The Guidelines include ethical principles related to the process of evaluating, improving, and making reports available and the relationships between GL producers and authors. The latter sections address the more technical aspects of preparing and submitting reports. GLISC believes the entire document is relevant to the concerns of both authors and GL producers.\n</p><p>The Guidelines are informally known as \"Nancy style\".\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#GLISC_members\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">GLISC members</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_GLISC_Guidelines_for_the_production_of_scientific_and_technical_reports_(also_known_as_&quot;Nancy_style&quot;)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports (also known as \"Nancy style\")</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Comparison_between_\u201cNancy_style\u201d_and_ANSI/NISO_Z39.18\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Comparison between \u201cNancy style\u201d and ANSI/NISO Z39.18</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Support,_Translation_and_Updating_of_the_&quot;Nancy_Style&quot;\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Support, Translation and Updating of the \"Nancy Style\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#On_the_development_of_the_GLISC_Guidelines\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">On the development of the GLISC Guidelines</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"GLISC_members\">GLISC members</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grey_Literature_International_Steering_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: GLISC members\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>These are the institutions which officially adopted the \"Nancy Style\" in the production and distribution of grey literature.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.iss.it\">Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0</a> (ISS) \u2013 Rome, Italy</li>\n<li>Institut de l\u2019Information Scientifique et Technique (<a href=\"/wiki/INIST\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"INIST\">INIST</a>-CNRS) \u2013 Nancy, France</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Grey_Literature_Network_Service\" title=\"Grey Literature Network Service\">Grey Literature Network Service</a> (GreyNet), Amsterdam \u2013 The Netherlands</li></ul>\n<p>Many other institutions all over the world do support and use the GLISC guidelines without a formal agreement which would require longer procedures.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_GLISC_Guidelines_for_the_production_of_scientific_and_technical_reports_.28also_known_as_.22Nancy_style.22.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_GLISC_Guidelines_for_the_production_of_scientific_and_technical_reports_(also_known_as_&quot;Nancy_style&quot;)\">The GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports (also known as \"Nancy style\")</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grey_Literature_International_Steering_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports (also known as &quot;Nancy style&quot;)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Authorship:</b> The <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/\">GLISC</a> guidelines were prepared by Paola De Castro and Sandra Salinetti from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.iss.it\">Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0</a>, Rome (Italy).

The major differences concerning the two documents as a whole regard:\n</p><p><b>*Document type</b>\n</p><p>They are different in that the \u201cNancy style\u201d represents guidelines \u2013 that is general principles agreed upon by a small group of experts, to be followed as an indication or outline of policy or conduct \u2013, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a proper standard, developed by the Standards Committees of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO), subject to rigorous control and approval process including peer review. This is why also the structure of the two documents is different since the standard may repeat concepts in different sections which may be used separately, while the Guidelines are intended as an easy to read document giving the general idea for recommended items. The Guidelines, different from standards, do not give full details on format and style. Moreover, the \u201cNancy style\u201d represents international guidelines developed by a corporate author (GLISC), which worked on the draft proposed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, and signed approval of this best practice on behalf of their respective organizations, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a national standard approved by the American National Standards Institute through a number of Voting Members.\n</p><p><b>*Paper vs digital document medium</b>\n</p><p>The \u201cNancy style\u201d is mostly paper oriented giving recommendations on report preparation mainly reflecting a traditional paper structure, while the organization pattern of the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is user-based more than content-based. The key concepts incorporated in the American standard mainly refer to metadata, persistence of links, interoperability, creation, discovery/retrieval, presentation in digital format (DTD, XML, XSL), maintenance and preservation (original content, software and media); it also contains a metadata schema, which is absent in the Guidelines.\n</p><p><b>*Annexes</b>\n</p><p>All material included in the \u201cNancy style\u201d is approved by the GLISC, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 provides a large amount of additional information (almost half of the pages) that is not part of the Standard (Appendices including selected annotated bibliography, glossary, Dublin Core data elements, etc.).\n</p><p><b>*Content</b>\n</p><p>In general, the \u201cNancy style\u201d contains technical requirements for a report, but does not include full details (i.e. format, style, etc.); yet, it provides important elements, which are not present or not fully described in the ANSI/NISO Z39.18. \n</p>\n<ul><li>Ethical issues</li></ul>\n<p>An initial section is explicitly devoted to authorship, editorship, peer review, conflicts of interest, privacy and confidentiality. \n</p>\n<ul><li>Instructions for authors</li></ul>\n<p>Producers are strongly recommended to issue instructions to guide authors in the production of a formally correct document containing ethical and editorial issues as well as indications for formats, styles, illustrations, etc. \n</p>\n<ul><li>Revision</li></ul>\n<p>Special attention is given to revision editing as GL is not generally peer reviewed, or produced with editorial support; therefore, it is fundamental that authors be aware of the importance of a careful revision of their texts before diffusion. \n</p>\n<ul><li>Reference style</li></ul>\n<p>The adoption of the \u201cVancouver style\u201d is recommended and examples and rules are given as a fundamental step for information retrieval.\nAs regards document structure, it is basically the same in \u201cNancy style\u201d and ANSI/NISO Z39.18, with minor terminological variations. Yet, the American standard explicitly gives indication on:\n\u2013\tReport Documentation Page (since it is used by some agencies within the federal government, and also some sample pages are given).\n\u2013\tDistribution list.\n\u2013\tGlossary (although not part of the Standard).\n\u2013\tExecutive abstract.\n</p><p><b>*Technical recommendations</b>\n</p><p>Since the \u201cNancy style\u201d represents guidelines and not a standard, all technical considerations are limited to the essential, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 gives indications (all absent in the \u201cNancy style\u201d) on:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Print-specific/non-print-specific recommendations</li></ul>\n<p>The Section 6 \u201cPresentation and display\u201d describes standard methods for ensuring consistency in presentation including designing visual and tabular matter, formatting, etc. and makes a distinction between rules applicable to all reports regardless of mode of publication (paper or digital) and rules applicable to reports published in paper form only. \n</p>\n<ul><li>Format</li></ul>\n<p>Specific information is provided on fonts, line length, margins, page numbering, style, units and numbers, formulas and equations, paper (format and type), printing equipment, ink.\nThe ANSI/NISO Z39.18 also includes specifications on index entries and errata, which are not present in the \u201cNancy style\u201d.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Support.2C_Translation_and_Updating_of_the_.22Nancy_Style.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Support,_Translation_and_Updating_of_the_&quot;Nancy_Style&quot;\">Support, Translation and Updating of the \"Nancy Style\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grey_Literature_International_Steering_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Support, Translation and Updating of the &quot;Nancy Style&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many institutions considered the relevance of the GLISC Guidelines for the production and distribution of technical reports and for educational purposed, therefore, accepted to carry out the translation of the original English version into different languases.\n</p><p>Translations are available in:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Italian</b> - translation carried out by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0<br />.

The proposals for their updating will make them more effective, although a regular revision is required to keep pace with the changing ITC scenarios and information policies (see De Castro et al. 2006).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"On_the_development_of_the_GLISC_Guidelines\">On the development of the GLISC Guidelines</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grey_Literature_International_Steering_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: On the development of the GLISC Guidelines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>*Electronic grey literature</b>\nThe \u201cNancy style\u201d is mostly paper oriented, because editorial consistency and ethical considerations recommended for traditional documents do apply also to digital publications. Yet, progressively more and more GL is being produced, stored, published and made available electronically and in order to manage relevant GL publications, <a href=\"/wiki/Metadata\" title=\"Metadata\">metadata</a> are required. The importance of metadata, as the natural evolution of library catalogue records, had been already stressed in the first version of the \u201cNancy style\u201d (when dealing with report structure: Section 4.2 of the Guidelines), but no metadata schema was then provided since it was difficult to find a formula that would satisfy all requirements. At present, much GL is catalogued using the <a href=\"/wiki/Dublin_Core\" title=\"Dublin Core\">Dublin Core</a> Metadata Standard (DC). However \u2013 as Keith Jeffery of the UK Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (<a href=\"/wiki/CCLRC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CCLRC\">CCLRC</a>) pointed out working on the \u201cNancy style\u201d draft \u2013 this standard suffers from several problems: a) it is machine-readable but not machine-understandable; b) it does not have a formalised syntax or semantics and therefore is open to ambiguous interpretations. Therefore, he proposed a formalised metadata standard (an umbrella standard, mainly generated from <a href=\"/wiki/Dublin_Core\" title=\"Dublin Core\">Dublin Core</a> metadata: \u201cFormalised DC\u201d based on the concepts of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=CERIF&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"CERIF (page does not exist)\">CERIF</a> Model (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.eurocris.org/Cerif\">[5]</a>). Yet, as the traditional cataloguing practice has different rules, similarly different communities may adopt different metadata schema. Nowadays the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wide_Web\" title=\"World Wide Web\">World Wide Web</a> provides the possibility to search for information across heterogeneous archives/databases/catalogues, but the systems managing different information resources must be \u201cinteroperable\u201d (capable to work together), and <a href=\"/wiki/Interoperability\" title=\"Interoperability\">interoperability</a> requires that the same metadata schema be used. As Stefania Biagioni (of the Italian Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell\u2019Informazione - <a href=\"/wiki/ISTI\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ISTI\">ISTI</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Consiglio_Nazionale_delle_Ricerche\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche\">Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche</a>) clearly commented, there is much work towards <a href=\"/wiki/Standardization\" title=\"Standardization\">standardization</a> and the Dublin Core Initiative (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://dublincore.org/\">[6]</a>) is receiving worldwide consensus as it suggests adding a very simple metadata record to any specialized one.\n</p><p><b>*Adoption strategy</b>\nWhen consensus was to be reached to release the first version of the Guidelines, a formal approval was asked to all organizations wishing to officially adopt them. Contrary to expectations, consensus was given only by a small number of institutions as the official adoption was sometimes a difficult step. Yet, support and encouragement did not lack: a less formal approach in launching the Guidelines and getting them adopted was soon granted by all institutions involved in their creation. For example, a large international organization (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - <a href=\"/wiki/OECD\" title=\"OECD\">OECD</a>), which took part in the development of the Guidelines, expressed concern to officially endorse them (and in fact, it did not), because that would require a great deal of internal debate and discussion with their own members. Suggestions were made to follow a voluntary system backed up by an official recognition of compliance to facilitate the adoption of the Guidelines. This would encourage like-minded supporters within an organisation to informally use the Guidelines and then gain the official \u201cstamp of approval\u201d to show that they are really following them. Actually, other organizations policies take a voluntary approach in the documents they recommend, such as the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (<a href=\"/wiki/ALPSP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ALPSP\">ALPSP</a>) with more than 230 not-for-profit publishers. As suggested by the OECD, voluntary sign-up is a less demanding step for organisations to take, but the effect is the same \u2013 more and more publishers will opt to use them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grey_Literature_International_Steering_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_literature\" title=\"Scientific literature\">Scientific literature</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Technical_report\" title=\"Technical report\">Technical report</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Grey_literature\" title=\"Grey literature\">Grey literature</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/European_Association_of_Science_Editors\" title=\"European Association of Science Editors\">European Association of Science Editors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/OpenSIGLE\" title=\"OpenSIGLE\">OpenSIGLE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Scientific_writing\" title=\"Scientific writing\">Scientific writing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Academic_authorship\" title=\"Academic authorship\">Academic authorship</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Grey_Literature_International_Steering_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>ANSI/NISO.
