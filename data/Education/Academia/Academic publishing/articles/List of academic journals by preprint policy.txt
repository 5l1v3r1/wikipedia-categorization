This is a list of academic journals by their submission policies regarding the use of preprints prior to publication,Â such as the arXiv, and bioRxiv. Journals focusing on physics and mathematics are excluded because they routinely accept manuscripts that have been posted to preprint servers. Publishers' policies on self-archiving (including preprint versions) can also be found at SHERPA/RoMEO.                        Authors should inform the journal at the time of submission if and where their article has been previously posted. Authors are required to provide a link to the final published article (known as the Version of Record) alongside the original preprint version.    The title page and cover letter should include a statement verifying the originality of the work, and disclose any previous abstracts, presentations, reports, or publications that contain material that might be perceived to overlap with the current submission. If a similar publication exists, the authors should upload a copy as a supplemental file as part of the submission process, and justify why their submission is considered non-overlapping and novel. If applicable, authors should cite any previously published or closely related work within the text."
