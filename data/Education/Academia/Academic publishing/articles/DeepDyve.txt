DeepDyve is a commercial website launched in late 2010 that provides access to mainly scientific and scholarly articles from a large range of commercial and non-commercial academic publishers. A novel aspect of DeepDyve's business model is that access is on an affordable, online rental basis for web browser viewing, rather than the conventional buy-and-download access already provided by most academic publishers. In an interview with one of the company founders, the article rental concept is mainly pitched as a way of giving researchers unaffiliated with academic libraries, access to otherwise expensive scholarly articles.  Similar to other 'rental' or online access services such as Spotify and Netflix, DeepDyve charges a monthly or annual subscription. Over 150 major publishers have signed up to provide articles from their scientific journals, such as Elsevier, Springer-Nature,  Oxford University Press, Wiley-Blackwell, IEEE and many more. DeepDyve's company website claims that over 12 million articles from nearly 10,000 peer-reviewed journals are available for rent at a fraction of the usual per-article purchase price.  In addition to per-article pricing, various subscription options are available.  DeepDyve provides free previews of usually at least the whole first page, while other publishers typically only provide the abstract. From June 2013 signed-in users can preview an entire article for free for five minutes.  The current viewing interface (Feb 2012) for article renting is implemented by rendering the article pages as images on the screen.[original research?] In addition to viewing the full-text article through a browser, subscribers also have the ability to print up to 20 pages of any article(s) per month, as well as receive a 20% discount on any article they wish to purchase and download.
