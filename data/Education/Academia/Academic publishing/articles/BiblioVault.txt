BiblioVault is a virtual warehouse for academic books that serves more than 90 scholarly publishers in the U.S. and Europe.  Development began in late 2001 under the auspices of the University of Chicago Press, with financial support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  As of mid 2015, BiblioVault provided long-term secure storage for more than 40,000 digital book files from 110 publishers, and offered scanning, printing, transfer, conversion, file distribution, print on demand and ebook order fulfillment services to its members. BiblioVault hosts a public web site, bibliovault.org, with information about each title, including descriptions, cover thumbnails, tables of contents, excerpts, and reviews. The site links to member press shopping carts, for immediate online purchase of the books listed. Accessibility offices can request files for students with disabilities from these pages as well. Member presses visit BiblioVault's publishers' site, to submit and retrieve their files, edit metadata about their titles, and order deliveries of files and metadata to e-retailers, search sites, and printers. BiblioVault is also associated with a digital printing center within the Chicago Distribution Center for short-run printing (and automated physical warehouse restocking) of titles stored in the repository. Besides making more than file deliveries to e-retailers, such as Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble's Nook, Apple's iBooks, Google Play, etc., BiblioVault also fulfills ebooks directly using Adobe Digital Editions for member presses, via the Chicago Distribution Center's online shopping cart and several other independent press shopping carts.
