The Kardashian Index (K-Index), named after Kim Kardashian, is a measure of the discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record.  Proposed in 2014, the measure compares the number of followers a research scientist has on Twitter to the number of citations they have for their peer-reviewed work. The relationship between the number of Twitter followers (                        F                 {\displaystyle F}    ) and the number of citations (                        C                 {\displaystyle C}    ) is described as: The Kardashian Index is thus calculated as: where                         F         (         a         )                 {\displaystyle F(a)}     is the actual number of Twitter followers of researcher                         X                 {\displaystyle X}     and                         F         (         c         )                 {\displaystyle F(c)}     is the number researcher should have given their citations. A high K-index indicates an over-blown scientific fame while a low K-index suggests that a scientist is being undervalued. According to the author, researchers whose K-index > 5 can be considered 'Science Kardashians'. The K-index suggests that the number of citations of a given scientist is comparable to his or her scientific value. This assumption has been criticized.   On the other hand, the proposal of the K-Index in itself can be interpreted as a criticism to the assumption that scientists should have a social media impact at all while in reality social media footprint has no correlation at all to scientific quality or scientific impact.
