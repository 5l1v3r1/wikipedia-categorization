viXra is an electronic e-print archive set up by independent physicist Philip Gibbs as an alternative to the dominant arXiv service operated by Cornell University. Although dominated by physics and mathematics submissions, viXra aims to cover topics across the whole scientific community. It accepts submissions without requiring authors to have an academic affiliation and without any threshold for quality.  The e-prints on viXra are grouped into seven broad categories: physics, mathematics, computational science, biology, chemistry, humanities, and other areas.  Anyone may post anything on viXra, though house rules do prohibit “vulgar, libellous, plagiaristic or dangerously misleading” content.  As a result, the site has a reputation among physicists for hosting "material of no interest".  Physicist Gerard 't Hooft writes, "When a paper is published in viXra, it is usually a sign that it is not likely to contain acceptable results. It may, but the odds against that are considerable".  Gibbs' original motivation for starting the archive was to cater for researchers who believed that their preprints had been unfairly rejected or reclassified by the arXiv moderators.  As of 2013 it had over 4000 preprints  and in January, 2018 the number had grown to 21,883.
