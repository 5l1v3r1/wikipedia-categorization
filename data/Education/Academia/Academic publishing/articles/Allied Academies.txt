Allied Academies is a reportedly-fraudulent corporation   chartered under the laws of North Carolina. It presents itself as an association of scholars, with supporting and encouraging research and the sharing and exchange of knowledge as its stated aims. The organization consists of 14 affiliate academies, which provide awards to academics and publish academic journals both online and in hard copy for members.  Since 2015 the organization has been listed on Jeffrey Beall's list of "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers".   It is in a partnership with OMICS Publishing Group which uses its website and logo.
