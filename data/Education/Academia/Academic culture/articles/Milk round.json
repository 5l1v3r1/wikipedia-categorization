The name milk round also refers to the online university student website, which is an online version of the traditional method in which business recruited University students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Milk_round&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Overview\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Milkman\" title=\"Milkman\">Milk</a> being delivered direct to homes is a long-standing tradition in <a href=\"/wiki/Great_Britain\" title=\"Great Britain\">Great Britain</a>. So, in the mid-1960s, when companies began touring universities to promote and advertise their job opportunities directly to candidates, the visits became known informally as \"the milk round\".\n</p><p>Traditionally the process involves recruiters attending graduate careers fairs and presentations located at universities across the UK. The Milk round tours usually take place during the Autumn and Summer academic terms.\n</p><p>Often the recruiters are large organisations with specific graduate training schemes, designed to train graduates and expose them to as many aspects of the business as possible, often over a number of years. In many cases the initial training scheme involves mentoring by a more senior member of the organisation.\n</p><p>The milk round is not managed by a central organisation, but each university careers service usually provides services to assist their students with company research, job applications and careers advice. Careers services also liaise with companies, to prevent clashes and help advertise the events.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_future\">The future</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Milk_round&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The future\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Since the late 1990s activity generally associated with the milk round has moved online with the creation of web-based graduate job boards, CV databases and agencies. These websites perform many of the functions of the traditional milk round. Graduates can apply for specific jobs and compare different graduate training schemes. Web-based job boards overcome one of the major disadvantages of the traditional milkround, namely that students attending universities not visited by a recruiter's milkround can still gain access to that recruiter's jobs.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Milk_round&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Graduate_recruitment\" title=\"Graduate recruitment\">Graduate recruitment</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2192\nCached time: 20180913125023\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.040 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.059 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 79/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 3991/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 12/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\nLua time usage: 0.016/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 818 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   40.377      1 Template:Unreferenced\n100.00%   40.377      1 -total\n 64.83%   26.178      1 Template:Ambox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:5206743-0!canonical and timestamp 20180913125023 and revision id 803235899\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"Milk Round","hidden":"","*":"Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2009"},{"sortkey":"Milk Round","hidden":"","*":"All_articles_lacking_sources"},{"sortkey":"Milk Round","*":"Academic_culture"},{"sortkey":"Milk Round","*":"Academia_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"Milk Round","*":"Students_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"sortkey":"Milk Round","*":"Graduate_recruitment"}],"links":[{"ns":14,"exists":"","*":"Category:Articles lacking sources from January 2009"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Graduate recruitment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Great Britain"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Milkman"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"UK"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Citing sources"},{"ns":4,"exists":"","*":"Wikipedia:Verifiability"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1"},{"ns":12,"exists":"","*":"Help:Maintenance template removal"}],"templates":[{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Unreferenced"},{"ns":10,"exists":"","*":"Template:Ambox"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Unsubst"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:No globals"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Yesno"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Arguments"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Message box/configuration"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/config"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/shared"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Category handler/blacklist"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/data"},{"ns":828,"exists":"","*":"Module:Namespace detect/config"}],"images":["Question_book-new.svg"],"externallinks":[],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Overview","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Milk_round","byteoffset":410,"anchor":"Overview"},{"toclevel":2,"level":"3","line":"The future","number":"1.1","index":"2","fromtitle":"Milk_round","byteoffset":1554,"anchor":"The_future"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"3","fromtitle":"Milk_round","byteoffset":2124,"anchor":"See_also"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Milk round","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"defaultsort","*":"Milk Round"},{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q6858053"}]}}
