The term JCR refers to the entire undergraduate population, but more specifically and commonly to the elected body of students who run the JCR for one academic year.

The same abbreviations are used. The JCR represents <a href=\"/wiki/Undergraduate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Undergraduate\">undergraduates</a>, with <a href=\"/wiki/Postgraduate_student\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Postgraduate student\">postgraduate students</a> being members of the Middle Combination Room. In some colleges, postgraduates are members of both the MCR and JCR: for example, at <a href=\"/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"St John&#39;s College, Cambridge\">St John's</a>, where the MCR is known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Samuel_Butler_Room_Society\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Samuel Butler Room Society\">Samuel Butler Room</a> or at Peterhouse. Most colleges also have an SCR. At Pembroke College the common rooms are called \"parlours\", such as the Junior Parlour and Graduate Parlour. At <a href=\"/wiki/Jesus_College,_Cambridge\" title=\"Jesus College, Cambridge\">Jesus College, Cambridge</a>, the JCR is known as \"The Jesus College Students' Union\", with its physical space being the Marshall Room.\n</p><p>JCRs and MCRs have elected committees to represent their interests within their colleges and in the central students' union. <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_University_Students%27_Union\" title=\"Cambridge University Students&#39; Union\">Cambridge University Students' Union</a>. The committees are almost universally led by a President and a range of other elected positions to cover specific areas or interest or functions (e.g. Secretary, Treasurer, Entertainment). There is a great deal of variety between the colleges in terms of the roles that the JCRs and MCRs undertake, how much influence they have in college affairs and how many functions they provide. Nearly all are responsible for organising Freshers Week and frequent entertainments.\n</p><p>JCR Presidents and External Officers in Cambridge are <i>ex officio</i> council members of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cambridge_University_Students%27_Union\" title=\"Cambridge University Students&#39; Union\">Cambridge University Students' Union</a> (CUSU).

The <a href=\"/wiki/College_of_St_Hild_and_St_Bede\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"College of St Hild and St Bede\">College of St Hild and St Bede</a> has a \"<a href=\"/wiki/Students_Representative_Council\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Students Representative Council\">Students Representative Council</a>\", which includes both undergraduates and <a href=\"/wiki/Postgraduate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Postgraduate\">postgraduates</a> at the college, with a special <a href=\"/wiki/Postgraduate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Postgraduate\">postgraduate</a> committee. St.Aidan's College combines the MCR and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one Common Room as a whole, while <a href=\"/wiki/St_Cuthbert%27s_Society\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"St Cuthbert&#39;s Society\">St Cuthbert's Society</a> combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR.

Lopes, Hope and Mardon hall are all home to extensive Common Room set ups, which form a central part of student life there. In such Halls, committees are elected to represent the student body via the Common Room, and it is their job to liaise with the Resident Tutors who reside within the Hall. Although somewhat under threat by mergers of Halls and changes to internal administration, the Common Rooms still play an active and important role within the University, by both providing welfare and recourse to higher authorities for the students, and by organising social events such as balls, formals and more casual activities.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kent\">Kent</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Common_Room_(university)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Kent\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Kent\" title=\"University of Kent\">Kent</a> each of the colleges was initially built with one or more \"senior Common Room\" social spaces. However, over the passage of time a number of the common rooms have been transformed into eateries and more formalised social areas. Each college has a \"management Committee\" (formerly \"Junior College Committee\" and before that, \"Junior Common Room Committee\") which acts to represent the students of each college at the students' union and organise cultural events.\n</p><p>The Rooms and Committees have traditionally been open to both undergraduates and postgraduates, with the Senior Common Rooms provided for staff.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lancaster\">Lancaster</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Common_Room_(university)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Lancaster\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Lancaster\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Lancaster\">Lancaster</a>, undergraduates are members of one of eight colleges (with a further college for postgraduate students). Each undergraduate college is a quasi-autonomous body within the university, and each divides its members into Junior and Senior Common Rooms. These terms are more indicative of the collective student/staff bodies than actual space,  although each college has actual common rooms set aside for Junior members. Senior members are less fortunate due to a current policy by the university's estates department of removing Senior Common Room space from college control \u2013 refurbishing these as teaching rooms or putting them on the central booking system, so SCR members cannot just \"drop in\". The term \"JCR\", although intended to refer to all junior members of a college, is often used to refer to elected members of each college's JCR Executive.  Each JCR Executive organises a range of social and sporting activities for its college while also offering welfare support for its junior members. The President and Vice President represent their college at the Student Union Council and on a range of University Committees, and many JCR Executive members sit with SCR members on the College Syndicate \u2013 the governing body of each college.\n</p><p>Within the Graduate College, the Graduate Students Association (GSA) takes on the role of an \"MCR\". Lancaster has a Students' Union which co-ordinates activities between the different colleges, and the JCR and GSA executives are considered to be standing committees of the Union Council.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Leicester\">Leicester</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Common_Room_(university)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Leicester\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Leicester\" title=\"University of Leicester\">Leicester</a>  the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130604024536/http://www.leicesterjcr.org.uk/\">Junior Common Room</a> (JCR) is open to all members of the University, although its main focus is around the Halls of Residence of the University.
