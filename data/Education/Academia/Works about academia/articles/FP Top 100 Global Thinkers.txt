Foreign Policy magazine recognizes the world's pre-eminent thought leaders and public intellectuals in an annual issue, "100 Leading Global Thinkers".  The list has become one of Foreign Policy's most-read features.  Honorees include a range of leaders, advocates, innovators, artists, government officials, and visionaries from around the world.  The editors of Foreign Policy select the 100 global thinkers based on their standout contributions over the previous year and their ability to translate ideas into action that change and shape the world.  Since 2011, Foreign Policy has honored these leaders at an annual celebration, held at the time of the release of the print issue, in Washington, D.C.
