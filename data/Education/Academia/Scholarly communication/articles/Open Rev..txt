Open Rev. is a web-based platform for open discussion and annotation of research publications and related material. Researchers can comment directly on text, formulas, and images in research papers, post related questions and answer questions posed by each other. Open Rev’s web-based PDF viewer has been implemented to encourage public discussion and open peer review of scientific publications.

Open Rev. was a participant of the Harvard i-Lab Venture Incubation Program 2014  and has won awards from the Harvard Institute for Learning and Teaching  and Education Innovation Pitch Competition.  Open Rev. was created by Erik Bauch and Georg Kucsko, currently PhD candidates in the Harvard Physics program, to foster public and open discussions on research papers. It officially launched in 2014.  As of 2015, the user base has risen to over 1000 participants and includes institutions such as Harvard, MIT, Northeastern University, Royal Holloway University of London, and Uppsala Universitet. Open Rev. has been featured in Harvard Physics,  the Harvard Gazette  and the Harvard alumni magazine, Colloquy.  In an interview in Colloquy, co-founder Erik Bauch explained, “Up until now scientific discussions usually occurred at conferences, in journal club, or in hallways on the way to lunch. With Open Rev. we are trying to motivate people to take some of these discussions online and share their knowledge with the whole scientific community.”
