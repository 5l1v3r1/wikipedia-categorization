PubRef is a composition and project management application used by researchers and students for scholarly writing and communication.  PubRef uses an extended form of Markdown  as a primary authoring format and converts this to JATS, the archive format used by the US National Library of Medicine. Researchers manage scholarly writing projects within version-controlled file repositories called containers that function similarly to git repositories and docker containers to provide enhanced reproducibility, transparency and re-usability in digital science publishing. A PubRef manuscript is a Markdown file within a container that contains extra embedded information that describes the essential front matter elements of a scholarly manuscript such as the title, short title, list of authors, author affiliations, keywords.  This information is captured in embedded YAML blocks within the primary manuscript called Meta.  Figures, tables, equations and other special content can be similarly embedded within the context of the document via Meta descriptors. This minimal formatting example repurposes a classic paper by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology   Once the essential frontmatter meta elements have been declared, manuscripts can be automatically submitted to academic publishers.  Articles, supporting data, and dependent code can be published directly on PubRef in the form of personal communications under the DOI prefix 10.17920/P9.pubref.
