VIVO is a web-based, open-source suite of computer software for managing data about researchers, scientists, and faculty members. VIVO uses Semantic Web techniques to represent people and their work. As of 2017, it is used by several universities and the United States Department of Agriculture.  The Cornell University Library originally created VIVO in 2003 as a "virtual life sciences community".   In 2009, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $12.2 million grant to Cornell, University of Florida, Indiana University, Ponce School of Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, Washington University, and Weill Cornell Medical College to expand the tool for use outside of Cornell.  VIVO can harvest publication data from PubMed, CSV files, relational databases, or OAI-PMH harvest.  It then uses a semi-automated process to match publications to researchers.   It also harvests information about researchers from Human Resources systems and student information systems.  The VIVO ontology incorporates elements of several established ontologies, including Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, FOAF, and SKOS. The ontology can be used to describe several roles of faculty members, including research, teaching, and service.  The Dutch Data Archiving and Networked Services and Indiana University worked to develop the ontology to enable bilingual modeling of researchers.
