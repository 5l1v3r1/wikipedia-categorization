ImpactStory is an open source, web-based tool that provides altmetrics to help researchers measure and share the impacts of all their research outputsâ€”from traditional ones such as journal articles, to alternative research outputs such as blog posts, datasets, and software.  It aims to change the focus of the scholarly reward system to value and encourage web-native scholarship. ImpactStory is a nonprofit organisation funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation   and the National Science Foundation.    ImpactStory follows open practices with its data (to the extent allowed by providers' terms of service), code,  and governance.  It provides context to its metrics so that they are meaningful without knowledge of the specific dataset: for example, instead of letting the reader guess whether having five forks on GitHub is common, ImpactStory would tell that the repository is in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repositories created that year.  The metrics provided by ImpactStory can be used by researchers who want to know how many times their work has been downloaded and shared,  and also research funders who are interested in the impact of research beyond only considering citations to journal articles. One of the solutions ImpactStory developed is Unpaywall, a Google Chrome and Firefox browser extension,  which find free versions of (paywalled) articles.  In July 2018 it was reported to provide free access to 20 million articles,  and about 47% of the articles that people search with Unpaywall.  The underlying data is used by Clarivate Analytics in Web of Science to provide free access to literature in that database.  In July 2018, it was announced that Unpaywall has been awarded a grant of $850,000 by Arcadia.
