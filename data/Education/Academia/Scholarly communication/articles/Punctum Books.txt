Punctum Books, stylized as punctum books, is an open-access and print-on-demand independent publisher based in Brooklyn, New York, United States. The imprint was co-founded in 2011 by Eileen A. Joy (a medievalist and advocate of open access ) and Nicola Masciandaro (Brooklyn College, CUNY), who left the project in 2012. The imprint was conceived partly as an offshoot of the BABEL Working Group,  a "non-hierarchical scholarly collective"  with an emphasis on medieval studies. Since its inception, Punctum has sought to bring creative works on the fringe of academic research to a broader public. It publishes print editions through CreateSpace, but buyers can get a PDF version of the book by giving a donation to the publisher.  Punctum also publishes the journals Anarchist Developments in Cultural Studies,  Badiou Studies,  Contention: The Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Protest,  Helvete: A Journal of Black Metal Theory,  Itineration: Cross-Disciplinary Studies in Rhetoric, Media and Culture,  Networks and Neighbours,  O-Zone: A Journal of Object Oriented Studies,  Radical Criminology,  and Speculations: A Journal of Speculative Realism.
