MyScienceWork builds tools to help institutions and R&D companies increase and measure the impact of their researcher’s work.  With the value of open access in mind, the company hosts a community of researchers that can upload and consult more than 70 publications and 12 millions patents online.  If publications are not available in open access, researchers are able to find it on the publisher's websites. In 2018, MyScienceWork launched PolarisOs, an open source repository that helps the dissemination of research and the communication of researchers at the service of scientific institutions. This tool is also a library management system, multimedia archive, research data repository and institutional repository. This solution is available on GitHub. MyScienceWork was created in August 2010  by Virginie Simon,  a researcher in cancer nanotechnology, and Tristan Davaille, a financial engineer.  The global platform www.MyScienceWork.com, online since January 2013, provides free and instantaneous access to more than 2,500 scientific databases cataloguing over 31 million research publications available online:  over 20 million are open access with a PDF download available and 10 million are priced for individual purchase from scientific publishers.  In October 2014, MyScienceWork opened American offices in San Francisco.  The first Polaris platform for research institutions produced by MyScienceWork was released in December 2014.  PolarisOS is a tool addressing the needs of research institutions in terms of communicating, networking, collaborating, and prioritizing research objectives. Researchers are also increasingly active in enhancing their own visibility and research impact as more universities take these measures into account in the promotion and evaluation of researchers.  The multichannel communication platforms offered by MyScienceWork include interconnected functionalities responding to these specific needs.  Archives Polaris allows institutions to archive their publications, research data, theses, videos, posters, etc., and can be linked to existing archives, like ArXiv, PubMed and HAL. Metrics The metrics tools allow institutions to track performance and trends of their research teams and overall research production. The platform's dashboard provides an overview of publications’ impact, and the metrics can be filtered to report the number of consultations per publication by reader, country, and discipline. Professional Profiles Researchers create profiles, similar to those of LinkedIn, within their Polaris and can build their network by adding contacts from their own institution or from the greater MyScienceWork international community. Keywords provided in the profile are used by the platform’s tools to offer personal suggestions of publications and contacts to each user. Other tools designed to facilitate professional collaboration and interaction allow for the sharing of documents and annotating of publications. Dissemination PolarisOS is dedicated to popularizing science and making it visible and accessible. PolarisOS integrates into the ecosystem of research institutes by recovering/exporting all types of data (scientific, technological, financial, managerial...) to and from existing information systems or the Internet to model, clean, structure, and enrich them.  MyScienceWork supports the circulation of open access scientific texts. Its search engine centralizes the main open access databases online,  like PubMed, CiteSeer, DOAJ, Research Papers in Economics, ArXiv, HAL, Abes, BioMed Central, CERN, Persee, Revues.org, TEL, ORBI, and Public Library of Science. In 2012 and 2013, MyScienceWork was the national coordinator of International Open Access Week in France.   Since 2010, MyScienceWork has been a popular science media outlet dedicated to news about multidisciplinary professional research.  In January 2016, the company launched OmniScience, a new format of its science news site. It features scientific news articles, video abstracts, researcher portraits, and opinion pieces, which are divided into three sections: “Revolution”, exploring emerging practices in science and their impact; “Exploration”, highlighting the diverse professional experiences of researchers; and “Knowledge”, reporting on the latest scientific discoveries. In OmniScience, readers also find collections covering open access, women in science, earning a doctorate, and science 2.0. MyScienceWork also produced a weekly video web series called Knock Knock Doc, highlighting PhD students and their research.
