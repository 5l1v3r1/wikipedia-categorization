The Cowdrey Lecture, also referred to as the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture, is an annual event organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at the Lord's Cricket Ground.  The event was first hosted in 2001, following the death of its eponym Late Lord Colin Cowdrey, in December 2000. Colin Cowdrey is reported to have been instrumental in adapting the Captains' Charter as the Spirit of Cricket and subsequently adding it as the preamble to the Laws of Cricket.   It is held annually during the English summer and is delivered by pre-eminent cricketing personalities. The event is an invite only affair, with high profile cricketing personalities, repr√©sentatives of cricketing boards and journalists in attendance. The format of the event is simple: the cowdrey lecture followed by an informal discussion/question-answer session with a panel of distinguished personalities.  * - Denotes Lecturers who received standing ovations from the audience.
