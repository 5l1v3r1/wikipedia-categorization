The Woolmer lecture is the flagship lecture of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. It takes place annually during the Institute's Medical Physics and Engineering Conference. The lecture is dedicated to Professor Ronald Woolmer who was the first Director of the Research Department of Anaesthetics at the Royal College of Surgeons. Woolmer convened a meeting at the Royal College of Surgeons, London, to discuss the evolving field of engineering applied to medicine. It was agreed that the group should hold regular meetings and as a result the Biological Engineering Society (BES) was formed with Ronald Woolmer as the first President. Woolmer died two years after the formation of the BES and it was agreed that a memorial lecture would be sponsored in recognition of his achievements. 2002 Anthony Unsworth 2003 Arun Holden 2004 Kevin Warwick  2005 Dr H Gollee   2006 Denis Noble 2007 Michael Brady 2008 Clive Hahn 2009 Martin Birchall 2010 Mark Tooley 2011 Willi Kalender  2012 Lionel Tarassenko  2013 Molly Stevens   2014 David Keating  2015 Anthony Barker  2016 Andrew Taylor  2017 Josef KÃ¤s
