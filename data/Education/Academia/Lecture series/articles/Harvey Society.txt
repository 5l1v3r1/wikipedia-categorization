The Harvey Society is a learned society based in New York City, Named after the British scientist William Harvey (1578â€“1657), its scope is "the diffusion of knowledge of the medical sciences".   Since its founding in 1905, the society has sponsored an annual series of lectures given by leading biomedical researchers which it publishes in book form at the end of the year. The society's seven annual lectures are now held at Rockefeller University's Caspary Auditorium.

Their intention was to form a society which would forge a "closer relationship between the purely practical side of medicine and the results of laboratory investigation" by organizing a lecture series which would be open to physicians, scientists, and the general public.  The society's first meeting took place on October 7, 1905 in the Academy of Medicine with a lecture on the theory of narcosis by Hans Horst Meyer, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Vienna.
