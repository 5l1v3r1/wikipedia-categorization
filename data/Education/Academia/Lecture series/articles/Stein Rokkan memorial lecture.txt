The Stein Rokkan Memorial Lecture is an annual lecture which is arranged by the Department of Comparative Politics (Norwegian: Institutt  for sammenliknende politikk) at the University of Bergen, Norway. Since 2002, the organising of the lecture has been in cooperation with the UNI Rokkan Centre. The purpose of the lecture is to draw attention to some of the most outstanding exponents of Stein Rokkanâ€™s fields of research; first and foremost political science, sociology and comparative politics.
