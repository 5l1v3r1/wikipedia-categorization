The Longford Lectures are held annually in November at Church House, Westminster. They aim to provide a national platform for a serious contribution to questions of social and penal reform. The Lectures are organised by The Longford Trust which celebrates the achievements and continues the work of Lord Longford. It was established in 2002 by friends and admirers to further the goals he pursued, particularly in the field of social and prison reform. The Longford Lectures were sponsored originally by The Independent and more recently by the Daily Telegraph. In addition to the Lectures, the Trust bestows The Longford Prize on individuals and organisations who play a prominent role in the field of prison reform. The broadcaster and journalist Jon Snow chairs the event every year. Full transcripts and films of each Lecture is available on the Longford Trust website.
