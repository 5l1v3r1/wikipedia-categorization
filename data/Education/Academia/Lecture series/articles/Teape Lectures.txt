The Teape Lectures were established at Cambridge University in 1955.  They form the major activity of the Teape Trust (Charity No 250095), created from an endowment made posthumously by William Marshall Teape (St John's College, Cambridge 1882, died 1945).  The object of the trust is 'The advancement of education by the provision of lectures on the relationship between Christian and Hindu thought and subject thereto the study of Christian and Hindu religious thought and the promotion of Christian-Hindu relations'.  The lectures are among the most prestigious engagements for Christian-Hindu relations, as evidenced from the list of major speakers who have held the appointments, and from the internationally significant publications that have emerged from many of the lecture series. The lectures are typically delivered in Cambridge by a speaker from India or in India by a speaker with a Cambridge connection.  They reflect a close association between Westcott House, Cambridge and St. Stephen's College, Delhi.
