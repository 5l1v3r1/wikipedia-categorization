The Baird Lecture is a lectureship that was endowed by James Baird to promote the Christian religion. In 1873 James Baird established The Baird Trust and gave into its care Â£500,000 to be used for aggressive Christian work. A part of the income of this fund was to provide for a series of lectures in Glasgow and also, if required, at one other of the Scottish university towns. Each course was to be delivered by a minister of the Church of Scotland, who could be reappointed, and was to consist of at least six lectures.
