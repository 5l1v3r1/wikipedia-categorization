 The Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture is an annual public lecture held by the University of Newcastle Law School.  The first lecture was delivered by former Governor-General of Australia Sir Ninian Stephen in 1993, to celebrate the establishment of the Bachelor of Laws program at the University.  This event continues under his name, and is generally held in the early weeks of the academic year.  The 2017 lecture was delivered on 11 August 2017 by Justice Margaret Beazley, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal titled "Language, Law's Essential Tool."
