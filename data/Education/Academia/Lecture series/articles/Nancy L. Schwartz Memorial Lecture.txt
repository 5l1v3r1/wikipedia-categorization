The Nancy L. Schwartz Memorial Lecture is a series of public lectures held every year by the Kellogg Department of Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences.    Nancy Schwartz was the Morrison Professor of Decision Sciences. She was also the Kellogg School's first female faculty member appointed to an endowed chair. Schwartz became a part of Kellogg in 1970, chaired MEDS as well as served as director of the school's doctoral program until her death in 1981.  To date, sixteen out of the thirty-four speakers held or have gone on to win a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.
