The Huizinga Lecture (Dutch: Huizingalezing) is an annual lecture in the Netherlands about a subject in the domains of cultural history or philosophy.  The lecture is in honour of Johan Huizinga, a distinguished Dutch historian (1872â€“1945) who worked in the first half of the 20th century. The Lecture is organized by nationwide daily general newspaper NRC Handelsblad, the Faculty of Humanities of Leiden University, and the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde (Society of Dutch Literature). Attendance at the lecture was free of charge for subscribers to NRC Handelsblad, members of the Faculty of Humanities, and members of the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde until 2010. From 2011 onwards tickets have to be bought. The lecture is held alternately by a Dutch and a non-Dutch intellectual. The Huizinga Lecture started in 1972 and is held annually in December in the Pieterskerk in Leiden, The Netherlands. This is a complete list of the Huizinga Lectures from the beginning in 1972 to the present date.
