It was established in 1970 and named after Fred Watts, a former professor of geography at the University of Toronto and founding member of the University of Toronto Scarborough, initially known as Scarborough College, who deceased a year before the inception of the lecture series.  The series was inaugurated by Lester B. Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada.
