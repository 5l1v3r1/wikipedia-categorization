The Charles Proteus Steinmetz Memorial Lecture is a series of academic lectures initiated in 1925  in honor of celebrated mathematician and electrical engineer Charles Proteus Steinmetz.  To date seventy three addresses have been given on subjects ranging from peace  and educational reform  to nanotechnology  and solar photovoltaics.  The seventy-fourth, "The Evolution of the Smart Grid from Edison and Steinmetz", will be delivered by Dr. Anjan Bose, Regents Professor at Washington State University, on October 2, 2018.  It will be hosted by Union College and is open to the general public. Shortly after Steinmetz's death at 58 in 1923, his friends and admirers, including prominent figures at General Electric in Schenectady, New York, endowed the series.  It is overseen by the Schenectady Section of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  and hosted by Union College, where Steinmetz long held a professorship.  Among those receiving the honor of delivering the lecture have been such notables as Nobel laureate experimental physicist Robert A. Millikan (1927), helicopter inventor Igor Sikorsky (1938), nuclear submarine pioneer Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (1963), Nobel-winning semiconductor inventor William Shockley (1966), and Internet 'founding father' Leonard Kleinrock (2010).  The featured lecturers of the Steinmetz series have included:
