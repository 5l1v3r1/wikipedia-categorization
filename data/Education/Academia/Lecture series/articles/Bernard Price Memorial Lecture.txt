The Bernard Price Memorial Lecture is the premier annual lecture of the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers. It is of general scientific or engineering interest and is given by an invited guest, often from overseas, at several of the major centres on South Africa. The main lecture and accompanying dinner are usually held at the University of Witwatersrand and it is also presented in the space of one week at other centres, typically Cape Town, Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth. The Lecture is named in memory of the eminent electrical engineer Bernard Price. The first Lecture was held in 1951 and it has occurred as an annual event ever since. 1951	Basil Schonland 1952	A M Jacobs 1953	H J Van Eck 1954	J M Meek 1955	F R N Nabarro 1956	A L Hales 1957	P G Game 1958	Colin Cherry 1959	Thomas Allibone 1960	M G Say 1961	Willis Jackson 1963	W R Stevens 1964	William Pickering 1965	G H Rawcliffe 1966	Harold Bishop 1967	Eric Eastwood 1968	F J Lane 1969	A H Reeves  1970 	Andrew R Cooper 1971 	H L Haslegrave 1972 	W J Bray 1973 	R Noser 1974 	D Kind 1975 	L Kirchmayer 1976 	S Jones 1977 	J Johnson 1978 	T G E Cockbain 1979 	A R Hileman 1980 	James Redmond 1981 	L M Muntzing 1982 	K F Raby 1983 	R Isermann 1984 	M N John 1985 	J W L de Villiers 1986 	Derek Roberts 1987	Wolfram Boeck 1988	Karl Gehring 1989 	Leonard Sagan 1990 	GKF Heyner 1991 	P S Blythin 1992 	P M Neches 1993 	P Radley 1994 	P R Rosen 1995 	F P Sioshansi 1996 	J Taylor 1997 	M Chamia 1998	C Gellings 1999	M W Kennedy 2000	John Midwinter 2001	Pragasen Pillay 2002 	Polina Bayvel 2003	Case Rijsdijk 2004	Frank Larkins 2005    Igor Aleksander  2006    Kevin Warwick  2007     Skip Hatfield  2008     Sami Solanki  2009     William Gruver  2010     Glenn Ricart  2011     Philippe Paelinck 2012     Nick Frydas  2013     Vint Cerf  2014     Ian Jandrell  2015     Saurabh Sinha  2016      Tshilidzi Marwala   2017      Fulufhelo Nelwamondo
