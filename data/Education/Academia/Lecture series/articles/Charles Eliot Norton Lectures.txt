The Charles Eliot Norton Professorship of Poetry at Harvard University was established in 1925 as an annual lectureship in "poetry in the broadest sense" and named for the university's former professor of fine arts.  Distinguished creative figures and scholars in the arts, including painting, architecture, and music deliver customarily six lectures.  The lectures are usually dated by the academic year in which they are given, though sometimes by just the calendar year. Many but not all of the Norton Lectures have subsequently been published by the Harvard University Press.  The following table lists all the published lecture series, with academic year given and year of publication, together with unpublished lectures as are known.  Titles under which the lectures were published are not necessarily titles under which they were given. The post had no incumbent in years omitted.
