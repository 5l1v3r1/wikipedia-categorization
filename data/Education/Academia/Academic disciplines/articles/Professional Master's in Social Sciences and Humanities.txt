Professional Master's in Social Sciences and Humanities, abbreviated PMA, is an initiative by the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) and support from the Ford Foundation to create master's programs in social sciences and humanities that better prepare graduates for professional careers in business, government, and nonprofit sectors. It corresponds with CGS's other professional master's initiative, the Professional Science Master's.
