Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science is a 1994 book by biologist Paul R. Gross and mathematician Norman Levitt. Levitt states he is a leftist trying to save the "academic left" from itself by exposing misuses and abuses of science to advance political goals. The book inspired the 1996 Sokal hoax, in which Alan Sokal published a bogus paper to a postmodernist journal that did not peer-review submissions.  Sokal stated in an interview that while he was initially skeptical about Higher Superstition, he concluded after reading the works Gross and Levit criticized that they were describing them fairly in "about 80 percent of the cases".
