Academic job market refers to the pool of vacant teaching and administrative positions in Academia, i.e. in institutions of Higher Education such as universities and colleges, and also to the competition for these positions, and the mechanisms for advertising and filling them. This job market differs somewhat from other job markets because of such institutions as tenure. It is frequently a subject of debate relating to questions of openness, discrimination and reverse discrimination, and political interference. The Academic job market, like the structure of academic careers, operates somewhat differently in different countries.
