Nuffic plays an important role in fostering international cooperation in education between the Netherlands and other countries.\n</p><p>Nuffic is part of the Dutch education field. Its goal is to support Dutch institutions and the Dutch government in internationalisation activities. The focus of its service lies in the Netherlands, even though its mission extends beyond that. To this end Nuffic cooperates with foreign partners, institutions and governments.

The goal was primarily to organise English education for students from developing countries that had recently gained independence. For this purpose the Institute of Social Studies (ISS) was established, initially as part of Nuffic, but it became an independent institute in 1956. This is where the current role of Nuffic in <a href=\"/wiki/Development_cooperation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Development cooperation\">development cooperation</a> \u2013 management of scholarship programmes and institutional cooperation programmes \u2013 finds its roots.\n</p><p>The first official president was <a href=\"/wiki/Prince_Bernard_of_the_Netherlands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prince Bernard of the Netherlands\">Prince Bernard of the Netherlands</a>, who remained in that position for two years. After <a href=\"/wiki/Queen_Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands\">Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands</a> moved to <a href=\"/wiki/Het_Loo_Palace\" title=\"Het Loo Palace\">Het Loo Palace</a>, Nuffic relocated to <a href=\"/wiki/Noordeinde_Palace\" title=\"Noordeinde Palace\">Noordeinde Palace</a> until 1977. Currently, Nuffic is situated in another famous building in The Hague: the former headquarters of the PTT (Post, Telegraph, Telephone), an organisation that used to be state owned, on the Kortenaerkade. The building is a national monument.\n</p><p>Over the years Nuffic acquired a great number of other tasks. Since 1958 the organisation is involved in the recognition of international diplomas and making comparisons of education systems. Its efforts to support educational cooperation in Europe increased during the 1980s. That is when both The Hague and Brussels set up stimulation programmes, among which the well-known <a href=\"/wiki/Erasmus_Programme\" title=\"Erasmus Programme\">Erasmus Programme</a>. \n</p><p>On 5 November 2012 Fedde Klaas (Freddy) Weima took up the position of Director-General of Nuffic.\nMr Weima succeeds Mr S.P. van den Eijnden, who left Nuffic in the spring of 2012 to become President of the Executive Board of the <a href=\"/wiki/Open_University_of_the_Netherlands\" title=\"Open University of the Netherlands\">Open University of the Netherlands</a>.\n</p><p>In 2015 Nuffic merged with Europees Platform.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Nuffic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nuffic.nl\">Nuffic</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.studyinholland.nl\">Study in Holland</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.wilweg.nl\">WilWeg</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.na-lll.nl\">Nationaal Agentschap \u2013 Leven Lang Leren</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.unesco.nl\">Nationale UNESCO Commissie</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hollandalumni.nl\">Holland Alumni network</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1345\nCached time: 20180906165747\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.020 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.022 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 23/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:7645093-0!canonical and timestamp 20180906165747 and revision id 772520148\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[{"lang":"id","url":"https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuffic","langname":"Indonesian","autonym":"Bahasa Indonesia","*":"Nuffic"},{"lang":"nl","url":"https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuffic","langname":"Dutch","autonym":"Nederlands","*":"Nuffic"}],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Academic_transfer"},{"sortkey":"","*":"1952_establishments_in_the_Netherlands"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Organizations_established_in_1952"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Educational_organisations_in_the_Netherlands"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Organisations_based_in_The_Hague"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Capacity building"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Development cooperation"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Erasmus Programme"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"European Union"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Het Loo Palace"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Knowledge economy"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Noordeinde Palace"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Open University of the Netherlands"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Prince Bernard of the Netherlands"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"The Hague"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"The Netherlands"}],"templates":[],"images":["Nuffic_vanaf_Hogewal_Den_Haag.jpg"],"externallinks":["http://www.nuffic.nl","http://www.studyinholland.nl","http://www.wilweg.nl","http://www.na-lll.nl","http://www.unesco.nl","http://www.hollandalumni.nl"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Activities","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Nuffic","byteoffset":1081,"anchor":"Activities"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"History","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Nuffic","byteoffset":1521,"anchor":"History"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Nuffic","byteoffset":3286,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Nuffic","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q2489459"}]}}
