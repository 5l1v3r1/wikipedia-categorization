The Boxer Indemnity Scholarship (United Kingdom) (Chinese: 庚子赔款奖学金; pinyin: Gēngzǐ Péikuǎn Jiǎngxuéjīn or simply Chinese: 英庚子), funded by the remittent of Boxer Indemnity (zh) of China to the United Kingdom, was a scholarship program for Chinese students to be educated in the United Kingdom. It was established after Boxer Indemnity Scholarship (U.S.). Unlike the U.S., the remittent of the indemnity had caused a debate in the parliament of the United Kingdom, on the allocation of the money, on education or on other area such as railways.
