University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific (UMAP) has developed a pilot UMAP Credit Transfer Scheme (UCTS) to facilitate greater student mobility in the region by providing a framework for establishing credit transfer arrangements.  UCTS model adopted the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) in order to assist and facilitate the student mobility and create a flexible mean of transferring grades between participating universities, countries/territories and governments.  The UCTS objective is to ensure effective credit transfer for students undertaking exchange program in universities from UMAP countries/territories and other regions.  Some of the major components of the UCTS scheme are: UCTS credit points are numerical values (1 to 60) and it is allocated to course units to measure student workload required to finish the course. 60 credit points represent full-time student workload for a full academic year. For one semester exchange student, the credit points would be represented with 30 credit points. Example: One Semester Study Program in Host University (Host University = 16 Credit point per semester; Home University = 6 credit points per term)   Conversion from Host University Credit Points to UCTS: 4*30/16  Conversion from UCTS to Home University Credit Points: 7.5*9/30  The UCTS credit points scale and grading scale are not intended to replace host and home universities scales. It is used solely for the purpose of assisting the conversion.     The grading scale of universities will vary between countries/territories within UMAP. As in European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), it is necessary to have a common scale for conversion purposes.
