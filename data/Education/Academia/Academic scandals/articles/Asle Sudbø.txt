Asle Sudbø (born 3 May 1961) is a Professor of Physics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He was awarded the Møbius Prize in 2005, for his research on superconductivity.  He has published papers in Physical Review Letters, and was a co-author (with his brother, Jon Sudbø) of two articles in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine  that were since found be based on scientific fraud and subsequently retracted. However, his brother claimed only he was responsible for the fraud.  An official inquiry into Asle Sudbø's involvement with his brother's fabrication took place, but he denied knowledge of the fabrication.
