Intellectual inbreeding or academic inbreeding is the practice in academia of a university's hiring its own graduates to be professors.  It is generally viewed as insular and unhealthy for academia;  it is thought to reduce the possibility of new ideas coming in from outside sources, just as genetic inbreeding reduces the possibility of new genes entering into a population.  According to the Commission on Graduate Education in Economics (COGEE), they recognize it as "a trend for emulation rather than diversification."  Academic inbreeding has also been cited as a major problem in the major universities of the People's Republic of China—such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, which have adopted measures in recent years specifically to combat the practice  —and South Korea.  A relevant study  also exists that analyzes the issue by considering Russia and Portugal as examples.
