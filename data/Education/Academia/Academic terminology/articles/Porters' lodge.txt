 A porters' lodge (colloquially, plodge)  is a place near the entrance of a building where one or more porters can be found to respond to enquiries from the public and direct them around the building. It is particularly associated with university accommodation in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada (such as the majority of colleges of the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Durham, York and Toronto).    Oxbridge porters' lodges typically also house the pigeon-holes for students' and Fellows' mail.
