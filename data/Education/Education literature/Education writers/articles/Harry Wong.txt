Wong's publications provide advice on the improvement of academic instruction, classroom management and teacher expectations of students. He draws a distinction between classroom "discipline" and classroom "management" and suggests that through clear procedures and routines, teachers can promote behaviors avoid infractions, punishments, and ultimately, lost productive time in a classroom.  He also asserted that the first few minutes with students on the first day can lead to the long-term success or failure of a teacher.   The First Days of School: How to Be an Effective Teacher was first published in 2001 and was co-written by Wong's wife Rosemary T. Wong. The book is separated into six sections that purport to create effective teacher-leaders through focus on objectives and student learning. Wong, Harry; Wong, Rosemary.
