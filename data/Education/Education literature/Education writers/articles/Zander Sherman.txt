 Zander Sherman (born 1986) is a Canadian author and journalist. Sherman is the great-grandson of Frank A. Sherman, cofounder of Dofasco, a steel company in Hamilton, Ontario. Sherman grew up in Muskoka, where he was homeschooled until the age of thirteen. His father, Jamie, is an artist, glassblower, and musician.  Sherman's debut work was published in 2012 by Penguin Random House. The Curiosity of School: Education and the Dark Side of Enlightenment  debuted on the national bestseller list,  where it generated wide-ranging response from critics.   Educator Paul W. Bennett described the book as "the most stimulating Canadian contribution to the Great Education Debate in decades."  Sherman has since contributed to The Globe & Mail,  and written for numerous magazines including Esquire  and The Believer.  In 2017, he consulted on "Murder in Cottage Country," a co-produced documentary by CBC News and The Walrus Foundation.  Sherman composes music under the name Larch.
