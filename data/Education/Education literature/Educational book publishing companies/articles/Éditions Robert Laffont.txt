Éditions Robert Laffont is a book publishing company in France founded in 1941 by Robert Laffont. Its publications are distributed in almost all francophone countries, but mainly in France, Canada and in Belgium. It is considered as one of the most important French publishing houses. Imprints belonging to Éditions Robert Laffont include éditions Julliard, les Seghers, Foreign Rights and NiL Éditions. In 1990, Éditions Robert Laffont was acquired by the French publishing group Groupe de La Cité. It is now part of Editis. Éditions Robert Laffont published the Quid encyclopedia from 1975 to 2007, but announced that the 2008 edition of the encyclopedia would not be published after annual sales had fallen from a high of 400,000 to less than 100,000, apparently because of competition from online information sources such as Wikipedia.
