Paulo Freire: The Man from Recife is a scholarly book written by American author James D. Kirylo.  It is a comprehensive text that covers the life, work, and thought of the great Brazilian educator, Paulo Freire (1921–1997), who was born and raised in Recife, Brazil.  Remarkably grounded in the wisdom of humility, yet gifted with a determined strength, deep insight, and perceptive intelligence, Freire not only believed in the human spirit, goodness, and the fostering of a more hopeful world, but was also profoundly committed to challenge individuals and political, educational, and religious structures that perpetuated the status quo.  Of the book, Ana Maria Araújo Freire, Paulo’s widow, stated, “If Paulo Freire could read this book, he would certainly be happy with how James D. Kirylo has presented his thought, faithfully and respectfully recreating him without distortion.”  Donaldo Macedo, author of numerous books and one who significantly collaborated with Paulo, asserted that Kirylo’s “insightful book is a great complement to Paulo Freire’s Letters to Cristina and Ana Maria Araújo Freire’s Paulo Freire: Uma História de Vida…Reading Kirylo’s book reminds me, once again, how I feel enormously blessed for having had the opportunity to work and collaborate with Paulo Freire so closely for many years.”  According to Peter McLaren, "Paulo Freire has cultivated the ground for a long revolution, and James D. Kirylo's outstanding new work has skillfully and with prescient insight illuminated this ground in ways few books on Freire have managed to accomplish."
