John Locke's Of the Conduct of the Understanding describes how to think clearly and rationally. It is a handbook for autodidacts. It complements Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education which explains how to educate children. The text was first published in 1706, two years after Locke's death, as part of Peter King's Posthumous Works of John Locke.
