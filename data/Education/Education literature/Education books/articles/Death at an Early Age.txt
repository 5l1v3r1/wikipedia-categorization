Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools (reissue ISBNÂ 0-452-26292-5) is a book written by the American schoolteacher Jonathan Kozol and published in Boston by Houghton Mifflin in 1967. It won the U.S. National Book Award in the Science, Philosophy and Religion category.  The book describes Kozol's first year of teaching, which took place in the Boston public school system. Kozol recounts the deeply entrenched policies of racial segregation and inequality on the part of Boston Public Schools; testifies to a crumbling infrastructure in his Roxbury, Boston, neighborhood; and documents the public outcry after his dismissal for teaching a Langston Hughes poem to his reading class.
