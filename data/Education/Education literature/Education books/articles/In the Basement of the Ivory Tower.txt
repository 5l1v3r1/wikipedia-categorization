In the Basement of the Ivory Tower: Confessions of an Accidental Academic is a 2011 book by an adjunct professor of English, who writes under the pen name Professor X.  It is based on an Atlantic Monthly article of the same title.   "Professor X teaches at a private college and at a community college in the northeastern United States"  and argues that "The idea that a university education is for everyone is a destructive myth."
