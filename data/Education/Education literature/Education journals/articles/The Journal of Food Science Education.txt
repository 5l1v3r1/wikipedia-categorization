The Journal of Food Science Education is an online peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the Institute of Food Technologists (Chicago, Illinois). It was established in 2002 as the first scientific electronic journal of the Institute that is published online only. Its main focus is the education methods involved in food science and technology. This involves recruitment of future food scientists, education at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and continuing education through distance learning, e-learning, and lifelong learning. The January 2007 issue featured the first themed issue with improved food science education in the K-12 grade range (Kindergarten, primary, middle school, and secondary).  Wayne T. Iwaoka was editor from 2002 to 2006. Since 2006, Grady W. Chism III has held that position.
