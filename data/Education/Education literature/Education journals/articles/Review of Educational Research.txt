The Review of Educational Research is a bimonthly peer-reviewed review journal published by Sage Publications on behalf of the American Educational Research Association. It was established in 1931 and covers all aspects of education and educational research. The Review of Educational Research (RER) publishes critical, integrative reviews of research literature bearing on education. Such reviews should include conceptualizations, interpretations, and syntheses of literature and scholarly work in a field broadly relevant to education and educational research. RER encourages the submission of research relevant to education from any discipline, such as reviews of research in psychology, sociology, history, philosophy, political science, economics, computer science, statistics, anthropology, and biology, provided that the review bears on educational issues. RER does not publish original empirical research unless it is incorporated in a broader integrative review. RER will occasionally publish solicited, but carefully refereed, analytic reviews of special topics, particularly from disciplines infrequently represented.  The journal is abstracted and indexed in Academic Search Premier, EBSCO databases, Current Contents/Social & Behavioral Sciences, ProQuest Education Journals, PsycINFO, SafetyLit, Scopus, and the Social Sciences Citation Index. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 8.241, ranking it first out of 238 journals in the category "Education & Educational Research".
