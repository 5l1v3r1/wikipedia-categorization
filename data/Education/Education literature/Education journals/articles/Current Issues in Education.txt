Current Issues in Education is a triannual peer-reviewed open access academic journal sponsored by Arizona State University's Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. The journal is run by graduate students and covers all aspects of education. The journal is abstracted and indexed in Scopus.  The journal was established in 1998 by faculty advisers David Berliner, Jim Middleton, and Gene V. Glass (Arizona State University) and editor-in-chief Leslie Poynor.  It ceased operation at the close of 2006 and underwent reorganization in 2007.  Faculty advisors Finbarr Sloane (University of Colorado Boulder) and Sarah Brem (Arizona State University) and then-newly appointed editors Lori Ellingford and Jeffrey Johnson restarted the journal in December 2008.
