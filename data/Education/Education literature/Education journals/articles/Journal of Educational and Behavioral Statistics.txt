The Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics (JEBS) provides an outlet for papers that are original and useful to those applying statistical approaches to problems and issues in educational or behavioral research.

In addition, critical reviews of current practice, tutorial presentations of less well known methods, and novel applications of already-known methods will be published. Papers discussing statistical techniques without specific educational or behavioral interest will have lower priority.
