Kurmancî is a linguistic magazine published twice a year since 1987 to spread the results of the Kurdish Institute's linguistic seminars on problems of terminology and standardisation of the Kurdish language. All issues of this periodical are available on the publisher’s Web site, as is the Kurdish-French-English-Turkish index of the first 20 issues. The name Kurmancî is a Kurdish spelling of the name of the most widely spoken dialect of the Kurdish language, Kurmanji.
