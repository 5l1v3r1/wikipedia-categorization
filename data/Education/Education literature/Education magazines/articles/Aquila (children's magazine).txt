Aquila is an educational children's magazine that offers an alternative to mainstream publications. It is for boys and girls of 8-13 and features puzzles, fun facts and activities - and is advert-free. Each issue revolves mainly around a specific topic, for example Captain Cook, Science Special, The Equator and Medieval Times - all covered in 2013.  The "lively and informative"   magazine is aimed at bright pre-teenagers interested in hobbies beyond pop music and soaps, who "need to be able to feel good about themselves" and to realise that "there are other children out there like them" according to D J Taylor's article in The Telegraph in 2003.  It was established in 1993 and is owned and run by New Leaf Publishing Ltd, a small independent publishing house situated in the coastal town of Eastbourne in the UK.  ATE Superweeks, a UK summer camp provider, works in association with Aquila magazine to run an annual summer camp. In 2012 the camp was called The Eco-Venture and had a focus on the environment.
