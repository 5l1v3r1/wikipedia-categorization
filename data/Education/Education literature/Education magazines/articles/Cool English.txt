Cool English is a monthly English-language educational magazine published in the Russian Federation by Eclectic Publishing Ltd. The magazine was launched in Russia in March 2004 initially as a partner project of Hot English magazine, Spain. Cool English aims to make learning English more fun and interesting through slang, humour and idioms. The magazine also comes with an audio CD and exercise pack. Sales are widespread throughout the Russian Federation, but are mainly concentrated in Moscow and St Petersburg. The founder and General Director of Cool English, William Hackett-Jones, had the inspiration to produce a magazine that made learning English more fun and interesting for students, after finding that far too many teaching and learning resources were mundane and humourless. The magazine was therefore founded in March, 2004 in partnership with Hot English magazine, published in Spain, and was originally called Hot English Magazine, Russia. The magazine changed its name to Cool English in December, 2005. To date, 47 issues have been released. The magazine focuses on modern, spoken English in a fun and easy-to-learn format. Each magazine is accompanied by an audio CD so that readers can also listen to the articles, read by English native speakers, in different accents. Each edition of the magazine also comes with a free downloadable Exercise Pack, which allows readers and teachers to practice what they have been learning. Cool English has sections on slang, dialogues, humour, celebrities, idioms, business, film, travel and music. Cool English has also produced special editions for the group of English First language schools, entitled Cool English for EF.
