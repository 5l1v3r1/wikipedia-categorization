Bibliothécaires Sans Frontières was a charitable organisation based in France which provided books and support for libraries, mostly in the Francophone developing world. It was formed in November 1999. Its first project, in 2000, was a youth library in Niger, followed in 2001 by two school libraries in India and - still ongoing - a project to provide books to a Kurdish refugee camp in Iraq. Two other projects supported a university library in Russia (since 2002) and a youth library in Senegal (since 2005). The organisation may have ceased operation sometime after 2007, when their website was last updated.
