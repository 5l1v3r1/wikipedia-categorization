Friends of Libraries are non-profit, charitable groups formed to support libraries in their communities. The County of Los Angeles Public Library reports having "...77 Friends of the Library groups with over 5,523 members."  Friends of Libraries groups are supported by a division of the American Library Association, called United for Libraries USA. The division was formed in 2009, when "Friends of Libraries U.S.A. (FOLUSA) and the Association for Library Trustees and Advocates (ALTA) joined forces."  Every year, Friends of Libraries groups have their own national week of celebration. It is used to promote and raise awareness of the library's services within the community, and also to promote membership. It also serves as an opportunity for libraries and Boards of Trustees to recognize the Friends for their help and support of the library.  United for Libraries USA provides many resources for Friends of Libraries groups, some of which include the following: Friends of Libraries in the UK can be charities set up to run community libraries,  or volunteers who support a public library by fundraising or arranging events for example.  Sometimes Friends groups are set up to campaign against a potential council closures of libraries or reductions in budgets.
