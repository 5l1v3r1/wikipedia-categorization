Beta Phi Mu (also ΒΦΜ or βφμ) is the international honor society for library & information science and information technology.  Founded by a group of librarians and library educators, the society's express purpose is to recognize and encourage "superior academic achievement" among library and information studies students. Beta Phi Mu now has 39 active chapters in the U.S. and abroad, continues to sponsor various publications and funds several scholarships.  The society's name comes from the initials in the Greek phrase "Bibliothekarios philax mathesis," meaning "the librarian is the guardian of knowledge." Aliis inserviendo consumor serves as the society's motto; translated from the Latin, it means "consumed in the service of others." Members of the society—librarians and other information professionals—dedicate themselves to serving the information needs of individuals, organizations, and communities. A dolphin and anchor, the mark of Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, serves as the society's insignia, appearing on various pins, buttons, and similar memorabilia.  The society's colors, as signified on honor cords, are purple and white. Eligibility for membership in Beta Phi Mu is by invitation of the faculty from an ALA-accredited professional degree program.  Invitations are extended only to individuals who complete the requirements for a master's degree and achieve at least a 3.75 (out of 4.0) GPA; invitations are further limited to a maximum of 25% of any given graduating class. Each eligible candidate must also be recommended for election by the faculty of the candidate’s school. The Beta Phi Mu Award is an annual award to a library school faculty member or to an individual for distinguished service to education for librarianship. The first award was made in 1954 to Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness Dean of the University of Michigan's Library Science Department from 1940 to 1964.
