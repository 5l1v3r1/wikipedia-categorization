Library and Information Science Access Midwest Program (LAMP) is an Institute of Museum and Library Services funded regional network of academic libraries and information science schools working on promoting careers in library and information science.  The program looks for promising undergraduate students at its member institutions to participate in activities and events designed to increase their awareness of the profession.  The program then provides financial and mentoring support for their graduate studies at one of the member schools. LAMP specifically seeks to encourage the participation of students from statistically and historically underrepresented populations in LIS.
