  The Li Ka Shing Foundation (李嘉誠基金會) is a Hong Kong-based charitable organization founded in 1980 by Hong Kong entrepreneur Li Ka-shing. It is the second largest private foundation led by a wealthy individual in the world, after Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  Li Ka-shing considers the Li Ka Shing Foundation to be his "third son" and has pledged to donate one-third of his assets to support philanthropic projects. He has called for other Asian entrepreneurs to do the same, in the hope of altering the traditional notion of passing wealth through lineage. The Li Ka Shing Foundation's story stretches back over three decades: Having grown up witness to suffering and illness, Li Ka-shing cultivated a compassion that set in motion the idea of establishing a charitable foundation. Li Ka Shing Foundation supports projects that promote social progress through expanding access to quality education and medical services and research, encouraging cultural diversity and community involvement. Every project and every donation stems from Li Ka-shing's belief in the inherent value of each human life, regardless of race, class, or circumstance. He has devoted himself to helping others overcome the educational and physical barriers preventing them from achieving their potential. To date, Li Ka Shing Foundation has granted approximately HK$14.5 billion (US$1.86 billion) in charitable donations, approximately 90% in support of education reform initiatives and medical services in Greater China region.
