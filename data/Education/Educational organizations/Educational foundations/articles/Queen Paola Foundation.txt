The Queen Paola Foundation, founded in December 1992, is a Belgian non-profit organization. The foundation was created at the request of Princess Paola of Belgium. The aim of the foundation is to provide support to Belgian organizations which help young people facing problems with re-integration into society, and to support education. The foundation has established the School of Hope programme, in order to support schools located in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The Queen Paola prize to primary education was created in 1997 in order to reward teachers who added value to their profession. Since 1998, the prize is awarded annually, alternating between primary and secondary school teachers.
