The John H. McDonald Journalism Foundation was a Canadian charitable foundation associated with Canadian University Press. The foundation aimed to serve all student journalists in Canada with educational programs and opportunities, regardless of whether they work for a CUP member paper or not. The foundation received donations from newspaper publishing companies and individual journalists, and helped to fund national conferences and the creation of style guides and writing guides.  It also created opportunities for writing positions across the country, and held an annual awards ceremony celebrating student journalism. The foundation also hopes to establish mentorship and internship programs in the future. Most operations that remain, such as the annual John H. McDonald Journalism Awards, have been taken over by the Canadian University Press. The foundation was established February 19, 1987, and named after CUPâ€™s first president, John H. McDonald, an editor of The McGill Daily, who won the position in a coin toss.
