FAAPI  currently has 21 associations of teachers of English from different parts of Argentina. Each organizes a range of local activities such as workshops, conferences, lectures or webinars.  The delegates of the local associations vote during the annual general meeting to form FAAPI’s Board of Directors  Each year one of the regional associations, together with the board of directors organizes an annual three-day conference.
