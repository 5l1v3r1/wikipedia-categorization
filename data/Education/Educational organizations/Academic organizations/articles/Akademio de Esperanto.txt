The Akademio de Esperanto (AdE; English: Academy of Esperanto) is an independent body of language scholars who steward the evolution of the language Esperanto by keeping it consistent with Fundamento de Esperanto in accordance with the Declaration of Boulogne. Modeled somewhat after the Académie française, the Akademio was proposed by L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, at the first World Esperanto Congress, and was founded soon thereafter under the name Lingva Komitato (Language Committee). This Committee had a "superior commission" called the Akademio. In 1948, within the framework of a general reorganization, the Language Committee and the Academy combined to form the Akademio de Esperanto.  The Akademio consists of 45 members and has a president, vice presidents, and a secretary. The corresponding address including e-mail is at the secretary.  It is funded by a subsidy from the Universal Esperanto Association and by donations. Members are elected by their peers for a period of nine years, with elections being held every three years for a third of the members. Following the last elections in February 2016, the Akademio de Esperanto consists of the following members:  Former members have included Gaston Waringhien, Rüdiger Eichholz, Jorge Camacho, Victor Sadler, Michel Duc-Goninaz, and William Auld (president, 1979–1983).
