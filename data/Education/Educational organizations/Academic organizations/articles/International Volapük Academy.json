Tazio Carlevaro set the original hierarchical committee, with Schleyer himself as Leader (<i>cifal</i>) along with the great French Volap\u00fck-pioneer <a href=\"/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs\" title=\"Auguste Kerckhoffs\">Auguste Kerckhoffs</a> as the business guide (or director: <i>dilekel</i>). Seventeen language specialists from twelve countries were elected as first-class academy-members (<i>kademals</i>), and the appointment was envisioned of second-class academy-members (<i>kademels'</i>) and of corresponding academy-members (<i>kademans</i>) totaling 31 members in the academy. The headquarters of the academy was established in Paris.\n</p><p>Schleyer conceded to Kerckhoffs that the organizational form determined in Munich should be considered only as an interim and that defining (or transformation) of the academic structure should be decided in the aftermath of the International Congress which was to be held in Paris in the 1889. In addition, Kerckhoffs received from Schleyer permission to appoint seven of the seventeen <i>kademals</i> of people to be selected by him. The medium of communication of the Academy was circulars from the director (<i>Zulags</i>), as well as Kerckhoffs' own journal <i>Le Volap\u00fck</i>.\n</p><p>Kerckhoffs' grammars published since 1887 differed fundamentally from the Volap\u00fck of Schleyer. With the intention of ending the strife between them, Kerckhoffs organized the third congress of the movement in Paris on 19\u201321 August 1889. This Third International Congress of Volap\u00fck took place in Paris. This Congress passed new statutes of the Academy, according to which the subject of the Academy was to complete and improve the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. However, even before 1889, a conflict arose between Schleyer and Kerckhoffs. Though Schleyer wanted a maximum enrichment of Volap\u00fck and to reform it radically in order to simplify the language, Kerckhoffs managed to remove Schleyer's right of veto within the Academy. Schleyer himself never agreed with this essential limitation of his copyright, and when Kerckhoffs offered to block reform of Volap\u00fck, Schleyer dismissed in its entirety the whole Academy.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Schism\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Schism</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Continuity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Continuity</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Schism\">Schism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Volap%C3%BCk_Academy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Schism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Academy, created under the name <b>Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka</b> (International Academy of Volap\u00fck) at a congress in Munich in August 1887, was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language <a href=\"/wiki/Volap%C3%BCk\" title=\"Volap\u00fck\">Volap\u00fck</a>. Under Rosenberger, who became the Academy\u2019s director in 1892, the group began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. The vocabulary was almost completely replaced by words more closely resembling those used in Western European languages, and a number of grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were discarded. It was understood that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \u201cIdiom Neutral\u201d (which means \u201cthe neutral idiom\u201d or \u201cthe neutral language\u201d). The name of the Academy was changed to Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.\n</p><p>Dictionaries of Idiom Neutral and an outline of the grammar were published in several European languages in 1902 and 1903. The language, sometimes referred to as \u201cNeutral\u201d or \u201cthe Neutral language\u201d by English-speaking writers, created interest among international language enthusiasts at the time. Rosenberger published a periodical in the language called Progres. In 1907 Neutral was one of the projects considered by a committee of scholars which met in Paris to select an international auxiliary language (exactly what the committee actually decided upon is disputed; see Ido and its external links for more information).\n</p><p>In 1908 the Akademi which had created Idiom Neutral effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Latino sine flexione, a simplified form of Latin developed by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. Peano was appointed the director of the Akademi, and its name was changed to Academia pro Interlingua. Peano's language was sometimes called Interlingua, not to be confused with the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\n</p><p>In 1912 Rosenberger published a reformed version of Neutral called Reform-Neutral.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Continuity\">Continuity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=International_Volap%C3%BCk_Academy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Continuity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1890 Schleyer himself chose a new Volap\u00fck Academy, from people completely loyal to him with 49 members; its headquarters was in Konstanz. But it remained essentially inactive, and according to the few reports that have appeared about it in the central organ of <i>Volap\u00fck Volapukabled lezenodik</i> its activities were limited to the approval of the decisions of Schleyer. The new Academy had disappeared in a real sense by 1893.\n</p><p>The shift from Volap\u00fck to Idiom Neutral to Latine Sine Flexione to Interlingua follows the path of interest of a number of people interested in an <a href=\"/wiki/International_auxiliary_language\" title=\"International auxiliary language\">international auxiliary language</a>, but with Idiom Neutral and its name change it simply ceased to be the Volap\u00fck Academy and became something else.\n</p><p>A revived Volap\u00fck Academy per se continues to this day, with <a href=\"/wiki/Brian_R._Bishop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brian R.
