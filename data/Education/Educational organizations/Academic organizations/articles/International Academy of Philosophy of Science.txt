The International Academy for Philosophy of Science (IAPS), also known as the Acad√©mie Internationale de Philosophie des Sciences (AIPS) is an international organization located in Brussels, which promotes fundamental issues of philosophy of science in an open interdisciplinary dialogue. Its members are philosophers of science or leading experts in sciences interested in philosophical questions. The AIPS was created in 1947 by Stanislas Dockx. Among its first members were Bernays, Beth, Bochenski, Bohr, Borel, Brouwer, de Broglie, Destouches, Einstein, Gonseth, Milne, Paulus and Weyl. Since 1949, a long series of colloquia have been organized in Europe but even in North- and South America. The AIPS promotes collaboration between philosophers of science and scientists by the means of annual sessions held in major scientific centers. The proceedings are published in French and/or English. The subjects of the meetings are decided by the General Assembly. Members are co-opted on the basis of proposals by full members. The currently over one hundred members come from nearly 25 countries.
