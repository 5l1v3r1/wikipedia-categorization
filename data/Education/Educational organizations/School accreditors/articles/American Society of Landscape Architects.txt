The group was founded on January 4, 1899, to "establish landscape architecture as a recognized profession in North America", "develop educational studies in landscape architecture", and "provide a voice of authority in the 'New Profession'".  A green roof, which covers 3,000 square feet (280Â m2) on the top of the ASLA headquarters, is to be[when?] honoured by Green Roofs for Healthy Cities (GRHC) in the 'Institutional Intensive' category, which honours innovative green roof design in North America, including the countries of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.[clarification needed]  On an annual basis, The American Society of Landscape Architecture gives various awards to professionals and students for design as well as constructed projects in many different categories. These categories range in size, scale and type from small residential areas to large multi acre parks and waterfronts.
