The Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria is the body which supervises Israeli universities and colleges in the West Bank. Its authority in the West Bank is similar to that of the Council for Higher Education in Israel in Israel proper. As Israeli law does not apply in the occupied West Bank, the Council for Higher Education in Israel has no legal standing there, so by a military decree a similar institution was formed in the West Bank to regulate the Israeli institutions of higher learning there. The Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria only applies to Israeli institutions and not to Palestinian institutions which also exist in the West Bank.
