The Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) is a private, non-profit organization in the United States that provides accreditation to private post-secondary educational institutions. It is recognized by the United States Department of Education as an independent accrediting agency.  Established in 1965,  it is based in Arlington, Virginia. The U.S. Department of Education identifies the scope of ACCSC recognition as the accreditation of private post-secondary institutions offering non-degree programs or associate, bachelorâ€™s and master's degrees in programs that are "predominantly organized to educate students for occupational, trade and technical careers, and institutions that offer programs via distance education."  As of 2010, ACCSC reported that it extended accreditation to 789 schools with a combined enrollment of more than 250,000 students.  The commission's diligence was called into question when it was revealed that the University of Northern New Jersey, which was accredited by the commission, never actually offered any classes. Instead, it was a front organization used by federal investigators to trap criminals engaged in student visa fraud. It is unclear how such an institution was able to meet credible accreditation standards .
