The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) is an independent agency created in 1970 by the Ryan Act and is the oldest of the autonomous state standards boards in the nation. In the capacity of P-12 public school education, the CTC is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and accrediting the programs that offer it, licensing educators, and, when necessary, disciplining license holders. The website has a searchable database for California teachers' credentials.  The commission operates out of Sacramento, CA. The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing consists of nineteen members: fifteen voting members and four ex officio, non-voting members. The Governor appoints fourteen voting Commissioners and the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction or his/her designee serves as the fifteenth voting member. The four ex officio members are selected one each by the major elements of the California higher education constituency: Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities; Regents of the University of California; the California State University; and California Community College Chancellor's Office. The current Governor-appointed Commissioners consist of six classroom teachers, one school administrator, one school board member, one school counselor or services credential holder, one higher education faculty member from an institution for teacher education, and four public members.  Governor-appointed Commissioners are typically appointed to four-year terms, and serve as volunteers in unpaid positions.
