On April 13, 1787, the legislature enacted a law that allowed individual educational institutions to have their own trustees and gave the Regents broader responsibilities for overseeing education in New York. The new law empowered the Regents to \"visit and inspect all the colleges, academies, and schools\" in the state, award higher <a href=\"/wiki/Academic_degree\" title=\"Academic degree\">academic degrees</a>, hold and distribute funds, and exercise other powers of a <a href=\"/wiki/Corporation\" title=\"Corporation\">corporation</a>.\n</p><p>Early in the 19th century, the Regents established standards for incorporating private academies and colleges, including specifying the texts or subjects that academies must teach to qualify for state aid. Aid was restricted to those students who had passed local entrance examinations. To combat the problem of academies lowering their standards in order to attract students and get state aid, during the later nineteenth century the Regents developed and instituted educational standards for <a href=\"/wiki/High_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school\">high schools</a> statewide, through use of the <a href=\"/wiki/Regents_examinations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Regents examinations\">Regents examinations</a> and syllabi.\n</p><p>The legislature gave the Regents responsibility for the <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_State_Library\" title=\"New York State Library\">New York State Library</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_State_Museum\" title=\"New York State Museum\">New York State Museum</a> in 1844 and 1845, respectively, and in 1889 and 1892 expanded the USNY's responsibilities significantly to include the incorporation and supervision of all libraries, museums, <a href=\"/wiki/Correspondence_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Correspondence school\">correspondence schools</a>, and other educational institutions. An 1872 statute authorized the Regents to appoint examining and licensing boards in the state's <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_school\" title=\"Medical school\">medical schools</a>, and in 1890 the Regents were given the exclusive power to license <a href=\"/wiki/Physician\" title=\"Physician\">physicians</a>. Also starting in 1890, the Secretary to the Board of Regents &#8211; then <a href=\"/wiki/Melvil_Dewey\" title=\"Melvil Dewey\">Melvil Dewey</a>, also head of the State Library &#8211; supervised full-time inspectors of secondary schools, libraries, colleges, and other institutions reporting to the Regents. Starting in 1910 private trade schools were required to be licensed and inspected, and in 1923 licensing requirements were extended to correspondence schools operating in the state.\n</p><p>In 1948, New York State established a system of support organizations known as <a href=\"/wiki/Boards_of_Cooperative_Educational_Services\" title=\"Boards of Cooperative Educational Services\">Boards of Cooperative Educational Services</a> (BOCES) across the state. The head of each BOCES, known as the District Superintendent, acts as the New York State Commissioner of Education's, and by extension, the Chancellor of the Board of Regents', field representative.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regents_College\">Regents College</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_the_State_of_New_York&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Regents College\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Excelsior_College\" title=\"Excelsior College\">Excelsior College</a></div>\n<p>A key former initiative of the Board of Regents, created to better bring <a href=\"/wiki/Higher_education\" title=\"Higher education\">higher education</a> to New York State's nontraditional adult learners, was the Board of Regents' <i>Regents External Degree Program</i>, or REX, which became Regents College in 1984 and then the separate and independent <a href=\"/wiki/Excelsior_College\" title=\"Excelsior College\">Excelsior College</a> in 1998&#8211;2001. This program was an outgrowth of the practice of giving <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> veterans school and college credit in recognition of their military education and experience. In 1963 the Regents introduced College Proficiency Examinations, now called Excelsior College Examinations (ECEs), initially to help <a href=\"/wiki/Teacher\" title=\"Teacher\">teachers</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Nurse\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nurse\">nurses</a> complete educational requirements. First named the \"Regents External Degree Program,\" it was established in 1971 with financial support from the <a href=\"/wiki/Ford_Foundation\" title=\"Ford Foundation\">Ford</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Carnegie_Corporation_of_New_York\" title=\"Carnegie Corporation of New York\">Carnegie Foundations</a>. Degrees could be granted based on a combination of college proficiency exams and classroom and correspondence courses, or on a variety of exams alone. The first degrees were conferred in 1972. This program became independent of the Education Department in 1991 but continued to be governed by the Board of Regents until 1998 when it fully separated from the Board of Regents to become a private, independent college. The school, prohibited by the terms of its \"independence\" agreement from continuing to use the name Regents College, adopted the name Excelsior College in 2001. Excelsior College is now a constituent member of USNY in the same way, and only the same way, that other colleges and universities in New York State are. Like them, it has its own charter and Board of Trustees.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_structure_and_functions\">Current structure and functions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=University_of_the_State_of_New_York&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Current structure and functions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Board_of_Regents_of_the_University_of_the_State_of_New_York\" title=\"Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York\">Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York</a> oversees USNY.
