 Overseas Sri Lankan Muslim Educational Trust or OSMET is an educational charity inaugurated in 1981 to provide higher education scholarships to under-privileged Sri Lankan Muslims  in the fields of science, IT, engineering and medicine.  To date OSMET has been able to assist over 600 students in one form or another. Their goal is to become one of the premier scholarship funds in Sri Lanka. OSMET is a UK registered charity and also registered in Sri Lanka as a recognised charity.  Presently 95 students with the help of OSMET grants are following courses in schools and universities in Sri Lanka. Twenty-eight students successfully completed their University degrees and twenty students completed their GCE Advanced levels. Well over 600 students have benefited through our assistance in one form or other OSMET's philosophy is very simple: it aims to provide long-term solutions to poor Muslim students. It believes that youngsters donâ€™t want to live on handouts; they just want to earn a living and a chance to work their own way out of poverty, to lead independent lives and to help their families.
