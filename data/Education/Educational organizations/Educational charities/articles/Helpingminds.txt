Helping Minds is a group of about 200 volunteers, rendering academic and financial aid to rural poor students in Tamil Nadu, helping scores to pursue engineering, medical and polytechnic courses. Every month, each member contributes a minimum of Rs 100, with proceeds donated to deserving poor students. The trust extends financial help to students identified and validated by the members. Those having consistently very good academic records and hailing from poor families are given priority. Their assistance has helped scores of students pursue engineering, medicine, polytechnic, paramedical and other job-oriented courses. The beneficiaries have now settled in top jobs, members said. During the past three years, the trust has donated around Rs 5.5 lakh to over 40 students, in addition to developing infrastructure in about ten government schools. Helping Minds Trust was awarded 'Unsung Heroes' award by PrimePoint Foundation, a city based NGO.
