In 1950s Vellanad was a remote village and there was only one government institution at Vellanad that was Government High School. He started his work by providing supplementary education for the students of nearby schools after school hours. Those class were very informal since  he aimed for a total development in children. As it became a huge success he converted it into a  Malayalam medium school. Now it known as the <i>Mitraniketan Vikas Bhavan School</i>(Primary &amp; Secondary).The greatest challenge he faced at that time was the scarcity of students for a regular schooling. Parents of neighboring children were not ready to send their children for an experiment. but Viswanathan was not ready to loose is faith, he moved some northern districts of Kerala where there are huge number of tribal population. He met them, talked with them, stayed with them.. at last they came forward to send their children with him.Mitraniketan Vikasbhavan school is not a regular school, it aims for developing active citizenship among the students by developing their innate potentials.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Location\">Location</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mitraniketan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Location\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Main campus</b> of Mitraniketan is situated near <a href=\"/wiki/Vellanad\" title=\"Vellanad\">Vellanad</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram\" title=\"Thiruvananthapuram\">Thiruvananthapuram</a> district, state of <a href=\"/wiki/Kerala\" title=\"Kerala\">Kerala</a>, South India.\n</p><p><b>City Center</b> a liaison office, situated at West Fort near Thiruvananthapuram City, Kerala.\n</p><p><b>Education Extension Center</b> situated at <a href=\"/wiki/Wayanad\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wayanad\">Wayanad</a> district of Kerala State.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"About_Mitraniketan\">About Mitraniketan</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mitraniketan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: About Mitraniketan\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Mitraniketan is a 500-member community, including a staff of about 100 men and women.
