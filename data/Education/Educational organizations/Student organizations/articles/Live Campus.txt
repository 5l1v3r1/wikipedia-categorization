Live Campus is a student-led fundraising initiative, benefiting non-governmental organizations working to eradicate extreme poverty. Its main fundraising model will be a series of concerts hosted by student run organizations on a designated weekend. Live Campus is an official initiative of the Millennium Campus Network. Live Campus 09 will be the inaugural event of Live Campus over the weekend of April 3, 2009. There are currently projected to be 23 participating schools. In anticipation of the series of benefit concerts, LiveCampus.org will act as a networking platform for students and concert coordinators. As an option to concert coordinators, LiveCampus.org can serve as a pledge tracker for their concert. Students can register at the site, and record their pledges for concerts they are attending. Students also have the option of recording pledges in teams.
