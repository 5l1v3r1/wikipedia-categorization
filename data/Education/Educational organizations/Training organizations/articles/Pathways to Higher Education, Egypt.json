The main objectives of PHE/EG is to enhance the skills of socially disadvantaged (underprivileged) groups among the university students and graduates, focusing on students and graduates of <a href=\"/wiki/Humanities\" title=\"Humanities\">humanities</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Social_sciences\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social sciences\">social sciences</a> specializations preserving gender equal opportunity, with a primary view to improving their chances of access to <a href=\"/wiki/Postgraduate_studies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Postgraduate studies\">postgraduate studies</a>, enhancing their prospects to benefit from any scholarships programs, and/or maximizing their potential for acquiring better employment opportunities. These developmental issues are in-line with the overall objectives and reform strategy of the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) that is being implemented in phases by the  <a href=\"/wiki/Project_management\" title=\"Project management\">Projects Management</a> Unit (PMU/MOHE).\nTo achieve an effective outreach, CAPSCU established <a href=\"/wiki/Partnership\" title=\"Partnership\">partnerships</a> with counterpart <a href=\"/wiki/Stakeholder_(project)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stakeholder (project)\">stakeholders</a> concerned with skills-oriented human resources capacity building.  One of the partners is the Social Fund for Development (SFD)] a government funding mechanism that provides support for graduates to start their own businesses.

ERS program was implemented for three years (2003\u20132005), and DTMS program was implemented only in each winter and summer since 2006 (winter is a short period of time, two weeks of mid-year holiday; summer vacation is almost 3 months).\n</p><p>Moreover, the project publications became 39 books used as educational training material.  Several pilot attempts to introduce some of the skills-oriented training into the regular undergraduate programs in the participating universities were successfully implemented.  The PHE steering committee including Presidents of the 10 participating universities out of the 18 public universities existing in Egypt, agreed to consider this issue a priority in their universities and to bring it to the attention of the Supreme Council of Universities (SCU), in line with the MOHE directives to reform higher education in Egypt.\n</p><p>The project established TOT programs to create a network of trainers, authors, monitors, evaluators, consultants, coordinators and administrative staff all over Egypt totaling 888 persons/experts.  The project extended its activities to include 13 different governorates each of them has its own training facilities.  Pathways websites help the underrepresented population in remote areas to access the training materials through the Internet.  Free access of all Pathways training material, publications and reports are hosted in www.pathways.cu.edu.e.g. website in the training publications sub-menu.  Another website was established as a central platform for trainees\u2019 activities and communications <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pathways-news.com/\">(www.Pathways-news.com).</a> Decentralized websites dedicated for PHE/EG were also established in each participating public university and linked in a network with the central website.\n</p><p>Strengthening capacity, core and democratic values between the trainees are among the by-products of the PHE training program.  These values help trainees to develop their personalities, human rights capacities, increase their self-esteem, accept opinions of others, etc., through activities that encourage trainees to; elect a class coordinator through free election, evaluation of trainers, training venue, training facilities and PHE/EG management team, as well as self and peer assessment (the feedback is analyzed and continual development and amendment takes place).  In addition, trainees are allowed to select the training approach that meets their needs (managerial, behavioral or knowledge), to suggest topics for the general lectures delivered during the training program (becomes part of a database for topics from which the general lectures are chosen), to organize some social activities together, and to plan and implement the final full-day ceremonial workshop that takes place at the end of each training program, with individual and/or group contributions of trainees to reflect critically on the outcome of their training.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Funding_of_the_PHE.2FEG\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Funding_of_the_PHE/EG\">Funding of the PHE/EG</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Pathways_to_Higher_Education,_Egypt&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Funding of the PHE/EG\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The PHE/EG project is funded in three phases with an aggregate budget of 3.91 million US$.

Phase-II of the PHE/EG implementation was prolonged to three and half years with a budget 1.2 million US$ from Ford Foundation because of the cost-sharing policy adopted by the PHE/EG Steering Committee to have universities share 50% of the direct training cost, reaching an aggregate of 1.5 million L.E., including contributions from project partners SFD and NCW, in a transition to have universities bear the total cost of training after the termination of project funds (a sustainability challenge).

In order to enhance the skills and employment chances of graduates on the national, regional and global levels, and to provide a scalable pilot that can be mainstreamed to reform English language instruction in Egyptian universities and higher education institutions, the program offered is aligned with the internationally recognized <a href=\"/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages\" title=\"Common European Framework of Reference for Languages\">Common European Framework (CEFR)</a> as the underlying framework for the graduates to become internationally certifiable.</li>\n<li>Phase-III will also witness the development and implementation of a new soft skills-oriented training program to promote entrepreneurial skills and human rights among students and graduates with the objective to enhance/change their mind-set towards the concept of creating job opportunities for themselves, injecting calculated risk-taking concepts, innovative and creative thinking, and furthering the limited government capacity to provide sufficient employment opportunities for the graduates, and the human resource capital at large.</li>\n<li>By the end of Phase-III, the sustainability of PHE/EG will be secured in all Egyptian public universities participating in the project through their ownership of the training infrastructure already established by PHE/EG (internationally certified training materials, critical mass of TOTs, human resources trained, assessment and evaluation mechanisms at all levels, fully integrated PHE/EG website containing relevant databases, online admissions, assessment mechanisms, procedures and guidelines, all networked with the corresponding websites developed in every public university, etc.). The implementation of PHE/EG in all Egyptian universities over the past eight years, and the involvement of their leadership in the Steering Committee of the project, led to their commitment to continue supporting the project implementation in their respective universities, utilizing the well-established infrastructure and nurturing its continued development and improvement to keep offering their students the soft skills-oriented training needed to support Egypt\u2019s human resources development strategy.</li>\n<li>Pathways Training Programs:Pathways established and developed training material for 25 training programs; these include books, power point presentations or trainee/trainer manuals.
