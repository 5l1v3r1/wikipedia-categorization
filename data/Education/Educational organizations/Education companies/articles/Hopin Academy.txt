Hopin Academy is a for-profit educational organization based in Tamale, Ghana that is open to anyone.  Open 24 hours a day, Hopin Academy derives its name from its educational philosophy as a school designed for students to â€œhop in and hop out," rather than having strictly organized timetable structures.  The school specializes in training in online marketing, social media communication, writing, video production, entrepreneurial work and web communications.   Hopin Academy has established an international academic partnership with Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College  through the BiCo-Dalun Summer Action Research Fellowship, a learning program fostered in 2010 where Bryn Mawr and Haverford students create community projects with Ghanaian partners.   According to the Hopin Academy website, Hopin Academy offers courses in writing, design, film, and entrepreneurial work.  Hopin Academy also provides training to NGOs, government organizations, and other schools, such as the Olive School of Journalism.   Hopin Academy was started in 2010 as a social enterprise that aimed to be an alternative to the Ghanaian public education system.   The educational initiative was co-founded by a Ghanaian entrepreneur,  MacCarthy M. Mac-Gbathy and the Danish film maker and Harvard-trained "innovator," Anders Midtgaard.      In addition to offering courses and technological resources, Hopin Academy supports Barcamp Tamale, which is a networking forum hosted in Tamale that connects Ghanaian leaders and innovators with young people.  Hopin Academy also supports the Youth Speak Up Project, which is a Ghanaian advocacy program that aims to empower youth through technology education.  Hopin Academy has collaborated with other educational institutions in the international community, including:
