The Dutch Museum Association (Dutch: De Museumvereniging) is an association of museums in the Netherlands. Over five hundred museums are affiliated with the association. In 1926, the Museumvereniging was established as a meeting of museum directors in the Netherlands. In 2003, the Museumkaart foundation was integrated into the Dutch Museum Association organisation. In 2006, the Museumvereniging became an umbrella organisation for the Dutch museums organised into ten subject-specific areas. The Association of National Museums, for example, is included within the Museumvereniging umbrella. Irene Asscher-Vonk is the first president of the Museumvereniging. De Museumvereniging focuses on advocacy and professional development of its members and promotes museum visits. It facilitates the Stichting Museumregister Nederland (English: the Dutch Museum Register), which facilitates recognition of the status of these museums. The Dutch Museum Association also facilitates the Ethical Code Commission for Museums.  Additionally, the Dutch Museum Association is responsible for the Foundation of the Museumkaart. Approximately 400 of the 500 Dutch Museum Association members are participants in the Museumkaart Foundation, meaning that they accept the Museumkaart.  The Dutch Museum Association also organises the Dutch Museumweekend. Amsterdam  Many of the museums in Amsterdam are members of the Dutch Museum Association as well as the Official Museums of Amsterdam. Additionally, many of these museums are involved in the Museumkaart initiative of the Dutch Museum Association. Association of state monuments: http://www.derijksmusea.nl/
