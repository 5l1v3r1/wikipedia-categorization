The Museum of New Mexico is a system of museums, historic sites, the Laboratory of Anthropology, the Office of Archaeological Services, the Museum of New Mexico Press, and archaeological collections governed by the State of New Mexico.   The Museum of New Mexico was established on February 19, 1909 by the New Mexico Territorial legislature. This pre-statehood legislation mandated that the Museum of New Mexico be housed in the historic Palace of the Governors. An unusual arrangement existed with the privately-funded School of American Archaeology in which the School was allowed to occupy the Palace of the Governors free of rent and the Director of the School would serve as the Director of the Museum.  This arrangement lasted until Governor John Burroughs signed a bill on April 2, 1959 forcing the School of American Research to leave state property and the Board of Regents. Over the years, the Museum of New Mexico grew to include the New Mexico Museum of Art, Laboratory of Anthropology, Museum of International Folk Art and the historic sites of Coronado, Fort Selden, Bosque Redondo Memorial at Fort Sumner, JÃ©mez, Lincoln, and El Camino Real Historic Trail Site.  The Museum of New Mexico has been reorganized several times, most recently in 2004 when Governor Bill Richardson created the Department of Cultural Affairs.
