The Museums Computer Group (MCG) is a British group which provides a forum for discussion between museum, gallery, archive, and higher education professionals who work with computers and new technologies. The group meets at different museums throughout the United Kingdom. The organization is run by a committee with a chair, secretary and treasurer. The MCG provides a forum for debate and a source of practical help through the possibilities it provides. The MCG organizes the annual United Kingdom Museums on the Web  conference, aimed at museum website managers and those working with web content in museums.
