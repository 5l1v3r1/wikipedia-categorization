 The Networks of Mediterranean Youth (NET-MED Youth) project is a three-year project (2014-2017) implemented by UNESCO and funded by the European Union. It aims at mainstreaming youth issues and priorities across national decision-making and policy implementation in eastern and western Mediterranean countries by building the capacities of youth and youth organizations and promoting their active engagement in the development and implementation of national policies and strategies on youth, ensuring that youth issues are adequately covered by national and regional media and by identifying workable models for improving youth access to employment and youth inclusion in different sectors. Networks of Mediterranean Youth (NET-MED Youth) aims at building the capacities of youth organizations, enhancing networking among them, increasing youth’s contribution to the development and revision of public policies on youth, fostering youth’s effective interaction with the media and their use of ICT-enabled platforms, strengthening youth organizations’ capacities through their active participation in dialogue with national stakeholders around employment and skills development policies, and supporting national stakeholders in developing new tools for evidence-based prospective policy planning. The project came as a response to the common challenges shared by Southern Mediterranean countries related to the social inclusion of youth. These include, among others, disinterest in civic engagement; insufficient representation in public and political spheres, as well as in mainstream media; high unemployment and a particularly weak participation of women in the labour market.
