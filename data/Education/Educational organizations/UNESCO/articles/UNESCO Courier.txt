The UNESCO Courier is the main magazine published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Of all the journals published by the United Nations and its specialized institutions, The UNESCO Courier has always occupied first place for the number of its readers and the range of its audience, said in 1988 the American journalist Sandy Koffler, The Courier's founder and first editor-in-chief.  UNESCO Courier was started in 1948.  The magazine has changed a great deal over the years, both in content and in form. But it pursues its original mission: promote UNESCOâ€™s ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate. The printed UNESCO Courier enjoys admiration of its loyal readers for decades, for its high journalistic standards and open-minded approach toward universal issues of literacy, human rights, environment, culture, science and arts. Available on line since March 2006,  The UNESCO Courier serves readers scattered around the world: it is on PDF in the six official languages of the Organization (English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Chinese). A limited number of printed issues are also produced. The magazine is nowadays translated in Sardinian and Esperanto.   Projects also exist to translate the magazine into other languages.
