ORBICOM is the international network of UNESCO chairs in communications. At the 1989 General Conference, UNESCO adopted the New Communications strategy, from which Orbicom's mandate derives.  Orbicom was created in 1994 by UNESCO and the Université du Québec à Montréal.  Orbicom has 250 associate members and 30 UNESCO Chairs.  Its members come from 25 countries and work in academia, private industry, and as policy consultants.  Their mission is to foster growth and spread of expertise in communications technologies through education, research, publications, and internship and exchange programs for both instructors and students.  Orbicom-UNESCO has proposed a standard to measure the Digital Divide, called Infostate.
