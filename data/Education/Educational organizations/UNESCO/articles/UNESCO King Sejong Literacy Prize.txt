The UNESCO King Sejong Literacy Prize is an annual prize awarded to two institutions, organizations or individuals "for their contribution to the fight against illiteracy." It is funded by the Government of the Republic of Korea which first offered the Prize in 1989, honouring the outstanding contribution made to literacy by Sejong the Great who created the Korean alphabet Hangul. The Prize specialises from other UNESCO Literacy Prizes that "it gives special consideration to the development and use of mother-tongue literacy education and training." Each award consists of a sum of US $20,000, a silver medal and a certificate.
