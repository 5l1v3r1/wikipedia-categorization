It was formed in the latter part of 1994 through a Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and UNESCO. The Centre is commissioned to undertake the following functions:\n</p>\n<ul><li>promote international research and development of methods and techniques of rural education;</li>\n<li>promote consultation and cooperation among Member States by devising policies and strategies in the areas of human resource development for rural areas;</li>\n<li>create a wide network for exchange of academic and technical information in the field of rural education among experts in various countries;</li>\n<li>coordinate the cooperative research activities and provide facilities for laboratory research and field work to international experts;</li>\n<li>organize international training workshops, seminars on special subjects and provide fellowships to international researchers;</li>\n<li>produce and disseminate publications and materials on the results of the various research projects undertaken by the Centre.</li></ul>\n<p>The overall planning and execution of programmes and activities of the Centre are supervised, monitored and evaluated by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China through its National Commission for UNESCO, in co-operation with UNESCO through their Cluster Office in Beijing.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/World_Education_Forum\" title=\"World Education Forum\">World Education Forum</a> held in <a href=\"/wiki/Dakar\" title=\"Dakar\">Dakar</a> in April 2000 reaffirmed the critical role education plays for poverty reduction (UNESCO, 2000). Programmes and activities organised by INRULED during the last ten years reflect clearly its fundamental emphasis on the development of better understanding of education, which is a key tool for reducing <a href=\"/wiki/Poverty\" title=\"Poverty\">poverty</a> and improving the lives of rural people, particularly of people who live in the <a href=\"/wiki/Developing_country\" title=\"Developing country\">developing</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Least_developed_countries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Least developed countries\">least developed countries</a>. \n</p><p>Over the years INRULED has initiated and facilitated a wide range of programmes and activities focused on rural education which have direct bearing on rural development and poverty reduction with linkages to the mid-term and biennium programmes of UNESCO in <a href=\"/wiki/Literacy\" title=\"Literacy\">literacy</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Continuing_education\" title=\"Continuing education\">continuing education</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_education\" title=\"Primary education\">primary education</a> within the broader framework of <a href=\"/wiki/Education-for-All\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Education-for-All\">Education-for-All</a> (EFA).  INRULED is inclusive in these programmes and activities in that it has involved practitioners and specialists from around the World with particular emphasis on South-South participation and collaboration. The products and outcomes of these activities are significant and have resulted in many valuable publications (paper and electronic) and informal networking of a wide range of institutions and professionals whose work focus on development of education in rural areas in developing countries.\n</p><p>Since its inception, three International Advisory Board Meetings were convened and three external evaluation missions were mounted (1999, 2001 and 2003).
