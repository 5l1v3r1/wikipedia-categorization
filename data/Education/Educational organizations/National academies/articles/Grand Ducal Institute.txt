Grand Ducal Institute (French: Institut Grand-Ducal) is the national academy of Luxembourg, and is based in Luxembourg City in the south of the country. The Institute incorporates six subsections, each dedicated to a separate field of academic research: The "Royal Grand Ducal Institute" was created on 24 October 1868 from the merger of three organisations, the Société archéologique, the Société des sciences naturelles and the Société des sciences médicales.  The Royal Grand Ducal Institute was divided into three sections: After William III's death in 1890, the Royal Grand Ducal Institute became the Grand Ducal Institute. The Société luxembourgeoise d'études linguistiques et dialectologiques à Luxembourg became the fourth Institute section in 1935, the Section de linguistique, de folklore et de toponymie. In 1962, a fifth was added, the Section des arts et lettres. The sixth was added in 1966: the Section des sciences morales et politiques.
