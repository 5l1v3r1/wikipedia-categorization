The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences (GAAS) is an arts and science institution of Ghana, based in the capital Accra. It was founded in November 1959 by Kwame Nkrumah with the aim to promote the pursuit, advancement and dissemination of knowledge in all branches of the sciences and the humanities.  The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences began its life as the Ghana Academy of Learning,  and was formally opened on 27 November 1959 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, at the Great Hall of the University College of Ghana, who became its first president along with Nkrumah. It was merged with the National Research Council in 1963 to become the Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1968 it was again split into (a) The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is a purely learned society, and (b) The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which undertakes research of an applied nature related to national needs.  The mission of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences is to encourage the creation, acquisition, dissemination and utilization of knowledge for national development through the promotion of learning.
