The National Socialist Teachers League (German: Nationalsozialistische Lehrerbund, NSLB), was established on 21 April 1929.  Its original name was the Organization of National Socialist Educators.  Its founder and first leader was former schoolteacher and Bayreuth Gauleiter Hans Schemm.  The organization was based in Bayreuth at the House of German Education. On October 27, 1938 the NSLB opened its own Realschule for teacher training in Bayreuth.  After Schemm's death in 1935, the new leader, or Reichswalter, was Fritz WÃ¤chtler.  This organization saw itself as "the common effort of all persons who saw themselves as teachers or wanted to be seen as educators, independently from background or education and from the type of educational institution". Its goal was to make the National Socialist worldview and foundation of all education and especially of schooling. In order to achieve this it sought to have an effect on the political viewpoint of educators, insisting on the further development of their spirit along Nationalsocialist lines. Organized mountain excursions in places called Reichsaustauschlager (Exchange Camps of the Reich) were perceived as helping in this purpose. The organization was dissolved in 1943 by the financial administration of the NSDAP.
