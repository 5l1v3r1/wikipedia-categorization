ABTA is one, although not the only, teachers and non-teaching staff's wing which is predominantly  run by teachers or non-teaching staff of the Government Sponsored/aided schools who are either members or supporters of Communist Party of India (Marxist), though it is not directly affiliated to CPI(M). There are many members of this organization who are not in the same political league as CPI(M), still they become member because it is by far the largest Teacher's Body of West Bengal. Though not many, but some of the members of ABTA are from Privately managed schools also. ABTA is by far the largest teachers organization in the state.It was established in 1921. Acharya Prfulla Chandra Roy was the president of the Association at the initial stage. Present Secretary of A.B.T.A. is Utpal Roy (as of June 2012). Number of members in the government and govt-aided schools of West Bengal are not less than 1,40,000.This amounts to 70 per cent of the total teachers of the state(i.e.west Bengal)
