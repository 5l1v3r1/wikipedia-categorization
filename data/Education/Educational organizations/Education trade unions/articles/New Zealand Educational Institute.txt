The New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI, in Maori: Te Riu Roa) is the largest education trade union in New Zealand. It was founded in 1883 and has a membership of 50,000.  The NZEI was founded by a merger of district institutes of teachers in 1883  at a meeting in Christchurch. It quickly became the nationwide voice of primary school teachers. Since the 1994 merger with the Combined Early Childhood Union of Aotearoa (CECUA) it has also represented teachers in early childhood centres. Since the major New Zealand employment law changes in the 1980s and 1990s,  the NZEI  negotiates the more than twenty collective agreements across the two sectors, including principals, teachers, support staff, te reo Maori immersion staff and Ministerial staff.  Due to the relatively fragmented history and nature of early childhood education in New Zealand, the largest number of collective agreements negotiated by the NZEI are in this sector.  Primary staff and principals are on separate collective agreements, with separate agreements for area (rural) staff and principals, but these are negotiated together.   The NZEI has struck four times since it was founded in 1883.  In 1991 members struck (unsuccessfully) as part of wider industrial and union action against the Employment Contracts Act 1991,  which lead to significant changes in New Zealand employment relations.  Members struck in 1994 and 1995 to successfully achieve pay parity with the Post Primary Teachers' Association,  their colleagues in secondary schooling. This related pay scales to the teachers' qualifications.  Members struck in 2018 as part of the negotiation round with the Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand. Rallies and marches were held in the major cities.
