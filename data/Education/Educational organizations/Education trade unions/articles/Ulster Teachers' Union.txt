The Ulster Teachers' Union is a trade union based in Northern Ireland, whose membership comprises nursery, primary, and secondary school teachers and school leaders working in the state sector. It has 6,429 members.  The UTU has close links with the Irish National Teachers Organisation, Educational Institute of Scotland and the National Education Union formerly the National Union of Teachers. The union was founded in 1919 and for many years identified strongly with the United Kingdom, therefore not affiliating with the Irish Trades Union Congress.  For many years the largest teaching union in Northern Ireland, from the 1970s it lost members to the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.
