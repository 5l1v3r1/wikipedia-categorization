Chester E Groth Music Company was founded in 1939 in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota by professional musician Chester E. Groth.  Prior to opening Groth Music, he was a cornetist in the United States Navy Band, and he also performed under the direction of John Philip Sousa.  In addition to importing and selling musical instruments, music lessons were provided by Mr. Groth and his staff. Groth's daughter Nancy Groth-Kersten assumed ownership of the company in 1985 when it moved to Bloomington, Minnesota.   In 2013, Groth Music acquired Music Products Inc. from Elmhurst, Illinois, expanding its nationwide service to school music programs.  In 2014 the company acquired Eble Music Company from Iowa City, Iowa, which expanded Groth Music's printed music division.
