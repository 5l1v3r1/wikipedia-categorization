The centre is envisioned as a base from which to carry out interdisciplinary research in such fields as <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_music\" title=\"Computer music\">computer music</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Electroacoustic_music\" title=\"Electroacoustic music\">electroacoustic music</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Interactive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Interactive\">interactive</a> systems, <a href=\"/wiki/Multimedia\" title=\"Multimedia\">multimedia</a>, including <a href=\"/wiki/Dance\" title=\"Dance\">dance</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Visual_arts\" title=\"Visual arts\">visual arts</a> etc., as well as a centre for the development and creation of innovative programs, technical devices and techniques. \n</p><p>From the start the Theremin Center was intended to operate on a non-profit basis and most services and equipment were donated by the founders and sponsors of the Theremin Center. Professor <a href=\"/wiki/Jon_Appleton\" title=\"Jon Appleton\">Jon Appleton</a> founded the International Advisory Board and helped in developing the Theremin Center and establishing continuous relationships within the international musical and scientific communities. The <a href=\"/wiki/Moscow_State_Conservatory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Moscow State Conservatory\">Moscow State Conservatory</a> has provided space. It was a part of the Sound Recording and Musical Acoustics Laboratory - the place where in the 1960s <a href=\"/wiki/Leon_Theremin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leon Theremin\">Leon Theremin</a> was conducting his research. Since 2005, the Theremin Center has been a part of the Electroacoustic Center at Moscow State Conservatory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"People\">People</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theremin_Center&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: People\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Director of the Theremin Center: Andrey Smirnov</li>\n<li>Studio board: Andrey Smirnov, Lidia Kavina, Elisabeth Schimana</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theremin_Center&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Teen_Age_Message#Theremin_concert\" title=\"Teen Age Message\">Teen Age Message#Theremin concert</a> by Theremin Center performers <a href=\"/wiki/Lydia_Kavina\" title=\"Lydia Kavina\">Lydia Kavina</a>, Yana Aksenova, and Anton Kerchenko for a series of interstellar radio transmissions sent to six star systems in 2001</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Theremin_Center&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: External links\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://theremin.ru\">http://theremin.ru</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2223\nCached time: 20180916003400\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:17127963-0!canonical and timestamp 20180916003400 and revision id 827541851\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Music_education_organizations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Theremins"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Music_organizations_based_in_Russia"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Computer music"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Dance"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Electroacoustic music"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Interactive"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Jon Appleton"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Leon Theremin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Lydia Kavina"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Moscow"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Moscow State Conservatory"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Multimedia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Russia"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Teen Age Message"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Theremin"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Visual arts"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://theremin.ru"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"People","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"Theremin_Center","byteoffset":1555,"anchor":"People"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"See also","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"Theremin_Center","byteoffset":1682,"anchor":"See_also"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"External links","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"Theremin_Center","byteoffset":1903,"anchor":"External_links"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"Theremin Center","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7782834"}]}}
