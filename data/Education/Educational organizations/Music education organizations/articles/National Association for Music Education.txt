The National Association for Music Education (NAfME) is an organization of American music educators dedicated to advancing and preserving music education as part of the core curriculum of schools in the United States.  Founded in 1907 as the Music Supervisors National Conference (MSNC), the organization was known from 1934 to 1998 as the Music Educators National Conference (origin of the MENC acronym).  From 1998 to 2011 it was known as "MENC: The National Association for Music Education."  On September 1, 2011, the organization changed its acronym from MENC to NAfME.  In March 2012, Professor Glenn Nierman was elected president-elect of NAfME.  On March 8, 2012, the organization's name legally became National Association for Music Education, using the acronym "NAfME". It has more than 130,000 members, and NAfME's headquarters are located in Reston, Virginia. NAfME functions regionally through more than fifty state (or state-level) affiliates.  These federated state associations include organizations representing each of the fifty U.S. states; the District of Columbia; and a single affiliate for Europe.  As of May 11, 2016, NAfME staff members are led by Mike Blakeslee. Staff were previously led by Michael A. Butera from 2010-2016, and by John J. Mahlmann, who retired in early 2010. There are also leaders for the All-Eastern Division. Hamlin Cogswell (1852-1922) founded the Music Supervisors National Conference in 1907. While a small number of women served as president of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female presidents of this organization.  Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.  More men tend to be hired for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.  According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "glass ceiling" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."  The association annually bestow the Stand for Music Award.  Past winners include:
