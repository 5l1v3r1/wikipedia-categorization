CNTRL: Beyond EDM is an educational initiative, centred on electronic dance music (EDM), and comprising music production seminars, lessons in the music business and live music performances on a tour of North American universities.  Organised by a core team of Richie Hawtin, Loco Dice and Ean Golden, the tour has included many high-profile guest speakers and performers.  Their stated aim is "engaging young North American fans of EDM and showing them the roots of the music, the history of a global movement and demonstrating what the future of music technology and performance has the power to become." Partners include Sennheiser,  New York DJ school Dubspot and DJTechtools magazine.  The CNTRL branding features a fingerprint/circuitboard logo representing the expression of musicians' individuality through electronics.  The first series of events took place in October and November 2012, touring the east coast of the United States and Canada. Seminars were held in:       Each was followed by an evening performance at a nearby venue. A further event took place in March 2013 at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas   and a U.S. west coast tour is planned for 2013 or 2014.
