In 2008, the funding was extended to 40 million over four years, ending in March 2011. In March 2011, the Government announced a further 4 million funding to Sing Up for the next financial year. The aim of this investment was to help the program build a sustainable future beyond April 2012. Between January 2009 and March 2011 Sing Up was led by a consortium of partners, made up of Youth Music with, <a href=\"/wiki/Faber_Music\" title=\"Faber Music\">Faber Music</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/The_Sage_Gateshead\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Sage Gateshead\">The Sage Gateshead</a>. Children's charity Youth Music was the lead partner, with music publisher Faber Music overseeing the national singing resource, including the Song Bank library, while advertising agency AMV, BBDO led a media and PR campaign highlighting the benefits of singing. <a href=\"/wiki/The_Sage_Gateshead\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Sage Gateshead\">The Sage Gateshead</a> led the Workforce Developmeehejrogramme, which aimed to build the confidence and expertise of teachers and musicians so they could lead and support children's singing activities. Due to restrictions in the programme\u2019s funding, AMV, BBDO stepped away from their role within the Consortium in 2011. From January 2009 to March 2011, Sing Up was championed by the composer and broadcaster <a href=\"/wiki/Howard_Goodall\" title=\"Howard Goodall\">Howard Goodall</a> in his role as National Singing Ambassador.
