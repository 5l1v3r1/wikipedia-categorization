The Insectarium is a museum about insects located in the Northeast part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The museum opened in 1992 and features displays of many types of live insects, mounted specimens, exhibits and hands-on activities. Examples of the live insects (and other arthropods) include honeybees, tarantulas, cockroaches, scorpions, spiders, praying mantis, millipedes, beetles, water bugs, ants, and crickets. In 2017 the museum expanded and will open a 7,000-square-foot greenhouse for a year-round butterfly pavilion.   Coordinates: 40°02′32″N 75°01′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.0423°N 75.0263°W﻿ / 40.0423; -75.0263
