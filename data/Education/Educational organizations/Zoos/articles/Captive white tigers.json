Unfortunately Mohini used to push Mighty Mo around. The original plan was to breed Mohini with an unrelated orange tiger, and then breed her to one or more of her male offspring, in the hope of producing white cubs. That was before Sampson arrived. Sampson fathered the first two of Mohini's four litters, which were born in 1964 and 1966.

He was first named \"Charlie\" by one of his keepers, before the Indian Ambassador gave him his official name. The National Zoo planned to trade Rajkumar for a number of other animals. He was equal to ten zebras in value. The Smithsonian Institution stepped in and vetoed the plan, insisting that Rajkumar would remain a permanent resident of Washington D.C. Rajkumar was the only white tiger fathered by Sampson.\n</p><p>The birth of Mohini's first litter was televised in a national special. Mohini's orange daughter Kesari was born in 1966 with an orange female who was stillborn. It was even suggested, although probably not too seriously, that Indian Prime Minister <a href=\"/wiki/Indira_Gandhi\" title=\"Indira Gandhi\">Indira Gandhi</a> be asked to bring a white tiger cub for the zoo, when she was scheduled to visit Washington in 1966. After Moni died in 1971 the National Zoo tried to acquire an orange tiger named Ram from <a href=\"/wiki/Trivandrum\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Trivandrum\">Trivandrum</a> Zoo, in southern India, as a mate for Mohini.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> Ram was her first cousin, a grandson of Mohan, and there was a 50% chance that he carried white genes. 25% of Ram's genes came from Mohan and 25% from Begum. 25% of Mohini's genes were from Begum and 75% from Mohan. Ram was a son of Vindhya and Suraj born on 23 IV 1965 at New Delhi Zoo, the same Ram discussed earlier.

Mohini did not conceive. Kesari produced six orange cubs, an extraordinary number, especially for a first litter, but only one survived, a female named Marvina. Kesari handed Marvina over to her keepers and kept the other five. Marvina was mistaken for male, and named Marvin which was changed to Marvina when it was discovered that he was a she. Washington Zoo keeper Art Cooper, who hand reared Marvina, observed that white tigers were the most obstinate cats in the zoo, and said that Marvina had a typical white tiger personality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-55\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-55\">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> (Poona also fathered litters by two other tigresses in Brookfield.)

Ralph S. Scott was watching and felt as though he was being robbed. He had been trying to get a mate for Princess for years. A bidding war erupted between Scott, Jimmy Stewart, a major league baseball team, a Hollywood producer, and a major European zoo. Scott said of Princess \"It is cruel to expect an animal like that to live alone. And you can't mate her with an ordinary tiger-she's so superior...I appealed to the Maharaja from a conservation standpoint and it hit home.\" Princess and Rajah were to be a \"royal couple.\" The Los Angeles Zoo had already spent $20,000 building a white tiger exhibit. Scott said that he would try and send them a pair of cubs from Princess and Rajah, but Princess died a week before Rajah was scheduled to arrive. Scott hired an Indian taxidermist to stuff Princess, and she was presented to the Museum of Science in Miami in 1972, but she is now in the reception area of the Miami MetroZoo's administration building. Scott paid around $45,000 for Raja, who he thought might still be mated to Mohini, but Rajah never arrived in Crandon Park.

Two white males returned to the Hawthorn Circus with Tony as John Cuneo's share from the breeding loan. John Cuneo also asked the Bristol Zoo to trade some white tigers, to diversify the gene pool, but the Bristol Zoo declined, perhaps not wishing to exchange pure-Bengals for mongrels. Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty lived for years with a troop of Hawthorn Circus tigers stationed at <a href=\"/wiki/Marineland_(Ontario)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Marineland (Ontario)\">Marineland and Game Farm</a>, in <a href=\"/wiki/Niagara_Falls,_Ontario\" title=\"Niagara Falls, Ontario\">Niagara Falls, Ontario</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada</a>. Because of selective breeding only a few of the oldest white tigers in the Hawthorn Circus today are <a href=\"/wiki/Strabismus\" title=\"Strabismus\">cross eyed</a>. Bhim and Sumita became the world record parents of white cubs. In 1976 there were 39 white tigers-7 in New Delhi, 7 in Kolkata, one in <a href=\"/wiki/Guwahati\" title=\"Guwahati\">Guwahati</a>, one in <a href=\"/wiki/Lucknow\" title=\"Lucknow\">Lucknow</a>, one in <a href=\"/wiki/Hyderabad,_Andhra_Pradesh\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh\">Hyderabad</a>, 8 in <a href=\"/wiki/Bristol\" title=\"Bristol\">Bristol</a>, Cincinnati Zoo had 2, Washington had 5, John Cuneo had 5, and Julius Von Uhl had 2. The Maharaja of Rewa retired from the white tiger business in 1976. He later abdicated in favor of his son so that he could run for the family seat in parliament and became an MP. There is a white tiger cub on the shield of the coat of arms of the Maharajas of Rewa.\n</p><p>Over 70 white tigers have been born at the Cincinnati Zoo, which is no longer in the white tiger business. The Cincinnati Zoo sold white tigers<sup id=\"cite_ref-77\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-77\">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup> for $60,000 each. Siegfried &amp; Roy bought a litter of three white cubs from the Cincinnati Zoo, which were offspring of Bhim and Sumita, for around $125,000. Prior to 1974 the Cincinnati Zoo wanted to acquire a white tiger, but no zoo would sell at any price. By the 1980s the Cincinnati Zoo was the world's leading purveyor of white tigers. It was a cousin of the Maharaja of Rewa, Lt. Col. Fatesinghrao \"Jackie\" Gaekwad, the Maharaja of Baroda, who was also the Commissioner of Indian Wildlife and an MP, who suggested to Siegfried and Roy that they acquire white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo and include them in their act.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_78-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-78\">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup>\"Jackie\" was also the President of the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"World Wildlife Fund\">World Wildlife Fund</a> India.  In the mid 1980s Siegfried &amp; Roy owned 10% of the world's white tigers, and they were escorting two big white tiger cubs, with dark stripes, to their new home in <a href=\"/wiki/Phantasialand\" title=\"Phantasialand\">Phantasialand</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Br%C3%BChl_(Rhineland)\" title=\"Br\u00fchl (Rhineland)\">Br\u00fchl</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">Germany</a>, when the white tigers were briefly stolen with their truck in New York City.<sup id=\"cite_ref-79\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-79\">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup> The driver stopped for coffee.

Kesari also went to live at <a href=\"/wiki/Omaha\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Omaha\">Omaha</a> Zoo, but did not have any more cubs. Some of Tony's white siblings born in Omaha proved to be sterile. Obie was paired with Ranjit from the National Zoo, and their cubs like those of Tony and Kesari, included non inbred white tigers. A white tiger named Chester, who was a son of Ranjit and Obie, born at the Omaha Zoo, fathered the first test tube tigers,<sup id=\"cite_ref-81\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-81\">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup> and then became the first white tiger in <a href=\"/wiki/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a> when he was sent to the <a href=\"/wiki/Taronga_Zoo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Taronga Zoo\">Taronga Zoo</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Sydney\" title=\"Sydney\">Sydney</a>.

Ika was also bred to Taj's orange mother Dolly, a daughter of Bhim and an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi, in Columbus. Taj's father, Duke, was a son of Ranjit from an outcross to an unrelated orange tigress. Isson, a white grandson of Kesari and Tony, was also dispatched to Columbus on breeding loan from the Hawthorn Circus, of Grayslake, Illinois, which eventually had 80 white tigers, the largest collection in the world at the time. In 1984 five white tiger cubs were stolen from the Hawthorn Circus in Portland, Oregon, and two died. The tigers were touring with the <a href=\"/wiki/Ringling_Bros._Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus\">Ringling Bros.

One of the three was later bred to her creating another blend of two unrelated strains of white tigers. This lineage resulted in several white tigers in Nandan Kanan Zoo. Today the Nandankanan Zoo has the largest collection of white tigers in India. The Cincinnati Zoo acquired two female white tigers from the Nandan Kanan Zoo, in the hopes of establishing a line of pure-Bengal white tigers in America, but they never got a male, and did not receive authorization from the <a href=\"/wiki/Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums\" title=\"Association of Zoos and Aquariums\">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> (AZA)'s <a href=\"/wiki/Species_Survival_Plan\" title=\"Species Survival Plan\">Species Survival Plan</a> (SSP) to breed them.

The white cub's grandmother Thara came from the Nandankanan Zoo in 1972. Mysore Zoo had a second female white tiger cub from New Delhi Zoo in 1984.
