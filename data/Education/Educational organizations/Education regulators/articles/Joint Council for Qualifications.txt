  The Joint Council for Qualifications, (commonly referred to as JCQ) is a council acting as a single voice for the seven largest qualification providers in the UK offering GCSE, GCE, Scottish Highers and vocationally related qualifications: AQA, CCEA, City & Guilds, Edexcel, OCR, SQA and WJEC.  The JCQ closely monitors examination administration, invigilation of exams at individual schools and activities of exams officers.  The JCQ was established to unite to an extent the largest educational and vocational examination boards in the United Kingdom and to administer testing standards. The JCQ should not be confused with the government of the United Kingdom, which has the authority to regulate and accredit British examination boards. The JCQ was formed to enable member awarding bodies to act together in: The JCQ provides rules and regulations concerning the exams. These include: Any malpractice, lateness of more than one hour, candidates leaving the exam early, or disturbances should be reported to the board. A candidate's exam papers may then be cancelled in that exam, subject, or whole series. It should be noted that British examination boards for GCSEs and GCE A-levels (i.e. AQA, Edexcel, OCR, WJEC, CCEA) are obliged to comply with JCQ's regulations, whereas Cambridge International are not obliged to comply with them for their international GCSEs.
