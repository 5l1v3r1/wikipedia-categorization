Young Reporters for the Environment is a programme of the Foundation for Environmental Education. An international network of youth in more than 25 countries, it promotes solutions to todayâ€™s environmental issues through investigative journalism. At the national[where?] level, participants choose local environmental issues to investigate, with the goal of communicating relevant information and solutions to the general public. The students carry out real journalistic enquiries and report their findings in the form of an article, photograph/photographic essay or video.  An international competition is also held annually.  The Foundation for Environmental Education is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation promoting sustainable development through environmental education, and is active in five programmes; Blue Flag,  Eco-Schools,  Learning about Forests (LEAF),  Green Key International  and Eco-Schools. It has members in 76 countries worldwide.
