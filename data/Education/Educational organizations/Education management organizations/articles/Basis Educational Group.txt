Basis Educational Group, styled BASIS.ed, is a for-profit education management organization based in Tucson, Arizona. It serves primarily BASIS Schools, a non-profit charter management organization with offices in the same complex. Basis comprises various companies organized by the regions in which the schools operate: Basis Schools, Inc., BTX Schools, Inc., Basis Washington D.C. (Washington D.C.), and Basis Baton Rouge (Louisiana).  In 2018, the company claims twenty-five schools and 17,000 students, which matches publicly available enrollment numbers from BASIS Schools. In 2015, BASIS Schools had enrolled 12,0140 students. :84 BASIS Independent Schools are private, tuition-based schools using the Basis curriculum. Critics observe that the relation between Basis Educational Group and BASIS Schools is not arms-length. As a result, there is little financial transparency.  An investigative article in 2010 compared the founders' salary compared to the teachers and other public school administrators.  The schools have suffered high attrition rates (senior classes are typically a third to a quarter of the size of the fifth grade class).  Critics argue that BASIS achieves good test scores in part by weeding out underperforming students.     In 2013, a request to expand was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board, which cited concerns about the high number of students who had withdrawn from the school since it opened.
