The Archives of American Mathematics, located at the University of Texas at Austin,  aims to collect, preserve, and provide access to the papers principally of American mathematicians and the records of American mathematical organizations. The Archives  began in 1975 at the University of Texas at Austin with the preservation of the papers of Texas mathematicians R.L. Moore and H.S. Vandiver.  In 1978, the Mathematical Association of America established the university as the official repository for its archival records and the name "Archives of American Mathematics" was adopted to encompass all of the mathematical archival collections at the university.   Originally a part of the Harry Ransom Center, in 1984, the Archives was added to the special collections of the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin.  The AAM includes approximately 120 collections.  Significant archives of American mathematicians and their organizations are held by other repositories. The following are examples which include a few Canadian collections with substantial United States connections. For the complete holdings, the catalogs of the individual repositories would need to be consulted. In addition, the archives of academic institutions will typically include administrative records of mathematics departments and clubs as well as the papers of faculty.
