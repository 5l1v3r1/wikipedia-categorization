The Arctic World Archive was opened on Svalbard, Norway, March 27 2017,  located deep inside arctic mountains with permaforst and ideal climatic conditions. The Svalbard archipelago is declared demilitarized by 42 nations, making the Artic World Archive an ideal location for valuable data storage.   What the Global Seed Vault is for plants, the Arctic World Archive will be for the worlds digital heritage and valuable data; - a secure and safe place where the data will be available when all other systems fail.  The archive is managed by Norwegian technology company Piql, in collaboration with governmental mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.  The archive is located inside an abandoned coal mine on Svalbard, and is said to be nuclear safe. Data is stored offline on digital film that has a reported lifetime of 500 years.   The archive stores data such as a digitized version of The Scream by Edvard Munch for the National Museum of Norway and a digitised version of the Divine Comedy for the Vatican Library.  In March 2018 German science TV show Galileo deposited their first show and made a documentary about it for ProSieben.
