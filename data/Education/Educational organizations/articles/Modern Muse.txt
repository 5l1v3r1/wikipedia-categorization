The Modern Muse Charity is an online platform designed to encourage the next generation of female business leaders and entrepreneurs.   The platform, www.modernmuse.org, is aimed at girls aged 8 and above; it features the professional pathways of women from all walks of life, working across business and society, with a focus on encouraging girls into STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and digital careers.  Muses are women of all professional levels, across all sectors. They offer information and insights about their career paths. Via an online forum, questions can be asked of the Muses.
