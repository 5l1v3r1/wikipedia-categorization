The European Council of High Ability (ECHA) was established in 1988 as a European Non-governmental organization.  The major aim of ECHA is to promote the information exchange of people interested in high ability – teachers, researchers, psychologists, parents, politicians and the highly able themselves. ECHA has the Charity Number: 40146782. ECHA has both personal and organizational membership. Those interested in gifted education or highly able people may apply for membership.  The services of the European Council for High Ability are the following: ECHA is directed by a General Assembly convening annually. The General Assembly elects the General Committee responsible for ECHA’s life in between two General Assemblies. Members in different countries are helped by National Correspondents. Past-presidents, past-secretaries and past-editor-in-chiefs of High Ability Studies are Honorary Members of ECHA.
