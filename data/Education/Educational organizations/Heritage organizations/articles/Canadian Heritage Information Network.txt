The Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) is a Government of Canada-supported organization that provides a networked interface to Canada's heritage. CHIN is a Special Operating Agency within the Citizenship and Heritage sector of the Department of Canadian Heritage. It serves as a national centre of expertise to more than 1,600 museums and other member heritage institutions across Canada, and it aims to give access to Canada's heritage for both Canadians and a worldwide audience, by supporting the development, presentation and preservation of Canada's digital heritage.  CHIN is based in Gatineau (until 2002, Hull), in Quebec. CHIN also provides Canada's not-for-profit heritage sector with research, products, services and fora that support skills and career development, and content development and presentation. It oversees the Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC), and the VMC Investment Programs. CHIN manages a Professional Exchange portal for heritage professionals and volunteers. In French, CHIN is known as the RÃ©seau canadien d'information sur le patrimoine (RCIP). It provides bilingual information for all its resources. CHIN was the first national organization to participate in the Virtual Library museums pages (VLmp) online museums directory, now supported by ICOM.
