  The Yangon Heritage Trust (Burmese: ရန်ကုန်အမွေအနှစ် ထိန်းသိမ်းစောင့်ရှောက်ရေးအဖွဲ့; abbreviated YHT) is a non-governmental organisation founded by Thant Myint-U to conserve historic buildings in Yangon (formerly Rangoon), the former capital of Burma.   Yangon has Asia's largest collection of colonial-era buildings.  The Trust has proposed to designate small zones within the city centre (particularly in Downtown Yangon) as heritage areas and envisions a joint public-private collaboration whereby private investors restore heritage buildings for commercial use while maintaining the character of the areas.  The Trust also advocates a conservation plan led by the private sector.  In June 2013, Philips announced a partnership with the Trust to install 200 LED-lit blue plaques to highlight key cultural heritage sites in the city.
