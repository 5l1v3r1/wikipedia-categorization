The Westsylvania Heritage Corporation (formerly the Allegheny Heritage Development Corporation) is a public organization centered in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. It was created in the late 1990s by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission, a federal commission made to oversee the America's Industrial Heritage Project. Westsylvania's aims are to promote the history and protect the identity of western Pennsylvania; among its actions toward these ends was the publication of Westsylvania magazine, a quarterly periodical on the history of and life in the region, which was issued from 1997 through 2006, when it ceased publication for lack of funding.
