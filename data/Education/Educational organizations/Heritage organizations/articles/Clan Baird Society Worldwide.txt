Clan Baird Society Worldwide  is the oldest and largest modern Clan Baird group.   It was established (1963) by Byron Owsley Baird and his wife Frances, in Florida, Unites States, and is a worldwide organization with members in Australia, Scotland, England, New Zealand, Canada, Spain, and the U.S..  The Society is governed by a Board of Directors, Chieftains, and Honorary Chieftains,  since Clan Baird is armigerous. The main objective of the group is to bring together Bairds of the world, especially those who were a part of the diaspora after each Scottish Rebellion and the Highland Clearances, with those who remained in Scotland.  The Society holds biennial meetings in Scotland and the United States, the next cycle will be in 2019.  The 2017 meetings were held in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, Scotland at the Boat Inn, and at the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games, in Linville, North Carolina.  Baird Archaeological and Historical Initiative (BAHI)  is one of the most important aspects of the Society.  The BAHI sponsors projects in history and antiquities each year.  In 2017, the sponsored project was St. Drostan's Pilgrimage Walk,  New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.
