NYSSMA is a professional organization that evaluates student musicians in New York state from elementary school to high school. Each spring, thousands of students register through their school music programs to attend NYSSMA Evaluation Festivals where they are adjudicated. These festivals take place at local middle and high schools within the fifteen NYSSMA zones, each of which covers an area in New York State. Usually, county high schools take turns to host the festival every few years.\n</p><p>At each festival, students perform <a href=\"/wiki/Major_scale\" title=\"Major scale\">scales</a>, a <a href=\"/wiki/Solo_(music)#Solo_pieces\" title=\"Solo (music)\">solo</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Musical_ensemble\" title=\"Musical ensemble\">ensemble</a> piece of their choice from the designated NYSSMA repertoire, and a sight reading piece. The judges score and comment on the students' performances according to defined guidelines set by NYSSMA. The grade sheets are then certified and sent to the music departments at the individual schools to be distributed to the students.\n</p><p>Instruments evaluated include <a href=\"/wiki/Vocal_music\" title=\"Vocal music\">voice</a>, piano, <a href=\"/wiki/String_section\" title=\"String section\">strings</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Woodwind_instrument\" title=\"Woodwind instrument\">woodwinds</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Brass_instrument\" title=\"Brass instrument\">brasses</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Percussion_instrument\" title=\"Percussion instrument\">percussion</a>. NYSSMA scores and evaluators' comments are often used by music teachers as diagnostics and progress monitoring. They also determine selection into orchestra, band, or choral groups depending on their instrument. Students who play saxophones, brasses or percussion or sing can choose to be evaluated in <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=NYSSMA_Jazz_Festival&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"NYSSMA Jazz Festival (page does not exist)\">NYSSMA Jazz Festival</a> where they have an opportunity to be selected into various jazz ensembles. Performance groups include All-County, Area All-State (part of New York State), and Conference All-State (entire New York State).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Judgment_Criteria\">Judgment Criteria</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_York_State_School_Music_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Judgment Criteria\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Participants in all categories prepare and perform a solo selected from the NYSSMA Manual, perform scales, and demonstrate sight reading from original music provided by NYSSMA at the audition. Each NYSSMA solo is preassigned a difficulty level from I (easiest) to VI (most difficult).  Instrumental soloists also must play scales, the number of which are determined by difficulty level of the solo. Overall each participant is judged on seven categories, <b>tone</b>, <b>intonation</b>, <b>technique</b>, <b>accuracy</b>, <b>interpretation</b>, <b>scales</b>, and <b>sight reading</b>.  Level I-IV solos are judged on a 28 point scale and level V-VI solos are judged on a 100 point scale.  Participants may also elect to receive a \"festival\" rating in which written comments are given but no score.\n</p><p>Vocalists (Levels I - IV) are judged on seven categories: <br />\n<b>Tone</b> (Quality, Consistency, Projection) <br />\n<b>Intonation</b> <br />\n<b>Technique</b> (Breath Control, Flexibility, Posture, Appropriate Range) <br />\n<b>Diction</b> (Vowels, Consonants, Naturalness) <br />\n<b>Accuracy</b> (Accuracy of Notes, Accuracy of Rhythms, Steadiness of Rhythms, Pulse)<br />\n<b>Interpretation</b> (Dynamics, Style, Tempo, Phrasing, Expression, Artistry, Stage Presence) <br />\n<b>Sight reading</b> (Accuracy of Dynamics, Accuracy of Notes, Accuracy of Rhythm, Correct tempo)\n</p><p>Woodwind/brass players are judged similarly, except \"articulation\" replaces \"diction\". String players are evaluated on their bowing techniques.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Levels_and_Grading_System\">Levels and Grading System</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_York_State_School_Music_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Levels and Grading System\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are a total of six levels, each with its own level of progressively more challenging repertoire. Levels I through IV are scored on a scale of 0 to 28, where each section is scored out of 4 points. Levels V and VI are scored from 0 to 100. Each of the judging categories are allotted a set points out of the total. For example, on Level V and VI String Solos, \"Tone\" is worth 20 points, \"Intonation\" 10, \"Technique\" 20, \"Accuracy\" 15, \"Interpretation\" 20, \"Scales\" 5, and \"Sight reading\" 10.\n</p><p>NYSSMA provides <a href=\"/wiki/Sight_reading\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sight reading\">sight reading</a> passages of all six levels from a proprietary manual. Scale requirement depends on level as well. Levels I and II require knowledge of three <a href=\"/wiki/Major_scale\" title=\"Major scale\">scales</a>, III and IV require seven, and V and VI require all <a href=\"/wiki/Major_scale\" title=\"Major scale\">major scales</a>. In levels I-IV, the performer can choose the scales they have prepared on the evaluation sheet. During the performance and evaluation, the judge would choose three scales at random among the expected set for the performer to play. In contrast, NYSSMA requires a list of <a href=\"/wiki/Rudiment\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rudiment\">rudiments</a> that the soloist must prepare for their evaluation depending on the level of the solo for snare drum. Also, the soloist must perform a \"long roll\" for snare drum. For Levels I and II, the soloist must perform a long roll without speeding up and slowing down. However, in levels III, IV, V, and VI, the soloist must speed up to an orchestral roll (multiple bounce stroke roll) and slow back down to where they started.\n</p><p>Some students wish to forgo the numerical rating entirely in favor of a completely comment-based evaluation. Such students indicate this before the festival by checking the \"Festival\" box on the evaluation sheet. They need not perform all the required components of the evaluation if they wish, but the judge does not score the performance regardless. Therefore, for this option, the judge may only write comments.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_York_State_School_Music_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nyssma.org\">NYSSMA</a></li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw2211\nCached time: 20180918202814\nCache expiry: 1900800\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.012 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.012 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1500000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:9672093-0!canonical and timestamp 20180918202814 and revision id 836491205\n -->\n</div>"},"langlinks":[],"categories":[{"sortkey":"","*":"Organizations_based_in_New_York_(state)"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Music_education_organizations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"Education-related_professional_associations"},{"sortkey":"","*":"National_Association_for_Music_Education"}],"links":[{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Brass instrument"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Major scale"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Musical ensemble"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"National Association for Music Education"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"New York (state)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Percussion instrument"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Rudiment"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Sight reading"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Solo (music)"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"String section"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Vocal music"},{"ns":0,"exists":"","*":"Woodwind instrument"},{"ns":0,"*":"NYSSMA Jazz Festival"}],"templates":[],"images":[],"externallinks":["http://www.nyssma.org"],"sections":[{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Judgment Criteria","number":"1","index":"1","fromtitle":"New_York_State_School_Music_Association","byteoffset":1836,"anchor":"Judgment_Criteria"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"Levels and Grading System","number":"2","index":"2","fromtitle":"New_York_State_School_Music_Association","byteoffset":3351,"anchor":"Levels_and_Grading_System"},{"toclevel":1,"level":"2","line":"References","number":"3","index":"3","fromtitle":"New_York_State_School_Music_Association","byteoffset":5266,"anchor":"References"}],"parsewarnings":[],"displaytitle":"New York State School Music Association","iwlinks":[],"properties":[{"name":"wikibase_item","*":"Q7014707"}]}}
