The Society of Heads, formerly the Society of Headmasters & Headmistresses of Independent Schools (SHHIS), or "S of H", is an association of Headmasters and Headmistresses of various types of independent schools in the United Kingdom, and was formed in 1961. Members include heads of single-sex and co-educational day and boarding secondary schools, specialist music, dance, and performing arts schools, and special schools for children with learning difficulties. The association's headquarters are in Market Harborough, in Leicestershire, England.  Members of the SofH usually have membership of the Association of School and College Leaders, with their schools usually having membership of the Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools. Some member girls' schools are also members of the Girls' Schools Association. SofH itself is a constituent of the Independent Schools Council.
