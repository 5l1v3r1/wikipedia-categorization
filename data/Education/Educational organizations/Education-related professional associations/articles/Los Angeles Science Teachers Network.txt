Los Angeles Science Teachers Network is a professional development network for science education by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through inquiry-based learning and scientific literacy. The first meeting was held in Lisa Ellen Niver's home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In Westside Today, information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.   In the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Impatient Optimists article, "Teachers Need A Village," the importance of teachers needing support from groups like LASTN is explored.   "Why So Many Of America's Teachers Are Leaving The Profession?" cites Los Angeles Science Teachers Network as an example to teachers everywhere to find support and stay involved.  Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,  PBS.org,  Green Living Arizona (in print),  the Huffington Post  and on National television.   While Niver is on sabbatical with We Said Go Travel, Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.   2014-2015 2013-2014 2012-2013 2011-2012 iPad apps and hands-on labs 2010-2011 2009-2010
