The Talloires Network is an international association of institutions which aims to foster higher education civic engagement. Its secretariat is based at Tufts University. The network began in September 2005 with a global conference involving 29 higher education heads from 23 countries who gathered at the Tufts University European Center in Talloires, France. As of 2018 the network has 379 member institutions in 77 countries with a combined enrollment of over 6 million students. The network hosts conferences, produces publications on university civic engagement, provides financial and technical support to regional university networks, and awards the annual MacJannet Prize for university student civic engagement initiatives.
