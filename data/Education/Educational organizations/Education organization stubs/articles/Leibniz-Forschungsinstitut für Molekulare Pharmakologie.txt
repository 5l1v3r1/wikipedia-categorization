The Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP) was founded in 1992 as a successor to the "Institut für Wirkstofforschung", an Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. It was renamed "Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie" - hence, its acronym. The institute has focused on proteins as basic structures of the [[life|lives[[File:]]|thumb]] of all cellular organisms. The FMP has from its inception been a member of the Leibniz Association. The school and seven other Berlin Leibniz-Institutes are legally represented by the Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V.
