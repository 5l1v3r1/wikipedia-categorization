Alexander Hamilton Institute for the Study of Western Civilization is an educational institute in Clinton, New York founded in 2007.  Judge David Aldrich Nelson was a charter director.  One of its board members is Jane Fraser.  History professor Robert L. Paquette of Hamilton College in Clinton had led an attempt to create an "Alexander Hamilton Center" on the Hamilton College campus, but it was unsuccessful.   A faculty vote voiced concern that the proposal to establish this alumni-financed center to study "capitalism, natural law and the role of religion in politics" would have an overt conservative political tendency and would not be subject to sufficient oversight by the school. The college's decision not to proceed drew criticism from conservative commentators,   and the institute was established as an off-campus, independent entity.
