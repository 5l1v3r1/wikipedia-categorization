The Nepalese Children's Education Fund (NCEF) is a non-profit organization that has been working to develop the potential of disadvantaged Nepalese children through education. Since its establishment in 2002, NCEF has targeted students from economically disadvantaged families, who would otherwise be unable to send their children to school. NCEF also extends its support to ethnically marginalized groups, orphans and girls with its belief in the power of education. With the help of volunteers in both Nepal and around the world, NCEF has been expanding its work in both rural and urban regions of Nepal. NCEF operates in the following regions in Nepal: Volunteers in Nepal, especially area coordinators, identify potential candidates for the scholarship, assist in filling out application forms by visiting candidates or through coordination with school teachers. Then they send the scanned applications to the US Selection Committee, which comprises volunteers both from NCEF and outside. Once the Selection Committee makes a decision, area coordinators relay that decision to candidates, and then continue the process of enrolling selected students into schools and providing them with education material. Detailed student selection criteria are listed in NCEF's official website:   The United States: NCEF is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. US Taxpayer ID: 51-0424140.
