Applied Education is a school for bookkeepers and tax agents  approved by the Tax Practitioners Board  and Institute of Certified Bookkeepers.  The Australian Government created legislation called the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 (TASA)  to ensure that people preparing Business Activity Statements for a fee are registered. The Tax Practitioners Board  administers and manages the registration of bookkeepers in Australia. Prior to this anyone could act as a bookkeeper and this created concern that business were getting poor advice from unqualified people. Applied Education is a Registered Training Organisation, which commenced in 1999.  website - www.appliededucation.edu.au
