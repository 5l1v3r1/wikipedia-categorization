The Museum Institute for Teaching Science (MITS), based in Quincy, Massachusetts, United States, and founded in 1983, provides resources and professional development to informal and formal teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In partnership with educators at science and natural history museums, MITS initiates and facilitates innovative STEM professional development programs for formal and informal educators. MITS provides SeaPerch Workshops, Customized School Services, a Professional Development Seminar Series (PDS), and annual Summer Professional Development Institutes, with an aim of providing STEM professional development that teachers can use as a model for their classroom activities and curriculum. MITS' Summer Professional Development Institutes are their cornerstone program, available as either hybrid or on-site courses for grades 3-8 or middle and high school educators.  These courses are held in regions across Massachusetts and participants are able to earn Professional Development Points (PDPs) and/or graduate credit from participating institutions.
