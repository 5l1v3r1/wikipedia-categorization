Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) is a Qatari-based non-profit organization that provides access to primary and secondary education to children affected by crisis across Asia. It was launched in December 2005 under the patronage of Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al- Thani and chaired by Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.   Working under the auspices of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science, and Community Development – a private, chartered, non-profit organization, ROTA pursues its objectives through ROTAQ – which handles activities within Qatar - and ROTAsia —responsible for programs across Asia and the Middle East. In its effort to promote education, ROTA implements educational projects in countries where immediate action is needed. Ten countries have been identified as ROTA’s priorities: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine and Yemen. Some of them are among the world’s poorest countries, while others have suffered war or natural disasters during the last years. In June 2011, ROTA in collaboration with the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) began the process of translating the agency communications and training tools into Arabic. The programme, ‘INEE Arabic Language Community: Supporting Quality Education in Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recover in the Arabic-Speaking World’ was established to ensure that the communities in the Middle East have access to and benefit from INEE’s useful tools and resources.
