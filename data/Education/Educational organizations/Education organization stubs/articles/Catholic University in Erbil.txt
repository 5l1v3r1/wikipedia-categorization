The Catholic University in Erbil (CUE) is a private non-profit institution of higher education and research located in the Erbil suburb of Ankawa, Iraq. It was founded in December 2015 by Archbishop Bashar Warda of the Chaldean Catholic Church, and provides degrees in the arts and sciences recognized by the Kurdistan Regional Government.  Its foundation stone was laid on 20 October 2012. 30,000 square metres of land were made available for the campus.  The Italian Episcopal Conference gave 2.3 million euros for the project,  and the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik in Lebanon was contacted for help and guidance.
