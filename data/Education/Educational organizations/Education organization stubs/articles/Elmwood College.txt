It became the Elmwood Campus of Scotland's Rural College in October 2013. Elmwood Agricultural and Technical College was the first regional farm centre to be established in Scotland, officially opened in 1972.   The Scottish Technical Education Consultative Council had made recommendations in 1967 around establishing regional farm centres. The college had started classes about twenty years earlier, with student numbers rising from 100 to around 2000 by 1972.  There were full-time as well as part-time courses, work based courses, and modern apprenticeships.  Before the purpose-built building opened in 1972,  classes had been held on borrowed premises over a few years. A 350-acre farm was attached to the college and it offered courses such as hill-farming and shepherding.  In 1997 Elmwood college became the first education establishment in Britain to have its own 18-hole, working golf course.  There is a large variety of subjects taught at Elmwood Campus, including land-based courses, and it is especially well known for golf and greenkeeping courses. There are three parts to Elmwood campus. The main campus is on Carslogie Road, Cupar. The second campus is at Stratheden, which has the only golf course and clubhouse in any college in Scotland.  Cuparmuir Farm is the third campus, where most of the land-based courses are taught.  Main Campus Former logo
