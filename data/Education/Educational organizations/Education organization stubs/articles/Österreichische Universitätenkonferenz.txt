Österreichische Universitätenkonferenz (Uniko; English: Universities Austria) is an association that supports universities in Austria and promotes science and research.  It began in 1911.  In 2008 it changed its name from Österreichische Rektorenkonferenz (Austrian Rectors' Conference) to the current Österreichische Universitätenkonferenz.  The first meeting of the group took place in Vienna in 1911. From the start of the University Organization Act 1975 until the end of December 2003, when the Universitäts-Organisationsgesetz 1993 (de) (1993 University Organization Act) was superseded by the Universitätsgesetz 2002 (de) (2002 University Act), the Rectors' Conference was a federal institution with partial legal capacity (Teilrechtsfähigkeit (de)). In addition to the internal coordination of the Austrian state universities, Uniko represents the concerns of universities in international and national affairs and in the public,  and is a member of the European University Association. The association signed the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities in November 2004.  Association members are the state universities in accordance with the 2002 University Act, which are represented in the plenary assembly by the respective rector. The president is elected from the ranks of university rectors. The president since January 2018 is the historian Eva Blimlinger (de), rector of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. The following have served as chairmen and presidents of the association:
