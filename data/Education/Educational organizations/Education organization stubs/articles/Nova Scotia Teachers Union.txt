The Nova Scotia Teachers Union was organized in 1895-96 to unify and elevate the teaching profession in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. As the unified voice for the advocacy and support of all its members, the NSTU promotes and advances the teaching profession and quality public education. Members include some 9,700 public school teachers as well as approximately 900 Nova Scotia Community College faculty and professional support staff. The NSTU serves as the primary advocate of its members by protecting and enhancing economic benefits, improving working conditions, supporting personal well being, keeping members informed and promoting opportunities to participate. During a dispute with the Nova Scotia government in 2016/17, they negotiated three contracts that they supported, however the membership rejected all three. The Nova Scotia Government has put forward a bill to legislate the teachers new contract.
