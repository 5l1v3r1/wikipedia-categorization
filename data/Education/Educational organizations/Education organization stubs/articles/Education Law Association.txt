The Education Law Association (ELA) is a professional organization composed of school and university administrators, professors, consultants, and attorneys, for the purpose of interdisciplinary dialogue regarding legal issues in education. This is accomplished through seminars, webinars, an annual conference, and the highest quality monographs and books, some of which are popular graduate textbooks. Members receive special pricing on most products and events, and also receive monthly and quarterly updates, access to an online searchable case database of summaries of cases in education law, and numerous other products and services not available to the public. Annual Conference Publications History Founded in 1954 during an education conference at Duke University, the National Organization on Legal Problems in Education was founded with 57 members from 15 states and the District of Columbia. Within six weeks of its inception, NOLPE had 205 members from 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. The first annual meeting was held in the fall of 1955 at the University of Chicago and the first full-sized book was published in 1958, titled Law and the School Superintendent. By 1963, nearly one-third of the membership were attorneys. The annual conference attracts hundreds of participants and attendees from around the United States and a number of other countries. The conference has been held in such places as Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, Miami Beach, Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Nassau, Bahamas.
