BACSAP (Bahrains' Association of Computer Students and Professionals) came into existence in April 1998, which was one of the first student chapters of Pakistan to be affiliated with ACM. BACSAP was the brainchild of one of the studentsâ€™ Shahnawaz Malik. Upon asking him how he came up with the idea he said that the basic motivation behind this concept was that there was no society, which could provide students with the chance to do something related to his or her field of study, because at university level education should not be just books and classrooms, but rather it requires something much more than that. The students really needed a platform that would prepare them for their practical and professional life. They also needed an opportunity to improve their management and leadership skills, because that is how they learned how to take initiative and then give a practical shape to their ideas. Now BACSAP has around 150 members, and membership is opened twice a year with the start of each semester. Bits Bytes & Colors is an annual Software/Hardware Exhibition & Competition held at Bahria University, Islamabad.
