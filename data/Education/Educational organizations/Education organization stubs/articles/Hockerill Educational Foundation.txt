The Hockerill Educational Foundation was founded on the closure of Hockerill College, a Church of England (Diocese of Rochester) and Non-conformist churches,  teacher training college, in 1978.  The foundation's purpose is to advance further and higher education, specifically but not exclusively  in relation  to religious education.  The Hockerill Lectures are delivered on an annual basis.  The lectures are published annually and in ten-year collections.
