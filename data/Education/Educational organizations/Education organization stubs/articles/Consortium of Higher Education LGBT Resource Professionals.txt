The Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals which was founded as the National Consortium of Directors of LGBT Resources in Higher Education originated in 1997 at the San Diego NGLTF Creating Change Conference. In 2008 they changed their name to better reflect their membership and mission. The consortium works with LGBT student centers to provide support, resources and help with the development of curriculum. The organization is dedicated to improving the educational environment for students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni and ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender participants have equity in every respect.  The Consortium's mission is to "achieve higher education environments in which lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni have equity in every respect." whose goals are to "support colleagues and develop curriculum to professionally enhance this work; to seek climate improvement on campuses; and to advocate for policy change, program development, and establishment of LGBT Office/Centers."
