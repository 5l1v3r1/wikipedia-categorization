A Spanish Trainee is the beneficiary from a Spanish fellowship program that gives young professionals from Spain the opportunity to do a traineeship in one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) establishments, in fields related to space science and engineering. It is an initiative to bring state-of-the-art knowledge to the Spanish aerospace industry. The program trains Spanish graduates at ESA in order to create professionals in the space industry, therefore reinforcing the technological know-how in this field. The fellowship is an initiative of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, together with the CDTI (Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology). The program lasts up to 2 years, during which time the trainee is integrated in an ESA section under the supervision of an ESA staff member. At the end of the program, the beneficiary is specialized in a space-related topic and therefore has a wide range of opportunities to develop his or her career in the sector, either in the industry or as part of ESA.
