The Fluxnet Canada Research Network is a research network of more than 100 scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from 15 Canadian universities and nine federal and provincial government laboratories. One of the priorities of FCRN is determining the factors that govern the time required for a forest to become a net carbon sink following disturbances such as harvest or fire. Tower-mounted meteorological equipment is used to measure carbon fluxes as well as water and energy exchange in 20 forested and seven peatland ecosystems in seven different provinces.
