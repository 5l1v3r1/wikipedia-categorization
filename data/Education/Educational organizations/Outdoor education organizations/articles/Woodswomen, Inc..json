Especially in the early years of Woodswomen (1970s and '80s), many women did not have strong outdoors skills because they had not been given the opportunity to learn them. This would lead to women on outdoor trips being marginalized for their lack of skill and not getting the opportunity to learn. When men on trips would teach women some skills, it would be condescending and hierarchal, and women would get frustrated when they didn't get it right away. When women learn from women, there's not as much of the condescension, and women are able to take more control of their learning\u2014\"When women learn from women, they take more credit for learning,\" said Elizabeth Barnard in an interview.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Womengrowingstronger_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Womengrowingstronger-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Traveling with other women also gets women out of passive roles they may take at home and on trips with men, where they are marginalized in favor of having the supposedly stronger and faster men do the job. When men are not around, it's impossible for women to fall into gender roles in terms of the tasks they perform and the skills they must learn.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Winegar,_Karin_1982_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Winegar,_Karin_1982-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In addition to learning new skills and becoming comfortable in the outdoors, one of the main byproducts of Woodswomen trips was increased self-esteem in participants.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Korn,_Ben_1979_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Korn,_Ben_1979-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Women coming back from Woodswomen trips reported an increase in confidence, saying things like \"now I know I can go for that job promotion.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Womengrowingstronger_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Womengrowingstronger-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Woodswomen affiliates did research over the years about outcomes of trips, and learned about how empowered women felt after trips.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mitten,_Denise_1992_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mitten,_Denise_1992-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg/220px-Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg/330px-Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"400\" data-file-height=\"600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Woodswomen_Denali_Expedition.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>1988 Woodswomen Denali Climb on the west buttress of Mount McKinley, AK.

In 1993, Woodswomen ran 70 trips in 8 different countries, and when it closed in 1999, Woodswomen had served over 8,000 women and 1,200 children through its outdoor adventure programs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Noyelling_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Noyelling-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Woodswomen ran trips focusing on activities including biking, <a href=\"/wiki/Rock_climbing\" title=\"Rock climbing\">rock climbing</a>, backpacking, cross country skiing, kayaking, canoeing, whitewater canoeing and rafting, <a href=\"/wiki/Winter_camping\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Winter camping\">winter camping</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Sea_kayaking\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sea kayaking\">sea kayaking</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Snorkeling\" title=\"Snorkeling\">snorkeling</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/SCUBA_diving\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SCUBA diving\">SCUBA diving</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mountaineering\" title=\"Mountaineering\">mountaineering</a>, horse packing, llama packing, wild ricing, and dogsledding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Trips were geared to serve women with no outdoor experience to women with extensive outdoor experience, and a range of women participated in the trips, from professionals to housewives to low income women on scholarships (Woodswomen had a scholarship fund, sponsored by former trip participants and others, to defray the cost of trips so that low income women could also attend).<sup id=\"cite_ref-TalkingwithWoodswomen_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TalkingwithWoodswomen-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Woodswomen guides completed an extensive guide-training program, focusing on leadership styles, group dynamics. Hollis Giammatteo, writing for <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ms._(magazine)\" title=\"Ms. (magazine)\">Ms.</a></i> magazine, took a leadership course that included climbing <a href=\"/wiki/Mount_Adams_(Washington)\" title=\"Mount Adams (Washington)\">Mount Adams</a> in Washington state.  According to Giammatteo, Denise Mitten refined Woodswomen's acclaimed leadership program, creating a style stressing ethical and inclusive leadership. For Woodswomen guides, leadership was viewed as a role that encourages appropriate participation, not as a characteristic of a personality type. The idea rigid of goal-setting and the language of right and wrong were removed.  Woodswomen guides, for example, would avoid words that connote domination, such as 'attack the trail,' summit assault,' conquer the mountain.'\" Rather, they would say things like \"'run the rapids,' 'climb the mountain,' or 'let's start hiking.'\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Giammatteo,_Hollis_1993_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Giammatteo,_Hollis_1993-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Giammatteo wrote that Mitten taught the hostess concept, meaning that one guides in areas in alignment with one's ability.

One, called Minnesota Youth Outdoors, was a program which served gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth and allies. Minnesota Youth Outdoors ran one and two day trips to various locations in Southern Minnesota, giving participants opportunities to go rock climbing, canoeing, skiing, and hiking. Trips were designed to expose LGBT youth to the outdoors and to provide them with positive interactions with adults, potentially leading to higher self-esteem, a greater affinity for nature, and hope for the future.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Callingall_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Callingall-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Wilderness Experiences for Women Offenders was another of Woodswomen's special programs.
