About 10 years later Miss Mary Currie, owner of the Hamilton Arms Hotel on the <a href=\"/wiki/Isle_of_Arran\" title=\"Isle of Arran\">Isle of Arran</a>, gave her property to be used as a Christian Centre resulting in the birth of the Arran Outdoor Centre.  In 1984 the Trust accepted the gift of Brae Lodge at Loch Tay from Mr and Mrs Barratt, which ran under the Abernethy banner as the Ardeonaig Outdoor Centre. The fourth centre to come under Abernethy was the Ardgour Outdoor Centre on the Kilmalieu Estate, across the loch from <a href=\"/wiki/Fort_William,_Scotland\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fort William, Scotland\">Fort William</a>. A few years later this centre became the home of the Abernethy Trust School of Adventure Leadership (in 1997). The last centre to be added to the Abernethy Trust  was Barcaple Outdoor Centre, in 1996. This Centre was already operating as a Christian outdoor centre, independent from the Abernethy Trust, but Barcaple approached Abernethy asking if they could merge their ministry in <a href=\"/wiki/Dumfries_and_Galloway\" title=\"Dumfries and Galloway\">Dumfries and Galloway</a> with that of Abernethy. This officially happened on 1 January 2001. Around the same time it became apparent that the Arran Centre had reached the end of its effective period of service and the property was sold off and the proceeds used to support the other centres. Abernethy also runs an additional winter base at a Chalet in the Swiss Alps, and provide ski holidays from the end of December until the beginning of March.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"About_Abernethy\">About Abernethy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Abernethy_(charity)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: About Abernethy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Abernethy caters to a wide range of people including (but not limited to): primary schools; youth groups (both Christian and non Christian); family weeks in the summer and winter; youth camps throughout the year; student expeditions; Charity and university groups.
