 The cooperation between Young Biologist Association NGO and Let's Do It! World international ecological movement has become the basis for establishment of the “Let’s do it! Armenia” movement in Armenia. In 2012, from 24 March until 25 September, the movement aimed to carry out the Pan-Armenian volunteer initiative “Armenia Without Garbage” which involved a number of activities (Pan-Armenian cleanup campaign, seminars etc.).The basis of the worldwide movement “Let's Do It! World” is the big cleanup (Let's do it! 2008) organized in Estonia in 2008, during which more than 50 000 volunteers were able to clean up Estonia from 10 000 tons of waste. All the individuals and organizations which worry about the ecological problems of Armenia and can make a contribution on a voluntary basis within the framework of the movement were welcome to take part in this campaign. They called everyone (individuals, ecological, youth and other organizations, schools, HEIs) to join the movement, coordinate and carry out clean-up and educational activities in their favorite places. Let's do it! Armenia was going to unite and carry out the biggest Pan-Armenian clean-up under the slogan “Armenia Without Garbage” on 15 September 2012. The initiative aimed to unite everybody’s strength in order to clean Armenia’s nature and historical and cultural sites from waste in a day with joint efforts. In order to raise the awareness among society, they also planned to organize educational and informational activities about waste sorting and recycling during the campaign. Let's do it! 2008
