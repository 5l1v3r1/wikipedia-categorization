He traveled with them through challenges in the deep wilderness of southern Utah to give them the opportunity to build resilience, mental toughness, and adaptability. The initial course was a huge success, and students returned to BYU transformed. The BYU Survival Course (also called Youth Leadership 480) was born.\n</p><p>For the next 10 years, under the leadership of a determined group of instructors (Larry Mullins, Doug Nelson, Dave Wescott, and others), Youth Leadership 480 continued to take BYU students into the wilderness of Southern Utah to give them the chance to learn primitive skills and meet the challenges of the wilderness. When Larry Mullins was injured in 1973, Doug Nelson took over management of the program. Under Doug\u2019s leadership the program flourished and grew. Doug streamlined and built the program in the university context, then in 1977 took it out from under the umbrella of BYU and incorporated it as an independent business in the small town of <a href=\"/wiki/Boulder,_Utah\" title=\"Boulder, Utah\">Boulder, Utah</a>.\n</p><p>Doug continued to run BOSS until 1985, when his friend (and another of Larry\u2019s instructors) David Wescott took the reigns as owner. Dave and his wife Paula grew the program to include teaching the traditional skills of the <a href=\"/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans\" title=\"Ancestral Puebloans\">Ancestral Puebloans</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fremont_culture\" title=\"Fremont culture\">Fremont culture</a>, adding more depth and a strong skills-focus to the program. He hired instructors who appreciated the history and legacy of indigenous people and who could teach the skills of so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d cultures to modern outdoor enthusiasts. In the late 80s, BOSS began expanding beyond Utah, offering courses in <a href=\"/wiki/Mexico\" title=\"Mexico\">Mexico</a>. In 1988, David and other BOSS staff founded the Rabbitstick gathering in Idaho.\n</p><p>By 1990, in addition to its world-famous Field courses, BOSS was offering Skills courses intensively focusing on the practice of traditional skills. With topics ranging from <a href=\"/wiki/Ethnobotany\" title=\"Ethnobotany\">ethnobotany</a> to primitive pottery to <a href=\"/wiki/Stone_tool\" title=\"Stone tool\">stone tools</a>, students had the opportunity to explore the world of these skills and the connection to human history they provide in greater depth, without the challenge of extreme hiking. In the 90s, BOSS also started running courses in Canada with <a href=\"/wiki/Mors_Kochanski\" title=\"Mors Kochanski\">Mors Kochanski</a>.\n</p><p>In 1994, BOSS alumnus and past staff member <a href=\"/wiki/Josh_Bernstein\" title=\"Josh Bernstein\">Josh Bernstein</a> returned to BOSS as Marketing and Administrative Director, opening a new office in <a href=\"/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado\" title=\"Boulder, Colorado\">Boulder, Colorado</a>. Josh restructured the BOSS curriculum to include an even greater emphasis on traditional cultures, and eventually took over as owner in 1997. \n</p><p>In 2001, BOSS\u2019s Field Office in <a href=\"/wiki/Boulder,_Utah\" title=\"Boulder, Utah\">Boulder, Utah</a> moved from a 1/4 acre parcel of land to 41 acres on Highway 12. Jenny Stein joined BOSS as Customer Service manager, working from the Colorado office. In 2004, Jeff Sanders took over as Program Director. Under Jeff\u2019s leadership, many systems were put in place that ensured smooth field operations, staff development, and consistent delivery of the BOSS curriculum. Under Jenny and Jeff\u2019s supervision, the number of students, courses and staff continued to grow.\n</p><p>In late 2010, Steve Dessinger, Laurel Holding and Bryan Puskar - all long-time instructors of the school - were promoted to Director positions, and in 2014, Josh Bernstein passed the torch of ownership to Steve Dessinger.\n</p><p>In 2015, with the financial support of dedicated BOSS alumni, BOSS Instructor (now Board Member) Jessica Ewing and Laurel Holding established the first-ever BOSS Scholarship fund. Since then BOSS has been awarding grants to students demonstrating financial need and strong merit.\n</p><p>After running the school for four years, Steve decided, with the support of other long-time BOSS staff, to transition the school to a <a href=\"/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization\" title=\"501(c)(3) organization\">501(c)(3) organization</a>. The nonprofit organization hit the ground running, with a board of directors initially made up of BOSS staff members Perry Tancredi, Jessica Ewing, Michael Denisoff, Charlie Detar, and Steve Dessinger. The board named Eli Loomis as BOSS\u2019s first executive director. <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2018, BOSS celebrated its 50th year of teaching tough wilderness programs and offering transformative experiences to students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philosophy\">Philosophy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Boulder_Outdoor_Survival_School&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Philosophy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The BOSS philosophy includes teaching skills in context, using simple, durable technology, and building mental toughness and resilience through powerful experiences in the wilderness.
