 MAA Foundation (Monayr Asha Aid Foundation) is a small non-governmental organization, dedicated to promoting education in developing countries.  MAA is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and currently runs projects in Bangladesh and in Uganda.  MAA was founded in 2006 with the goal of giving underprivileged children the possibility of a solid education which will provide them with a future of choices and opportunities. Child labour is a reality in many poor countries where families are dependent on their childrenâ€™s labour to survive. MAA wants to change this dynamic and create the foundation of a sustainable socioeconomic development within small, poor communities, by giving young people a chance to improve their future lives and that of their community.  MAA was created out of the idea of using simple, personal resources and contacts for aid.  To raise funds, MAA works primarily with local artists in order to support local communities wherever possible. Fundraisers have featured musicians such as Gurpreet Chana, Devika Mathur, TC Raas Band,  or jazz saxophonist Sundar Viswanathan, who opened the 2006 MAA fundraiser Lula World.  At the moment MAA runs projects in Bangladesh and in Uganda. In Bangladesh, MAA provides scholarships for poor children in the slums of Chittagong, Bangladesh.  Moreover, MAA is involved in the development of these communities, for instance through a project providing sustainable light sources, which give the school children the possibility to read in the evenings, rather than having to use kerosene candles which pollute the air.  In Uganda, MAA works together with Buwagga Senior Secondary School in Kasangati, Uganda. MAA supports Buwagga School by raising money to address the most urgent needs of the school, including crucial renovations and classroom supplies.
