The Le Ch√©ile Schools Trust is a charitable trust which manages around 60 schools in Ireland on behalf of fourteen Roman Catholic religious congregations.  The formation of the trust was agreed in 2004 , and fully enacted over the following years, with the body established as a company limited by guarantee in 2008. Its mission is to maintain and promote the Catholic ethos of these schools, and develop new schools where the need arises.  Originally set up by twelve Roman Catholic religious congregations, fourteen congregations are involved as of 2018, with their schools entrusted to Le Cheile.  59 voluntary and 7 community schools are managed by the trust.  In 2013 the Ursuline College joined the trust.  In 2009 the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny joined Le Cheile. In September 2014, in Tyrellstown, Le Cheile opened the first Catholic secondary school in 30 years in Ireland.  The Trust's administration office is based in the Jesuit complex at Milltown Park, Dublin, and the trust produces a newsletter called Le Cheile Update.
