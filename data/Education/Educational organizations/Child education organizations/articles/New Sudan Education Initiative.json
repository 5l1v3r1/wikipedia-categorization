It was founded in January 2006 by Atem Deng, a former Sudanese refugee, and Robert Lair, a social entrepreneur and educator. The organization was created after a <a href=\"/wiki/Comprehensive_Peace_Agreement\" title=\"Comprehensive Peace Agreement\">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> was signed in 2005, bringing the conflict in southern Sudan to an official close. The CPA created a critical opportunity for development to take place in this region.  In 2004, Deng and Lair asked <a href=\"/wiki/Sudanese_people\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sudanese people\">Sudanese</a> they met at refugee camps throughout <a href=\"/wiki/East_Africa\" title=\"East Africa\">East Africa</a> what was most needed in their homeland. \"Education\" was the resounding answer they received. South Sudan currently suffers from some of the worst education access rates in the world. Female illiteracy hovers above 93%, and only 5% of young people graduate from high school. It was from these discussions with <a href=\"/wiki/Sudanese_refugees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sudanese refugees\">Sudanese refugees</a> that they developed NESEI. The organization opened its first school in May 2008, near the town of <a href=\"/wiki/Yei,_South_Sudan\" title=\"Yei, South Sudan\">Yei</a>, and it currently plans to build 20 schools throughout South Sudan.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" style=\"display:none\" /><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2>Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#History_and_present_activities\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">History and present activities</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Future_plans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Future plans</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Philosophical_guidelines\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Philosophical guidelines</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_and_present_activities\">History and present activities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_Sudan_Education_Initiative&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: History and present activities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>NESEI was first conceived in January 2004, on a plane ride from East Africa to Vermont, when Robert Lair, a <a href=\"/wiki/Teacher\" title=\"Teacher\">faculty member</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Saint_Michael%27s_College\" title=\"Saint Michael&#39;s College\">Saint Michael's College</a>, and Atem Deng, a former Sudanese refugee and student at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Vermont\" title=\"University of Vermont\">University of Vermont</a>, decided that they needed to make an impact in Southern Sudan, after witnessing the poor living conditions and lack of education opportunities affecting Sudanese in refugee camps across East Africa. They formulated a plan to work with the large <a href=\"/wiki/Sudan\" title=\"Sudan\">Sudanese</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Diaspora\" title=\"Diaspora\">diaspora</a> population in the Burlington, VT area and throughout the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> to bring diaspora-initiated education opportunities to Sudan. Together, they founded an organization, named the New Sudan Education Initiative (NESEI), through which they planned to provide an education for young people throughout Southern Sudan who lacked education opportunities, including former child <a href=\"/wiki/Soldiers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Soldiers\">soldiers</a>, young women, <a href=\"/wiki/Internally_Displaced_Person\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Internally Displaced Person\">Internally Displaced Persons</a> (IDPs), and other groups who had been most adversely affected in the decades-long <a href=\"/wiki/War\" title=\"War\">war</a> there.\n</p><p>Over the next few years, their organization evolved into a plan to provide secondary education to 20,000 Southern Sudanese children and to build 20 schools throughout the region. Their first school, The New Sudan School of Health Sciences, opened on May 19, 2008, with an initial class of 75 young women.\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>NESEI has evolved into an organization that has as its priority the incorporation of sustainable economic and environmental practices at its school campus. To achieve this goal, they have instituted <a href=\"/wiki/Social_business\" title=\"Social business\">social business</a> practices that include agriculturally based income generating projects that provide food to the campus and broader community. Additionally, the school plans to replace the <a href=\"/wiki/Electric_generator\" title=\"Electric generator\">generators</a> which currently power the school with <a href=\"/wiki/Solar_panels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Solar panels\">solar panels</a>, increasing <a href=\"/wiki/Sustainability\" title=\"Sustainability\">environmental</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Economic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Economic\">economic</a> sustainability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2010, NESEI was renamed <a href=\"/wiki/Africa_Education_and_Leadership_Initiative\" title=\"Africa Education and Leadership Initiative\">Africa Education and Leadership Initiative</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Future_plans\">Future plans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_Sudan_Education_Initiative&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Future plans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>NESEI's school plans to expand to over 100 students in 2009.  NESEI also plans to open an agriculture program within the next year at the same location, which will teach students agricultural practices in an 'interactive classroom' on the school farm.  As part of their studies, students will grow and learn about food at the farm, helping to support their campus and the surrounding communities.\n</p><p>NESEI plans to open schools throughout South Sudan. These schools will combine a standard high school curriculum, as well as specialized vocational courses, which will provide training to young <a href=\"/wiki/Sudan\" title=\"Sudan\">Sudanese</a> in specific occupations which are in high <a href=\"/wiki/Demand_(economics)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Demand (economics)\">demand</a> and low <a href=\"/wiki/Supply_(economics)\" title=\"Supply (economics)\">supply</a> throughout <a href=\"/wiki/South_Sudan\" title=\"South Sudan\">South Sudan</a>, including <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Sciences\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health Sciences\">Health Sciences</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Agriculture\" title=\"Agriculture\">Agriculture</a>, Computer Technology, and <a href=\"/wiki/Business\" title=\"Business\">Business</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Philosophical_guidelines\">Philosophical guidelines</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_Sudan_Education_Initiative&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Philosophical guidelines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although NESEI is currently a traditional non-profit organization, and receives most of its funding from private <a href=\"/wiki/Donation\" title=\"Donation\">donors</a>, it operates under the belief that a <a href=\"/wiki/Sustainable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sustainable\">sustainable</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Business_model\" title=\"Business model\">business model</a> is one which will be most able to create a lasting and scalable impact.

It plans to become sustainable through charging a small tuition to its more affluent students, and by utilizing income-generating projects in its schools.  The projects will include activities in each school, with examples being small agricultural plots and <a href=\"/wiki/Animal_husbandry\" title=\"Animal husbandry\">animal husbandry</a>.  This will provide food for the school, teach students valuable skills, and supply the local community with reasonably priced and fresh products.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a
