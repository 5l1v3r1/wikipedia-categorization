The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is the law used as the primary statute governing the federal government's role in education. \n</p><p>The federal government's role in this area was earlier defined under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The ESEA stated that its purpose was to strengthen and improve educational quality and educational opportunities in the nation's elementary and secondary schools.

This is ensured through the use of academic assessments, teacher preparation and training, rigorous curriculum and adequate and proper instructional material that will in turn aid in performance on the challenging state academic standards that all students are to meet with proficiency. This process is meant to help meet the educational needs of low-achieving children in the nation's poverty-stricken schools, and have every school performing at a national standard level. If this is achieved, then NCLB is said to have \"closed the gap\". This means that the achievement gap between high- and low-performing schools and children will be less prominent and all will be achieving at the same level and standard throughout the nation. Thus, there will be no child left behind and no schools identified as \"schools in need of improvement\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-StatementofPurpose_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-StatementofPurpose-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Details\">Details</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Details\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Requirements\">Requirements</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Requirements\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>All kindergarten through twelfth grade schools are required to demonstrate AYP in the areas of <a href=\"/wiki/Reading_(process)\" title=\"Reading (process)\">reading</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/Language_arts\" title=\"Language arts\">language arts</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mathematics\" title=\"Mathematics\">mathematics</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Graduation#United_States\" title=\"Graduation\">graduation</a> rates for high schools and districts, and at least one other academic indicator.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> \nStates are in charge of developing their own criteria for meeting AYP and must submit them for approval.

For instance, steps taken by the <a href=\"/wiki/Georgia_Department_of_Education\" title=\"Georgia Department of Education\">Georgia Department of Education</a> include new and more rigorous <a href=\"/wiki/Curriculum\" title=\"Curriculum\">curriculum</a>, the placement of \"<a href=\"/wiki/Graduation\" title=\"Graduation\">graduation</a> specialists\" in each <a href=\"/wiki/High_school\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> across the state, comprehensive high school redesign focused on rigorous and relevant education, and integrated <a href=\"/wiki/Technology\" title=\"Technology\">technology</a> throughout learning, including the Georgia Virtual School and a free online <a href=\"/wiki/SAT\" title=\"SAT\">SAT</a> prep course.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, outside critics and analysts continue to make their own suggestions on improvements for Adequate Yearly Progress.  One example of this is Robert Manwaring (a Senior Policy Analyst at Education Sector), who has many suggestions at the federal, state and local levels.  On the federal level, Manwaring believes that No Child Left Behind has been too \"hands-off\"  and that states have been avoiding hard choices such as replacing people in failing schools. He believes intervention in low-performing districts has been too slow to occur.  He believes the key is for the federal government to insist on heavier oversight from the states and to propose shorter timelines for quicker actions to be taken with consistently failing schools.  He believes the federal government should continue to invest in school improvement, but move from a \"formula-driven program\" to competitive grants, which will reward schools who make drastic improvement in low-performing schools. He believes that states should be in charge of approving the \"other major restructuring plans\" (as discussed above) for schools, in order to ensure that they are the right steps to drastically improve student performance.  Lastly, he believes Title I funding \"comparability\" requirements should be changed to make sure that all Title I schools receive an accurate amount of state and local funding.  \n</p><p>On the state level, Manwaring believes that states are reluctant to intervene in low-performing schools, and that many state departments lack the experience or capacity to facilitate school turnaround anyway.  He suggests that states should identify schools in need of improvement, and require districts to implement an intervention model, during which the state will provide support and monitor progress.  He believes they should take control of charter schools by ensuring effective charter oversight, closing low-performing charter schools and providing a fair amount of funding and facilities to successful charters.  Lastly, he states should monitor school restructuring closely and be prepared to step in when needed.  \n</p><p>On the local level, Manwaring believes that since local school districts are closest to the schools, and have the flexibility necessary to act immediately for students, they should change their policies to ensure that schools have an equal amount of resources, and to reinforce the fact that long-term failure is unacceptable. He suggests that districts push for collective bargaining agreements that allow for improving the staff at low-performing schools, including evaluation systems that allow for the timely removal of poor performing teachers.  He also believes that school leaders must be able to make radical changes quickly in order to turn around low-performing schools, with high teacher investment in such policies.  Lastly, he believes that school districts need to be prepared to establish new schools in order to close the lowest-performing schools over time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Manwaring_19-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Manwaring-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Controversy\">Controversy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Controversy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Schools across the country have restructured according to standards dictated by the federal government, rather than local needs. A principal of one such school remarked, \"Putting all of the neediest special education students in a few schools seems to create insoluble challenges under No Child Left Behind.\" Those determinations often come down to the performance of small numbers of students that do not reflect the progress of the whole school.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>  As of 2006, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which performs math and reading assessments of national education systems, does not include special education students as a significant portion of their assessment population.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Criticisms are being met with a series of innovations on the state level. In 2007, the top official of the <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio_Department_of_Education\" title=\"Ohio Department of Education\">Ohio Department of Education</a> diagnosed that NCLB \"paid no attention to whether students below proficient were making strides, or (those) above proficiency.\" Ohio is proposing a more subtle \"growth model\" that would allow schools to better demonstrate progress without jeopardizing past academic accomplishments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another controversial concern of NCLB is that it produces unintended consequences on other school subjects. Since AYP is based mostly on standardized state testing on the subjects of math and reading, it is believed that this may cause schools to neglect other subjects. Also, NCLB is thought to provide teachers with the motive to focus energy in the classroom towards the types of questions that students will face on proficiency-based tests as opposed to other questions and topics that should be addressed equally.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Evaluating_NCLB_26-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Evaluating_NCLB-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_State_Department_of_Education\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New York State Department of Education\">New York State Department of Education</a> is among a group of <a href=\"/wiki/State_education_agency\" title=\"State education agency\">state education agencies</a> that have voiced support for AYP.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"NCLB_effect_on_teacher_quality\">NCLB effect on teacher quality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: NCLB effect on teacher quality\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>NCLB was not set in place just to make sure students meet proficiency, but also to encourage teachers to become more qualified and agree to working in different environments depending on need. States have developed a variety of incentives to encourage this. These include tuition benefits, loan forgiveness programs, and housing assistance, to encourage people to enter the profession in general, to better their qualifications, or to work in particular school settings. NCLB required that Illinois stop the use of unqualified teachers and in place offered more training so that teachers could come back under NCLB guidelines. After this, employment of not-fully certified teachers was much less prevalent even in the schools with highest poverty and numbers of minorities, where not-fully certified teachers are most seen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Teacher_Qualifications_28-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Teacher_Qualifications-28\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Present_state_of_NCLB\">Present state of NCLB</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Present state of NCLB\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>On January 8, 2002, George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. According to Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, it has created an artificial goal of proficiency that actually encouraged states to lower their standards to make it easier for students to meet goals and bring the school to meet AYP. Duncan also believes that this kind of system narrows curriculum and mislabels schools as failing, even though they may be demonstrating academic growth in other ways other than state tests. Over the years since NCLB has been in place, 44 states have made strides in raising their standards but are now having to explain why their schools are \"failing\". To fix this, the secretary of state believes the law needs to be less prescriptive and allow school districts to create their own improvement plans unique to their needs. In 2015, the Obama administration offered states flexibility from NCLB in exchange for their own fair and flexible plans to raise standards. So far, 42 states have shown interest in this system and are currently working with the Department of Education. Congress's efforts to reauthorize NCLB<sup id=\"cite_ref-After10Years_29-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-After10Years-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> ultimately led in 2015 to the <a href=\"/wiki/Every_Student_Succeeds_Act\" title=\"Every Student Succeeds Act\">Every Student Succeeds Act</a>, which replaced it, modifying but not replacing provisions related to standardized testing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Education in the United States\">Education in the United States</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adequate_Yearly_Progress&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">National Council on Measurement in Education <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA\">http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA\">Archived</a> 2017-07-22 at the <a href=\"/wiki/Wayback_Machine\" title=\"Wayback Machine\">Wayback Machine</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">New York State Department of Education.
