  A think-tank with a focus on higher education, Centre for Education Policy of India was started to facilitate a platform for discussion / debate among various stakeholders in the sector, be it educationalists, experts, students, teachers as well as those in educational governance amongst others. The ultimate aim is to influence policy with regard to education. The centre is governed by an advisory group of experts in the field of higher education, who together with other experts would enrich the discourse on educational reforms by sharing considered opinions, participating in consultations, bringing out White papers and influencing public opinion. In addition, the Centre would initiate surveys/studies to document the ills of the present system. The Centre is promoted by Kanohar Lal Trust Society (KLTS) Kanohar Lal Trust Society is a non-profit organization established in 1968 with the primary objective of furthering the access of education to girls and women in Meerut and Village Sonda in the district of Ghaziabad. Currently, there are over 7500 students studying at the various institutions founded and run by the Trust, while several million others, having received their education are serving in a variety of roles. KLTS has floated the Centre for Education Policy of India with its registered office in Green Park, New Delhi.
