Focus on Algebra was the widely cited 812-page-long algebra textbook which contained significant content outside the traditional field of mathematics. The real-life context, intended to make mathematics more relevant, included chili recipes, ancient myths, and photographs of famous people. Although it was a widely used textbook, it made headlines when it was dubbed "rainforest algebra" by  critics.  Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat from West Virginia, joined critics of reform mathematics on the floor of the senate by dubbing Addison-Wesley Secondary Math: An Integrated Approach: Focus on Algebra the "Texas rainforest algebra book,".

Each Superlesson began with an opening page with discussion questions relating to the theme. Critics of the programs cited these questions as evidence of the lack of math in the books. Examples of questions cited: Exercises within lessons that related to the theme were also criticized. One example:
