A particular priority for Young was implementing the Common Schools Act in <a href=\"/wiki/Gloucester_County,_New_Brunswick\" title=\"Gloucester County, New Brunswick\">Gloucester County</a>.  Gloucester County, which included Young's home town of <a href=\"/wiki/Caraquet,_New_Brunswick\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Caraquet, New Brunswick\">Caraquet</a>, had mainly <a href=\"/wiki/Acadians\" title=\"Acadians\">Acadians</a> (descendants of French colonists) and was strongly Roman Catholic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cyr_(2000)_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cyr_(2000)-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Young faced deeply entrenched opposition to the act in Gloucester. In 1873, Gloucester magistrates refused to enforce the provisions of the act. Young responded by having them replaced. At the 1874 elections, although only 5 of the 41 members elected to the Legislative Assembly were not supporters of the Common Schools Act, both of the members elected in Gloucester were in the opposition.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Acheson_(2000)_5-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Acheson_(2000)-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Gloucester elected <a href=\"/wiki/Th%C3%A9otime_Blanchard\" title=\"Th\u00e9otime Blanchard\">Th\u00e9otime Blanchard</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Kennedy_Francis_Burns\" title=\"Kennedy Francis Burns\">Kennedy Francis Burns</a>, both Catholics who were firm opponents of the act.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cyr_(2000)_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cyr_(2000)-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The town of Caraquet was opposed to the Common Schools Act and most of its residents had for some time refused to pay the schools tax in protest. In 1874 a meeting was held by the townspeople of Caraquet at which public officials were appointed. Caraquet's small Protestant minority questioned the legality of the appointments, and on January 4, 1875 Young held his own, secret, meeting at which he appointed Protestants to the same positions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cyr_(2000)_13-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cyr_(2000)-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On January 14, 1875, a public meeting was convened with the aim of imposing the school tax on Caraquet. The meeting ended in a scuffle.  On January 15, a group of Caraquet Acadians held a public protest against further attempts to apply the act. During the protest, drunken demonstrators caused property damage to several premises including a store owned by Young. The demonstrators threatened Young's wife and employees.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cyr_(2000)_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cyr_(2000)-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On January 25, ten police constables bearing arrest warrants arrived in Caraquet to identity and arrest the demonstrators who had damaged Young's store.

One Acadian (Louis Mailloux) and one militiaman (John Gifford) were shot and killed during the exchange. Nine Acadians were tried as accessories to the death of Gifford but were acquitted. Public sentiment in Gloucester held Young responsible for both deaths.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cyr_(2000)_13-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cyr_(2000)-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Amendment\">Amendment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Common_Schools_Act_of_1871&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Amendment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Caraquet deaths brought a realisation to both sides of the school debate that compromise was required on the issue.
