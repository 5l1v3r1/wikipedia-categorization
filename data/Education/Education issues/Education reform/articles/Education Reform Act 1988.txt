The Education Reform Act 1988 is widely regarded as the most important single piece of education legislation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the 'Butler' Education Act 1944.    The main provisions of the Education Reform Act are as follows: The Act uses a common technique in UK legislation in that it makes it illegal to offer or advertise any qualification that appears to be, or might be mistaken for a UK degree. This restriction is then removed in respect of qualifications from bodies on a list maintained by Statutory Instrument. The act required "broadly Christian" acts of worship in schools. The National Muslim Education Council objected that the wording to be changed to "the worship of the one supreme God".  This requirement was built upon in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
