Hazing in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces refers to hazing and bullying carried out within the military, often, to conscripts and junior members. A similar example is that of Russia's Dedovshchina. It was enforced mainly under the pretext of establishing military discipline, despite evidence to the contrary. Hazing resulted in cases of fragging and suicide, which are referred to as non-combat casualties.
