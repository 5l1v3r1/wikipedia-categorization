Education was not a legislative priority, after <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_Church_Act_1869\" title=\"Irish Church Act 1869\">Irish Disestablishment</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Landlord_and_Tenant_(Ireland)_Act_1870\" title=\"Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870\">First Irish Land Act</a>.

This was done by comparing the results of a census of existing school places with the number of children of school age recorded in the <a href=\"/wiki/Census\" title=\"Census\">Census</a>. If there was a shortfall, a <a href=\"/wiki/School_boards_in_England_and_Wales\" title=\"School boards in England and Wales\">school board</a> for the district would be created.\n</p><p>These Boards were to provide elementary education for children aged 5\u201313 (inclusive).\n</p><p>Board Members were elected by the ratepayers under a system of <a href=\"/wiki/Cumulative_voting\" title=\"Cumulative voting\">cumulative voting</a>. (The number of Board Members was determined by the size of the population of the district). Each voter could choose three (or more) Board Members from a list of candidates, and those with the highest number of votes were chosen for the existing number of seats available. A voter could cast all their votes for one person. This was known as 'plumping' and ensured that religious (and, later, political) minorities could ensure some representation on the Board. The franchise was different from national elections since female householders could vote and stand for office.\n</p><p>The Boards financed themselves by a precept (a requisition) added to either the local <a href=\"/wiki/Poor_rate\" title=\"Poor rate\">poor rate</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Rates_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Rates in the United Kingdom\">municipal rate</a>. They were also eligible to apply for capital funding in the form of a government loan.\n</p><p>The Boards could make grants to existing Church Schools (this had been happening since the 1830s) and erect their own board schools or <a href=\"/wiki/Elementary_schools\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elementary schools\">elementary schools</a>.\n</p><p>Section 74 of the Act empowered boards to, if they deemed it necessary, create a <a href=\"/wiki/By-law\" title=\"By-law\">by-law</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Table_(parliamentary_procedure)\" title=\"Table (parliamentary procedure)\">table</a> it before <a href=\"/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Parliament of the United Kingdom\">Parliament</a>, to make attendance compulsory (unless\nthere was an excuse, for example, sickness, or living more than three miles from a school, or unless they had been certified as reaching a certain standard of education \u2013 <i>see below</i>). In 1873, 40% of the population lived in compulsory attendance districts.\n</p><p>All schools would be inspected, making use of the existing regime. The individual\nschools continued to be eligible for an annual government grant calculated on the basis of the\ninspection ('payment by results').<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contentious_provisions\">Contentious provisions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Elementary_Education_Act_1870&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Contentious provisions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Two provisions of the Act became, for religious reasons, matters of contention within the governing Liberal Party.\n</p><p>Firstly, nonconformists objected to their children being taught Anglican doctrine. As a compromise, <a href=\"/wiki/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple\" title=\"William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple\">Cowper-Temple</a> (pronounced \"Cooper-Temple\"), a Liberal MP, proposed that religious teaching in the new state schools be non-denominational, ie. restricted in practice to learning the Bible and a few hymns. The Cabinet accepted the Cowper-Temple amendment on 14 June 1870 and Gladstone proposed it to the House of Commons two days later. It became the famous Cowper-Temple clause (Section 14 of the Act). <a href=\"/wiki/Colin_Matthew\" title=\"Colin Matthew\">HCG Matthew</a>, editor of Gladstone\u2019s diaries, believes that this compromise hurt Gladstone more deeply than any other which he had to make. However, on 30 June 1870, a stronger amendment by <a href=\"/wiki/Jacob_Bright\" title=\"Jacob Bright\">Jacob Bright</a> (younger brother of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Bright\" title=\"John Bright\">John Bright</a>), insisting that religious teaching neither be for nor against any denomination, was defeated by 251 votes to 130. The supporters of the amendment were all Liberals, and the government won only with Conservative support.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Section 7 also gave parents the right to withdraw their children from any religious instruction provided in board schools, and to withdraw their children at any time to attend any other religious instruction of their choice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Secondly, parents still had to pay fees for their children to attend schools. Section 25 gave school boards the power to, if they chose, pay the fees of poor children, including those attending voluntary (ie. church) schools. Although few school boards actually did so, the provision caused great anger among nonconformists, who saw this as a new source of local ratepayers\u2019 money being spent on Church of England schools. A large conference was held at Manchester in 1872 to lead resistance to the section, and one of the campaigners was the Birmingham politician Joseph Chamberlain, who emerged as a national figure for the first time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The resulting splits (some education campaigners, including Chamberlain, stood for Parliament as independent candidates) helped to cost the Liberals the <a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1874\" title=\"United Kingdom general election, 1874\">1874 election</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Effects_of_the_Act\">Effects of the Act</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Elementary_Education_Act_1870&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Effects of the Act\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Between 1870 and 1880, 3,000\u20134,000 schools were started or taken over by school boards. Rural boards, run by parishes, had only one or two schools to manage, but industrial town and city boards had many. Rural boards favoured economy and the release of children for agricultural labour. Town boards tended to be more rigorous in their provisions, and by 1890 some had special facilities for gymnastics, art and crafts, and domestic science.\n</p><p>There were ongoing political clashes between the vested interests of Church, private schools and the National Education League followers. In some districts the creation of boards was delayed by local vote. In others, church leaders managed to be voted onto boards and restrict the building of board schools, or divert the school rate funds into church schools.\n</p><p>The Act established the foundations of English elementary education, although it was not taken up in all areas and would be more firmly enforced through later reforms. The state (<a href=\"/wiki/Gladstonian_Liberalism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gladstonian Liberalism\">Gladstonian Liberalism</a>) became increasingly involved and further acts in 1876 (\"the Sandon Act\", which gave parents a legal obligation to ensure that their children were educated) and 1880 (\"the Mundella Act\") made attendance compulsory for children until they were 10 years old, with various exemptions.\n</p><p>Many factory owners feared the removal of children as a source of cheap labour. However, with the simple mathematics and English they were acquiring, factory owners now had workers who could read and make measurements.\n</p><p>Following continued campaigning by the National Education League, following the <a href=\"/wiki/Elementary_Education_Act_1880\" title=\"Elementary Education Act 1880\">Elementary Education Act 1880</a>, attendance to age 10 became compulsory everywhere in England and Wales. In 1891, elementary schooling became free in both board and voluntary (church) schools.\n</p><p>In Wales, this act is widely believed to be one of the most damaging pieces of legislation in the social history of the Welsh language, as children in Wales who very often knew no English were taught in English only.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commercial_consequences\">Commercial consequences</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Elementary_Education_Act_1870&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Commercial consequences\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As a direct response to this Education Act, the founding father of British popular journalism, <a href=\"/wiki/George_Newnes\" title=\"George Newnes\">George Newnes</a>, began his career in publishing in 1881 when he founded <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tit-Bits\" title=\"Tit-Bits\">Tit-Bits</a></i>.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
