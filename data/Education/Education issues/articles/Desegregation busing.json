While the <i>Swann</i> decision addressed <i>de jure</i> segregation in the South, it failed to address <i>de facto</i> segregation which persisted elsewhere in the country.

A few of these plans are still in use today.

Although the <i>Brown</i> decision affirmed principles of equality and justice, it did not specify how its ruling would promote equality in education. <a href=\"/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall\" title=\"Thurgood Marshall\">Thurgood Marshall</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/NAACP\" title=\"NAACP\">NAACP</a> wanted a speedy process for desegregating the school districts, but the Court waited until the following year to make its recommendations. Reasons for delaying had to do with the changes in the Court and with Chief Justice <a href=\"/wiki/Earl_Warren\" title=\"Earl Warren\">Earl Warren</a> steering a careful course given the expected opposition from Southern states.  In May 1955, the Court ruled in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Brown_II\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brown II\">Brown&#160; II</a></i> that the school districts desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\". Public school administrators had to begin the process of desegregating the schools through the development of policies that would promote racial mixing.  A backlash of resistance and violence ensued.  Even members of Congress refused to abide by the decision.  In 1956 over a hundred congressmen signed the <a href=\"/wiki/Southern_Manifesto\" title=\"Southern Manifesto\">Southern Manifesto</a>, promising to use all legal means to undermine and reverse the Court's ruling.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The momentum continued with two additional Supreme Court decisions aimed at implementation.  In 1968, the Warren Court in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Green_v._County_School_Board_of_New_Kent_County\" title=\"Green v. County School Board of New Kent County\">Green v. County School Board of New Kent County</a></i>, rejected a freedom of choice plan.  The Court ordered the county to desegregate immediately and eliminate racial discrimination \"root and branch\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-patterson_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-patterson-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Then in 1971, the <a href=\"/wiki/Burger_Court\" title=\"Burger Court\">Burger Court</a> in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Swann_v._Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Board_of_Education\" title=\"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education\">Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</a></i> ruled that the school district must achieve racial balance even if it meant redrawing school boundaries and the use of busing as a legal tool.  The impact of <i>Green</i> and <i>Swann</i> served to end all remnants of <i>de jure</i> segregation in the South. However, the consequence of the <i>Swann</i> decision ushered in new forms of resistance in subsequent decades.  The decision failed to address <i>de facto</i> segregation.\n</p><p>Consequently, despite being found \"inherently unequal\" in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, by the late 1960s public schools remained <i>de facto</i> segregated in many cities because of demographic patterns, school district lines being intentionally drawn to segregate the schools racially, and, in some cases, due to conscious efforts to send black children to inferior schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Thus, for example, by 1969, more than nine of every ten black students in <a href=\"/wiki/Nashville\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nashville\">Nashville</a> still attended all-black schools.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Evidence of such de facto segregation motivated early proponents of plans to engage in conscious \"integration\" of public schools, by busing schoolchildren to schools other than their neighborhood schools, with an objective to equalize racial imbalances. Proponents of such plans argued that with the schools integrated, minority students would have equal access to equipment, facilities, and resources that the cities' white students had, thus giving all students in the city equal educational opportunities.\n</p><p>A federal court found that in <a href=\"/wiki/Boston\" title=\"Boston\">Boston</a>, schools were constructed and school district lines drawn intentionally to segregate the schools racially. In the early 1970s, a series of court decisions found that the racially imbalanced schools trampled the rights of minority students. As a remedy, courts ordered the <a href=\"/wiki/Racial_integration\" title=\"Racial integration\">racial integration</a> of school districts within individual cities, sometimes requiring the racial composition of each individual school in the district to reflect the composition of the district as a whole. This was generally achieved by transporting children by <a href=\"/wiki/School_bus\" title=\"School bus\">school bus</a> to a school in a different area of the district.\n</p><p>The judge who instituted the Detroit busing plan said that busing \"is a considerably safer, more reliable, healthful and efficient means of getting children to school than either carpools or walking, and this is especially true for younger children\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-&#39;70s_252_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-&#39;70s_252-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> He, therefore, included <a href=\"/wiki/Kindergarten\" title=\"Kindergarten\">kindergarten</a> children in the busing scheme: \"Transportation of kindergarten children for upwards of forty-five minutes, one-way, does not appear unreasonable, harmful, or unsafe in any way.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-&#39;70s_252_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-&#39;70s_252-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The resultant Supreme Court case, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Milliken_v._Bradley\" title=\"Milliken v. Bradley\">Milliken v. Bradley</a></i>, imposed limits on busing.  The key issue was whether a district court could order a metropolitan-wide desegregation plan between urban Detroit and suburban school districts.  Busing would play a key role in the implementation phase. The Court essentially declared that federal courts did not have the authority to order inter-district desegregation unless it could be proven that suburban school districts intentionally mandated segregation policies.  The implication of the decision was that suburban school districts in the North were not affected by the principles established by <i>Brown</i>. <i>De facto</i> segregation was allowed to persist in the North. The courts could order desegregation where segregation patterns existed, but only within municipalities, not suburban areas.  The lasting consequence of the <i>Milliken</i> decision is that it opened the door for whites to flee to the suburbs and not be concerned about compliance with mandatory integration policies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-patterson_2-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-patterson-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With waning public support, the courts began relaxing judicial supervision of school districts during the 1990s and 2000s, calling for voluntary efforts to achieve racial balance. In the early 1990s, the <a href=\"/wiki/Rehnquist_Court\" title=\"Rehnquist Court\">Rehnquist Court</a> ruled in three cases coming from <a href=\"/wiki/Oklahoma_City\" title=\"Oklahoma City\">Oklahoma City</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri\" title=\"Kansas City, Missouri\">Kansas City</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/DeKalb_County,_Georgia\" title=\"DeKalb County, Georgia\">DeKalb County</a> in Georgia that federal judges could ease their supervision of school districts \"once legally enforced segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-jost_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jost-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> With these decisions, the Rehnquist Court opened the door for school districts throughout the country to get away from under judicial supervision once they had achieved unitary status.  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Unitary_Status&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Unitary Status (page does not exist)\">Unitary Status</a> meant that a school district had successfully eliminated segregation in dual school systems and thus was no longer bound to court-ordered desegregation policies.\n</p><p>Then in 2002, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision in <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Belk_v._Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Board_of_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (page does not exist)\">Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</a></i> which declared that the school system had achieved desegregation status and that the method to achieve integration, like busing, was unnecessary. The refusal of the Court to hear the challenges to the lower court decision effectively overturned the earlier 1971 <i>Swann</i> ruling.\n</p><p>Finally, in 2007, the <a href=\"/wiki/Roberts_Court\" title=\"Roberts Court\">Roberts Court</a> produced a contentious 5\u20134 ruling in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Parents_Involved_in_Community_Schools_v._Seattle_School_District_No._1\" title=\"Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\">Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No.&#160;1</a></i> (PICS). The decision prohibited the use of racial classifications in student assignment plans to maintain racial balance. Whereas the Brown case ruled that racial segregation violated the Constitution, now the use of racial classifications violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. However, Justice Kennedy's concurrence did hold that \u201cavoiding racial isolation\u201d and addressing \u201cthe problem of de facto resegregation in schooling\u201d remain compelling state interests which can be addressed by narrowly tailored programs. <sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Writing for the minority, Justice Breyer said the \"ruling contradicted previous decisions upholding race-conscious pupil assignments and would hamper local school boards' efforts to prevent 'resegregation' in individual schools\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Civil_rights_movement\">Civil rights movement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Desegregation_busing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Civil rights movement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The struggle to desegregate the schools received impetus from the <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil Rights Movement\">Civil Rights Movement</a>, whose goal was to dismantle legal segregation in all public places.

In fact, the city was a leader of school desegregation in the South, even housing a few small schools that were minimally integrated before the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision in 1954. Despite this initial breakthrough, however, full desegregation of the schools was a far cry from reality in Nashville in the mid-1950s, and thus 22 plaintiffs, including black student Robert Kelley, filed suit against the Nashville Board of Education in 1955.\n</p><p>The result of that lawsuit was what came to be known as the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=%22Nashville_Plan%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"&quot;Nashville Plan&quot; (page does not exist)\">\"Nashville Plan\"</a>, an attempt to integrate the public schools of Nashville (and later all of <a href=\"/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee\" title=\"Davidson County, Tennessee\">Davidson County</a> when the district was consolidated in 1963). The plan, beginning in 1957, involved the gradual integration of schools by working up through the grades each year starting in the fall of 1957 with first graders. Very few black children who had been zoned for white schools showed up at their assigned campus on the first day of school, and those who did met with angry mobs outside several city elementary schools. No white children assigned to black schools showed up to their assigned campuses.\n</p><p>After a decade of this gradual integration strategy, it became evident that the schools still lacked full integration. Many argued that <a href=\"/wiki/Housing_Segregation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Housing Segregation\">Housing Segregation</a> was the true culprit in the matter. In 1970 the <i>Kelley</i> case was reintroduced to the courts. Ruling on the case was Judge <a href=\"/wiki/Leland_Clure_Morton\" title=\"Leland Clure Morton\">Leland Clure Morton</a>, who, after seeking advice from consultants from the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health,_Education,_and_Welfare\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\">United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare</a>, decided the following year that to correct the problem, forced busing of the children was to be mandated, among the many parts to a new plan that was finally decided on.

Many whites did not want their children to share schools with black children, arguing that it would decrease the quality of their education. While a triumph for some, many blacks believed that the new plan would enforce the closure of neighborhood schools such as Pearl High School, which brought the community together. Parents from both sides did not like the plan because they had no control over where their children were going to be sent to school, a problem that many other cities had during the 1970s when busing was mandated across the country. Despite the judge's decision and the subsequent implementation of the new busing plan, the city stood divided.\n</p><p>As in many other cities across the country at this time, many white citizens took action against the desegregation laws. Organized protests against the busing plan began before the order was even official, led by future mayoral candidate Casey Jenkins. While some protested, many other white parents began pulling their children out of the public schools and enrolling them in the numerous private schools that began to spring up almost overnight in Nashville in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these schools continued to be segregated through the 1970s. Other white parents moved outside of the city limits and eventually outside the Davidson County line so as not to be part of the Metropolitan District and thus not part of the busing plan.\n</p><p>In 1979 and 1980, the <i>Kelley</i> case was again brought back to the courts because of the busing plan's failure to fully integrate the <a href=\"/wiki/Metropolitan_Nashville_Public_Schools\" title=\"Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools\">Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools</a> (MNPS). The plan was reexamined and reconfigured to include some concessions made by the school board and the Kelley plaintiffs and in 1983 the new plan, which still included busing, was introduced. However, problems with \"<a href=\"/wiki/White_flight\" title=\"White flight\">white flight</a>\" and private schools continued to segregate MNPS to a certain degree, a problem that has never fully been solved.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pasadena.2C_California\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pasadena,_California\">Pasadena, California</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Desegregation_busing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Pasadena, California\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 1970 a <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_district_court\" title=\"United States district court\">federal court</a> ordered the desegregation of the public schools in <a href=\"/wiki/Pasadena,_California\" title=\"Pasadena, California\">Pasadena, California</a>.

As a result, by 2004 Pasadena became home to 63 private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children in the city, and the proportion of white students in the public schools had fallen to 16 percent.

The county, a large suburban school district east of <a href=\"/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\" title=\"Washington, D.C.\">Washington, D.C.</a>, was over 80 percent white in population and in the public schools. In some county communities close to Washington, there was a higher concentration of black residents than in more outlying areas. Through a series of desegregation orders after the <i>Brown</i> decision, the county had a neighborhood-based system of school boundaries. However, the <a href=\"/wiki/NAACP\" title=\"NAACP\">NAACP</a> argued that housing patterns in the county still reflected the vestiges of segregation. Against the will of the Board of Education of Prince George's County, the federal court ordered that a school busing plan be set in place. A 1974 <a href=\"/wiki/Gallup_poll\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gallup poll\">Gallup poll</a> showed that 75 percent of county residents were against forced busing and that only 32 percent of blacks supported it.\n</p><p>The transition was very traumatic as the court ordered that the plan be administered with \"all due haste\". This happened during the middle of the school term, and students even in their senior year in high school were transferred to different schools to achieve racial balance. Many high school sports teams' seasons and other typical school activities were disrupted. Life in general for families in the county was disrupted by things such as the changes in daily times to get children ready and receive them after school, transportation logistics for extracurricular activities, and parental participation activities such as volunteer work in the schools and <a href=\"/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association\" title=\"Parent-Teacher Association\">PTA</a> meetings.\n</p><p>The federal case and the school busing order was officially ended in 2001, as the \"remaining vestiges of segregation\" had been erased to the court's satisfaction. Neighborhood-based school boundaries were restored. The Prince George's County Public Schools was ordered to pay the <a href=\"/wiki/NAACP\" title=\"NAACP\">NAACP</a> more than $2 million in closing attorney fees and is estimated to have paid the NAACP over $20 million over the course of the case.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Richmond.2C_Virginia\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Richmond,_Virginia\">Richmond, Virginia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Desegregation_busing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Richmond, Virginia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In April 1971, in the case <i>Bradley v.

Merhige,&#160;Jr.</a>, ordered an extensive citywide busing program in <a href=\"/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia\" title=\"Richmond, Virginia\">Richmond</a>, Virginia. When the massive busing program began in the fall of 1971, parents of all races complained about the long rides, hardships with transportation for extracurricular activities, and the separation of siblings when elementary schools at opposite sides of the city were \"paired\", (i.e., splitting lower and upper elementary grades into separate schools). The result was further white flight to private schools and to suburbs in the neighboring counties of <a href=\"/wiki/Henrico_County,_Virginia\" title=\"Henrico County, Virginia\">Henrico</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Chesterfield_County,_Virginia\" title=\"Chesterfield County, Virginia\">Chesterfield</a> that were predominately white. In January 1972, Merhige ruled that students in Henrico and Chesterfield counties would have to be bused into the City of Richmond in order to decrease the high percentage of black students in Richmond's schools. This order was overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 6, 1972, barring forced busing schemes that made students cross county/city boundaries. (Note: Since 1871, Virginia has had independent cities which are not politically located within counties, although some are completely surrounded geographically by a single county. This distinctive and unusual arrangement was pivotal in the Court of Appeals decision overturning Merhige's ruling). The percentage of white students in Richmond city schools declined from 45 to 21 percent between 1960 and 1975 and continued to decline over the next several decades. By 2010 white students accounted for less than 9 percent of student enrollment in Richmond.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> This so-called \"white flight\" prevented Richmond schools from ever becoming truly integrated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> A number of assignment plans were tried to address the non-racial concerns, and eventually, most elementary schools were \"unpaired\".\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Wilmington.2C_Delaware\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wilmington,_Delaware\">Wilmington, Delaware</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Desegregation_busing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Wilmington, Delaware\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware\" title=\"Wilmington, Delaware\">Wilmington</a>, Delaware, located in <a href=\"/wiki/New_Castle_County,_Delaware\" title=\"New Castle County, Delaware\">New Castle County</a>, segregated schools were required by law until 1954, when, due to <i><a href=\"/wiki/Belton_v._Gebhart\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Belton v.
