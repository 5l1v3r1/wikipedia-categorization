This film is known for its poignant expression of guilt, it portrays with great sensitivity the story of a doctor who tries to atone for a mistake that he committed as a student – a mistake that destroyed a family. Amrutham Gamaya is regarded as one of the best films of Hariharan   and one of the classic screenplay of Nair.  The film is the story of Dr. P. K. Haridas (Mohanlal). When he was a senior student in Medical college, he unknowingly killed Unnikrishnan (Vineeth), a junior student, during ragging. The incident comes back to haunt him when he meets Unnikrishnan's poor family. As an act of atonement, he helps the poor family. He also helps Vineeth's sister, Sreedevi (Parvathy), to become a doctor. The film was written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair and directed by Hariharan.  It was their following collaboration with Mohanlal and Geetha in main roles together again after Panchagni (1986). Unlike Panchagni, which was a women-oriented film, Amrutham Gamaya follows the character of Dr. Haridas played by Mohanlal. The title is derived from the lyric "mṛtyor mā amṛtaṃ gamaya" (meaning: "From death, lead me to immortality") of the Pavamana Mantra, a Hindu mantra.  The film score was composed by M. B. Sreenivasan. This film does not feature any songs.
