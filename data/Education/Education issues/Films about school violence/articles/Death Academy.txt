Death Academy (also known as School Night Massacre) is a 2005 horror film written and directed by Daniel Lehmussaari. While researching a massacre that occurred at their high school ten years ago, a group of four students manage to contact the recently released killer, who claims that he was framed by the school's current principal. Believing the man's story, the quartet bring him along when they break into the school one night to look for evidence of the principal's guilt. As the students search the building, they are picked off one by one by a hooded and masked figure who is determined to stop the truth from getting out. The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre stated that Death Academy was "cliche-ridden" and "doesn't provide much entertainment".  Independent Flicks criticized every aspect of it, and gave the film a half-star out of seven.  A grade of four out of five was awarded by Slasherpool, which said that Death Academy was suspenseful, interesting, well-directed and acted and "one of the best slashers you'll see this year".  Slasherpool would go on to release a newly edited version of the film under the title School Night Massacre, which is currently the only version of the film with English subtitles.
