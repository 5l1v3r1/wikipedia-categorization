American Yearbook is a 2004 American drama film written, produced, edited, and directed by Brian Ging. While the film itself is finished, and has been shown at various film festivals, there is currently no public release date. Will Nash (Nick Tagas) is the kid-next-door, a typical upbeat high schooler, but his dreams of being a photographer quickly fade, as he is relentlessly terrorized by school bullies Ian (Chris Peter) and Jason (Ryan Nixon). Will adores Amanda (Giovannie Pico), but her best friend Kristy (Jennifer Noble) is dating the head bully Ian. Confused and angry, Will meets a mysterious, brooding character named Chance (Jon Carlo Alvarez), both of them outsiders. Chance eventually convinces Will that they should get a gun and take the bullies out: pull a Columbine. Amanda pleads with Will to set revenge aside, but can Will stop what he and Chance have started, or are Will's emotions too strong for him to just walk away?
