The Only Way is a 2004 American film about a school shooting directed by David Zimmerman III and Levi Steven Obery. The film is loosely based on the April 20, 1999 tragedy at Columbine High School. The film was shot entirely on location in Metamora, Illinois, Washington, Illinois, Pekin, Illinois, and Peoria, Illinois with Metamora Township High School, the same high school from which the film's directors graduated, serving as the principal location.  A limited edition DVD of the film was released on June 19, 2007. The DVD contained the original version of the film (also referred to as the "school cut") and a new "re-cut" version of the film. The 2007 version is slightly different from the original version and most notably contains more violent gruesome imagery and language not suitable for the premiere of the film, which took place at Metamora Township High School. On December 29, 2008, two new DVDs were released: the School Cut Special Edition and the Re-Cut Special Edition. Both versions of the film were also made available On Demand for the first time. The School Cut is targeted at schools and other organizations for educational purposes.  A new website, The Only Way: Resources for Teachers and Parents , was launched by the filmmakers as a companion to the School Cut.
