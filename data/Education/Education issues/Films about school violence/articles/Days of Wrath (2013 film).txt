Days of Wrath (Hangul: 응징자; RR: Eungjingja; lit. "The Punisher") is a 2013 South Korean film about a man who, having been bullied as a teenager, seeks revenge against the former classmate who ruined his life.    Chang-sik bullied Joon-seok relentlessly during high school. And his girlfriend was raped by Chang-sik in front of him and committed suicide on the next day. Fifteen years later, the two encounter each other again. Chang-sik is working for a conglomerate, and preparing for his wedding. On the other hand, because of his traumatic experience, Joon-seok has a difficult time getting a decent job even though he graduated from a prestigious university; he works part-time as a valet park attendant and frequents a convenience store nearby. Unable to forget, Joon-seok prepares for revenge to make Chang-sik pay. In July 2014, the film was selected to be shown in the 2014 Fantasia International Film Festivalat Montreal, Canada.>
