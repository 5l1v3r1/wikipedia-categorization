Quotaism    is the concept of organising society by a quota system, whether by racial, gender, language or another demographic attribute. The basic premise is to have demographics represented at all levels and aspects of the civilisation according to national statistics. A quota system is often part of any Affirmative Action policies, but in those cases it is mainly used as an "target", within a single entity. Quotaism applies to the whole country and is enforced by legislation on all public and private entities. Local trade unions commonly use the term "Absolute representation" in this regard.  Quota distribution doesn’t necessarily fit the real composition of the population; It's impossible to keep to a quota system in equilibrium as the demographics are continually changing.

Quota systems have a  discriminative effect on minorities; Only elite members of the majority demographic benefits. The higher educated are artificially higher in demand due to under-subscription and can mandate higher than average salaries. The politically connected are given multiple directors’ position.  It interferes with a person’s basic human rights - freedom of choice.
