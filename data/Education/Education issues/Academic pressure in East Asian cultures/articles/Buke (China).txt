Buke (Chinese: 补课; pinyin: bǔ kè) in the high school of mainland China refers to the social phenomenon of extra study for the improvement of students’ academic performance in National Higher Education Entrance Examination (commonly known as Gaokao) in the form of extra mandatory classes organized by high schools or private tutoring provided by cram school. Generally, Buke in high schools of mainland China are of two types: Almost every year the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issues official documents which emphasize the prohibition of any forms of Buke organized by state-run schools. In Opinions Concerning the Implementation of the Compulsory Education Law to further regulate which was issued after the emendation of the Compulsory Education Law in 2006, the Ministry of Education points out that it is banned for teachers in state-run schools to encourage either intramural or extramural Buke. And Teachers’ devotion in the extramural Buke in their part-time is also strongly opposed.  Despite the prohibition of Buke by state-run schools, in mainland there is no national regulation for Buke organized by private-run schools or educational establishments, however the regulations made by some local governments at different levels did affect them. In February 2015, Wenzhou City Board of Education issued Disposal Options of Wenzhou for Primary and Secondary School Teachers in Paid Buke, for teacher’s attendance in paid Buke is officially considered an unprofessional conduct. For the first time this regulation relate to the in-service teachers in private-run primary and secondary schools, hence it is called “the toughest regulation on Buke”.  According to a clerk working in an educational establishment, the in-service teachers in Wenzhou no longer attend extramural Buke after the implementation of the disposal options.  While some parents, student and educators support buke for the opportunity to retain learning through holidays and to work out difficult problems for which there is not time during normal classes,   others oppose the practice as overly stressing academic performance and increasing stress on students.
