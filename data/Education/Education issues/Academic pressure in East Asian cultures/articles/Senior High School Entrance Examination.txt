The Senior High School Entrance Examination, or commonly known as Zhongkao (中考), is the academic examination held annually in the mainland of the People's Republic of China to distinguish junior high school graduates.

The Senior High School Entrance Examination usually make out problems by province, but few provinces transmit the power of making out problems to cities. This exam is the second examination system recovered after the Cultural Revolution. It takes place in early June every year, however in few place it takes place in late June or even early July. In 1980, the decades that just recover the exams, the Graduation Examination of Junior High School and the Senior High School Entrance Examination are the same exam. If the students failed the Senior High School Entrance Examination, then they cannot graduate from the junior high school, even if there are senior high school who want to admit them. These students will be refused by the senior high school for the reason "failure in graduation from junior high school" (初中肄业), that is what is commonly called “sending back the document” (退档).
