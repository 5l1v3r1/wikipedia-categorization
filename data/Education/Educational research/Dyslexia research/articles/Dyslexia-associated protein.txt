Variants of the KIAA0319 gene have been associated with developmental dyslexia.  Reading disability, or dyslexia, is a major social, educational, and mental health problem. In spite of average intelligence and adequate educational opportunities, 5 to 10% of school children have substantial reading deficits. Twin and family studies have shown a substantial genetic component to this disorder, with heritable variation estimated at 50 to 70%.  A mutation in a gene on chromosome 6, called the KIAA0319 gene, appears to play a key role in Specific Language Impairment.   The KIAA0319 protein is expressed on the cell membrane and may be involved in neuronal migration.  Furthermore, KIAA0319 follows a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway
