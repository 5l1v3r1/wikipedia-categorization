An Educational System for the Seventies,  sometimes abbreviated as ES'70 or ES-70, was a research effort in the United States to develop a new secondary school curriculum for the 1970s.   It was jointly produced by 19 local school districts, their corresponding state agencies, and the U. S. Office of Education. The related report was published in 1969.
