Jan H. Blits (born April 6, 1943) is an American educational researcher and professor emeritus in the University of Delaware School of Education. He is also the president of the Delaware chapter of the National Association of Scholars (NAS). He received the Prometheus Award from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education in 2009, and the Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in 2011. He is known for, along with his colleague Linda Gottfredson, helping to expose a controversial Residence Life Program at the University of Delaware in 2007. After critics described the program as "appalling" and an attempt at indoctrination, the program was quickly shut down by the University.   Blits also fought alongside Gottfredson against the University's attempts to ban them from receiving research funding from the Pioneer Fund in the early 1990s. Ultimately, they were successful in their attempts to be allowed to accept such funds.
