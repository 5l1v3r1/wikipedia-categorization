Archbishop Romero Catholic Secondary School is an alternative-style Separate high school located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, with satellite campuses in Brampton and Caledon.  The school is administered by the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board. Like other members of the district, students who attend Archbishop Romero receive teaching on religion, family life and prayer in addition to the standard curriculum found in public schools. However, students who attend this school have usually been expelled from their schools within the Dufferin-Peel Board, and are sent to Romero to find their way on the right track. Archbishop Romero C.S.S. opened in February 2005.  The school offers programs that include Dual Credit College Transition, Career Opportunities in Trades and Technology, or Machining / Electrical Pre-Trades at Sheridan, ABLE Outdoor Adventure, Catholic Leadership, Co-op Experiential Learning, Flexible Alternative Learning, PLAR, New Directions and Positive Personal Change Programs. A newly formed community Roundtable allows participating stakeholders an opportunity to work together to align resources and services directly into program and school curriculum reflecting global learning for renewed hope.   The school has no sports teams or extra-curricular clubs.
