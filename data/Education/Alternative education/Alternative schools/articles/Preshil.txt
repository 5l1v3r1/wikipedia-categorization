  Preshil, The Margaret Lyttle Memorial School, is an independent, secular, co-educational, day school located in Kew, an eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The original Arlington campus houses the Kindergarten and Primary school, while the Secondary School is located at the Blackhall Kalimna campus. Established in 1931 by Greta Lyttle (and later, Margaret Lyttle), Preshil teaches a progressive curriculum.  Preshil is Australiaâ€™s oldest progressive school.
