Reid studied the progress of this education experiment in its first year and reported to the Vancouver Board of School Trustees, \"At the core of City School is the involvement on an equal (in most instances) basis of everyone, students and teachers alike. Students have votes of equal status in matters of policy, organization, discipline and rules. This 'democracy' extends to the choice of subjects offered. If a student wants to pursue a particular interest with other students and staff, he is expected to initiate the activity himself.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>She wrote: \"The objectives of City School are:\n</p>\n<ol><li>To provide the basic subject skills based on individual aims.</li>\n<li>To encourage involvement by parents and community.</li>\n<li>To provide for the exploration of areas of interest not normally available in schools.</li>\n<li>To develop individuality in goal setting and in self-concept.</li>\n<li>To provide each individual with success.</li>\n<li>To develop social concepts in a variety of situations.</li>\n<li>To explore the community and become practically involved.</li>\n<li>To develop the ability to think.\"</li></ol>\n<p>Reid surveyed students and parents on a School Sentiment Index and in her summary, noted, \"Many students and parents felt that one of the school's greatest handicaps was the inadequacy of its buildings and equipment. The facilities were designed for children at the primary level and are, not surprisingly, unsuitable in some ways for older children.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"First_move\">First move</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=City_School_(Vancouver)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: First move\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After three years the school outgrew these facilities and moved to Vancouver's downtown core.  The Sir William Dawson elementary school was designed by Edward Evans Blackmore<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> and built in 1913 at 935 Helmcken Street.

City School occupied the main floor and shared the building with <a href=\"/wiki/Ideal_Mini_School\" title=\"Ideal Mini School\">Ideal School</a> and a class for new Canadians.\n</p><p>By the 1974-75 school year, nearly 200 students were registered in Grades 4 to 12, with one part-time and six full-time teachers.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Using_the_city_as_a_classroom\">Using the city as a classroom</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=City_School_(Vancouver)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Using the city as a classroom\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>With more appropriate facilities - classrooms, seminar rooms, kitchen, art room, darkroom - and proximity to much that was going on downtown and beyond, the school hit its stride and began to pique media interest.  Kay Alsop wrote a feature article for <i>The Province</i> newspaper in 1976.\n</p><p>\"It was something new in the way of an alternative school; geared, not to academic dropouts, but to students who found regimentation irksome and stifling. And it's become so flexible in structure that timetables, as such, would be incongruous.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Students were pictured studying rock formations with a UBC professor, looking at chicken foetuses in a genetics class, and loading the school van for a camping trip. Alsop listed many of the field trips the school had taken in British Columbia's Lower Mainland and beyond: geology road trips to Prince George and Banff, an exchange to Quebec.  Early excursions are remembered in a film made on the occasion of a City School reunion in 1996.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>These extended science trips and exchanges began a tradition that has carried on.  In ensuing decades, City School groups have taken multiple road trips with a geology focus, to B.C.'s Interior and to Dinosaur Park and Drumheller in Alberta.  Exchanges, with the support of Open House Canada (later Exchanges Canada) have taken students to Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>  Biology field studies at the <a href=\"/wiki/Bamfield_Marine_Sciences_Centre\" title=\"Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre\">Marine Sciences Centre</a> at Bamfield, B.C. have been regular events as have camping trips to various provincial parks (Alice Lake, Porpoise Bay, Golden Ears, Montague Harbour, Newcastle Island).\n</p><p>Closer to home, students took advantage of libraries, art galleries, museums, public lectures, law courts, university classes, film festivals, and myriad other resources to learn outside the walls of the school building.  This custom continues today.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Move_to_Strathcona\">Move to Strathcona</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=City_School_(Vancouver)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Move to Strathcona\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1976 the school board decided to decommission the former Dawson School and move its tenant programs out.  The entire block, which had also contained the original <a href=\"/wiki/King_George_Secondary_School\" title=\"King George Secondary School\">King George Secondary School</a>, was later redeveloped as the <a href=\"/wiki/One_Wall_Centre\" title=\"One Wall Centre\">Wall Centre</a>.\n</p><p>Just as Ideal School fought its relocation to classrooms in Lord Byng Secondary, City School parents, students and staff strongly protested their move to a 1940 parish school building in Vancouver's historic <a href=\"/wiki/Strathcona,_Vancouver\" title=\"Strathcona, Vancouver\">Strathcona</a> neighbourhood some three kilometres east of the downtown core.  During the Christmas holiday closure in December 1976, the school's belongings were transferred.\n</p><p>In January 1977, the students and staff, wearing black armbands, walked from their boarded-up building to their \"new\" leased premises in the former Sacred Heart School at 884 East Pender Street.  Minor modifications had been made to create a darkroom and kitchen, but the floor plan was essentially a corridor running the length of the building, with classrooms off both sides.\n</p><p>The forced move and the struggle that preceded it led to many students and all the teachers leaving City School at the end of that school year.  The remaining students and their families were committed to maintaining the school's philosophy and traditions through further staff changes and the prospect of another move.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Return_to_the_downtown_core\">Return to the downtown core</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=City_School_(Vancouver)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Return to the downtown core\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Declining enrolment in Vancouver's only downtown high school, coupled with a disinclination on the part of the school board to pay rent, led to City School's relocation from Strathcona to the <a href=\"/wiki/West_End,_Vancouver\" title=\"West End, Vancouver\">West End</a>.  In September 1980 it opened its fourth set of doors, in what had been the cafeteria on the ground floor of King George Secondary, at 1755 Barclay Street.\n</p><p>Though smaller than the Sacred Heart building, the physical space had a better layout, and the downtown location was much more popular with students and families.   The elementary grades were abandoned at this point, and a long period of stability ensued, with little staff change for a decade.\n</p><p>Constraints on the \"student-centred education\" model of the early 1970s came, over time, in the form of provincially mandated final exams, and demands for accountability and conformity from district administrators.  Schedules and classes became more structured, but opportunities for enrichment always trumped the formal timetable.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"An_incubator_for_the_arts\">An incubator for the arts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=City_School_(Vancouver)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: An incubator for the arts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>City School's high school program attracted a wide variety of young people seeking an alternative to the mainstream school culture.
